HEADLINE: Obama's Jobs Plan, Now Piecemeal, Is Blocked Again by Senate Republicans

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the second time in 10 days, the Senate on Thursday rejected Democratic efforts to take up a jobs bill championed by President Obama.
The vote to advance the bill was 50 to 50. Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster.
This time, the bill was narrowed to provide $35 billion to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of teachers, police officers and firefighters. To offset the cost, the bill would impose a surtax of 0.5 percent, starting in 2013, on income in excess of $1 million. 
Despite the vote Thursday, Democrats said they hoped to gain a political edge, by forcing Republicans to vote on this and other discrete parts of broader legislation proposed by Mr. Obama to create jobs and revive the economy.
Campaigning for his $447 billion jobs package this week in North Carolina and Virginia, Mr. Obama suggested that Republicans could not understand the whole thing all at once, so he said ''we're going to chop it up into some bite-sized pieces.''
The Senate last week blocked consideration of the larger bill, which included a 5.6 percent surtax on income over $1 million.
Republicans objected to the tax and said the bill would be no more successful than the economic stimulus law Mr. Obama signed in February 2009.
The vote late Thursday generally followed party lines. Two Democrats -- Senators Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas -- and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, joined Republicans in voting against immediate consideration of the bill for public employees.
Both parties seized on the smaller bill to draw contrasts in advance of the 2012 elections.
Democrats said the bill would save or create jobs for nearly 400,000 teachers and force millionaires to make a small sacrifice for the benefit of the nation.
''The massive layoffs we have had in America today are rooted in the last administration,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''It is very clear that private sector jobs have been doing fine. It is the public sector jobs where we have lost huge numbers.''
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, derided the Democrats' proposal as ''a government jobs bill.'' He said it would ''impose a permanent tax hike on about 300,000 U.S. business owners and then use the money to bail out cities and states that cannot pay their bills.''
The bill would pay for the hiring, rehiring and retention of school employees, law enforcement officers, firefighters and other emergency workers.
Public employees and labor union leaders joined Democrats, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., at a rally on Wednesday urging the Senate to pass the bill. Mr. Biden said that because of police layoffs, ''murder rates are up, robberies are up, rapes are up'' in many cities.
Democrats see an urgent need to aid state and local governments, whose revenues have not fully recovered from the recession. The Congressional Budget Office said that less than one-third of new spending under the bill would occur in the coming year, however. It foresees annual spending of roughly $11 billion in 2012 and 2013, followed by $7 billion in 2014, $5 billion in 2015 and $1 billion in 2016.
Unable to pass the full bill devised by the White House, Senate Democrats hope some of the individual pieces will prove more popular with Republicans. Other smaller bills to be taken up in turn would expand the current payroll tax cut for employees, increase spending on transportation and public works projects, and provide incentives for the hiring of unemployed veterans.
For their part, Senate Republicans pushed Thursday for a bill that would repeal a tax compliance requirement that businesses consider extremely burdensome. The provision, adopted in 2006, requires federal, state and local government agencies to deduct and withhold 3 percent of payments they make to many suppliers of goods and services. The requirement was adopted after federal auditors found that thousands of government contractors had substantial amounts of unpaid federal taxes.
Democrats supported the intent of the bill, but blocked its consideration because it would also require unspecified cuts in spending for domestic programs.
Senator Scott P. Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, said, ''We need to repeal once and for all this onerous and costly unfunded mandate.''
Republicans described their proposal as a jobs bill because, as Mr. Brown said, it would ''repeal a part of our tax code that promises to kill jobs.''
Enforcement of the requirement has been delayed several times. As part of his jobs bill, Mr. Obama proposed a further delay, to 2014. Businesses say the withholding will disrupt their cash flow and cause administrative headaches.

HEADLINE: Party Of Pollution

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last month President Obama finally unveiled a serious economic stimulus plan -- far short of what I'd like to see, but a step in the right direction. Republicans, predictably, have blocked it. But the new plan, combined with the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations, seems to have shifted the national conversation. We are, suddenly, focused on what we should have been talking about all along: jobs.
So what is the G.O.P. jobs plan? The answer, in large part, is to allow more pollution. So what you need to know is that weakening environmental regulations would do little to create jobs and would make us both poorer and sicker. 
Now it would be wrong to say that all Republicans see increased pollution as the answer to unemployment. Herman Cain says that the unemployed are responsible for their own plight -- a claim that, at Tuesday's presidential debate, was met with wild applause.
Both Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have, however, put weakened environmental protection at the core of their economic proposals, as have Senate Republicans. Mr. Perry has put out a specific number -- 1.2 million jobs -- that appears to be based on a study released by the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association, claiming favorable employment effects from removing restrictions on oil and gas extraction. The same study lies behind the claims of Senate Republicans.
But does this oil-industry-backed study actually make a serious case for weaker environmental protection as a job-creation strategy? No.
Part of the problem is that the study relies heavily on an assumed ''multiplier'' effect, in which every new job in energy leads indirectly to the creation of 2.5 jobs elsewhere. Republicans, you may recall, were scornful of claims that government aid that helps avoid layoffs of schoolteachers also indirectly helps save jobs in the private sector. But I guess the laws of economics change when it's an oil company rather than a school district doing the hiring.
Moreover, even if you take the study's claims at face value, it offers little reason to believe that dirtier air and water can solve our current employment crisis. All the big numbers in the report are projections for late this decade. The report predicts fewer than 200,000 jobs next year, and fewer than 700,000 even by 2015.
You might want to compare these numbers with a couple of other numbers: the 14 million Americans currently unemployed, and the one million to two million jobs that independent estimates suggest the Obama plan would create, not in the distant future, but in 2012.
More pollution, then, isn't the route to full employment. But is there a longer-term economic case for less environmental protection? No. Serious economic analysis actually says that we need more protection, not less.
The important thing to understand is that the case for pollution control isn't based on some kind of aesthetic distaste for industrial society. Pollution does real, measurable damage, especially to human health.
And policy makers should take that damage into account. We need more politicians like the courageous governor who supported environmental controls on a coal-fired power plant, despite warnings that the plant might be closed, because ''I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people.''
Actually, that was Mitt Romney, back in 2003 -- the same politician who now demands that we use more coal.
How big are these damages? A new study by researchers at Yale and Middlebury College brings together data from a variety of sources to put a dollar value on the environmental damage various industries inflict. The estimates are far from comprehensive, since they only consider air pollution, and they make no effort to address longer-term issues such as climate change. Even so, the results are stunning.
For it turns out that there are a number of industries inflicting environmental damage that's worth more than the sum of the wages they pay and the profits they earn -- which means, in effect, that they destroy value rather than create it. High on the list, by the way, is coal-fired electricity generation, which the Mitt Romney-that-was used to stand up to.
As the study's authors say, finding that an industry inflicts large environmental damage compared with its apparent economic return doesn't necessarily mean that the industry should be shut down. What it means, instead, is that ''the regulated levels of emissions from the industry are too high.'' That is, environmental regulations aren't strict enough.
Republicans, of course, have strong incentives to claim otherwise: the big value-destroying industries are concentrated in the energy and natural resources sector, which overwhelmingly donates to the G.O.P. But the reality is that more pollution wouldn't solve our jobs problem. All it would do is make us poorer and sicker.

HEADLINE: Romney Will Compete in Iowa, if a Bit Cautiously

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
TREYNOR, Iowa -- Mitt Romney always said he would be back.
After months of keeping Iowa at arm's length, coyly refusing to signal his intentions here, Mr. Romney returned after more than two months on Thursday, confirming what political watchers have long suspected -- that he is not ceding the state to any of his rivals.
''I'd love to win in Iowa,'' Mr. Romney said at a gathering in Sioux City. 
Mr. Romney and his aides have always maintained that he wants to compete in Iowa. But they have been tight-lipped about their strategy.
''I think it would be unfair to remove any suspense,'' said Stuart Stevens, Mr. Romney's top strategist.
In part, that may be because Mr. Romney is trying to have it both ways -- he wants to win, but he doesn't want to invest so deeply that a loss in the Iowa caucuses would prove devastating.
So, the game plan seems to be leaning toward competing aggressively -- but with fewer people and less money than four years ago, when he spent $10 million only to finish second to Mike Huckabee, who spent a sliver of that amount.
This time, Mr. Romney decided not to place Republican leaders on his payroll and give them the title of senior adviser -- the approach he used four years ago.
The campaign has only five paid workers in the state. (That number is up from August, when there were only three paid staff members.)
But there are plenty of young campaign aides, often dressed in blue ''Romney'' shirts, who turn up at party meetings and county Republican dinners. (At a barbecue for Gov. Rick Perry of Texas on a recent night here, the first person to greet guests was Phil Valenziano, a member of Mr. Romney's staff who travels across the state building the campaign organization.)
Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, also campaigned here for three days this month.
''He made a lot of friends around here last time,'' said David Oman, a Republican businessman who endorsed Mike Huckabee four years ago and is supporting Mr. Romney. ''The residual good will still exists.''
Mr. Romney's advisers also believe that the political environment has changed, even from only two months ago.
Recent polls and surveys in Iowa, albeit limited, show that Mr. Perry's decline in national polls has also taken place in the state, making it increasingly possible that evangelical and Christian conservative voters will split their vote among rivals like Mr. Perry and Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Ron Paul of Texas.
And Iowa, like the rest of the nation, is concerned about the economy, which is Mr. Romney's main message. Four years ago, he also focused on social issues to try to sway evangelicals.
Not this time. On Thursday, when Mr. Romney arrived here for an afternoon campaign event, his stop was in the basement of the Treynor State Bank, underscoring his economic focus.
He did not pander to members of his audience in Treynor, a small farming community about 20 miles from the Missouri River. He said he initially favored ethanol subsidies ''to get the industry on its feet.'' But he said the high price of corn, which is delivering record profits for many farmers during the fall harvest, was a sign that subsidies should expire.
Dr. Ward Chambers, a corn and soybean farmer here who also works at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said he appreciated the candor. ''He said some tough things today,'' Dr. Chambers said, ''No more ethanol subsidies? That's pretty strong stuff.''
Dr. Chambers, 66, said he had been impressed by Mr. Romney in the recent presidential debates. ''He's a very centrist Republican,'' he said. ''But frankly, he may have more trouble with people in his own party than with the Democrats.''
The sense of inevitability that Mr. Romney has been working to build across the country may have also seeped into Iowa. He did not mention his Republican rivals during stops on Thursday afternoon, choosing to focus on the policies of the Obama administration. He showed signs of confidence that he may have been reluctant to reveal not so long ago.
''There's a good shot I might become the next president of the United States,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It's not a sure thing, but a good shot.''
His long-distance relationship with Iowa could also be paying off. Four years ago, he visited the state so frequently that his campaign often struggled to build a sense of excitement when he came to town. This time, his rare appearances have created an aura of mystery, which have added to the interest in his campaign -- at least for the news media. An afternoon event in Treynor featured more reporters in the room than community leaders around the table.
Mr. Romney has also had the luxury of waiting and assessing the field this time because of the strong apparatus and organization he created last time. His aides have a database of the names of thousands of supporters from 2008, and a roster of precinct chairmen from four years ago.
''You can tell he benefits from having done this before,'' said Richard Schwarm, a former Iowa state party chairman who was a senior adviser to Mr. Romney during the last campaign. ''I think there are just a lot folks who thought good things about him, are proud they supported him in 2008, and are going to do it again anyways.''
The Iowa strategy also offers a window into how Mr. Romney has streamlined his campaign nationally from the first time he ran for president.
''We've got a lean organization, we know what we need to do, and we're working away to get it done,'' said Dave Kochel, an Iowa consultant for the candidate.

HEADLINE: Nominee for Commerce Is Confirmed

BYLINE: By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN

 BODY:
The Senate voted 74-26 on Thursday to confirm the nomination of John Bryson to be the next commerce secretary, ending a months-long struggle over President Obama's choice. 
Mr. Obama nominated Mr.. Bryson to replace the outgoing secretary, Gary Locke, in May. Mr. Locke succeeded Jon M. Huntsman Jr. as U.S. ambassador to China. Senate Republicans threatened to block Mr. Bryson's confirmation unless Mr. Obama submitted long-delayed trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea for congressional approval. He did so, and Congress passed those trade deals last week.
Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee, put a hold on Mr. Bryson's nomination, preventing a vote for months. He fought Mr. Bryson's confirmation for his support of cap-and-trade legislation to reduce carbon emissions and his role in founding the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, in 1970.
After Mr. Bryson's confirmation, Mr. Obama issued a statement emphasizing employment and economic recovery.
''At such a critical time for our economy, I nominated John because I believe his decades of experience both in the public and private sector have given him a clear understanding of what it takes to put America on a stronger economic footing and create jobs,'' Mr. Obama said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Week 7 Matchups: When the Middling Face the Mediocre

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: The best and most interesting teams have byes this weekend, but the games go on. 

 BODY:
Colts (0-6) at Saints (4-2)

The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell - "On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other" - has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost.
Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline.
Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. "I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline," Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine. Pick: Saints.
Bears (3-3) at Buccaneers (4-2) in London

The Buccaneers rookie defender Adrian Clayborn tried fish and chips for the first time as soon as Tampa Bay arrived in London on Monday. "It didn't sit well with me at all," Clayborn told The Tampa Tribune. "It messed up my stomach bad." Do not let Clayborn anywhere near steak and kidney pie.
You would think that most Americans have encountered fish and chips by now, and conversely, that most Britons would be able to differentiate a football team worthy of international acclaim from, say, the Bears. However, Lovie Smith (whose Bears stayed in the United States until Thursday) expects something close to a home-field advantage. "I'm told we have a big following overseas," Smith said, not realizing that many Londoners are still expecting to see William (The Refrigerator) Perry.
Smith does not expect his Bears to be jet-lagged, any more than Raheem Morris expects his players to be cramped up from too much bangers and mash. Smith also hopes to win some new fans. "I know the guys are excited about showing our brand of football over there," he said. The Bears brand includes Jay Cutler's occasionally uttering profanities, heard by a microphone, about the coordinator Mike Martz. Though if you really want to hear Cutler swear, get him to try bubble and squeak. Pick: Buccaneers.
Chargers (4-1) at Jets (3-3)

Norv Turner and Rex Ryan are as different as two coaches can be. The mild-mannered Turner has less motivational power than dress-down Friday, but his detail-oriented approach turns quarterbacks into sharpshooters and receivers into precision route runners. Ryan's Homer Simpson-meets-Pagliacci routine keeps the troops fired up, but he is rarely bothered by trifling details, like his offense.
Yet their results are the same. Both Turner and Ryan appear to lose control of their locker rooms at times, with Ryan reining them back in with his Asylum's Chief Inmate routine and Turner waiting for the pot to boil over and return to room temperature. Although neither coach has reached the Super Bowl with his current team, each has something to say about it. Ryan said Wednesday that he would have won "a couple of rings" had the Chargers hired him instead of Turner in 2007. Turner jokingly responded, "I was wondering if he had those rings with the ones he's guaranteed the last couple of years." When Norv Turner zings you, you know you left yourself open.
In news unrelated to Ryan's imaginary jewelry box, Plaxico Burress promises that the Jets offense will soon "go through the roof." It would be nice to at least see them get a few inches off the ground. Pick: Jets.
Texans (3-3) at Titans (3-2)

The last meeting between these teams was overshadowed by a brawl between Texans receiver Andre Johnson and Titans cornerback/provocateur Cortland Finnegan. Finnegan reinterpreted "jam at line" as "jab to face" on several plays, until finally he and Johnson ripped each other's helmets off and began swinging. The kerfuffle ended with Finnegan clapping and smiling in the fine "I got you in trouuuu-ble" tradition of schoolyard agitators everywhere. The Texans got the last laugh with a 20-0 victory that perpetuated a six-game Titans losing streak.
Johnson (knee) is doubtful for Sunday, so Finnegan will not have his favorite playmate, and the Texans will again be without the focal point of their passing game. "We needed a new hero," Gary Kubiak said after last Sunday's 29-14 loss to the Ravens. Kubiak failed to mention if that hero's got to be sure, or it's got to be soon. "Larger than life" would not hurt. Pick: Titans.
Broncos (1-4) at Dolphins (0-5)

Fun things to do during this game. 1.) Count the number of incredibly minor accomplishments Tim Tebow receives credit for: completing screen passes and faking handoffs are about to go from remedial quarterbacking skills to "Things Tebow Does Ever So Well." 2.) Try to figure out which Dolphins defender is trying to cover which Broncos receiver. That is exactly what the Dolphins defenders will spend much of the afternoon doing. 3.) Watch the entire Dolphins organization acquire tunnel vision at the 5-yard line, passing to Brandon Marshall on every snap, as if the plays are being called by a tipsy fantasy football enthusiast who needs a big game from the concentration-challenged receiver. Pick: Broncos.
Steelers (4-2) at Cardinals (1-4)

We have reached a crossroad in human history: Larry Fitzgerald is officially quoting Winston Churchill. "Sometimes doing your best isn't good enough. Sometimes you need to do what's required," Fitzgerald said earlier in the week. Fitzgerald got the quote from the special teams coach Kevin Spencer, who got it from Churchill, who got it from special teams coach. Fitzgerald missed the "personal responsibility" part of Churchill's message when he explained that he was not to blame for his lackluster four-catch game against the Vikings. "We had this other guy, what was his name? Oh, yeah. Anquan Boldin," he said, adding, "I wasn't here by myself. I had some talented guys around me." There's something delightfully ironic about signing a cap-straining contract, then complaining about your budget-friendly supporting cast. Any thoughts, Mr. Churchill? "If we open a quarrel between past and present, we shall find that we have lost the future." And shall have caught only a handful of passes. Pick: Steelers.
Redskins (3-2) at Panthers (1-5)

Rex Grossman has a 23-16 career record as a starter. That record is updated and displayed every time he starts a game, more as justification than information: "Yes, we know you are watching a guy close his eyes and heave the ball into tight downfield coverage, but look, he has won many games, so he must do something right." The entire Redskins offense closed ranks around Grossman after his four-interception meltdown against the Eagles, which meant it was only a matter of hours before Mike Shanahan named John Beck (career record: 0-4, earned honestly) the starter. If you did not celebrate the renaissance of Redskins team unity, wise management and long-range planning before last week, it is now probably too late. Pick: Panthers.
Seahawks (2-3) at Browns (2-3)

Seahawks quarterback Tarvaris Jackson (ankle) was a limited practice participant this week, but Charlie Whitehurst took most of the snaps with the first-team offense. Pete Carroll said he may not choose his starting quarterback until Sunday. The Browns are preparing for both by trying to keep a straight face. Carroll also made waves during the bye week by sending football-suggestive Twitter messages to the N.B.A. star (and Cleveland expatriate) LeBron James, including a picture of a Seahawks jersey with James's name on it. A Browns fan countered by creating a video game montage of a superhuman James playing tight end for the Browns. The montage ends with the Eagles snatching James away to create a Double Dream Team for whom James spends his days watching Vince Young throw interceptions. Pick: Browns.
Falcons (3-3) at Lions (5-1)

Jim Schwartz went from "the coach who may finally be turning the Lions around" to "the guy who turned the postgame handshake into the Uproar Festival mosh pit" in just a few regrettable seconds last week. Mike Smith is no stranger to coaching violence (he almost decked DeAngelo Hall in 2009), but Smith is more worried about Detroit crowd noise than acts of Schwartz. Smith made the Falcons practice while he had jet engine noise pumped through giant speakers. It was a far cry from past years, when teams prepared for Ford Field by practicing in a sensory deprivation chamber. Pick: Lions.
Chiefs (2-3) at Raiders (4-2)

Time stands still in the Raiderverse. Hue Jackson was a Bengals assistant from 2004-6, so he may believe he is getting Early Carson Palmer in exchange for two first-round picks, one of them conditional. That Palmer routinely threw for 4,000 yards per season. Unfortunately, the Raiders are getting Late Carson Palmer, a conscientious objector who sat out all of training camp this year, a player whose efficiency rating has fallen in each of his last five seasons as a healthy starter. Palmer went straight from the recliner to the starting lineup, meaning that the Raiders' game plan this week will be mostly runs, reverses and fake punts, which is really not a stretch for them.
The Chiefs have won two games after an 0-3 start, and beanbags may be the reason. The embattled coach Todd Haley set up a game in the locker room, which has lightened the atmosphere and fostered team unity. The beanbags offer almost as much resistance as the Colts and the Vikings, the two opponents the Chiefs beat to get their confidence back. Haley has also given up shaving during the winning streak in an effort to look more like the St. Louis Cardinals squirrel. Pick: Raiders.
Rams (0-5) at Cowboys (2-3)

Jerry Jones has backed away from his harsh criticism of Jason Garrett's play-calling after last week's loss. Jones wanted Garrett to give Tony Romo more passing opportunities while the Cowboys nursed a 3-point lead, because we all know that never backfires. "I would say that probably if I had that to do over again, I wouldn't comment, period," Jones said later in the week. Was he visited by the Ghosts of Meddling Past, Present and Future? Perhaps Nolan Ryan's low-key demeanor as the Texas Rangers' owner is rubbing off.
The new Rams receiver Brandon Lloyd had a reputation as an extraordinary talent with major maturity issues when he played for the 49ers and the Redskins, but he blossomed in Denver under the former Broncos coach Josh McDaniels, now a Rams assistant. Birds of a feather and all that. Pick: Cowboys.
Packers (6-0) at Vikings (1-5)

Donovan McNabb, whose declining accuracy has the Vikings passing game look like a game of pin the tail on the donkey, has been mercy-benched so the Vikings can develop the off-brand prospect Christian Ponder. Ponder is best known to magnetic resonance imaging technicians in Tallahassee as the Florida State quarterback who played through multiple injuries; no one knows yet if he can throw a pass without raising health insurance premiums. The Packers have been excellent long enough that we take it for granted, but not for so long that we resent it, placing them in a sports-consciousness blind spot that makes them difficult to comment upon. Pick: Packers.
Ravens (4-1) at Jaguars (1-5)

We wrap this week's remarkable run of ho-hum matchups with a game of staggering inconsequence. The Ravens specialize in beating down-and-out teams, often in methodically dull ways. With David Garrard, Matt Turk and Mike Sims-Walker all briefly unemployed in the middle of the week, more recognizable Jaguars were out of the league than on the team's roster. That changed when Jacksonville re-signed Sims-Walker, who was cut by the Rams, who lost two weeks ago to the Ravens, 37-7, to give the Jaguars a shot of adrenaline, or more likely a nice cup of chamomile. Pick: Ravens.

HEADLINE: Revisiting Deng Xiaoping: A Word With Ezra F. Vogel

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: In an interview at his home in Cambridge, Mass., Ezra F. Vogel discussed his book, "Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China." Read edited excerpts from an interview with Mr. Vogel. 

 BODY:
Ezra F. Vogel, author of a new biography of Deng Xiaoping, retired from Harvard University in 2000, but still lives just a few hundred yards from the campus. In an interview at his home in Cambridge, Mass., he discussed his book, "Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China"; the differing views of Deng during his rule and now; and the differences between Chinese and American politics during the opening of China to the West. Mr. Vogel talked to The Times's David Barboza. These are edited excerpts from their conversation.
Vogel on His Book
I started in 2000. I thought it'd take five years. To upgrade my spoken Chinese to interview high officials, I got a tutor and worked with a tutor for a year.
After a year, I decided to take a detour and work on Chen Yun (one of China's senior leaders alongside Deng and one of the leaders who often challenged Deng's policies). He was the other person in power. I wanted to get perspective on how the other person thought. I spent almost a year on Chen Yun.
I wanted to understand Deng and Chen's relationship. Chen Yun never spoke publicly to criticize Deng. But he had a different perspective.
I wanted to know those who supported Deng and those who criticized Deng from different perspectives. I got to many liberal intellectuals too, including Some of them told me that if Mao was 70 percent good, Deng was 50 percent good and 50 percent bad. 
I wanted to meet people close to Deng. I used all the connections I could. I cultivated a lot of people over the years. Before I started this project I had known many of the leading dissidents as friends here at Harvard, including Liu Binyan, Wang Ruoshui and Dai Qing. I wish I had thought of this project when they were here, for I would have inquired about certain issues more deeply.

Cultivating Sources
I got to know Deng's daughter, Deng Rong. I also met Deng Lin, his eldest daughter. I had long meetings with Wan Li's daughter and Zhao Ziyang's daughter. I also held meetings with two sons of Hu Yaobang, Hu Dehua and Hu Deping. I met the sons Chen Yi and Ye Jianying and Ye's nephew who worked closely with Ye.
In the U.S., I met (Henry) Kissinger, (Brent) Scowcroft, Stapleton Roy. I met Nancy Tang (former translator for Mao) when I traveled with Kissinger to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 1971 talks. She was on the trip. So we talked several hours. Zhang Hanzhi, (former translator and English teacher for Mao), we had long talks. I went to the Carter Library, that was a key period. The National Security Archives have a lot of material
available. Now the U.S. has fuller, richer records.
Perspectives on Deng
When Jiang Zemin came to the U.S. (in 1997) I was the one who organized his visit to Harvard and I hosted him. Jiang Zemin gave me an interview on his views of Deng.
Several things surprised me. He wasn't the one that started reform and opening. Hua Guofeng did that. Hua Guofeng wasn't as conservative as he's made out to be. He was the originator of the reform and opening.
The vision, it was a lot of people. I don't think he was unique. But he had the judgment and balance and political skill to carry it through.
There was that Time magazine photograph. He was a capitalist in everything but name, it read. My evaluation is that wasn't accurate. He thought socialism could do things better. He thought with a more centralized, stronger legislature.
Sino-U.S. Relations
He once went to Tip O'Neill, Tip told him about the fights between White House and Congress. Deng was delighted and invited him to China. But Deng said these fights wouldn't work in China.
He also thought you need planning and land is not privately-owned. Government with allocation of funds. He didn't want capitalists to have political power. He wanted a disinterested group at the top that
couldn't be swayed.
I call it a market economy but not a capitalist economy.
I want the reader to see how deep the changes were. I want to reader to come away with Deng wanted good relations with all the foreign powers. He even wanted Japanese literature and art to come into China.
Deng and Mao
There was the brilliance in much of the way he dealt with Maoism. He put Mao on a pedestal, so Maoists couldn't complain. Then when people asked he said, "it doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice." The way he put it he never opposed Mao. He never even criticized Mao.
Of course, he was bitter with Mao, but he was a pragmatic guy. When your son is crippled for life, how can you not be bitter? (Deng's son was crippled during the Cultural Revolution, when he came under attack by critics of his father while he was at Beijing University.) But Deng didn't nourish his bitterness. He was a commander for 12 years. You get ready for the next battle.
He did carry out Mao's ideas. He felt you had to run a disciplined organization and he did carry out attacks on intellectuals.
And Great Leap Forward, he didn't stop it. His daughter said he started to see something was wrong after the Great Leap Forward.
Tiananmen Square
The Tiananmen thing was a perfect storm; it shouldn't have happened. The students weren't so upset. But Deng felt if you warn them they'll shape up.
He wrote an editorial. Then Zhao (Ziyang) comes back and people see there are two different views (on the demonstrations). And Zhao wants to be more forthcoming. If someone like Zhou Enlai was there maybe he would talk to them. But Zhao wasn't that kind of guy. Zhao Ziyang was not good at seeing students some blamed him and said his kids were corrupt.
So Deng said bring on martial law. The police can stop it ; so it got stronger. So you bring in military troops. On May 20, unarmed were brought in to establish order. But there was so much opposition. The locals were supporting the students and blocking it; So what do you do? Deng felt if unarmed troops can't do it... . Deng thought clearing the square was not enough. He had to come down with stronger message to stop it. He felt a greater crackdown was needed.
He tried to take precautions, and clear the streets. He told troops to do what was necessary, including the use of guns.
A lot of people were killed. I think early reports of the numbers were greatly exaggerated. Tim Brooks, a Canadian, he did his best estimate, maybe 700 people were killed. Some estimate 2,000. Some had said 10,000 were killed. Some of the foreign press overestimated. We still don't know what happened in Tiananmen Square.
The students were naive and pushed too hard. Many students said they kind of had to find new ways.
China After Tiananmen Square
But in the 22 years since Tiananmen, they've grown very rapidly. He said in 1957, whether you have political reform depends on the mood of the people. In the '70s he allowed Democracy Wall. Then it went too far and he stopped it. In '86 and '87, he allowed some things then stopped it.
He wasn't necessarily opposed to democracy; democracy to him was a good word, but not American-style democracy. There should be freedom in party to express.

HEADLINE: Beyond Green: A Net-Zero College Community

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: West Village, a community at the University of California at Davis whose net energy consumption is zero, is described as the largest project of its kind and just opened its doors to students. 

 BODY:
Designing buildings that leave a lighter imprint on the environment has become the de facto standard these days. The target for many is zero net energy use, meaning that a building makes as much energy as it uses over the course of a year. 
Noteworthy net-zero-energy homes, commercial buildings and government structures are regularly built. But none have matched the scale of West Village, a net-zero community at the University of California, Davis, that its developers describe as the largest project of its kind in the country.
Stretching over 130 acres on the campus, which is just west of Sacramento, the initial phase of this $280 million project officially opened last weekend with the completion of 315 apartments, 42,500 square feet of commercial space and a recreation center. Once it is completed in 2013, the development will be home to about 3,000 students, faculty and staff in apartments and single-family houses.
The university collaborated on the project with the private developers Carmel Partners and Urban Villages, real estate development firms that specialize in sustainable design.
Reaching net zero energy for such a varied collection of residential and commercial spaces combines two approaches, according to Nolan Zail, project manager for Carmel Partners.
"First you have to find ways to reduce energy consumption for the development and then meet that consumption by generating energy on-site from renewable sources," he said.
Using techniques like solar reflective roofing and extra insulation will reduce the heating and cooling demands of the buildings. Designs that make the most of natural light so that overhead lights can stay turned off will reduce electricity costs. Aside from those passive energy-saving methods, residents can manage their energy use by turning off lamps and plugged-in electronics remotely through a smartphone app.
All these techniques should result in energy consumption that is about 50 percent lower than that of other projects built to meet the current building codes, according to Mr. Zail.
A four-megawatt photovoltaic solar power system provides power for the community. And for future energy needs, a biodigester is being considered that uses technology developed at the university. A biodigester produces biogas from animal and plant waste that is used to generate electricity and heat.
The innovations are notable considering the constraints imposed on the project, said Sid England, the university's assistant vice chancellor for sustainability. "Working with a private developer, the project must provide a return for its investors," he said. "At the same time, we had to build high-quality affordable housing for students and staff while still accomplishing the goal of zero net energy."
"We've proven it can work on a very large scale within those constraints," said Mr. England. "We want this to be replicable, so others can see what we've done and know they can do it too."
Here's a video about the project:

HEADLINE: The Fisker Karma's 20 M.P.G. Sticker: A Scarlet Letter?

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The plug-in hybrid luxury sports sedan received the rating from the E.P.A. this week, a reflection of the vehicle's estimated fuel economy when its gasoline generator was engaged. 

 BODY:
With its range-extender gasoline engine engaged, the Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid was rated this week by the Environmental Protection Agency at just 20 miles per gallon. The E.P.A. figure was first reported by the blog GreenCarReports.com.
In the ensuing blowback, some critics concluded that the luxury sport sedan, which was not yet certified by the California Air Resources Board for sale in that primary E.V. market, would be a "fuel economy flop."
Like the bankrupt solar company Solyndra, Fisker also received a loan from the Energy Department, $528.7 million, feeding the critics' grist.
According to the E.P.A., the Karma has a purely electric range of 32 miles, in the vicinity of the Chevrolet Volt's 35-mile rating, and a mileage equivalent in battery mode of 52 MPGe, compared with the Volt's 93 MPGe.
"Over all, we're pleased," said Roger Ormisher, a spokesman for Fisker, when asked in a telephone interview how the automaker reacted to the E.P.A. rating.
Plug-in hybrids are new to market, as are the E.P.A.'s MPGe ratings, which also apply to purely electric cars. Dual-mode hybrids like the Karma can be driven with or without the gas engine running, so a driver's behavior strongly influences a car's performance. Owners with shorter commutes are likely to use the Karma mostly in all-electric mode, Mr. Ormisher said, returning the approximate per-gallon economy of a Toyota Prius. In 100-mile daily commutes, with the gas engine engaged, the car would disappoint would-be hypermilers.
Still, the ability of MPGe to convey an E.V.'s equivalent gasoline fuel economy to shoppers is not entirely proven, as the new metric was just introduced in the spring. The E.P.A. offers this definition:
"The mpg-equivalent metric expresses the energy consumption of a nongasoline vehicle in terms of how many miles the vehicle could go on gasoline if it used the same amount of gasoline energy as it used of the nongasoline fuel energy. For example, a gallon of gasoline has the energy equivalent of 33.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity. An E.V. that uses 33.7 kilowatt-hours to drive 100 miles will use the energy equivalent of one gallon of gasoline, and therefore would have an MPGe of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline equivalent."
Charles Griffith, director of the climate and energy program at the Ecology Center, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization in Ann Arbor, Mich., thinks that Karma owners will try to drive electric.
"I think most people are going to strive to be in the electric mode as much as possible," he said. "We're going to need a lot of data gathering in the first few years of electric and plug-in hybrid cars to see how people actually drive these vehicles."
Mr. Griffith said that the E.P.A. might have purposely rated the Karma conservatively at 20 m.p.g. in gas mode. "It's unfortunate if it discourages some people from purchasing these vehicles, but a bigger concern would be promising more miles per gallon and then disappointing drivers." In his review of the Chevrolet Volt for The Times, for example, Lawrence Ulrich observed fuel economy of 44 m.p.g., besting the E.P.A. rating by a full nine m.p.g.
John DeCicco, a senior lecturer at the University of Michigan who developed a competing E.V. metric called AutoEcoRating, said that the Karma should be compared to similar high-performance cars. "You don't want to compare it to a Nissan Leaf," he said in a telephone interview.
The Karma's 6.3-second zero-to-60 time, while quick, does not position it anywhere near supercar range.
As a marketplace offering, Mr. Ormisher compared the Karma to the 2012 Porsche Panamera, which achieved a slightly better combined fuel-economy rating of 24 m.p.g. The Panamera is roughly $20,000 cheaper, however, so to maintain its comparative advantage in this not-so-hypothetical marketplace, a Karma would have to rely on its purely electric range and comparative rarity on the road.

HEADLINE: Can Powerful Women Change the Workplace?

BYLINE: JUDITH WARNER


HIGHLIGHT: It's nice that more women in positions of power feel safe talking about family commitments at work. What about those in less powerful jobs? 

 BODY:
The New York Times's otherwise distressing article today on the very real possibility that, in 2012, women's representation in the Senate may shrink for the first time in a generation did contain one real bright spot: Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, elected in the much-vaunted Year of the Woman in 1992, reflected on the contrast of then and now:
"Obviously when I was elected in 1992 there wasn't a lot of success to point to," she said. "But there was a collective sense at the time that there needed to be a better culture in the Senate." And that culture has changed, she said. As an example, she told Jennifer Steinhauer that women have learned to feel comfortable with saying a meeting has to be moved because that is the time that they need to be at a parent-teacher conference.
It's nice to see that we've evolved to a point where it's safe for women in positions of power to talk about their family commitments - and to insist upon incorporating those responsibilities into the way they manage their workday. (Ken Auletta, in a lengthy profile of The Times's first female executive editor, Jill Abramson, in the New Yorker this week, points out that she, too, is changing the culture of work at the paper in this more well-rounded direction: "It used to be that women wouldn't talk about when their kid had a dentist appointment," Trish Hall, the deputy editorial-page editor, tells him. "Jill doesn't pretend that work is the only thing in her life.")
The question now is: Can women like this rise to the top or the near-top in sufficient numbers to change our work culture enough that the benefits will trickle down to those less powerful? Or will we have to wait for the next generation of men - who, multiple studies have shown, are at least as plagued, if not more, by the sense that their work-family balance is askew - to rise to power to see such change mainstreamed into a national priority?

HEADLINE: Taking the Protests to the Art World

BYLINE: MELENA RYZIK


HIGHLIGHT: On Thursday evening, about 20 members of Occupy Museums, a splinter group of the Occupy Wall Street protesters, made their way from the Museum of Modern Art to the New Museum of Contemporary Art to a downtown gallery, protesting what they say is the conflation of art and commerce, the snobbery of the art market, and high ticket prices at museums, which they called the "temples of the cultural elite." 

 BODY:
The Occupy Wall Street movement took on the art world, sort of, this week, with a splinter group, Occupy Museums. Convened on Thursday evening through a Facebook, Twitterand Tumblr posts, about 20 people made their way from the Museum of Modern Art to the New Museum to a downtown gallery, protesting what they say is the conflation of art and commerce, the snobbery of the art market and high ticket prices at museums, which they called the "temples of the cultural elite."
Outside the New Museum they chanted: "Museums, open your minds and your hearts, and listen. Art is for everyone! The people are at your door." Standing in a circle on the sidewalk, they used the call-and-response system, known as the people's mic, that has become a hallmark of the movement. The people's mic is an "art form," Noah Fischer, an artist and organizer of Occupy Museums, said later, promising that it was only the first new artistic tool to emerge from the protests. "I thing art is going a change from this movement," he said, "because it's going to unstick the current paradigm, which is based on money."
After reading from a text, which called museums a "pyramid scheme" in which "the wealthiest one hundredth of one percent claim ownership of culture," the Occupy Museums group opened the floor to supporters to speak. One woman noted that the New Museum had recently collaborated with a group called WAGE - Working Artists and the Greater Economy - to take on the issue of artist compensation in an exhibit called "Free." She wanted to acknowledge the museum for paying artists fairly for their work in it. But she added, "This should not be an exception, but rather a rule." She called upon artists to be brave and stand up to gatekeeper cultural institutions. Together, she said, "we are stronger than the threat of obscurity."
At MoMA, the protesters had been cordoned off by the police, but at the New Museum they were unencumbered. Three police officers casually watched the proceedings, leaning on their squad car. Museumgoers, too, seemed to take the spectacle in stride (though a protester in a gorilla mask, a woman who said she worked at an art museum, drew a few double takes). Some passersby stopped to listen. "It makes sense," one 60-ish man, a neighborhood resident, said of the group's comments, before heading on his way.
Mr. Fischer, 34, a Brooklyn sculptor, performance artist and Fulbright scholar, has been a supporter of Occupy Wall Street since it started five weeks ago, though he has spent only one night at Zuccotti Park, the movement's epicenter. "My girlfriend, she would not appreciate me sleeping there every night," he said, as his girlfriend looked on, nodding. He has, though, committed himself as an artist to protesting. "Right now, this is my practice," he said. (He teaches at the Pratt Institute and rents out artist studios to make ends meet.)
Even in its first day, Occupy Museums, which is meant to be a weekly event, had drawn some criticismonline, but Mr. Fischer said dissent was welcome. "This is our moment to expand people's thinking about what part of our culture is controlled by the one percent," he said, "and people who think about it will figure out pretty quickly that MoMA is."
Over the summer Mr. Fischer and several others were involved in a performance of their own on Wall Street, "Summer of Change." Wearing an oversized mask that resembled the head side of a coin (a penny or a quarter), Mr. Fischer and his compatriots gave out vast amounts of change - 400 quarters, 1,000 dimes - in an attempt at redistribution of wealth. (The project was funded by a Kickstarter.) "It's time now, in the movement, to look beyond Wall Street and notice that a culture of economic inequality flows to all parts of our city, and all parts of our culture," Mr. Fischer said.
At the New Museum, a protester mentioned White Box, a small gallery off the Bowery that was having an opening that night. After a consensus vote, the group marched their protest over to its doors. But the exhibit there, "WALLmART," turned out to be in solidarity with the 99 percent movement. So after a few minutes, the Occupy Museums group abandoned their sidewalk chants and went in.
"We occupied, and now we're going to schmooze," Mr. Fischer said.

HEADLINE: Rawls on Wall Street

BYLINE: STEVEN V. MAZIE


HIGHLIGHT: If Occupy Wall Street needs a manifesto, they should look to John Rawls and his theory of "justice as fairness." 

 BODY:
Whether it fizzles with the first snowfall or develops into a true counterweight to the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street will go down as the first protest movement in recent memory to shine a critical light on the staggering levels of economic inequality in the United States.
But to move forward and make a difference, Occupy Wall Street needs specific goals backed by a more coherent, more inspiring vision for American democracy. To their credit, protestors have recently begun debating which specific demands the movement should make, but their conversations appear to be unguided by any deeper wisdom. A perfect intellectual touchstone would be the work of John Rawls, the American political philosopher who was one of the 20th century's most influential theorists of equality. Rawls named his theory "justice as fairness," and emphasized in his later writings that its premises are rooted in the history and aspirations of American constitutionalism. So it's a home-grown theory that is ripe for the picking.

Despite providing a remarkable venue for what Al Gore called a "primal scream of democracy," Occupy Wall Street is leveraged too heavily on the rhetoric of rage rather than reciprocity. Rawls would argue that Occupy is fully justified in its criticism of the political and economic structures that propagate massive concentrations of wealth; he saw the "basic structure" of society as the "primary subject of justice." But Rawls would lament the tendency of the "99 percent" to misdirect their energies into hatred of individuals in the 1 percent. He would have them save their hostility for the policies and institutions that have permitted only the wealthiest to enjoy significant gains from the past two decades of economic growth.
Rawls's boldest claim - that inequality in society is only justified if its least well-off members fare better than they would under any other scheme - could provide a lodestar for the protests. Rawls was no Marxist: this "difference principle" acknowledges that a productive, free society will be home to at least some degree of inequality. But the principle insists that if the rich get richer while wages and social capital of the poor and middle class are stagnant or falling, there is something seriously wrong.
This idea is built on the premise that in a just society, citizens should be understood as free and equal participants in a system of social cooperation. Some individuals may be more motivated and harder working, and thus can legitimately expect greater rewards for their efforts. But everyone deserves the same bundle of individual rights and liberties, and everyone is entitled to "fair equality of opportunity," including access to a decent education and a genuine chance of success in pursuing one's life plans.
Inequality becomes injustice when the cooperative nature of society breaks down and a significant segment of the population finds itself unable to thrive, despite its best efforts. Rawls does not prescribe particular policies to heal the divide, but structural changes in campaign financing, the banking system and the tax code are natural places to begin the discussion. Whatever platform Occupy Wall Street adopts, Rawlsian principles might help clarify the values of the movement and navigate it away from divisive or intellectually bankrupt rhetoric.
Some may question the strategy of concentrating on the plight of the "least advantaged." No political movement can get off the ground, they will rightly observe, if individuals under the poverty line are its exclusive concern. Though the recent economic downturn has swelled the ranks of these least-fortunate Americans, the proportion is still only 1 in 6, and they neither turn out at the polls in great numbers nor contribute cash to political campaigns.
Yes, merely railing against poverty cannot be Occupy Wall Street's sole focus. But it does violence to the special problems facing the truly poor to lump everyone in the bottom 99 percent together as if families on food stamps are really on a par with those making $100,000 or more a year. It's worth distinguishing between the various strata of the 99 percent while highlighting something all layers have in common: a basic structure of society that is geared to advance the interests of only the very wealthiest Americans.
So perhaps Occupy should apply Rawls's more inclusive formulation of the difference principle, which holds that "inequality is only allowed if there is reason to believe that the institution with the inequality, or permitting it, will work out for the advantage of every person engaged in it."
Is all this too rarefied for a popular protest movement? The quote from the last paragraph does not fit on a handwritten sign, let alone a bumper sticker. It certainly lacks the pith of one sign I saw in Zuccotti Park on Columbus Day: "Eat the Rich!!!"
But Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged," the libertarian novel beloved by the Tea Party, helps to fuel a social movement despite running over 1100 turgid pages. Occupy protestors could find inspiration by reading "A Theory of Justice" and Rawls's other books in study circles from Zuccotti Park to Washington, D.C., to Des Moines. They'll find a trove of ideas to enrich their movement, from Rawls's "original position" (a heuristic for developing a society's principles of justice in a context of impartiality), to his view of "public reason" (a mode of debating divisive issues), to his "overlapping consensus" (a vision of groups with incompatible beliefs settling on basic terms of political justice) to his distinction between "the rational" and "the reasonable," where the latter includes putting yourself in someone else's shoes and not merely advocating for your narrow self-interest.
Elizabeth Warren is already sounding some Rawls-style principles in her bid for the Massachusetts U.S. Senate seat currently held by Scott Brown. Recently she portrayed American democracy as a cooperative enterprise in which no tycoon can claim sole responsibility for his fortune, given the public goods necessary for any company to succeed. The factory owner should "keep a big hunk" of the profit but "part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along."
This sentiment could be ripped from the pages of a streetwise edition of "A Theory of Justice." If Occupy Wall Street is to remedy the social justice crisis in the United States, it should consider drafting - and rallying behind - just such a manifesto.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Paul Volcker's Warnings, the S.E.C.'s Privacy Problem and Some Economic Pitfalls

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A weekly podcast features the former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, a look at the public pension crisis and some cautionary words from the Harvard economist Greg Mankiw, among other topics. 

 BODY:
With European leaders struggling to contain their financial crisis, many Americans may be feeling complacent. Perhaps they shouldn't be.
Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, warns that we are not out of the woods yet, as Gretchen Morgenson writes in her Fair Game column in Sunday Business and says on the new Weekend Business podcast. Mr. Volcker focuses on two big problems. 
First, he says, money market funds should be treated like other mutual funds - whose price can fluctuate - rather than as guaranteed stores of value, like bank accounts. In addition, he says, the United States needs to plan on eventually shutting down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two agencies that now dominate the mortgage market.

The public pension crisis, another big problem afflicting the American economy, is the focus of a cover article in Sunday Business by Mary Williams Walsh. In a discussion on the podcast with David Gillen, she says Rhode Island is experiencing acute problems now, which may provide a preview of much that is still to come elsewhere in the country. 
Greg Mankiw, the Harvard economist, discusses his Economic View column, in which he points out four pitfalls for the American economy, which he says are epitomized by four countries that have already experienced them: Zimbabwe, Greece, Japan and France. He provides details in his column and in our discussion. Briefly, though, he is referring to the potential for runaway inflation, uncontrolled debt, a protracted slump and a relatively high tax regime. 
And, in a separate conversation, Natasha Singer asks whether the S.E.C. may have inadvertently compromised the financial privacy of its own employees. The potential problem, which arose after the agency brought in an outside contractor to help it monitor its employees' finances, is the subject of her Slipstream column in Sunday Business. 
You can find specific segments of the podcast at these junctures: Paul Volcker's warnings (34:10), news headlines (23:36), the public pension crisis (21:30), four pitfalls of the American economy (14:15), the S.E.C. and privacy (7:50) and the week ahead (1:43).

HEADLINE: Santander to Sell Stake in U.S. Auto Financing Group

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: As it looks to shore up its books, Spain's Grupo Santander announced a deal to sell a 35 percent stake in its American automotive financing unit to a group of private equity firms. 

 BODY:
Spain's Grupo Santander, the euro zone's largest bank by market capitalization, announced a $1.15 billion deal on Friday to sell a 35 percent stake in its automotive financing unit in the United States to a group of private equity investors, as it looks to shore up its balance sheet. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Centerbridge Partners and Warburg Pincus will invest a combined $1 billion for a 25 percent share in Santander Consumer USA. Dundon DFS will pay $150 million for a 10 percent stake in Santander Consumer USA.
"Following the transaction, Santander will realize a capital gain of approximately $1 billion," the bank, which is based in Madrid, said in a statement. "The capital gain will be fully allocated to reinforce the group's balance sheet."
According to regulatory filings, Santander's core tier-1 ratio - a crucial indicator of a bank's overall financial health -- stood at 7.1 percent in 2010.
Santander, which will retain a majority stake in its United States consumer financing division, went on an acquisition binge during the financial crisis.
In 2008, the Spanish bank bought the Philadelphia-based Sovereign Bancorp for $1.9 billion. That followed other global deals, including the acquisition of Britain's Alliance & Leicester for $1.9 billion and Brazil's Banco Real for $1 billion.
Yet the deteriorating economic situation in its home market has begun to take its toll. According to the European Union, more than one in five of all Spaniards is unemployed. 
That has hit Santander's domestic operations as people struggle to meet their mortgage payments and companies can not meet their debt obligations. In the first half of 2011, the bank's net profit fell to $5 billion, a 21 percent drop compared with the same period last year. 
The automotive financing group in the United States has been a point of strength for Santander. The unit, based in Fort Worth, Tex., has been rapidly expanded its financing operations across the country, and reported an annual net profit of $455 million last year.
Deutsche Bank and Barclays Capital advised Warburg Pincus, K.K.R., Centerbridge Partners on the deal.

HEADLINE: Live From New York, It's Steve Schwarzman

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Blackstone Group's co-founder delivered more than a few zingers at a top Catholic charity dinner on Thursday, picking on politics, Bank of America -- and himself. 

 BODY:
Stephen A. Schwarzman has been many things, including a mergers banker, a private equity mogul and philanthropist.
On Thursday night, the Blackstone Group co-founder tried out a new role: comedian.
Mr. Schwarzman delivered the keynote speech at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, an annual Catholic charity fund-raiser named in honor of the former governor of New York. Held at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Midtown Manhattan, it is one of the most prominent charity events on the New York circuit, with presidential candidates often stopping by during election years. (None were in attendance on Thursday, perhaps for the better. More on that later.)
By tradition, the keynote speaker of the 66-year-old event is supposed to deliver a mostly humorous speech, and Mr. Schwarzman's roughly 15-minute peroration was laced with humor. Blackstone staff members took weeks to write the speech, with contributions from executives like John Studzinski, the head of the firm's financial advisory practice. But we're told that Mr. Schwarzman -- who confidently delivered the speech wearing a traditional white-tie ensemble -- practiced giving the full speech only twice before Thursday night.
DealBook was on hand to jot down some of his zingers. From our notes:

        
Mr. Schwarzman acknowledged the protests downtown: "Thank you for the opportunity to address the 66th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. Or as I like to call it, Occupy Wal-Dorf." As he noted later, Blackstone also happens to own the Waldorf through its Hilton Worldwide portfolio company.
        
The line that brought the house down: "Brian Moynihan is here tonight. He's the C.E.O. of Bank of America. As many of you know, Brian's brother Patrick runs a Catholic boarding school in Haiti. Their parents must be so proud to see two of their boys running an underfunded, nonprofit organization." Even Mr. Moynihan, who was in the audience, laughed.
        
More topicality: "I know Rupert Murdoch is upset he can't be here tonight, but after I read some of my jokes over the phone to my mother, Rupert called and told me that I had pretty good material."
        
Mr. Schwarzman recounted, in a fashion, how he and Peter G. Peterson founded Blackstone and chose its name. The first choice, he said, was "Stone-Cold Black-Hearted Partners." Then came "Man and Son," which he said was a little patronizing. The third choice was already taken by Goldman Sachs: "Vampire Squid."
Mr. Schwarzman wasn't above poking fun of himself, either, noting that he "grew from modest Pennsylvania beginnings to develop a nearly insatiable desire for stone crabs." Dealbreaker, take a bow.
Much of the speech focused on an apparent discrepancy: a Jewish keynote speaker at a Catholic charity. But Mr. Schwarzman and his Catholic wife are longtime supporters of Catholic nonprofit organizations, including through their sponsorship of nearly 200 students through the Inner-City Scholarship Fund. (DealBook wrote about a visit to one of those students.)
There are other reasons as well, Mr. Schwarzman professed. First, he cracked, "You never know when you're hedged enough." And then he added that he was trying to arrange "a merger of Judaism and Catholicism," noting a few things the two have in common. Among them was headgear, since Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan, who sat next to Mr. Schwarzman on the dais, wears a "yarmulke."
A prolific donor to Republican candidates, Mr. Schwarzman included more than a few political cracks in his remarks, poking fun at Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, and former Representative Anthony Weiner. A sample: "I'm Jewish and a Republican. That used to be a rare thing. Now it describes all of Anthony Weiner's old district."
But he also threw a few barbs at Republicans as well, noting the presidential candidate Herman Cain's "9-9-9" tax plan. "It's not just Herman Cain's tax plan, or the number of cans of hair spray he goes through each year. " Mr. Schwarzman said. "It's also the number Rick Perry thinks comes after 888."
Not every line went over smoothly. When Mr. Schwarzman described the Waldorf's progressive history, he said, "It was the first hotel to admit women without escorts. Shortly after Eliot Spitzer heard 'no escorts,' he sent his regrets." Much groaning followed.
But the speech had its serious side, too. Mr. Schwarzman pointed to high unemployment, collapsing housing prices and a sense of "economic and social alienation," and called for an end to political gridlock and venomous partisanship to solve the country's woes.
"At the end of the day, this can't be about who occupies 'one street,' but about the fact that we are all Americans and we each deserve the right to aspire to the American dream and to achieve a bright future for ourselves and our families," he said.
Mr. Schwarzman was followed by Archbishop Dolan, who said that the dinner had raised $3 million, one of its highest totals in recent history. He then delivered a brief benediction, before hastening the crowd to leave so he could watch his hometown baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals.

Narrowing Losses, Groupon Seeks $16 to $18 in I.P.O. | Groupon reported nearly breaking even in its third quarter, an important milestone as it prepares the final leg of its long journey toward an initial public offering.
The daily deals giant said on Friday in a revised prospectus that it expects to sell 30 million shares in its initial offering and fetch $16 to $18 a share, valuing the company at as much as $11.4 billion.
Groupon is also seeking to quell questions about its business model, disclosing that it had narrowed its losses in the third quarter, to $1.7 million in consolidated segment operating income. Based on that same metric, the company turned a profit in its core North American business, earning $18.8 million, with the losses mainly coming from the international businesses.
The company had been especially keen to prove that it was at least close to profitable before it began its two-week road show, according to people briefed on the matter.

HEADLINE: For Those With Less, One Less 9 From Cain

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Herman Cain went to Detroit an "Opportunity Zones" program to mitigate the 9-9-9 plan's impact on low earners and bring production jobs to struggling areas. 

 BODY:
Herman Cain, who has said simplicity is one of the greatest virtues of his "9-9-9" tax plan, added an asterisk on Friday.
After acknowledging that his plan to impose taxes of 9 percent on corporations, personal income and purchases would result in a tax increase for lower earners, Mr. Cain proposed modifications to the plan that would mitigate that impact. 
The plan would be 9-0-9 for those at or below the poverty level, meaning they would pay no income tax, Mr. Cain said at an appearance in front of Detroit's dilapidated Michigan Central Station.
The appearance was part of a broader unveiling of Mr. Cain's "Opportunity Zones" proposal to revitalize struggling cities with incentives to encourage the creation of manufacturing and production. People would get deductions for working or living in such a zone, and employers could take payroll deductions. 
"By basing it on payroll and not income, it reduces 'gaming' and helps new businesses which generally don't generate profits in early years," says a brochure about the zones.
The brochure also lists "barriers" to economic growth that local entrepreneurs would need to "identify" in order for a city to win Opportunity Zone status - including minimum wage and labor laws.
Unions are already attacking Mr. Cain's plan as an effort to undermine organized labor.
"To have Herman Cain, a serious contender on the Republican side, to make a statement like that, that he wants to further lower wages, that he wants to do away with the minimum wage - it's almost laughable," Richard L. Trumka, persident of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., told Fox News.

HEADLINE: DealBook's Week in Review

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: Before you run out of the office, take a look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
Before you run out of the office, take a look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
 Mergers & Acquisitions
ENERGY SECTOR The week began with one of the biggest energy deals in history when "Kinder Morgan agreed on Sunday to buy the El Paso Corporation for about $21.1 billion in cash and stock," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced and The Times's Clifford Krauss reported. Kinder Morgan, founded in 1997 by a former head of Enron, is now set to become the largest midstream energy company in North America. The size of the deal exposes it to potential antitrust risk. The acquisition will be financed by Barclays.
DealBook's Mark Scott finds that energy deals are on an upswing as bargains abound. "Big domestic and international players are tapping their vast cash reserves to buy oil and gas companies, whose stocks have been decimated by the downturn."
HEALTH CARE SECTOR Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals company, said that it would split next year into two publicly traded companies, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced and The Times's Bruce Japsen reported.
MEDIA SECTOR Bids to buy Citigroup's EMI Group have been lower than expected, The Times reported. Citi put the giant music company on sale in June hoping that it might sell for up to $4 billion.
DEAL PROFESSOR Although mega-deals abound, Steven M. Davidoff warns that "many major economies in the world are growing sluggishly, if at all. The negative economic outlook is likely to counteract some otherwise strong drivers for deal-making."
Investment Banking
EARNINGS SEASON Goldman Sachs reported a quarterly loss of of $428 million, signaling a shift in Wall Street. As regulators step in, banks "may no longer be able to produce the supercharged earnings that were common before the financial crisis," DealBook's Susanne Craig reported. 
JPMorgan is now the biggest bank in the United States. Bank of America reported a $6.23 billion profit and $2.22 trillion in assets in its third-quarter earnings placing it behind JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.22 trillion is assets.
Morgan Stanley earned $2.15 billion in the third quarter. The bank's stock "is now up more than 40 percent from its low earlier this month," Ms. Craig reported.
BlackRock's third-quarter profit fell 3 percent, to $521 million. Blackstone said that it lost $341.9 million in the third quarter.
INVESTMENT BANKING'S UNCERTAIN FUTURE The giant Swiss bank UBS is determined to shrink its investment banking operation, The Times's Julia Werdigier reported. "The sudden shift of UBS, long one of Europe's major investment banks, is driven by a disappointing performance but also by demands from Swiss regulators and politicians to abandon riskier practices like proprietary trading and to buttress their operations with more capital." 
LOAN GROWTH "Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot," The Times's Eric Dash and DealBook's Ben Protess reported.
2012 ELECTION Mitt Romney has raised $1.5 million while President Obama has raised just over $270,000 from the firms that have been among Wall Street's top sources of donations for the two candidates, according to an analysis by The Times. 
IN EUROPE "Germany and France, still at odds over a more forceful response to the sovereign debt crisis, postponed a decision-making summit meeting for several days amid signs that the complexities of European politics may block an all-encompassing resolution," The New York Times reported. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development reduced its growth forecast for Eastern Europe.
REVOLVING DOOR "One of stalwarts of the restructuring world, the boutique investment bank Miller Buckfire plans to name Harvey Golub its chairman," DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reported.
OFF THE RECORD Omid Malekan imagines a confrontation between the chief of Goldman Sachs and a protester from Occupy Wall Street.
Hedge Funds
FOOD & BEVERAGE SECTOR Green Mountain Coffee Roasters stock has increased more than thirtyfold since October 2006. This has made the company's founder the richest man in Vermont, but it has also brought out the short sellers. David Einhorn, who runs the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, called Green Mountain stock overvalued on Monday and brought the stock down more than 10 percent. 
MAN GROUP EXPANDING "To attract American investors, the firm is expanding its product lineup, building up its local sales force and striking distribution deals with brokerage houses like Morgan Stanley," DealBook's Azam Ahmed reported.
I.P.O./Offerings
GROUPON'S RED FLAGS Groupon reported nearly breaking even in its third quarter. "On Friday, the daily deals giant published the expected price range of its initial offering in a revised prospectus. Groupon expects to sell 30 million shares and fetch $16 to $18 a share, valuing the company at as much as $11.4 billion," DealBook's Evelyn M. Rusli and Michael J. de la Merced reported.
Earlier in the week, DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin asked: Did Wall Street firms desperate to underwrite the Groupon I.P.O. turn a blind eye to the online coupon company's problems? "The cynical reason that the banks stood by Groupon and its accounting shenanigans is most likely the expected fees from the offering."
Legal/Regulatory
MORTGAGE FRAUD "Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had defrauded investors," The New York Times's Edward Wyatt reported. Regulators had charged that the bank misled investors in a $1 billion derivatives deal tied to the United States housing market, then bet against investors as the housing market began to show signs of distress.
The judge presiding over the S.E.C.'s action Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan, "a jurist whom many consider the agency's bete noire," DealBook's Peter Lattman reported.
DODD-FRANK ACT Though several federal agencies agreed "to propose the initial version of the Volcker Rule, they are divided over some of its crucial details," DealBook's Ben Protess reported. "The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for example, has pushed for tough language that would require bank executives to vouch for their compliance with the Volcker Rule - a measure that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been fiercely resisting, say people close to the regulators."
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also expanded the so-called position limits rule that will cap the number of derivatives contracts a trader can hold on commodities.
FORGERY LAWSUIT "Herbert A. Allen, the chief executive of the powerful investment bank Allen & Company, was accused of forging his dying cousin's signature to protect a family ranch from his cousin's creditor," DealBook's Peter Lattman reported.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Park Ave. Co-op Is Sale of Week

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: A 15-room, 6-bedroom apartment is actually two separate spaces, one of which needs work. 

 BODY:
The most expensive apartment sale of the week in Manhattan, according to property records, was a 15-room, 6-bedroom co-op at 625 Park Avenue that had an asking price of $29.75 million - although the final sale price could not be confirmed before publication.
But it came with a catch: It's a fixer-upper. A gilded fixer-upper, to be sure, but still a work in progress.
The 7,500-square-foot fourth-floor apartment is actually two separate spaces. The main living space, about 5,000 square feet, has been lavishly renovated, with all the over-the-top touches one would expect. There are five working fireplaces, eight-foot-tall solid-core French-polished walnut doors, a billiard room and a "chef's caliber" kitchen, according to the listing on the Web site of Warburg Realty, one of the brokers of the apartment. 
But the "second living space," an additional 2,500 square feet, "awaits your personal touch," according to the listing.
The sellers, according to property records, are David Matlin, an investor, and his wife, Lisa. Robert Schulman, a broker for Warburg who helped handle the sale, declined to comment or confirm the final sale price. The Real Deal is reporting that it was $25 million. 
Joan Swift of Prudential Douglas Elliman also brokered the sale. She did not return calls for comment. The buyers were not identified. Big Ticket includes closed deals from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Trying To Unwarp The Debate

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Of demonstrators and the austerity class. 

 BODY:
I visited Zuccotti Park yesterday. Michael Moore gave a short speech, transmitted by the human microphone. I gather that right-wingers are claiming that OWS is anti-Semitic; someone forgot to tell the excellent Klezmer band.
Overall, what struck me was how non-threatening the thing is: a modest-sized, good-natured crowd, mostly young (it was a cold and windy evening) but with plenty of middle-aged people there, not all that scruffy. Hardly the sort of thing that one would expect to shake up the whole national debate. Yet it has -- which can only mean one thing: the emperor was naked, and all it took was one honest voice to point it out.
As for how the emperor got that naked: read Ari Berman's article on the austerity class, and its dominance in Washington. It's about
a central paradox in American politics over the past two years: how, in the midst of a massive unemployment crisis-when it's painfully obvious that not enough jobs are being created and the public overwhelmingly wants policy-makers to focus on creating them-did the deficit emerge as the most pressing issue in the country? And why, when the global evidence clearly indicates that austerity measures will raise unemployment and hinder, not accelerate, growth, do advocates of austerity retain such distinction today?
An explanation can be found in the prominence of an influential and aggressive austerity class-an allegedly centrist coalition of politicians, wonks and pundits who are considered indisputably wise custodians of US economic policy.
What's truly remarkable is the way the reputation for wisdom persists despite one belly-flop moment after another. 
There was the embrace of "expansionary austerity", which has fared even worse than Berman says -- it's not just think tanks like CBPP that have torn holes in the doctrine, it's the Congressional Research Service and the IMF, yes, the IMF.
There was the fiscal responsibility award given to the clownish Paul Ryan -- and in general, the embrace of Ryan when it was obvious way back in early 2010 that he was neither serious nor honest.
And there is, of course, the total failure of the economic data to perform as expected -- austerity regimes have universally led to high unemployment, interest rates have stubbornly stayed low despite the supposedly imminent debt crisis.
I don't think Berman fully explains the austerity class's dominance, but he does a fine job of documenting it. And here's the thing: that dominance has been so total that alternate views weren't even being heard. So doing something, anything, that broke through the narrative could have a big effect.
Thank you, OWS.

HEADLINE: The Infrastructure Twofer: Jobs Now and Future Growth

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Investment in infrastructure construction and repair is an efficient way to create jobs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Two credible reports issued last week present compelling and complementary cases for infrastructure investment and should be required reading by members of Congress before their next vote on President Obama's American Jobs Act. 
One report was from President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness (on which I serve), a nonpartisan group of business and labor leaders, and the other from the New America Foundation, an influential Washington think tank. According to nonpartisaneconomic forecasters, the jobs act, which proposes about $90 billion in infrastructure spending as part of a $450 billion package of tax cuts and spending, would create about two million jobs.
Echoing the views of many economists, the foundation report asserts: "Long-term investment in public infrastructure is the best way to simultaneously create jobs, crowd in private investment, make the economy more productive and generate a multiplier of growth in other sectors of the economy." In less technical language, the council's report makes the same point, arguing that infrastructure investment is a "twofer" that creates jobs in the near term and promotes competitiveness and productivity in the long term.

Both reports provide sobering evidence of the growing deficiencies of infrastructure in the United States, which millions of Americans experience every day in traffic and airport delays, crumbling and structurally unsafe schools and unreliable train and public transit systems. 
These deficiencies impose significant costs on the economy. For example, the Department of Transportation estimates that freight bottlenecks cost the American economy about $200 billion a year, the equivalent of more than 1 percent of gross domestic product; the Federal Aviation Administrationestimates that air traffic delays cost the economy nearly $33 billion a year. 
Both reports cite a study by the American Society of Civil Engineers that documents a five-year gap of more than $1.1 trillion between the amount needed for maintenance and improvements of the nation's public infrastructure and the amount of public funds available for such investment. 
Several recent bipartisan reports, including one by the former transportation secretaries Norman Mineta and Samuel Skinner, find that the annual spending gap in transportation infrastructure alone is $200 billion. 
Based on such estimates, the New America Foundation report calls for a five-year public investment program of $1.2 trillion, encompassing transportation, energy, communications and water infrastructure as well as science and technology research and human capital. (In a report I did for the New America Foundation a year ago, I proposed a five-year increase of $1 trillion for infrastructure investment.) The Jobs Council report recommends a significant increase in infrastructure investment but does not set a target.
The two reports concur that the multiplier effects of an increase in infrastructure spending are substantial, citing recent estimates by Moody's and the Congressional Budget Office that $1 billion of infrastructure spending generates about a $1.6 billion increase in G.D.P. According to Moody's, the multiplier for government spending on infrastructure is even larger than the multiplier for a payroll tax cut, the largest component of the president's proposed jobs act. 
And according to the C.B.O., infrastructure spending is one of the most cost-effective forms of government spending in terms of the number of jobs created per dollar of budgetary cost. The Jobs Council report cites studies indicating that each $1 billion of government infrastructure spending creates 4,000 to 18,000 jobs. Most of these jobs are relatively well paid. 
Critics of infrastructure spending as a form of fiscal stimulus point out that the lags in such spending are long and variable. It often takes considerable time to initiate and complete infrastructure projects, even those deemed "shovel-ready" with engineering plans in place. 
In 2009, when many economists thought (or hoped) the recession's effects would be temporary, the conventional wisdom was that fiscal stimulus measures should be "targeted, timely and temporary." Nearly three years later, the consensus among economists is that the United States will be mired in an anemic recovery with high unemployment for several years. 
So what the country needs now is not temporary stimulus measures that increase consumer spending but sustained stimulus that increases investment spending over several years.
Yet more than just additional money is required. As the Jobs Council report highlights, an increase in funds must be coupled with reforms to select and carry out projects efficiently, based on cost-benefit analysis. 
The Obama administration has urged the Congress to adopt such reforms in its reauthorization of multiyear surface-transportation legislation, because political pressures more often drive project selection than cost-benefit considerations. For example, state and local governments frequently allocate federal infrastructure funds to build roads and bridges rather than to fix existing ones, despite compelling evidence that repairs are more cost-effective. A recent study for the Hamilton Project lays out the efficiency case for a "fix it" strategy for spending on transportation infrastructure. 
Road pavement tends to deteriorate slowly at first; its rate of deterioration accelerates over time. It's often much cheaper to repair a road early on, when it's still in fair condition, than when it falls into a condition of serious disrepair. 
The foundation report makes a related argument, noting that deteriorating infrastructure is subject to "cost acceleration," as repair and replacement costs rise over time. A project that costs $5 million to repair now may cost more than $30 million to repair two years from now. Deferred maintenance on essential infrastructure is not fiscally wise but fiscally irresponsible. That's why many of the infrastructure investments in the American Jobs Act focus on rebuilding and repairing roads, bridges and schools. 
Even when infrastructure projects are carefully selected, they often face permit and approval delays that can last for months, even years -- though, recently, far less than the C.B.O. had anticipated. Eighty percent of the highway funds in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act were deployed between February 2009, when the act was passed, and the end of fiscal year 2011 (far exceeding the C.B.O.'s prediction of 55 percent). 
The Jobs Council report includes numerous recommendations to reduce permitting and approval delays, calling on local, state and federal agencies to develop coordinated one-stop shops to eliminate duplication and harmonize project approval standards and practices. 
As a first step, President Obama has identified 14 high-priority infrastructure projects for expedited review and permitting by the relevant federal agencies and has announced the creation of a "Projects Dashboard," to track the projects as they move through the expedited process. 
Members of Congress who argue that the federal government cannot afford the infrastructure investments in the American Jobs Act are wrong -- the government's borrowing costs are at a historic low. Borrowing now to fund efficient infrastructure projects will reap returns that exceed these costs and will reduce future deficits through job creation and higher growth. 
An investment of $10 billion by the federal government to establish a national infrastructure bank, as proposed in the jobs act, would also unleash additional private funds for infrastructure by fostering public-private partnerships. Many other developed countries have similar institutions and have successfully used them to tap private funds for infrastructure. Both of the new reports recommend the establishment of a national infrastructure bank, and bipartisan Congressional support for the idea is growing.
As the Jobs Council warns, there is no "silver bullet" that will solve the nation's jobs crisis. But as the mounting protests around the country warn, the federal government must take concrete steps to address the crisis. Significant, timely and targeted investments in the nation's deteriorating infrastructure should be one of these steps.

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate faced off on Thursday over a piece of President Obama's jobs bill. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
The Senate had its second showdown in 10 days on Thursday over President Obama's job creation bill, narrowed to include just the $35 billion proposed to protect teachers and public safety officers from layoffs. While Democrats did not collect the 60 votes necessary to surmount a Republican filibuster, they hoped to gain politically by forcing the vote on the issue, Robert Pear reports.

        
The death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi has offered Mr. Obama vindication of his decision to intervene in Libya, for which he received criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as of his broader approach to war that favors surgical strikes and collective action, Mark Landler says.

        
Mitt Romney visited Iowa on Thursday, signaling his intentions to compete there but remaining tight-lipped about his strategy as the caucuses approach, Ashley Parker and Jeff Zeleny report. That may be because Mr. Romney hopes to win but doesn't want to invest so much into the effort that a loss would prove devastating to his campaign.

        
Will 2012 be the year of the woman? The greatest number of female incumbents ever are running for re-election in the Senate, and the number of female nominees would be among the highest ever, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. But with Democrats under fire and Republicans lagging in recruiting women, it could also be the first time women lose ground in the Senate in a generation.
Washington Happenings:

        
On Friday, Mr. Obama will sign free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, as well as the renewal of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers. He will then speak about the deals, emphasizing their benefits to the struggling economy.

        
Mr. Obama also honors the recipients of the 2010 National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the government's highest honor for scientists, engineers and inventors.

HEADLINE: The Value of Foreign Policy Victories for Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Surveys suggest that people give Mr. Obama high marks on foreign policy, but that has not helped his overall approval ratings. 

 BODY:
If there was one area of doubt about Barack Obama that lingered in people's minds during - and even after - the 2008 campaign, it was how well he could handle a foreign policy crisis.
That doubt was planted by his rival at the time, Senator Hillary Clinton, whose most memorable television ad questioned whether people could trust Mr. Obama to take a 3 a.m. call in the Oval Office about a world crisis.
"It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep, but there's a phone in the White House and it's ringing. Something is happening in the world," the ad said. "Who do you want answering the phone?"
Now, three years later, Mr. Obama's actions as the nation's commander in chief may have all but erased many of those doubts in the public's mind.
On Thursday, Libyan officials announced the death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. In a Rose Garden statement, Mr. Obama hailed the American role in his death at the hands of Libyans.
"A coalition that included the United States, NATO and Arab nations persevered through the summer to protect Libyan civilians," Mr. Obama said. "And meanwhile, the courageous Libyan people fought for their own future and broke the back of the regime."
That success followed the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a key terrorist in Yemen, by an American drone authorized by Mr. Obama. And last spring, Mr. Obama ordered the raid that ended with the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks.
But if Mr. Obama has satisfied many of the doubters about his ability to answer the 3 a.m. call, a nagging political question still remains as he begins his campaign for re-election next year: will it matter? 
Is it possible that Mr. Obama has managed to meet - or even exceed - the expectations placed on him in the one area of policy that will not matter that much when it comes times for voters to pull the lever in November 2012?
Surveys suggest that people do give Mr. Obama high marks on foreign policy despite the efforts of some Republicans on Capitol Hill and his rivals on the presidential campaign trail.
But that has not helped his overall approval ratings because the country is so focused on domestic policy, and in particular the economic struggles that are affecting their homes, their jobs and their ability to feel good about the future.
After Bin Laden was killed in May, Mr. Obama did get a political boost, rising several points in the polls. And the victory helped quiet some of his most vocal critics in the Republican party.
The Bin Laden bump lasted just a few weeks, though, until the continuing impact of the economic downturn was once again front and center for most Americans. 
And in some ways, the president's success in hunting terrorists highlights his lack of success in other areas.
People who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 expected him to keep the promise that his administration would change the way Washington operates. They believed him when he said the country's economic fortunes would turn around. 
Mr. Obama has not met the expectations in those areas for many people. The challenge for the president and his advisers in the coming year is to figure out how use his success in foreign policy and war-fighting to offset his difficulties elsewhere.
One possibility is that the president's campaign could try to shift the election-year discussion more toward foreign policy. He could talk more about his wartime victories, and his campaign could spend more time highlighting the reduction of troops in Afghanistan or Iraq. 
But that strategy runs the risk of seeming to be out of step with the conversation that American voters want to have. And it has the potential to backfire if people think the president is eager to avoid discussing the economy.
The issue is also not a natural fit for a Democratic candidate. Republican presidents have a long tradition of appealing to the American people on the issue of how to keep the country safe. Democrats do not.
The other option for Mr. Obama's strategists is to try to find a way to link his foreign policy successes to the issue of his leadership on the country's economic fortunes. That may not be as impossible as it sounds, though it would not be easy by any means.
Surveys suggest that people want a president who will show decisive leadership when it comes to addressing the economic crisis. They want boldness and a feeling that the president is in charge and confident. (Even Mr. Obama's Republican opponents have been demanding it: they keep urging him to show leadership.)
If the president can use his foreign policy successes to bolster the broader idea that he is a decisive leader in other areas as well, Americans might come to view him differently.
One of the strengths of the president's campaign in 2008 was in developing a narrative about him - an overarching story about hope. It's possible that a new narrative could be developed about Mr. Obama that describes him as decisive, bold and confident. That could go a long way toward helping his re-election chances.
Mr. Obama's advisers are keenly aware of the challenge that faces them.
But that doesn't make it any easier.

HEADLINE: Beef Will Be What's for Dinner for a Long Time, Panelists Say

BYLINE: GLENN COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Panelists at New York University said beef is too great an icon to lose its place in the American diet. 

 BODY:
Have you been persuaded that beef is waning on the American plate because it's too destructive to the ecosystem, too hormone-pumped and too corn-fed artery-clogging?
"American steak is here to stay - it's iconic and you don't bring down icons," said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University. 
Betty Fussell, the food historian and author, most recently, of "Raising Steaks: The Life and Times of American Beef," was emphatic that "meat is making a comeback, even among some vegetarians, thanks to the thoughtfulness" in the production of locally raised American beef. 
They had gathered on Thursday in the Fales Library of New York University for a panel discussion on "The Changing Center of the American Plate," and beef seemed right there at the bull's-eye of the platter
"Meat is still at the center of a lot of plates," Dr. Nestle said, adding that in Manhattan, "23-ounce steaks are not that unusual, even now." 
Ms. Fussell added that beef has always been an American staple "because steak is raw, violent, macho, sexy and big." Her book offers an indictment of confined feeding operations where thousands of steer are raised, and the way that beef cattle became commodities. As panelist she traced the historical ascendancy of beef over pork in America "to the refrigerated railroad car, when people had the opportunity to taste fresh beef instead of the previous ho-hum salt pork." 
The moderator was the restaurant consultant Clark Wolf, and the other panelists were Jenifer Harvey Lang, who long ran the Cafe des Artistes restaurant in Manhattan; Mark Gillman, a Connecticut specialty cheesemaker who offers his $20-to-$30-a-pound product at three New York Greenmarkets; and Jeffrey Yoskowitz, a student of pigs and pork who identifies himself as a "swinologist" and who said he was "curious to see if, increasingly, American steak becomes a status symbol in China." 
To which Dr. Nestle said: "Historically, emerging economies always buy meat." 
However, Ms. Fussell noted that Americans' vanity as the world's beef purveyor must increasingly yield to "Brazil, the world's major exporter -- and most of theirs is grass fed." 
In the audience, Stanley Lobel, for 50 years the chieftain of that haute Manhattan butcher, Lobel's of New York, had the last word, noting: "There is no question that beef has an important future. The question is: What is the cost of that future?" 
Because of the Texas drought, which has forced ranchers to bring young cattle prematurely to market "to keep them from dying on the range," Mr. Lobel said, marbled "prime beef is increasingly scarce - and it's only available at a prohibitive price."

HEADLINE: Bridgewater's Dalio: 'I Think I Did Everything Right'

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, told Charlie Rose that the economy is in a deleveraging process, and that he does not deserve the ire of Occupy Wall Street protesters. 

 BODY:
Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, didn't used to do many media appearances. But a series of big magazineprofiles that focused on the intense culture of his Connecticut-based hedge fund seem to have eased the billionaire out of his shell.
On Thursday, Mr. Dalio appeared on Charlie Rose's program on PBS to talk about the economy, and to address the accusations that Bridgewater -- which is governed by a set of rules laid out in Mr. Dalio's business manifesto, "Principles" -- is a cult of personality.
"It's a global macro firm," said Mr. Dalio, who eschewed his usual wardrobe of khakis and untucked shirts for a dark suit and red tie.
For more than half an hour, Mr. Rose and Mr. Dalio talked about the state of the world economy. Mr. Dalio explained his oft-repeated "deleveraging" theory, in which debts rise relative to incomes in a nation until the country, under threat of default, takes stimulative actions to bring the debt-to-income ratio back to more stable levels. Mr. Dalio told the host he believed the United States is in a deleveraging process, but said that economic catastrophe could be averted if careful action is taken.
"The key is to spread it out as much as you can, to make sure it's not disorderly" Mr. Dalio said of the deleveraging process. 
Mr. Rose asked Mr. Dalio, who has pledged to give away at least half his wealth as part of a giving pledge engineered by Warren E. Buffett, if he supported a so-called "Buffett Rule" that would raise taxes on the top income brackets. Mr. Dalio said that he did support the plan, but that he wanted to make sure his tax money was being put to good use.
"I'm going to give away a lot more than half my money," said Mr. Dalio, who made more than $3 billion in 2010. "I'd be happy to give that to the government if the government put together programs that were like I'm giving away to charity, in which I believe the money is effectively used to help people."
Mr. Dalio defended Bridgewater's culture, which emphasizes radical honesty and encourages employees to criticize each other, by saying that it was "exactly the opposite of a cult." He said that the firm's culture of institutionalized bickering actually makes it more productive.
"If people who are disagreeing can say, 'Why do we disagree?' and work through that conversation in an intelligent way to try to find out what's true, you can learn, you can make progress," he said. "It can be a fabulous thing."
The Occupy Wall Street movement, a go-to topic for journalists interviewing financiers since the protests in Lower Manhattan began, also came up in the segment. Mr. Dalio said he understood the frustration expressed by the protesters, but added that he did not believe he had done anything to deserve the ire of the 99 percent.
"I think I did everything right," he said. "I did well when others didn't. I happen to earn one-fifth of the profits. I pay about a third in taxes, I give away about a third, and I follow the law. And if I'm doing something they think is incorrect, I'd like to know that."
And despite his bearish outlook on the domestic economy, Mr. Dalio ended the interview on a caveat-laden note of hope. 
"If we can keep orderly, and not argue with each other, and not do disruptive things, and we don't go down," he said. "Maybe then it'll be O.K."
The full interview is available on Charlie Rose's Web site.

HEADLINE: Battle of the Borders

BYLINE: PETER CATAPANO


HIGHLIGHT: While Republicans talked tough on immigration, the Obama administration deported a record number of illegal immigrants. 

 BODY:
It is probably safe to bet that the tradition of heated arguments over immigration began millennia ago, when the first country drew a line in the sand. But the past week in the United States of America has been a hot one, at least by any recent comparison.
You might say it began on Tuesday night, like many a bloody fight, in Vegas, when this exchange took place at the Republican debate:
Rather unpleasant, no? 
Or it could have been said to begin back on Saturday, when Herman Cain, at a Tea Party sponsored event in Tennessee, proposed an electrified fence - not the joy buzzer type but the type that kills those who dare to breach it - on the U.S.-Mexico border. Or even earlier on Saturday, when Michele Bachmann, campaigning in Iowa proposed her own "secure double fence" for the border. (Bachmann, who seems to always have a pen handy, signed a pledge with the group Americans for Securing the Border, affirming her commitment to the fence.)

Midweek, The Times's Trip Gabriel reported on the potential fallout for the G.O.P. of this kind of tough talk: the alienation of droves of Latino voters in battleground states in 2012.
And one might even suppose it culminated in an immigration fight of a different sort -the late-week dust-up that began when a story in The Washington Post asserted that the U.S. senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, "embellished" the story of his parents arrival in the United States from Cuba, for his political advantage. Many - including The Miami Herald and Rubio himself - responded with outrage at the story, and called the motives of the paper into question. Rubio's stature as a popular Latino Republican, one who has been mentioned as a vice-presidential candidate, has led some to assert that the story itself was a "hit job."
And lest anyone think the issue breaks clearly down partisan lines, there was this, as reported by The Hill: "The U.S. deported more people - nearly 400,000 - who were in the country illegally in fiscal 2011 than ever before, according to the latest numbers released Tuesday by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bureau.
"President Obama's administration touted the startling figures as evidence of its progress in stopping illegal immigration, a record that could help the president win back independent voters who abandoned Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections."
Despite all the hot collars and flaring tempers brought on by the Republican antics, it was this last point, a revealing bit of information on the Obama administration's position on the matter, which opened a round of soul-searching among some bloggers on the left. How tough should Democrats be on immigration and border security?
Soon after the debate, Joe Klein at Swampland pointed out. 
It should also be noted that all this macho posturing about electrified fences, crocodiles etc. avoids the most basic fact about illegal immigration - it is down dramatically. The bad economy means there are fewer jobs to lure illegals. The efforts of the last several Presidents [have] significantly beefed up Border Patrol, fencing and high-tech surveillance. And the Obama Administration has been very tough on illegals-almost 400,000, a record, have been deported in the past year. (Of course, you won't hear the Obama Administration touting this since it might turn away Latino votes the President, like a strict Franciscan Friar, does not tout his good works, like tax cuts and tightening the border. Weird.)
Kevin Drum at Mother Jones replied to Klein's post: 
I don't really have a big problem with beefing up the border patrol, but the real answer to illegal immigration (in the short term, anyway) is to lower the cost of legal immigration by boosting quota levels and to raise the cost of illegal immigration by making it unprofitable for employers to hire undocumented workers. That means getting E-verify to work and then tightening up the enforcement and penalties on employers who cheat. It will be interesting to see if the American public actually supports this once they see the results (no more cheap gardeners, no more cheap vegetables, etc.), but the basic idea is hardly impossible to implement.
So far, so good. Then Ryan Bonneville at The League of Ordinary Gentlemen threw a wet blanket on the border patrol bandwagon: 
As has been widely reported for several days now, Obama set a new deportation record in the last fiscal year (narrowly edging out the previous record, which also belonged to his administration). This is, no doubt, the latest in his myriad attempts to co-opt the right and burnish his bipartisan credentials heading into the upcoming election. ... 
Any time he moves to the right, they are going to move further to the right, and their base is going to move with them. There is nothing Obama can do to alter the political calculus here.
But Bonneville truly sounded a note of despair about Klein, Drum and what he calls the "feckless discourse" of Obama and his base on immigration: 
Obama's base is as feckless as he is, which is why he expresses no compunctions about the policy choices he makes. What do you say to Joe Klein when he claims that the "most basic fact" about illegal immigration is that it's "down"? That the real reason we don't need crocodiles patrolling the border has nothing at all to do with the number of people illegally crossing it? Drum isn't much better when his response is "I don't really have a big problem with beefing up the border patrol". Why not, Kevin? ... 
Instead of the fine, self-righteous rage I was working up about what a failure Obama's presidency has been, I'm left mostly with disappointment. I don't want to imply that there aren't any voices doing great work on this ([Adam] Serwer is one of them, most of the time), but more and more it's becoming clear that Obama is right about what liberals want, and I'm wrong. That's not infuriating; it's crushing.
(For those who are riveted by this, Drum defends his stance in a response post, which in turn elicited a response from Matt Yglesias.)
But still the fireworks were being generated by Republicans. On Thursday, Steven Benen at Political Animal expanded on the Times analysis of the Latino voter fallout:
A few weeks ago, Mitt Romney's campaign launched an attack ad, going after Rick Perry for a Texas policy that offers in-state tuition to children of undocumented immigrants. It was an ugly, borderline-racist commercial, intended to exploit right-wing animus towards Latino immigrants. I noted at the time that Romney appears to be hoping that these voters have short memories and will forget about his divisive antics by Election Day 2012.
Of course, the larger issue goes well beyond one obnoxious ad. Given the extent to which Republican presidential hopefuls are appealing to anti-immigrant voters, the Latino community isn't exactly being made to feel welcome in the GOP.
But it's clear Latino voters may not just run up against that problem with Republicans. Adam Serwer, who Bonneville praises, had this to say even before Tuesday's debate, on the cognitive dissonance of the administration's stance on "immigration removal:" 
In the twisted bizarro world of Washington politics, media conventions have obliged journalists to report with equal "balance" the Republican claim that Obama is pursuing a policy of "backdoor amnesty" even as he racks up more deportations than any president ever before. You'll hear something similar at the GOP debate tonight if the Republican candidates are asked what needs to be done about illegal immigrations. Perhaps the other candidates will compete with Herman Cain at imagining the most elaborate possible death trap that could be placed at the border to deter would-be migrants.
What you won't hear about, however, is the human cost to the families, citizen and non-citizen, impacted by the sheer volume and efficiency of the Obama administraton's immigration removal policy. Neither side is particularly interested in talking about that - Republicans because compassion for the undocumented is political suicide, and the administration because it's attempting a delicate balancing act between strict immigration enforcement policies and maintaining the approval of Latino voters who were hoping for more out of the Obama administration than record deportation numbers.
Some borders, it seems, can't be crossed.

HEADLINE: News Corp.'s Annual Shareholders Meeting

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: We live-blogged the annual News Corporation shareholders meeting. 

 BODY:
We live-blogged the annual News Corporation shareholders meeting. 
 It's always a raucous and unpredictable event. Our friends at the MediaDecoder blog have run down five things to watch for at the meeting.
2:45 P.M. | Meeting Is Closed
Mr. Murdoch closed the meeting after about 90 minutes, concluding a sometimes raucous gathering that focused intently on the phone hacking scandal. In some ways, it was a typical shareholder meeting, replete with seemingly random queries from investors. But Mr. Murdoch and other board members still faced a procession of investors who questioned the independence of News Corp.'s board and its handling of the hacking incidents, sometimes yielding testy responses from the media conglomerate's chief.
When results of the board elections are announced late Friday afternoon, they are likely to show all of the company's directors re-elected. But the Murdochs are likely to receive vote margins below 90 percent, indicating dissatisfaction within News Corp.'s independent shareholder base.
- 
2:23 P.M. | But What About the Animals?
An advocate for animal rights, Chris DeRose, took the floor, asking what News Corp. could do to help stem the practice of taking animals out of Australia and brought to the Middle East and other areas. "You're the one single individual" who can make a difference on the issue," Mr. DeRose said.
Mr. Murdoch responded that he'll look into the issue.
- 
2:02 P.M. | Viet Dinh Defends His Independence
Mr. Dinh faced questions about his status as an independent director, given his close ties to the Murdoch family; for instance, he is the godfather to one of the children of Lachlan Murdoch, Rupert's eldest son.
Mr. Dinh spoke up, recounting how he arrived to the United States as a refugee from Vietnam.He strongly denied that he was beholden to the Murdoch family and argued that he was more than qualified to serve as an independent director.
"I owe too much and I care too much to sacrifice my integrity for nothing," he said, garnering applause.
- 
1:55 P.M. | Shareholders Venting Frustration With Company Performan
The mood in the room quickly turned frosty as shareholders lined up at two microphones to push the company on governance and vent frustrations with the company's performance. A fiesty Mr. Murdoch, appearing frustrated and trying to move the agenda along, parried with several of them. "I hate to call you a liar, but I don't believe you," he said curtly to one shareholder speaker, Stephen Mayne, director of the Australian Shareholders Association, as Mr. Mayne talked about having an open mind on a proxy vote involving governance.
1:54 P.M. | Murdoch Say Phone Hacking Was Not in 'Thousands'
A shareholder asked a question about the "thousands" of people whose phones were hacked by journalists at The News of the World and how the board is conducting its inquiry into the matter.
Mr. Murdoch responded, "It's not thousands. I've not heard that figure before."
Joel Klein, the News Corp. executive tasked with leading the internal investigation, jumps in and says the company is conducting a thorough investigation. He added that "there is no official count" of how many people were hacked.
- 
1:39 P.M. | Church of England Calls for a Split
A representative for the Church of England began speaking up in favor of the resolution to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. Additionally, he said, the Murdoch family's voting power must be reduced so that it is more in line with its economic stake in the company.
Piqued by continued criticisms of News Corp.'s returns, Mr. Murdoch shot back to the Church of England representative, "Your returns haven't been great either."
- 
1:36 P.M. | Call for an Independent Chairman
During a discussion about a shareholder motion to institute an independent chairman at News Corp., Stephen Mayne, an Australian activist investor, spoke up in favor of the motion.
"It's time to get on the governance high road," Mr. Mayne said, adding that News Corp.'s returns have been unimpressive as of late. "You've treated us like mushrooms for a long time"
- 
1:16 P.M. | An Earlier Tweet From British Lawmaker
1:14 P.M. | Board Looks a Little Shell Shocked
Mr. Dinh has his hand covering his mouth, Mr. Knight is sitting with his arms crossed, Mr. Edington is looking down and Mr. Carey is staring into space. Mr. Murdoch looks rested and has color to his face. He appears a little feisty.
1:11 P.M. | More From Murdoch's Opening Remarks
"I'm personally determined to right whatever wrong has been committed and to ensure that it doesn't happen again anywhere in our company"
- 
1:09 P.M. | From Murdoch's Opening Remarks
"We cannot be just a profitable company. we must be a principled company."
"I think the closing of the News of the World was the right thing to do."
- 
1:08 P.M. | British Lawmaker Outside the Meeting
Tom Watson, the British lawmaker who has intensified pressure on News Corp., spoke to media as well. About the reports that he would be unveiling new things: "That's a slightly overcooked story there. I'm here because investors should be aware that the scandal has not gone away in the U.K."
"Their PR people would like you to think that they are through the worst of it," he said.
Mr. Watson, in Prada glasses and a purple tie, said he would not be meeting with any law enforcement or government officials during his trip to Los Angeles. He arrived Wednesday and will leave Saturday.
1:02 P.M. | A Blessing for News Corp.
On the dais from right to left - Rupert, Chase C., David DeVoe, Janet Nova, Viet Dinh, Rod Edington and Andrew Knight. There is also a priest here, Seamus Finn, who is a shareholder. Asked if he came here to give the company a blessing, Mr. Finn replied "definitely."
12:40 P.M. | Media Outnumber the Protesters
At 8:45 a.m. Pacific, news media and security outside 20th Century Fox's main gate on Pico Boulevard outnumbered protesters by two to one. About 20 people - at least one wearing an oversize Rupert Murdoch Halloween mask - carried pickets beneath studio billboards for Fox television shows like "Glee" and "House." (One example of a picket: "Lying is wrong.")
Across the street was the expected media circus, with CNBC prominently positioned on the corner and a line of satellite trucks and other camera crews clustered around. Also across the street, a line of about 20 uniformed LAPD officers stood shoulder to shoulder in a line as if to warn against mischief.
The increased security presence at the studio was noticeable: normally the gates are manned by a couple of guards; Friday morning there were a half dozen uniformed security guards peppered around the main Fox gate, with other guards stationed at smaller gates on side streets. Still, in some ways the scene was business as usual, with a parade of Fox employees dutifully driving their Priuses onto the lot to start anotherday.

HEADLINE: Obama Announces Troops to Come Home From Iraq by Year's End

BYLINE: AT WAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama announced that all American troops would be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of the year. 

 BODY:
President Obama announced that the United States has fulfilled its commitment in Iraq and will bring all American troops home by the end of the year. "As promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year," Mr. Obama said. 
The United States and Iraq had been negotiating whether the Obama administration would leave behind up to several thousand trainers after the end of the year, but had been at odds over whether the Iraqi government would grant legal immunity to American forces that remained.
Interactive Feature
Drawing Down, Moving Ahead
The end of the combat mission in Iraq will open a precarious new chapter in the Iraqi-American post-invasion relationship. 

        
Timeline: Major Events in the War
Iraq's political leaders announced earlier in October that they had agreed on the need to keep American military trainers in Iraq next year, but they declared that any remaining troops should not be granted immunity from Iraqi law, a point the United States has said would be a deal breaker. 
The announcement brings to an end America's more than eight-and-a-half years of combat in Iraq and comes as Mr. Obama moves ahead with plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2014. "Now, as we remove our last troops from Iraq, we'll beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan, where we'd begun a transition to Afghan security and leadership. When I took office, roughly 180,000 troops were deployed in both these wars. And by the end of this year that number will be cut in half."
When the official end of U.S. combat operations came to a close in August 2010, correspondents from The New York Times who covered the war in Iraq reflected on their time there. 
Sabrina Tavernise talked of the shift as a "Fragile Turning Point." Razzaq al-Saiedi reflected on the losses that both Iraqis and Americans have suffered in "Everybody's War." James Glanz visited a fallen colleague and friend. John Fisher Burns wrote about a watershed in history for the two countries, for the two peoples and for the wider world in "A Long-Awaited Day."

HEADLINE: Republican Plan Would Not Help Economy, Firm Projects

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Senate Republicans' proposed jobs package would not reduce unemployment or spur the economy's growth in the next year or two, according to a forecasting firm that predicted that President Obama's plan would achieve both goals. 

 BODY:
Senate Republicans' proposed jobs package would not reduce unemployment or spur the economy's growth in the next year or two, according to a leading economic forecasting firm that has predicted that President Obama's plan would achieve both goals.
And a central piece of the Republicans' plan - a balanced-budget amendment to the constitution - "would quickly destroy millions of jobs while creating enormous economic and social upheaval" if implemented soon, said Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis-based firm that has done work for the Federal Reserve. But an amendment and the required deep budget cuts are virtually impossible anytime soon; an amendment could take years to be ratified by enough states even if Congress were to approve the language this year.
Macroeconomic Advisers, in a seven-page analysis released on Friday, said comparing the plans of Republicans and Mr. Obama was like "asking us to compare apples to oranges." The Republicans' proposals would at best increase economic productivity in the long term, the firm said, but unlike Mr. Obama's measure "does not address the root cause of today's unemployment - namely, insufficient aggregate demand" caused by the fact that crisis-scarred consumers and businesses continue to keep a lid on their spending.
The economists' negative assessment of the Republican plan's immediate job-creation potential was just what Mr. Obama had predicted when he recently challenged Congressional Republican leaders to submit their package to Macroeconomic Advisers and to a second firm, Moody's Analytics, which also had forecast that Mr. Obama's package would increase employment and economic growth in 2012 and avert a double-dip recession.

Economic forecasts are projections based on complicated models, not certainties. Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that Mr. Obama's package of temporary payroll tax cuts, infrastructure spending and state aid to avoid layoffs of teachers and first-responders would add 1.3 million jobs next year and increase the gross domestic project by 1.3 percentage points. But Republicans have refused to bring the package to a vote in the House and blocked it in the Senate, forcing Democrats there to try to pass it piece by piece.
Besides the proposed constitutional amendment, the Senate Republicans' package calls for an overhaul of the income tax code, repeal of the laws Mr. Obama signed to expand health insurance and tighten regulation of the financial system, an expansion of oil and gas drilling and expedited procedures for free-trade agreements. 
"The long-run objectives of the plan are not without merit, but it is a reach to argue that quick enactment" of what the Republicans call The Jobs Through Growth Act "would significantly reduce the unemployment rate over the next year or two," the economic firm said.

HEADLINE: Housing Comments Echo Democrats Worries About Obama's Plans

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Dennis Cardoza's comments highlighted what Democrats perceive as a "lack of urgency" in the Obama administration and federal agencies' efforts to revive the housing market. 

 BODY:
With his rebuke Thursday of President Obama's handling of the housing crisis, Representative Dennis Cardoza of California joined an increasingly vocal chorus of House Democrats criticizing the president's efforts.
"I am dismayed by the administration's failure to understand and effectively address the current housing foreclosure crisis," Mr. Cardoza said. "Home foreclosures are destroying communities and crushing our economy, and the administration's inaction is infuriating."
On Friday, some Democrats expressed similar dissatisfaction with what they perceived as a "lack of urgency" in the Obama administration's and federal agencies' efforts to stimulate a listless housing market.
Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he understood Mr. Cardoza's frustration.
"In my opinion, this is a national economic crisis that has been inadequately addressed for too long, and strong, bipartisan efforts are urgently needed," he said.
Representative John Tierney, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the mortgage situation required immediate action to protect homeowners and the long-term health of the economy.
"The lack of urgency being shown by various agencies and the White House is hurting our economic recovery and unnecessarily putting families at risk to lose their home," he said. "If we do not address the housing/mortgage debt issue, we will not be able to fully tackle today's economic challenges."
Their comments came ahead of a report that the administration will release a plan next week to expand a two-year-old refinancing program for homeowners with government-supervised loans backed by the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
As early as Monday, officials will detail plans to expand access to the Home Affordable Mortgage Program, which helps borrowers refinance to lower interest rates, to some homeowners who owe more on their properties than they are worth, Reuters reported. Mr. Obama had proposed revising the program last month in his speech to a joint session of Congress.
Administration officials were unavailable Friday evening to comment on the record.
At the end of June, more than 838,000 borrowers had refinanced through the mortgage program, far fewer than the target 5 million that the White House estimated when the program created in March 2009. Officials have estimated that the pending proposal would help 600,000 additional borrowers, a figure lawmakers have said was too small.
In an Oct. 11 speech to mortgage bankers gathered in Chicago, Mr. Donovan said the number of homeowners that had already been helped by the program remained below one million and conceded the need "to pick up the pace." He said officials hoped to have a plan ready "in the next couple of weeks."
Mr. Cummings said the White House had not responded to an Oct. 7 letter he and others sent requesting a meeting with top housing officials to discuss the proposal. " How the administration responds to this request will determine my view of their efforts," he said.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico's Plan For Gas Pipeline Has Many Critics

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
PORTUGUES, P.R. -- It is his retirement refuge, a tiny house in the Central Mountain Chain, surrounded by banana and orange trees, coffee bushes and the melody of coqui frogs.
''I like the peace and tranquillity after so much time spent working and sacrificing,'' said Luis Rodriguez Cruz, 59, who bought his home, nestled in the center of the island, for $10,000 a few years ago, after a lifetime of factory work. ''We came here for peace. Now we have to worry whether this thing will explode next to our house.''
With that, Mr. Rodriguez pointed to the red markings on a cement curb near his property, denoting the path of a proposed $450 million natural gas pipeline that will cross the mountains here. The pipeline, which has provoked demonstrations on the island and widespread opposition over environmental and safety concerns, would run 92 miles from Penuelas in the south, across the mountains to the island's northern coast, then east to San Juan.
For Gov. Luis G. Fortuno, who has made the pipeline a centerpiece of his first term, the project represents one of the island's best attempts at revving up its flailing economy, by reducing stratospheric electricity costs. Puerto Ricans pay almost three times the national average for electricity, the result of a heavy reliance on imported oil. 
Puerto Rico depends on oil to generate 68 percent of its power (the United States mainland uses 1 percent); coal provides 15 percent and natural gas makes up 16 percent. Next year, the natural gas portion will rise to 30 percent, and if the pipeline is built it will increase each year until 2016, when it is expected to account for half of all energy production on the island.
''People are mad as hell about the cost of power,'' Governor Fortuno said in a recent interview. ''It dampens economic development, kills jobs and puts pressure on families.''
''The idea,'' said the governor, a Republican, who is seeking re-election next year, ''is to move away from our dependence on oil.''
But environmentalists and some community leaders and politicians view the pipeline, called Via Verde, or the Green Way, as unsound. They accuse the governor of trying to rush construction of the pipeline, which will be financed by the government.
The governor declared an energy ''emergency'' last year. In doing so, he was able to speed up approval by various Puerto Rican government agencies, which he said was necessary because of the dire economic situation.
The project was originally scheduled to be completed this December, but the government still needs one final permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction. And while the Puerto Rican government has held hearings and completed an impact study on the sensitive project, activists have asked federal agencies to take a more deliberative look at the fast-moving plan. Officials for the Corps say they are still working on a draft environmental assessment of the project. The Corps may then choose to hold public hearings or start a more rigorous impact study.
''All I can say is that it's extremely complex,'' said Nancy Sticht, a Corps of Engineers spokeswoman.
Critics of the project see the delay as a sign that their concerns are resonating.
''It's like building a gas pipeline in Illinois, and there have been no hearings and the governor has declared an energy emergency,'' said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois and a forceful critic of the project. ''It appears that our constant questioning and our constant demanding that they follow all of the rules have had the impact we wanted. That is, stop, hold on a minute, let's be a little more careful.''
Opponents of the pipeline, led by Casa Pueblo, an environmental group that once blocked mining projects in this area, say a pipeline cutting across mountains and running almost the full length of the tremor- and hurricane-prone tropical island is dangerous.
And they say it would be ecologically unsound, requiring the felling of 270,000 trees across 1,500 acres and potentially threatening 32 species of endangered plants and animals, as well as part of the country's water supply. To make way for the pipeline, the government also would have to buy out at least 90 property owners, including Mr. Rodriguez's son, who lives next door to him.
''The impact on the environment, on our rivers, on our communities is enormous,'' said Alexis Massol Gonzalez, the founder of Casa Pueblo. ''And there has been very little transparency about how this will be built, what the savings will be and how it will affect Puerto Rico.''
The governor was not helped by his early political missteps on the issue, which helped engender mistrust. In 2008, he campaigned against the natural gas pipeline that his opponent, Gov. Anibal S. Acevedo Vila, was putting in place, and called it the wrong approach. But soon after Mr. Fortuno won the election, he proposed his own, larger pipeline.
Then the project's first no-bid contract, worth $9.6 million, to design the pipeline was given to a company owned by an old friend of Mr. Fortuno's. The company had no experience in pipeline construction and immediately subcontracted the work to a firm in Texas.
The governor said he was unaware that the contract had gone to his friend until he read about it in the press.
Mr. Massol, the environmentalist, and others maintain that oil dependence is not the sole reason for sky-high electricity costs. They point out that some of the island's power plants are antiquated, for one, and that the government gives large electricity subsidies to municipal offices and buildings, churches and some corporations, which result in higher prices for other consumers.
''The people have to know,'' said Ignacio Veloz, president of United Retailers Association of Puerto Rico, which represents 8,000 businesses, some of which have seen their electric bills jump 30 percent in the past few months. ''What is the real cost of electricity?''
Critics say, all in all, the pipeline, which has been widely promoted by the government, is too risky a trade-off; they are pushing for renewable energy.
But the governor maintains the pipeline is crucial. EcoElectrica, the one company equipped to receive shipments of natural gas, convert it and send it into the pipeline, will begin sending 15 percent more gas to a neighboring plant through an existing mini-pipeline in April. To maximize the benefit, government officials say, the gas must flow along the 92-mile pipeline to stations in power-hungry San Juan. That way extra surges of gas can be sent when demand is highest. By the government's estimates, the pipeline would pay for itself in 18 months.
With the pipeline stalled, Governor Fortuno is taking more immediate measures. Last week, he announced that he would lower electricity costs by as much as 10 percent to 20 percent in November. The changes involve, in part, streamlining how the government buys oil and restructuring the government-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority's debt.
Fulfilling his campaign promise, the governor also said he was expediting renewable energy projects, like solar and wind, which he hopes will account for at least 15 percent of energy production in the coming years.
''I wish we could depend 100 percent on renewable energy,'' the governor said, adding that the technology was still too expensive. ''But natural gas is cleaner, safer and much cheaper than oil. It is a middle point.''

HEADLINE: Cries of Anti-Semitism, But Not at Zuccotti Park

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Among the hodgepodge of signs that have sprouted in Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan, one man in jeans and a baseball cap has been carrying placards that shout their suggestions: ''Google: Jewish Billionaires'' and ''Google: Zionists control Wall St.''
At the same time, among the sea of tarps under which protesters have been sleeping, a sukkah, a makeshift hut, was erected to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. 
The Occupy Wall Street protests, now in their second month, have increasingly been criticized by a variety of groups, most of them politically conservative, for flashes of anti-Semitism. Among those calling attention to the issue have been the Republican National Committee, Rush Limbaugh and the columnist William Kristol.
But the protests have also, on occasion, had a distinctly Jewish flavor: The encampment has coincided with the busy Jewish holiday season and has witnessed, in its midst or on its edges, a crowded Kol Nidre service on Yom Kippur, festive dancing with a scroll on Simchat Torah on Thursday night, and the sukkah.
The protesters, clustered together in a kind of ad hoc Athenian democracy in the canyons of Lower Manhattan, firmly deny that their demonstrations against corporate greed and the political power of banks exhibit antagonism that singles out Jews.
''You're going to get a few wackos,'' said Aaron Moses Miller, 25, a slender, unemployed man from Ridgewood, Queens, who had been in the park for 16 days. ''You can't help it in a population of this size.''
Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, said that he had not seen the man holding the anti-Semitic signs, but said: ''If I had seen him, I would have said something to him. My name is Aaron Moses Miller.''
Jeff Smith, 41, part of the press team for Occupy Wall Street, assailed those who he said ascribed the views of one sign-holder to the entire movement.
''To put someone out there to say, 'This is who the group is,' is about as dishonest as you can be,'' Mr. Smith, who is also Jewish, said. ''It's yellow journalism.''
And Marjorie Dove Kent, executive director of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, which has taken part in the protests, said that the movement had a diffuse leadership and that individual protesters had indicated their condemnation of the sign-carrying man by shouting him down.
But much as the Tea Party movement initially grappled with accusations of racism, Occupy Wall Street has been consistently confronted with accusations of anti-Semitism. Several conservative Web sites and television programs have shown video of the sign-holder, as well as of a woman at an allied demonstration in Los Angeles who identified herself as a public school teacher and decried ''Zionist Jews who are running the big banks and the Federal Reserve.''
These conservative critics have urged President Obama and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, to retract their expressions of support for the Wall Street protests.
''Democrats were quick to single out any instances of perceived extremism among Tea Party supporters,'' Sean Spicer, the communications director of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement on Tuesday. ''But with Occupy Wall Street, they turn a blind eye.''
An Oct. 13 article on the Web site of Commentary, a politically conservative magazine founded by the American Jewish Committee, though no longer affiliated with it, argued that ''it isn't just a few crackpots engaging in anti-Semitism.'' The article said that the ''main organizer behind the movement -- Adbusters editor Kalle Lasn -- has a history of anti-Jewish writing.''
Mr. Lasn did not return a message left on his Adbusters office voice mail in Vancouver, British Columbia. But Patrick Bruner, another member of the Occupy Wall Street press team, said the magazine Adbusters had helped prompt the protest movement with a call for action but otherwise had ''not been active at all.'' He said the Occupy Wall Street movement rejected any kind of racism or hatred, but also was ''open source,'' meaning that anyone could take part.
Jewish groups that have sensitive antennas for eruptions of bigotry have not criticized the protesters.
Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, urged the protest organizers to condemn any expressions of anti-Semitism, but said, ''There are manifestations in the movement of anti-Semitism, but they are not expressing or representing a larger view.'' He also pointed out that, according to his organization's periodic polls, roughly one in six Americans believed Jews had too much power in Wall Street and the American government.
''So it's not surprising that in a movement that deals with economic issues you're going to get bigots that believe in this stereotype,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''The movement is not about Jews; it's not about Israel. It's about 'the economy, stupid.' ''

HEADLINE: Humming To Higher Ed

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The season is upon us. Squirrels are collecting their winter nuts, the geese are flying off in formation, the hummingbirds headed south -- and how the heck do they do that, anyway? Also, the high school seniors are beginning their long college visitation treks, which appear to take longer and require even more effort than that hummingbird thing.
There are more than 2,000 four-year institutions of higher learning alone in the United States. How are you supposed to make a selection? 
I was always a proponent of the idea that it didn't really matter much where you went to school. This was based in part on the fact that I chose my own alma mater, Marquette, because it was the only university that sent a recruiter to my high school. The recruiter told us that Marquette was only for people who were ready to be treated like adults, and imagine my surprise on the first day when I discovered that the women couldn't leave the dorms in slacks unless they were going bowling.
But that was a long time ago, before picking a college was a science. Now coming up with a list of top choices is easy because you can log onto any number of find-your-college sites, put in your academic interests, your financial considerations, your geographical preferences and so on. Pretty soon you will get a batch of schools that meet your criteria.
Just for the heck of it, I went to the College Board site, tried to pretend I was 18 again, plugged in my data and discovered that I was meant to go to the University of Minnesota and nowhere else.
I should have been a Gopher.
But forget my path untaken. We've got a new crop of parents and kids out on the road, searching for the perfect road to intellectual growth. Or maybe not. There's a well-known study called ''Academically Adrift'' that followed 3,000 students on 29 campuses and determined that after two years, 45 percent showed no significant gain in learning -- and even after four years, 36 percent showed little change.
This is particularly frightening because the young men and women entering college have already spent their entire senior year of high school doing nothing but fretting over what college they're going to get into. I would rather not think that many of the most expensively educated brains in the country are already formed by their 17th birthday.
Wait, there's more: Besides learning less, today's students are borrowing more. This year, the total amount of outstanding student loans will pass the $1 trillion threshold for the first time. The Federal Reserve has reported that Americans now owe more on student loans than on credit cards.
While this all looks pretty depressing, I think it's important to consider the bright side. When it comes to spending money they don't have, Americans today apparently prefer to invest in History 101 and Conversational French rather than clothes, vacations and new kitchen appliances.
However, Richard Arun, the co-author of ''Academically Adrift,'' is not looking on the bright side at all. Particularly about the fact that his study found ''that 36 percent of the students are studying five or fewer hours a week and get a 3.16 grade average.''
Some 18-year-olds may be heartened by the idea that they can go to a good school, do almost nothing and still come home with a B. But Arun says this isn't going to cut it in the global economy. He compared the performance of the students he studied with a recent report on academic effort in European countries and discovered that when it comes to time spent on class work and homework, ''only the Slovak Republic would come after us in academic time.''
I don't think I can put a positive spin on beating the Slovak Republic.
Since Arun says the kids who never studied were more likely, two years out of college, to be living at home with their parents, it's clear that all mothers and fathers have a major interest in making sure their offspring are doing more reading than their competition in Bratislava.
Maybe the goal of the great college search should not be the most prestigious school, or even the school the prospective freshman falls in love with on the campus tour. Maybe everybody should be looking for the college that is most likely to maximize the amount of work the kids put in once they're out on their own.
If they ever are. ''Parents' concern should not end once they send the kid off in September,'' said Arun, who believes it's important to stay on the case, making sure your children are picking challenging courses and putting in major book time.
Once again, a parent's work is never done. So much easier if you'd been raising hummingbirds.

HEADLINE: U.S. and U.N. Demand Details From Libyan Leaders on How Qaddafi Died

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and RICK GLADSTONE; Kareem Fahim reported from Misurata, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva, James Kanter from Brussels, and J. David Goodman from New York.

 BODY:
MISURATA, Libya -- International calls mounted Friday for Libya's interim leaders to provide a fuller accounting of the final moments before Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's violent, messy death, as new videos circulated that showed him and his son Muatassim alive, apparently while in the custody of the former rebels.
The United Nations and two leading human rights groups called for a thorough investigation into precisely how Colonel Qaddafi, who was seen on the Internet in cellphone videos bleeding and heaving as he was manhandled by screaming fighters, wound up dead with what appeared to be bullet wounds to the head.
One video in particular was receiving heightened scrutiny on Friday because it showed a conscious Colonel Qaddafi wiping blood off the left side of his face, revealing no bullet wound. Later videos of his corpse showed a bullet wound in the same spot, adding to skepticism about the interim government's official explanation that he was accidentally killed during a shootout with Qaddafi loyalists. 
The United States, which along with other major Western powers heartily congratulated the Libyan people on Thursday as news of Colonel Qaddafi's death was announced, also said that Libya's post-Qaddafi leaders must furnish a detailed explanation of how he had died.
Officials with the interim government indicated that they would pursue an investigation, although senior military leaders in Misurata, where the bodies were taken, said they saw no need for one.
In Misurata, which harbors special antipathy toward Colonel Qaddafi because of his military's vicious assault here during the struggle to oust him, there appeared to be little concern about the manner of the deaths.
At an ad hoc viewing ceremony in a shopping center at the edge of town, giddy men and children lined up to see the colonel's body, lying on a mattress in a meat locker. All that seemed to matter was that he was gone.
''I felt joy,'' said Mustafa Ali, 37, who is unemployed, as he left the meat locker. ''How long have we been waiting for this? We have martyrs, and this is his penalty.''
As night fell, fireworks lighted up the city's skies.
The Transitional National Council, the shaky interim government in Tripoli, had said initially that Colonel Qaddafi would be buried on Friday in accordance with Islamic law, which generally requires a burial as soon as possible, but that the grave site had not been determined.
But Ali Tarhouni, the finance and oil minister, said the burial would be delayed pending an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Colonel Qaddafi's death and a decision about where to bury him. Officials gave no specifics about the timing or possible location.
Mahmoud Jibril, the interim prime minister, visiting the colonel's body in the meat locker, said the burial could take place in the next 48 hours.
The death of Colonel Qaddafi, who was found Thursday hiding in a drainpipe after two months on the run, was a moment of national catharsis in the country he had ruled for 42 years. The interim government said it would formally declare Libya's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the revolution to oust him began in February. Officials said Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, the chairman of the Transitional National Council, would make the proclamation.
Council officials have not said whether Colonel Qaddafi's son Muatassim was found dead or alive. But a new video circulated Friday showing the son, too, had been captured alive.
The video showed him sitting upright, smoking a cigarette and wearing a blood-stained shirt. Reporters and photographers who saw his body said it had wounds in the neck and chest.
The whereabouts of another Qaddafi son, Seif al-Islam, who had been reported captured or wounded on Thursday, were unknown, and there were rumors that he may have fled to Niger.
Navi Pillay, the top United Nations human rights official, formally requested an investigation into Colonel Qaddafi's death. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also urged the new Libyan authorities to investigate the killing.
Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington on Friday that Libya's interim government had ''pledged to provide a full accounting of what happened, what transpired leading up to his death. And we look to them to do that.''
The interim government has ignored calls by its allies for similar investigations before, quietly dropping an inquiry into the controversial killing of its top military official in July.
In Misurata, two senior security officials dismissed the need for an investigation, saying the interim government's explanation of what happened -- that the colonel and his son had died of injuries sustained on the battlefield -- was plausible enough.
Ibrahim el-Sharkasy, the head of the local security committee in Misurata, left open the possibility that Colonel Qaddafi had been executed but said it was more likely that he had been shot and killed during skirmishes. ''What investigation?'' he said, adding that that the military authorities did not investigate fights on the battlefield.
A senior official in the city's military intelligence service, Col. Ismail Shukri, said it was possible that Muatassim, despite appearing alert in the video, had died of internal bleeding. Another video, he said, showed Muatassim lying down with his hand across his face.
Colonel Shukri, who said he had questioned senior Qaddafi aides in recent days, said that Colonel Qaddafi had been in Surt, his birthplace, since Tripoli fell on Aug. 21, having traveled there in a convoy of about 25 cars. Once there, he moved from house to house. Colonel Shukri said that the ill-fated decision to flee the city in a convoy on Thursday had been made by Muatassim, who was directing military operations for the loyalist forces in Surt.
The plan had been to travel to a small town west of Surt, and then head south through the open desert.
''It was a desperate decision,'' the colonel said. ''It was a failed decision.''
NATO forces spotted the convoy before it had traveled two miles, and called in a French airstrike.
NATO said Friday that the strike had destroyed at least 11 of the vehicles, and had probably contributed to Colonel Qaddafi's capture. Anti-Qaddafi fighters arriving soon after the attack described a scene of mass destruction, with as many as 50 bodies scattered about and the charred remains of victims still sitting in the driver's seats of the destroyed vehicles.
At NATO headquarters in Brussels on Friday, the alliance's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said that it would seek to end operations in Libya on Oct. 31 but that a formal decision would be made early next week. For now, he told a news conference, NATO would ''monitor the situation and retain the capacity to respond to threats to civilians if needed.''
NATO has been conducting aerial assaults on Colonel Qaddafi's forces since March under a United Nations Security Council resolution to protect Libyan civilians. The assaults were widely credited with helping the rebels overthrow him.

HEADLINE: Gains at McDonald's Continue, But Menu Prices Could Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
McDonald's said Friday that its third-quarter net income rose by 9 percent as it kept defying a tough economy and attracting more customers. But those diners might want to get ready to pay more. 
McDonald's, the world's largest hamburger chain, has performed well throughout the recession and its aftermath. But it noted potential challenges like the rising cost of beef and higher labor costs, and hinted that it could raise menu prices for the third time this year.
''The economists say we are officially out of the recession, but it hardly feels that way,'' Jim Skinner, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. He referred to McDonald's gains as ''hard won'' victories.
The 9 percent rise in net income, to $1.51 billion, was McDonald's ninth consecutive quarter of earnings gains. Earnings per share of $1.45 beat analysts' expectations of $1.43. A 14 percent increase in revenue, to $7.17 billion, also beat the $7.02 billion predicted by analysts polled by FactSet.
McDonald's shares rose $3.31, or 3.7 percent, to close at $92.32.
McDonald's success has hinged on quickly adapting to customers' changing tastes and reshaping itself as a hip and more healthful place to eat. It has added menu items like smoothies and oatmeal, remodeled restaurants and converted more locations to 24-hour operations. All those moves, the company says, have brought in more customers.
The company's commodity costs in the United States spiked 8 percent this quarter compared with a year ago. That is higher than the second quarter's 6 percent and the first quarter's 1 percent increase.
The cost of beef, which normally declines at the end of the summer grilling season, stayed high, which McDonald's said it had not expected. The Department of Agriculture now predicts that consumers will end up paying 8 or 9 percent more for beef and veal in 2011 compared with 2010.
McDonald's has already raised prices to offset the higher ingredient costs, raising menu prices by an average of 1 percent in March and another 1.4 percent in May. The chief financial officer, Peter Bensen, said the company had experienced good ''flow through'' on the two price increases, meaning they had not driven away customers.
Grocery prices, which are increasing at a faster clip than restaurant prices, could also give McDonald's some room to raise prices because customers could view eating in as less of a value.
Beef was not the only expense to rise. McDonald's effective tax rate climbed because of some lower foreign tax credits. Labor costs rose, and the company invested in new restaurant openings in China, where it now has about 1,400 locations.
''Almost every category of costs is going in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Bensen said.
The store openings in China, where McDonald's hopes to have 2,000 locations by the end of 2013, signal its strategy to invest in emerging markets.

HEADLINE: Struggling Through A Fog Of Crises

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA LA ROCCO

 BODY:
In theory, art can and should address whatever the heck it feels like addressing, however it so chooses. Mandates about content and form are so 20th century.
In reality, the heart -- no fool -- quails upon reading program notes detailing ''a creative response to the current economic and environmental crises.'' There are worse things, the heart mutters darkly, than old-school mandates. 
One of these things is ''Haze,'' by the Beijing Dance Theater, which is performing for the first time in the United States as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival. There is nothing remotely next wave-ish about this insufferably decorous and unrelentingly safe 70-minute work. It is at times reminiscent, in broad strokes, of early modern-dance attempts earnestly to address sweeping societal ills.
But it is a dim reminder. In 1936 Martha Graham gave the world ''Chronicle''; that modernist call to arms can look heavy-handed today, but it still retains far more force and texture than the wan ''Haze.'' (Maybe the Beijing company, whose focus on socially relevant themes has incited controversy in China in the past, has stronger works up its sleeve.)
The work is choreographed by Wang Yuanyuan, who leads the Chinese troupe with the visual artists Tan Shaoyuan and Han Jiang. Mr. Tan is responsible for the set, the bulk of which is a spongy, fabric-covered expanse of flooring upon which the dancers tumbled, bounded, bounced and so on, to a by-the-numbers sound design by Liu Bo, featuring Gorecki and electronic music by Biosphere. Dressed in silvery gray leggings and, for the women, tops (designed by Zhong Jiani) and lighted by Mr. Han's theatrical, steam-enhanced design, the performers resembled nothing so much as a gymnastics team at the Art Olympics.
There were lots of artfully executed belly-flopping dives. (You know how silly Prince Siegfried looks leaping to his watery fate at the end of ''Swan Lake''? Imagine it replicated and in full view.) There were lots of meaningful stares into the rafters, hands clasped in supplication. There was lots of running up to the lip of the stage and balancing as if the fourth wall were a daunting precipice. There was a final ''all the dancers stand still and snow falls'' scene, which perhaps provided the cynical with fodder for a few jokes about cloud-seeding in China.
What there wasn't much of in this work, ostensibly focused on probing ''the relationship between the individual and society'' (more earnest program notes), was any sense of either an individual artistic voice or a coherent society, whether metaphorical or allegorical or what. The title ''Haze,'' in the end, was the work's best description: efficient, accurate, utterly without substance.
''Haze'' runs through Saturday at the BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; (718) 636-4100, bam.org.

HEADLINE: Seeing Limits Of 'New' War

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all its success, NATO's intervention in Libya had several significant flaws that highlight why future offensives, against a stronger adversary, could be far more difficult.
Even as Washington put a European mask of command on the operation -- an effort described as ''leading from behind'' -- shortages in allied intelligence-gathering aircraft, aerial refueling tankers and precision-guidance kits for bombs proved the United States remained the backbone of any NATO offensive.
To be fair, while the fighting has dragged on longer than anticipated, the death on Thursday of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, gave senior Obama administration officials an opportunity to trumpet the new American way of war to a nation weary of ground combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The United States military has spent just $1.1 billion in Libya, and in the words of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., ''didn't lose a single life.'' He added that ''this is more of the prescription for how to deal with the world as we go forward than it has been in the past.''
Libya proved that the leaders of some medium-size powers can be overthrown from a distance, without putting American boots on the ground, by using weapons fired from sea and air with the heaviest load carried by partner nations -- in the case of Libya, European allies and even some Arab states.
Now, that mission is winding down. NATO said Friday that it would cease operations in Libya on Oct. 31, exactly seven months after the alliance assumed full control of the campaign.
An axiom of the new warfare is that speed kills: Attacks must be carried out rapidly to recapture an old-fashioned element of surprise, with intelligence identifying targets even before an enemy has recoiled from previous ones.
Senior military officials noted that in Libya, NATO missions were under way just 10 days after the alliance decided to move forward -- compared to the 11 months it took to move from a United Nations resolution to the first airplane enforcing a no-fly zone over Kosovo in the 1990s.
''NATO works, and it can work at speed,'' said Adm. James G. Stavridis, the alliance's senior military commander. ''The difference is that 10 years of integrated operations in Afghanistan have created an alliance that can move quickly, can move with alacrity -- not without controversy, not without some nations moving faster and some moving slower and some saying we are not going to participate in this operation.''
But American and alliance officials acknowledged that a stinging critique, issued this summer by Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary at the time, still echoed. He warned of a two-tiered alliance in which some allies could fight, and some really could not.
''It takes every nation to bring what they can to the operation and then it's up to the nations to figure out how best to use what they bring,'' said Lt. Gen. Ralph J. Jodice II, a United States Air Force officer who commands the allied air campaign from his headquarters in Italy.
The shortages in the proper equipment, military skills and political commitment that Mr. Gates underscored are, indeed, considered a warning to the alliance. NATO does not have a roster of experienced officers to do its own targeting -- the essence of successful air warfare. Only the United States, Britain and France have targeteers up to modern standards.
With no troops on the ground to help spot targets, NATO planners and pilots had to improvise with other reconnaissance equipment and informants on the ground. Still, commanders acknowledged that they often could not pinpoint the shifting battle lines in hotly contested cities.
Shortages in intelligence-gathering aircraft -- both manned and remotely piloted -- also revealed a near United States monopoly on these technologies, although NATO is considering purchasing drones for itself.
For command bunkers in Tripoli as well as Colonel Qaddafi's final hide-out in Surt, NATO increasingly relied on American Predator drones that fly high overhead for hundreds of hours, chronicling the ''pattern of life'' below until allied commanders feel confident the site is a legitimate target. On Thursday, for instance, a Predator helped to guide a French warplane to attack Colonel Qaddafi's convoy as it tried to flee Surt. (NATO said Thursday it did not know Colonel Qaddafi was in the convoy then.)
Ditto with refueling tankers: The United States had to provide most refueling aircraft.
Likewise with the GPS packages, which turn gravity bombs into precision-guided weapons to hit their targets while minimizing civilian casualties. While alliance officers say no missions were delayed or canceled due to shortages of precision-guided munitions, there was a scramble to borrow from American and other stockpiles for NATO aircraft.
For the record, non-American alliance and partner aircraft flew 75 percent of all sorties of the war. And non-American alliance warships carried out 100 percent of the missions to enforce the arms embargo at sea.
But NATO will be able to add muscle to its military only by increasing its defense spending, now averaging 1.7 percent of gross domestic product across the 28-nation alliance. And that may be a difficult push as the United States, still the essential alliance member, cuts the Pentagon budget as part of a deficit-reduction deal with Congress.
For all the talk that no American combat troops were deployed in Libya, ground forces were required to topple the government. But they were Libyan rebel forces, and they required ample assistance and advising from outside powers.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Saturday about the NATO military operations in Libya referred imprecisely to the role of Lt. Gen. Ralph J. Jodice II, a United States Air Force officer who spoke of coordinating the actions of various allied forces. While he is the air commander of the operation, he is not the overall commander. (Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, a Canadian, heads all operations.)

HEADLINE: Running Out of Bandwidth

BYLINE: By LOWELL C. McADAM. 
Lowell C. McAdam is the chief executive of Verizon Communications.

 BODY:
AT a time of slow economic growth and declining competitiveness, wireless technology remains a shining example of innovation. In the last 10 years, wireless communications companies in the United States have invested hundreds of billions of dollars and unleashed a torrent of new products.
Demand for faster speeds and more applications is growing at a tremendous rate. But without prompt government action, the lifeblood of this innovative sector of the economy is at risk of being choked off. 
At issue is the allocation of wireless spectrum, the crucial ''real estate'' upon which wireless networks are built. A number of wireless companies -- large and small, urban and rural -- as well as companies like TV networks, cable companies and the government hold spectrum licenses, and have enough spectrum to meet today's consumer demand. But many other companies depend on spectrum, too: mobile device manufacturers, software and application designers and content creators -- all of which make products and services that require fast wireless networks that can connect them to consumers.
The Yankee Group, a research firm, estimates that by 2015 consumer use of wireless applications and services will be almost 60 times today's volume. And a recent analysis found that the nation's biggest wireless carriers controlled only about half of the spectrum available for wireless services.
Even with technological advances, a severe spectrum crunch looms over the next decade. Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has rightly pointed out that substantial amounts of new spectrum are needed to drive the continued growth of the wireless industry.
The Obama administration and the F.C.C. both support the allocation to wireless companies of 500 megahertz of additional spectrum within the next 10 years, effectively doubling the amount of available spectrum. But the challenge of identifying that spectrum and bringing it to market remains. Spectrum can't be created, only allocated. And reallocating spectrum is difficult, because those who control it are restricted in how they can use the spectrum and whether they can sell the spectrum rights to others.
A disproportionate amount of spectrum is allocated for older technologies or for applications that are declining in use, like broadcast television stations, while large swaths of spectrum are assigned to government agencies that may not be using it or using it efficiently.
We need to change the process for allocating spectrum and get it in the hands of those who can use it to generate economic growth. There are a number of bills being considered in both the House and the Senate that would enable the sale, auction or allocation of spectrum, and the so-called ''super committee,'' charged with finding $1.5 trillion in debt reduction over 10 years, is also looking at spectrum sales as a revenue generator.
First, Congress should give permission to the F.C.C. to hold voluntary ''incentive'' auctions, in which current spectrum holders who no longer need their spectrum can share a portion of the auction proceeds, which they are not currently allowed to do and which would encourage them to return unneeded spectrum. It should also require government agencies holding unneeded spectrum to make it available for auction. These auctions must be a priority, as it takes government an average of nine years to bring such spectrum to market.
Second, Congress should establish a fair and transparent auction process that is open to all bidders. In previous auctions, the F.C.C. has excluded potential participants and dictated aspects of a winning bidder's business plan. The auction process shouldn't be weighed down by such conditions.
Third, we must establish a truly streamlined approach for those who hold excess or dormant spectrum to sell to those who need it and can commercialize it. The current process can take more than a year for approval, and is often used to impose additional license conditions that are tantamount to backdoor regulation of the industry.
Finally, Congress must ensure that police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers have the spectrum they need, as well as a workable plan and resources for an interoperable nationwide broadband network for critical communications. The system remains as inadequate as it was on Sept. 11, 2001.
With these actions, Congress can generate tens of billions of dollars to cut the federal deficit, meet demand for wireless broadband and create a broadband public-safety network. We must not allow this opportunity to slip by.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Took Modernity To China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- In 1979, just when Americans were beginning to reflect on the ascent of Japan, the Harvard sociologist Ezra F. Vogel wrote his best-selling book, ''Japan as Number One: Lessons for America.''
Now 81 and retired from Harvard as a professor emeritus, Mr. Vogel has written an equally compelling study of the rise of another Asian superpower.
In ''Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China,'' he chronicles the life of China's paramount leader during the 1980s and '90s and his determined push to open up and modernize the world's most populated country.
''My book 'Japan as Number One' played a role in educating Americans about Japan,'' Mr. Vogel said during a recent interview at his home here, a few hundred yards from the Harvard campus. ''With this book, I thought I could write something new that would educate Americans about China.'' 
The book, published last month by Harvard University Press, has already been called a monumental biography of Deng and the most comprehensive survey to date of China's spectacular but rocky road to economic reform.
Some reviews, however, have accused Mr. Vogel of devoting too little space to Deng's iron-fisted rule, including his 1989 decision to allow the military to use deadly force against demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
But other scholars say that Mr. Vogel's new volume offers a deeply textured portrait of Deng and the reforms he championed.
''It's a major accomplishment,'' said David Shambaugh, a leading China scholar who teaches at George Washington University. ''This book pushes our knowledge of Deng further. And while much of this information is not necessarily new, this is the first time we've seen it all in one place, analyzed with scholarly detachment.''
Deng, of course, was one of the giant political figures of the 20th century and has been credited with setting China on a path that helped lift hundreds of millions out of poverty while reshaping global trade patterns. But only a handful of biographies have been written about the man, among them Richard Evans's 1993 ''Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China.''
Historians have largely focused on Mao, the revolutionary commander-philosopher who led the Communist takeover in 1949. But scholars have begun to conclude that it was Deng (1904-97), Mao's diminutive and long-suffering lieutenant, who deserves credit for truly reshaping China after Mao's death.
Few scholars were better positioned to write a biography of Deng than Mr. Vogel, who retired from teaching in 2000. For decades Mr. Vogel had studied China, Japan and the other dragons of East Asia. He traveled to Guangdong Province in southern China in 1987 and 1988, when China began opening its special economic zones to foreigners, to study the reforms. He had also covered some of this material in his groundbreaking 1969 book, ''Canton Under Communism,'' a study of Guangdong's capital in the time after the Communist takeover.
Mr. Vogel, who worked for a decade on this huge biography, spent a year brushing up on his Chinese-language skills with a tutor. (Most of his interviews were conducted in Chinese without an interpreter.) He talked to people close to Deng, including two of his daughters, as well as relatives and aides of Communist leaders like Chen Yun, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, who had worked with Deng.
He also talked to former Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who rarely grants interviews.
Mr. Vogel visited Deng's birthplace in Sichuan Province, as well as remote Jiangxi Province, where Deng was exiled during the Cultural Revolution; consulted all of Deng's official writings; and was given access to newly released documents from United States and Russian archives.
The result is an exhaustive, 876-page study of Deng's life that includes his multiple falls from power and his final comeback, when he assumed the top position in 1978; the book offers new details into how Deng pushed aside Mao's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng.
Mr. Vogel compresses the first 65 years of Deng's life into 30 pages, offering a sweeping overview of his journey from being the son of a small landlord in Sichuan to his transformation into a Communist revolutionary living in France and Russia, and then on to his role as military commander and, later, Mao's vice premier.
Deng loosened state controls over the lives of ordinary people, opened the door for Chinese to study overseas and, Mr. Vogel explains, he retreated from Maoist doctrine and Communism without ever really saying so. He lured foreign investors to China and tapped outside expertise to jump-start a largely moribund economy, setting the stage for China's three-decade-long economic boom.
Much of this happened, Mr. Vogel explains in minute detail, despite stiff opposition from Communist Party elders, some of whom feared the reforms were too aggressive, and others who viewed them as bourgeois liberalization.
Mr. Vogel also writes about Deng's darker periods, like his role in the ''antirightist campaign'' during the 1950s, which harshly targeted scientists and intellectuals and set the stage for the Great Leap Forward, which led to mass starvation.
And he makes clear that in June 1989 it was Deng who ordered the military action to end demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square, a course that led to the deaths of hundreds of people and incited international outrage.
The political scientist Richard Baum, a professor emeritus at University of California, Los Angeles, said the book offered an enormous amount of new material about Deng's leadership and internal power struggles in China during the '70s. But he also said that those achievements were mildly diminished by sections that read like ''an uncritical paean to Deng's character.''
Other critics have been harsher, saying some passages read as if they came from Communist Party headquarters.
During an interview Mr. Vogel defended his work. ''This is unfair, because in some places I'm very critical,'' he said, noting: ''A lot of Americans' view of Deng is so colored by Tiananmen Square. They think it was horrible. I have the same view. But it's the responsibility of a scholar to have an objective view.''
With this book, Mr. Vogel said he tried to put Deng's life in context, to show him as a survivor, obsessed with social and political stability and economic progress.
''Who in the 20th century had more influence on more people?'' he asked. ''He took 300 million people out of poverty. They'd been trying to do it in China for 150 years, and they couldn't. And he did it.''

HEADLINE: Markets Rally on Solid Corporate Profits

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied Friday after several large United States companies reported solid third-quarter earnings and as hope mounted that a weekend meeting would bring European leaders closer to easing the region's debt troubles. 
Shares of McDonald's rose 3 percent after the company reported a 9 percent increase in income. The results beat analysts' expectations and represented the ninth straight quarter of gains for McDonald's.
Shares in Harman International Industries, the maker of audio equipment, jumped 18 percent, the most in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, after the company's income far exceeded analysts' expectations.
The encouraging corporate news was in line with recent signs that the United States economy strengthened in September after a very weak summer. On Friday the government said unemployment fell last month in half of the states and was unchanged in 11. That's much better than August, when unemployment rose in 26 states.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 267 points, or 2.3 percent, to 11,808.79. The Dow is now up 2 percent from the start of 2011. Before the surge on Friday, it was down again for the year.
The S.& P. 500 added nearly 23 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,238.25. The Nasdaq composite index gained 39 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,637.46.
The stronger earnings, better economic news and a sense that European officials were taking the debt crisis more seriously have helped lift stocks, said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. ''It seems like there's a greater sense of urgency to deal with Greece and the sovereign debt trouble in Europe,'' he said.
Traders are monitoring Europe's efforts to solve the Greek debt crisis. Worries about a default by Greece have been behind much of the market's volatility in recent months.
European markets closed sharply higher as investors hoped that European leaders would agree on a package of measures to address the region's debt crisis in time for a summit meeting scheduled tentatively for Wednesday.
Traders had hoped for a plan to be forged at a meeting on Sunday. But talks between France and Germany this week have broken down repeatedly. European officials said on Thursday that there would be no deal before a second summit meeting next week. The two countries disagree about the size of losses that private banks should take on Greek debt that they own, among other issues.
Traders sold ultra-safe United States Treasury debt as riskier assets rose. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 8/32, to 99 7/32, and the yield rose to 2.22 percent, from 2.19 percent late Thursday. Bond yields rise as demand for them falls and their prices decline.
Stocks were lifted early in the week by modestly better news about the United States economy. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits declined this week. Housing construction picked up last month, at least for apartment buildings, and inflation remains low.

HEADLINE: A Risky Investment, Made Unwittingly

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
ALLEGATIONS of financial fraud have, unfortunately, become all too common in this economic downturn. But one of the latest seems worth particular note since it involves a former national chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, who pushed the group to adopt a policy that requires members to act in the best interests of their clients and to disclose any conflicts of interest.
Now, the former chairman, Mark F. Spangler, an investment adviser in Seattle, is being accused by the federal authorities of committing securities fraud when he put his clients' money into investments in private companies without their consent. In an affidavit to support a search warrant of Mr. Spangler's home, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent claimed that he also created false statements and failed to disclose that he had an interest in two of the companies in which he invested clients' money. One of those companies went out of business this year.
Here's a little background: The investments at issue are so-called private placements, meant for sophisticated investors who are aware that they could make a lot of money but also that they could lose it all. In this case, the F.B.I. estimated losses of at least $46 million out of the $106 million that Mr. Spangler managed. 
Ronald J. Friedman, the attorney representing Mr. Spangler, said his client had been cooperating with the federal investigation and had not been charged. He declined to give Mr. Spangler's version of what happened or make him available for comment. A court-appointed receiver has been named to try to recover whatever assets remain.
''We're at the front end of this,'' Mr. Friedman said. He added that the allegations had ''raised interesting questions about discretionary authority in accounts.''
All investors should ask how much they should trust their advisers. But for the wealthy, in particular, the case underlines the serious risks of investing in private placement deals. Whether they are set up to invest in real estate, private companies or particular types of securities, private placements are created to finance someone's enterprise. That enterprise is usually undervalued or poised for growth. But it should be a given that it may not play out as planned.
Susan John, the current national chairwoman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, said she served on the board with Mr. Spangler in the 1990s and had known him for 20 years. The organization says it prides itself on transparency.
''He was perhaps one of the strongest believers in standards for Napfa,'' she said. ''So it's very difficult for me to see how he could have evolved into the person that these allegations would lead you to believe he had become.''
She said Mr. Spangler did a series of presentations showing that returns in private placements were better than in public companies for his clients, many of whom had become wealthy from stock in Microsoft and Starbucks.
In the F.B.I. agent's affidavit, several of Mr. Spangler's clients said that he had shown them documents saying they were putting their money in funds that would invest in publicly traded securities, but their money was put into private companies.
Because these private placements carry the risk that all the principal will be lost, most advisers recommend them only for their wealthiest clients, whose financial lives will not be affected by the loss. Mr. Spangler's clients said in the affidavit that they told him they did not want to take any big risks with their money.
But even when clients agree to the risks, they need to look for red flags that the deal may not work or pay the returns they expect.
Perhaps the biggest one here was that Mr. Spangler was associated with the companies in which he invested clients' money. Clients said they were not told that he was on the board of TeraHop Networks, the company that went out of business, and Tamarac Inc., which provides software for financial advisers.
With any legitimate private placement, the person offering it will provide a memorandum that discloses how the company is structured and how the promoters of the deal are paid. The memorandum should also lay out how a person's money will be invested, what returns can be expected and what fees will be charged. Getting a lawyer or certified public accountant to read through this is crucial.
''You have to remember that the emphasis is on disclosure and disclosure only,'' said Gerald Townsend, a certified public accountant and president of Townsend Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. ''If they put on Page 1 that 'we're crooks and we're going to steal your money,' they've disclosed. If they have a good securities attorney, they're going to disclose things and hope you don't read them.''
Other red flags, Mr. Townsend said, are not knowing where the money you are investing is being held, who the auditor is, whether you are personally liable if the investment fails and if the sponsor has a track record.
The onus is on investors, though, to understand what they are agreeing to. According to the affidavit, Mr. Spangler had some clients sign agreements that allowed him to change how their money would be invested. In particular, Mr. Spangler added a section in the revised document called ''Illiquidity of Investments,'' which stated that some of these investments might have to be made for a longer period of time to be profitable.
''It goes back to understanding what you're signing,'' said Elaine Scoggins, a director at Merriman, an investment advisory in Seattle. ''Ask a lot of questions if you don't understand. There's always the option of getting a second opinion.''
For people who lose money in private placements, there is little good news. The recovery process will be slow and there is no guarantee on how much an investor will get back.
Kent L. Johnson, a venture capitalist who is president of KLJ Consulting, is the court-appointed receiver for the Spangler Group. He said nearly all of the assets that had not been lost were invested in various private companies, and it could take up to three years to unwind those investments.
He said he hoped to recover about 50 percent of the $68 million that he estimated remained, at least on paper. That would then be distributed to the 80 investors on a pro rata basis.
''It's just going to take some time to allow those companies to mature and maximize their value,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''If you try to liquidate them too early it wouldn't be worth as much.''
As painful as this wait will be for Spangler investors, this is an average length of time and a decent rate of recovery. Robert P. Gray, partner in the forensic litigation group at ParenteBeard, an accounting and advisory firm, said investors with the best chance of recovering money were the ones who had kept detailed records -- assuming those records were not fabricated.
''When the wheels come off the car, it's going to be a lot more difficult to go out and get the documentation and figure out what you can go after,'' he said.
In these cases, a good lawyer can also help you find out if there are other assets to go after, said Stan Twardy, a partner at Day Pitney and a former United States attorney for Connecticut. ''Were there other people out there? Were there aiders and abettors? Is there insurance out there?'' Mr. Twardy asked. ''That's where a good lawyer could make sure all potential pockets are explored.''
Chances are those pockets are not going to be as deep as investors hope.

HEADLINE: The End of Cheap Chinese Goods

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
The great Chinese-led deflation in goods prices may have come to an end.
Beginning in the 1990s, the emergence of China as a major exporter first depressed and then held down the prices of many goods, helping to improve living standards in the United States. But recently, prices have begun to rise.
The change can be seen clearly in the accompanying charts showing the Consumer Price Index for apparel. Because prices can be volatile, they use three-month moving averages to smooth the trends. 
The chart above shows how prices have moved over the last two decades, from the end of 1991 through the September figures released this week. Prices are still well below where they were in 1991, a performance that no one would have expected at the time. Over the previous two decades, beginning in 1971, that index doubled.
But in the last few months, the index has begun to rise at the fastest rate in many years. This spring, prices were still about 9 percent lower than in late 1991. Now the prices are just 5 percent below the level of two decades ago.
A second chart shows the 12-month change in the index. It is now up to 3.6 percent, the highest since 1992. Over the last six months, the three-month average has risen at an annual rate of 7.6 percent.
Prices for apparel were broadly steady for most of the 1990s, before beginning a sharp descent in 1998 that continued until 2003. Much of the decline was because of imports from China, which forced down prices and allowed Chinese suppliers to supplant companies from many other countries. The declines continued at a slower pace for several more years, but prices now appear to have hit bottom in 2007.
When Chinese trade was helping to push down prices for many things, the reported low figures for inflation gave optimistic central bankers a reason to think that there was no need to slow rapid growth in the United States.
The continued monetary stimulus helped push unemployment rates down to the levels of the late 1950s. The underlying assumption was that technological innovations had produced a new economy that could boom without inflation.
The alternative explanation was that a substantial part of the reported low inflation came from imports of Asian, primarily Chinese, products, and that that effect was bound to be temporary. At some point, trade imbalances would become unsustainable and the inflation picture would reverse, as either the dollar lost value or costs began to rise in Asia.
That is what appears to have happened. Labor costs are rising in China. Some business is going to other countries, where wage rates are lower than in China. And some product prices are rising.
The excessively easy monetary policy helped lead to bubbles in the American economy, first in technology stocks and then, much more damaging, in housing. There was substantial inflation, even when import prices were falling, but it was in other parts of the economy.
The third chart shows the United States balance of payments -- largely determined by the trade surplus or deficit -- as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product. From a rough balance two decades ago, it deteriorated to a deficit of more than 6 percent of G.D.P. in 2006, before the economy began to stumble.
If the era of Chinese-led deflation has ended, the implications may be unfortunate for consumers, as the price of necessities rises even as the American economy continues to struggle along in a slow recovery from the recession of 2007 to 2009.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Protest Isn't Like Ours, Tea Party Says

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE; Anne Barnard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
At a Republican candidate forum outside Fort Worth last week, a Tea Party activist turned Senate candidate proclaimed the Occupy Wall Street protesters ''unemployed, uneducated and uninformed.'' To which the conservative radio host moderating the panel added, mirthfully, ''This is the first occupation many of these people have seen in years.''
More and more commentators -- as well as President Obama -- have likened the Occupy forces spreading across the country to the Tea Party movement. But as they have, conservatives and Tea Party activists have rushed to discredit the comparison and the nascent movement. They have portrayed the Occupy protesters as messy, indolent, drug-addled and anti-Semitic, circulated a photo of one of them defecating on a police car, and generally intimated that Democrats who embrace them are on a headlong road to Chicago 1968.
It is a culture war, young versus old, left versus right, communal food tables versus ''Don't Tread on Me'' flags. 
In fact, the two movements do share key traits. They emerged out of nowhere but quickly became potent political forces, driven by anxiety about the economy, a belief that big institutions favor the reckless over the hard-working, grievances that are inchoate and even contradictory, and an insistence that they are ''leaderless.'' ''End the Fed'' signs -- and even some of those yellow Gadsden flags -- have found a place at Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street protests alike.
Where they differ is in where they place the blame. While Occupy forces find fault in the banks and super-rich, the Tea Party movement blames the government for the economic calamity brought on by the mortgage crisis, and sees the wealthy as job creators who will lift the country out of its economic malaise. To them, the solution is less regulation of banks, not more.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey declared Monday, ''If you told the Occupy Wall Street people and the Tea Party people that they are the same, they would hit you.''
Not quite. But Tea Party activists are indeed fighting the comparisons.
''They seem to be more in favor of anarchy than they are in favor of working out problems through the Constitution,'' Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said about the Occupy forces.
''We have worked very hard to be respectful of the laws,'' she said in an interview. ''We protest and complain, but we're also trying to work within the system. It's frustrating to watch people who have an utter lack of respect for our form of government.''
Tea Party Patriots issued a statement last week titled, ''Occupy Wall Street? They're No Tea Partiers.'' Tea Party supporters, it argued, were the ones who ''have stood firmly on principle.''
''They believe freedom from government allows entrepreneurs to try new things, see what works and discard what doesn't,'' it continued. ''They don't believe corporations are inherently evil, or that bankers should be beheaded.''
By contrast, it portrayed Occupy protesters as freeloaders, or would-be freeloaders: ''Those occupying Wall Street and other cities, when they are intelligible, want less of what made America great and more of what is damaging to America: a bigger more powerful government to come in and take care of them so they don't have to work like the rest of us who pay our bills.''
Certainly one reason that conservatives do not like the comparison is that Democrats and unions have eyed the Occupy movement as a vehicle for energizing the left in the 2012 elections.
On Tuesday, President Obama, the man Tea Partiers love to loathe, made the link, telling ABC News that the Occupy protests are ''not that different from some of the protests we saw coming from the Tea Party.''
''Both on the left and the right I think that people feel separated from their government,'' he said. ''They feel their institutions aren't looking out for them.''
Conservative media outlets have accused the ''mainstream media'' of paying the Occupy movement too much attention, but have themselves covered it extensively -- mostly to argue that it is made up of sloppy, angry socialists.
The Daily Caller jubilantly noted Monday that the Nazi Party of America had endorsed the Occupy movement. Big Journalism, another conservative Web site, published a collection of photographs showing defaced flags and cars at Occupy protests, as well as signs urging an end to aid to Israel, which the Web site used to argue the anti-Semitism of the new movement.
There is a through-the-looking glass element to some of the criticism. The Daily Caller reported that based on photographs, the Occupy forces were almost exclusively white (numerous studies and polls have shown the Tea Party, too, has proportionately few members of minority groups).
The Tea Party, too, was vague about its frustrations in its early days, or contradictory, as in the sign at one rally that was cited as evidence that the Tea Party itself was uneducated and uninformed: ''Keep Your Government Hands Off My Medicare.''
At Tea Party protests you could find the kind of one-off cranks that conservatives have found at Occupy rallies -- Tea Party organizers would explain them as fringe-y interlopers. (Those Obama-as-Hitler posters, they noted, were the work of Lyndon LaRouche supporters, not Tea Party activists.)
And similarly, conservative criticism of Occupy protests has not always held up. Lu Busse, a Tea Party leader in Colorado, claimed on Facebook that two Occupy Denver protesters died from heroin overdoses last week. In fact, city officials said, there had been no overdose deaths in Denver all month.
Some Occupy demonstrators seemed more willing to express some commonality with -- and even some admiration for -- the Tea Party.
Lin Wefel, an Occupy supporter at Zuccotti Park, where the protests began, said she had attended a Tea Party event in Pennsylvania and thought the missions of the two movements coincided ''80 percent.''
''They want jobs, fair wages, get the money out of the system -- the same things we want,'' she said.
Kate Linker, another protester, said that while the two movements agreed that the system was not working, they disagreed on how it should work. She, for instance, was soliciting signatures for petitions to renew the New York State millionaires tax and establish one federally -- not a cause most Tea Party activists are likely to support.
Still, she said, Occupy does aspire to have as strong an impact on the national discussion as the Tea Party has had.
So far, most Americans do not align with either movement. In a USA Today/Gallup poll taken last weekend, 26 percent of those polled said they were supporters of the Occupy movement, while 19 percent identified as opponents, and 52 percent said they neither supported nor opposed it. Meanwhile, 22 percent said they were supporters of the Tea Party, 27 percent said they were opponents, and 47 percent said they were neither.
But the large majority -- 63 percent -- said they did not know enough about the Occupy goals to say whether they approved or disapproved. In the early days of the Tea Party movement, a similarly large percentage did not know much about it.
Conservatives are trying to define the Occupy protesters before the protesters define themselves.
Ed Morrissey, writing in The Week, insisted that the Occupy movement wants ''seizures and redistributions, which necessarily means more bureaucracies, higher spending, and many more opportunities for collusion between authorities and moneyed interests in one way or another.''
Still, he acknowledged that it resembled the Tea Party movement in some respects.
Ms. Martin, of Tea Party Patriots, said the next year would determine whether more Americans agree with the Occupy forces or the Tea Party.
''That's what the whole election comes down to,'' she said, ''what direction do we think America's going to go in, and what's the proper size and scope of government.''

HEADLINE: Occupy-apalooza Strikes a Chord

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
Thursday night I spoke to a young woman in Brooklyn who was having dinner and planning the next day. Between a morning boot camp workout at the local Y.M.C.A. and an evening meeting with friends for drinks, she was planning her first trek to Zuccotti Park to take part in the Occupy Wall Street protests.
''Why?'' I asked. ''What specifically are you protesting?'' I was curious. I hoped that she'd respond with some variation of the umbrella arguments about income inequality, the evils of corporate greed and corruption or removing corporate money from politics. 
She didn't. ''I don't know. It's just cool,'' she said. She went on to tell me about how she felt that this was a movement of people with whom she felt some kinship, banding together and making history, and that she wanted to be a part of that in the same way that people from previous generations were part of the civil rights, women's liberation and antiwar movements.
She hinted at inequality but never quite got there. Yet she was passionately convinced that she must get involved. That is part of the magic and mystery of these protests: a near magnetic attraction drawing in both the hard core and the hangers-on alike.
While there are some people with very specific goals taking part in the protests and supporting them, there are many others who come with no particular, refined mission or message other than a desire to show solidarity, to rise up and be seen and heard and to display their disaffection for the status quo.
And that may well be message enough for many.
If the Occupy Wall Street protests were a band, I'd say the closest corollary would probably be the legendary '90s grunge band Nirvana -- both meaningful and murky, tapping into a national angst and hopelessness, providing a much-needed catharsis and gaining a broad and devoted following while quickly becoming the voice of a generation.
Needless to say, that doesn't cover everyone. The protests have a Lollapalooza-like eccentricity and diversity to the crowds. Some come to revel in the moment. Others come to rage against the machine. But they are all drawn together by the excitement of animating a muscle that many thought had atrophied: demonstration and disobedience in the name of equality.
This has energized two groups who are notoriously apathetic and lacking in civic engagement -- the young and the poor -- and has done so outside the existing architectures of power and politics.
This excitement has attracted the attention of progressive politicians, pundits and celebrities, many of whom are making pilgrimages to the protests to lend support while reinforcing their own street cred and pondering how to best harness the energy on display.
After all, civic energy is a precious commodity in an election season. You can almost see some leaders and luminaries drooling at the thought of using the protests to their political advantage.
But there has been an even stronger reaction by some on the right, who, out of fear, are seeking to pre-emptively stain and marginalize the protesters.
Herman Cain has called them ''jealous.'' Bill O'Reilly has suggested that they are ''crackheads.'' Glenn Beck -- I guess in an attempt to be king of the hill of hysteria -- has gone so far as to call them killers: ''Capitalists, if you think that you can play footsies with these people, you're wrong. They will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you.''
The irony is that all these people are at the top of the food chain in an economic ecosystem that many protesters seem to view as fundamentally flawed and in need of radical realignment if not wholesale deconstruction.
So the protesters have defied efforts to be led or labeled by either side. This independent positioning may be serving them well.
Early national polls taken about the movement have found that although many Americans aren't clear about the protesters' goals, they support them.
A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last weekend found that nearly two-thirds of people who were asked didn't know enough about the goals of the Occupy Wall Street protests to say if they approved of them or not.
Yet a United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, also conducted last weekend, asked if people agreed with the goals of the protests from what they ''know about the demonstrations.'' Fifty-nine percent said that they agreed.
That may well be because even if there isn't a single, clear message of the protests that people identify with, it seems as if they do agree with many of the disparate ideas being put forward. A Time Magazine/Abt SRBI poll conducted last week found that among those familiar with the protests, 86 percent of respondents believed that ''Wall Street and lobbyists have too much influence in Washington''; 79 percent believed that ''the gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S. is too large''; 71 percent believed that ''executives of financial institutions responsible for the financial meltdown in 2008 should be prosecuted''; and 68 percent believed that ''the rich should pay more in taxes.''
Closer to the epicenter, the mission is clearer and public support even stronger. A Quinnipiac poll of New York City voters released this week found that nearly three-quarters said that they understood the protesters' views at least fairly well, two-thirds said that they agreed with those views, nearly 9 in 10 said that it was O.K. ''that they are protesting'' and nearly three-quarters said that as long as the protesters obey the laws that they should be able to remain as long as they wish.
The Occupy Wall Street protests may or may not grow into a political force pursuing a specific legislative agenda through normal systems, but there can be little doubt at this point that the protests have struck a chord with a large swath of Americans.
If nothing else, the movement has established itself as a cultural phenomenon with surprising staying power, and as someone who wasn't sure that it would catch hold, I must echo the young woman in the restaurant: that's just cool.

HEADLINE: China Charges Protectionism In Call for Solar Panel Tariffs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese government Friday condemned a demand by the American solar panel industry for steep tariffs on solar panels shipped to the United States from China.
China accused the American industry of protectionism that could undermine the global economy and harm international efforts to combat global warming. It called for the United States government to reject the industry's legal filing.
In a carefully worded statement, the Chinese commerce ministry suggested that if the American government imposed import tariffs on Chinese solar panels, then China would purchase less American factory equipment and raw materials for making solar panels. 
But the statement did not specify whether American exports would suffer because of deliberate retaliation by the Chinese government, or simply because Chinese companies would have less need for the equipment and raw materials if the United States market were to be partly or completely closed to them.
Either way, ''the result is a lose-lose situation, and this will cause an adverse impact on the bilateral trade interests of the two countries,'' the statement said.
A coalition of seven American companies filed the trade case against China on Wednesday. They accused Chinese manufacturers of obtaining billions of dollars in Chinese government subsidies to help them buy market share in the United States, and of dumping solar panels in the United States at prices that did not fully cover the cost of manufacturing and distributing them.
Their petition to the Commerce Department in Washington and a related federal agency, the International Trade Commission, seeks tariffs ''well in excess of 100 percent'' to offset dumping, plus additional unspecified tariffs to offset the suspected subsidies.
The coalition responded quickly to the Chinese criticism. ''The Chinese government's claims that our actions are improper and protectionist, and that its illegal subsidies and massive dumping of solar product are helping the global economy and the environment, are absurd,'' said Gordon Brinser, the chief executive of SolarWorld Industries America, the lead company in the coalition. ''China is one of the biggest trade protectionists in the world. In the solar industry, China is gutting manufacturing and jobs here in America and abroad while China's solar industry pollutes its own people. The accusations have no basis in fact.''
The United States government has 20 days from the filing of the petition to decide whether to take the case, but the law gives it little discretion to reject it. A preliminary ruling is likely by March on the subsidies claim and by May on the dumping claim.
The Commerce Department and the I.T.C. must use narrow criteria set by Congress that give little discretion to either agency except on the question of whether a domestic industry has suffered significant injury from imports. The American solar panel industry has been laying off thousands of workers and closing factories. If the agencies pursue the case, final rulings could take six months or longer.
The Chinese ministry's statement barely addressed the substance of the industry's complaint, mentioning only in passing that Chinese policies were ''in line with World Trade Organization rules.''
The ministry also made a clear plea for environmentalists to take its side.
''The development of the solar energy industry is a key measure of the Chinese government to address the challenges of climate change and energy security,'' the statement said. ''The United States has no reason to criticize other countries' efforts to try to improve humanity's environment -- rather, it should join together with other countries to strengthen cooperation in the field of solar energy, and join together to face the challenges of climate change and the environment.''
So far, environmental groups in the United States have said little publicly in response to the solar panel trade case. Many environmental groups have advocated the creation of a strong American clean energy industry, which could improve the odds that Congress will continue to approve subsidies for alternative energy.
But many environmentalists also advocate the widest possible installation of solar panels as an alternative to burning fossil fuels. And toward that end, Chinese manufacturers have helped drive down the wholesale price of solar panels from $3.30 a watt in late 2008 to $1 to $1.20 a watt now.
The Chinese statement highlighted a study completed in August for an American trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, whose members include Chinese companies. The study calculated that the United States imported $1.4 billion worth of solar panels and other solar products from China last year, but exported solar factory equipment and raw materials valued at $1.69 billion to $1.98 billion to China.
But SolarWorld Industries America, the lead company in the trade filing against China, has pointed out that shipments of Chinese solar panels to the United States surged to $1.6 billion in the first eight months of this year. Meanwhile, American exports of factory equipment and raw materials have weakened as investment in Chinese factories has started to slow and as China has built its own industries to make these products.
Chinese companies are not the only ones unhappy about the American solar panel manufacturers' case. Many American installers of solar panels are hostile. Mike Hall, the chief executive of Borrego Solar, a solar project developer based in Oakland, Calif., said, ''One-hundred percent tariffs would have a massive effect, and the market in the U.S. would screech to a halt.''
World Trade Organization rules strictly ban the use of subsidies by a government to aid its export industries. W.T.O. rules also allow antidumping cases to be pursued within member countries, but do not encourage them.

HEADLINE: End Date for Iraq

 BODY:
President Obama's announcement on Friday that the last American soldier will leave Iraq by year's end signals a welcome end to a war that was started under false pretenses and went on far too long -- killing more than 4,400 Americans and many more thousands of Iraqis and costing $1 trillion over nearly nine years. 
When Mr. Obama took office, there were about 142,000 Americans fighting in Iraq. The president deserves credit for fulfilling his campaign promise to bring the conflict to a close.
Mr. Obama had wanted to leave several thousand troops behind, for a while longer, to keep training Iraqi forces and to help Iraq's democratically elected but deeply flawed government maintain security. But the Iraqis couldn't make up their minds, and the debate in Baghdad was growing increasingly bitter. With a Dec. 31 deadline for a full withdrawal -- negotiated by President George W. Bush -- approaching, Mr. Obama decided the best thing to do was to bring all the troops home. There is still talk between Iraqis and Americans about an ongoing military relationship and future negotiations that could continue Iraqi training in Kuwait, the United States or under NATO auspices.
We share concerns about Iran's growing influence, continued high levels of violence and doubts about the ability of Iraq's army and police. Those were reasons to keep a small military force there, with a carefully drawn mission, but only if Iraq agreed.
The problem was that even Iraqi officials who favored the United States and understand their country's vulnerabilities want the Americans gone. When Iraqi officials refused a demand from the United States to continue granting immunity from legal prosecution to American soldiers, there was no way the Pentagon could accept that.
The announcement triggered some foolish criticism from neo-conservatives -- who remain shamefully unapologetic for their role in unleashing this war -- accused Mr. Obama of abandoning Iraq now. Mitt Romney, a Republican presidential candidate, said Mr. Obama ''unnecessarily put at risk'' hard-won victories. Like most of what Mr. Romney says about national security, that was absurd. Would he have Washington ignore the desires of Iraq's democratic government and stay in Iraq forever?
Oil-producing Iraq is a major regional actor. The United States, which has an embassy with thousands of employees in Baghdad, must remain actively engaged diplomatically, through development and economic cooperation. But Iraq will be in the hands of Iraqis, as it should be.

HEADLINE: Senate, at Least for a Day, Gets Back to Legislating

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As if compensating for months of inaction, the Senate kicked into gear around midnight Thursday and kept working early Friday as it shelved another piece of President Obama's economic agenda and, in a bold experiment, tried using traditional legislative give-and-take to move a spending bill for half a dozen cabinet departments.
The pace of what is known on Capitol Hill as regular order was glacial, but senators marveled at the fact that they were debating the merits of legislation and voting on amendments, rather than being frozen in ideological igloos. 
''We have worked long and hard this whole week trying to move forward on appropriations bills,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. ''It has been difficult, and one reason it has been difficult is this is kind of a new area we are working in -- that is, legislating.''
Mr. Reid called it ''a noble experiment.'' Instead of trying to block or limit Republican proposals, he allowed the Senate to work its will on dozens of amendments to a bill providing money for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, State, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development -- a bill for the fiscal year that began three weeks ago.
Leaving the Capitol on Friday, Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said: ''We had an opportunity to have lots of amendments. That's a good thing.'' But he added, ''We need to figure out how to get ourselves organized so we are not casting votes at 1:30 a.m.''
The amendments dealt with a dizzying array of issues: detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, food stamps, federal payments to wealthy farmers and slumlords, the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, disaster relief for upstate New York and many more.
The Senate convened at 10 a.m. on Thursday and held 17 roll-call votes before adjourning at 2:26 a.m. on Friday. The cooperation on money bills contrasted with continued gridlock over jobs legislation.
For the second time in two weeks, Senate Democrats failed to muster the 60 votes needed to take up a bill championed by President Obama as a way to create jobs and revive the economy. Neither measure received a single Republican vote.
Republicans described the whole exercise as a political charade, and said the federal government did not have the money to ''bail out'' cities and states. ''The Democrats' bill would raise taxes on the private sector to pay for new spending on the public sector,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota.
Undeterred, Mr. Reid said he would try again. When the Senate returns on Oct. 31 from a weeklong recess, he said, he will offer a bill to spend $50 billion on highways, bridges, railroads, airports and other transportation projects. The bill -- a component of Mr. Obama's $447 billion jobs package -- would also provide $10 billion in loans and loan guarantees for transportation projects, water and sewer systems and other infrastructure.
Democrats said the bill would put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job. Of the 14 million people who are unemployed, more than one million are in the construction industry, the Labor Department says.
To offset the cost, Senate Democrats would impose a surtax of 0.7 percent, starting in 2013, on income in excess of $1 million.
The House next week will take up two bills that Republicans said would create jobs. One would clear the way for development of a large copper mine in an area of Arizona with high unemployment. The other would repeal a requirement for withholding of taxes from payments to government contractors.
Senators did not finish work on the 2012 spending bill, but did agree to limit debate, so they can vote on passage of the measure when they return. It is unclear whether the Senate and the House can work out their differences before Nov. 18, when a stopgap spending bill expires.
The Senate rejected an amendment by Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, that would prevent the Justice Department from prosecuting certain members of Al Qaeda in civilian federal courts.
''These individuals, enemy combatants, are not common criminals who just robbed a liquor store,'' Ms. Ayotte said. ''When we detain a member of Al Qaeda who is planning an attack on our country, the priority has to be on gathering information to protect Americans. We should not be trying these individuals in our civilian system but in military commissions.''
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said federal officials should be free to use civilian courts or military commissions, whichever seemed more appropriate in a particular case.
The Senate also rejected a proposal by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, to cut off federal payments to ''greedy slumlords'' whose properties were in poor physical condition or had life-threatening deficiencies.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said Mr. Coburn had raised a valid concern. But, she said, ''This goes too far.''
''This amendment puts the tenants at risk,'' she said. ''It will put the tenants out of a place to live.''

HEADLINE: Last U.S. Soldiers To Exit From Iraq In 2011, Obama Says

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, Michael S. Schmidt from Baghdad, and Elisabeth Bumiller en route to Indonesia.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama announced on Friday that the last American soldier would leave Iraq by the end of this year, drawing to a close a divisive eight-year war that cost the lives of more than 4,400 troops, defined the presidency of George W. Bush, and helped ignite his own political rise.
The decision leaves only a vestigial presence of Marine embassy guards and liaison officers staying on where more than a million troops, in all, have served.
The president's statement, coming a day after a NATO air campaign hastened the death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, was laden with symbolism, marking the ebb tide of a decade of American military engagement that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It also capped a remarkable period of foreign-policy accomplishments for a president who is hindered by a poor economy at home. 
For Mr. Obama, whose rise to the White House was based partly on his opposition to the Iraq war but who as president ordered a troop buildup in Afghanistan and intensified drone strikes against militants in the region, the announcement fulfills a campaign promise. Its timing, after Colonel Qaddafi's death and the commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and just as the administration was taking its toughest stance yet on Pakistan's reluctance to root out militants along its border with Afghanistan, may help insulate him from Republican charges that he is weak on national security.
''Today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year,'' the president said in a midday appearance at the White House. Anticipating what he called ''another season of homecomings,'' he declared, ''Our troops will definitely be home for the holidays.''
The complete withdrawal, which his political critics decried and his military team had worked hard to avert, was propelled by an irreconcilable dispute between the United States and Iraq over the legal immunity of a small force of military trainers that the Pentagon had planned to leave in the country. Though the president left open the possibility that trainers might still advise Iraqi troops, military officials said the chance of putting any significant American force there was slim.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, among others, scorned Mr. Obama for putting the sacrifices of American troops at risk and questioned whether the president had been motivated by ''naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude in negotiations with the Iraqi government.''
Mr. Obama gave word of the decision to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who faces rough political crosswinds of his own over the timing of the departure, in a video conference call. Mr. Obama's aides described the call as ''poignant,'' with the Iraqi leader expressing thanks for the sacrifices of American soldiers. As of Jan. 1, 2012, Mr. Obama said, the two countries will begin ''a normal relationship between sovereign nations, an equal partnership based on mutual interest and mutual respect.''
The agreement to leave Iraq this year dates from late 2008, when Mr. Bush, before leaving office, made a farewell visit to Baghdad that was disrupted when an Iraqi journalist hurled his shoes at him and denounced him as a ''dog.'' American military officials had wanted a ''residual'' force of as many as tens of thousands of soldiers to remain past 2011 as an insurance policy against future violence.
Those numbers were scaled back, but the expectation was that 3,000 to 5,000 American troops would remain. Some top American military officials were dismayed by the decision, saying Mr. Obama was putting the best face on a breakdown in tortured negotiations with the Iraqis.
Pentagon lawyers insisted that the Iraqi Parliament grant soldiers immunity from legal prosecution. In recent weeks, American negotiators in Baghdad concluded that it would be impossible to obtain that protection, essentially scuttling any chance of a substantial troop presence there next year.
Mr. Obama and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta kept the door open to further talks on trainers. While civilian and military officials characterized the withdrawal as a clean break, negotiations could always resume.
''As I told Prime Minister Maliki, we will continue discussions on how we might help Iraq train and equip its forces,'' Mr. Obama said. ''After all, there will be some difficult days ahead for Iraq, and the United States will continue to have an interest in an Iraq that is stable, secure and self-reliant.''
At the Pentagon, however, senior officials said that without a change in the tenor of Iraqi domestic politics, it was unlikely that any enduring American military presence could be negotiated with the Iraqi government.
Instead, these officials said, the two countries might look to create what one Pentagon official called ''a smaller footprint and more flexible relationship.'' That might include organizing joint exercises, inviting Iraqi officers to American military schools and offering to train Iraqis in other Middle Eastern nations where the United States has a presence.
''We're prepared to meet their training needs, we're prepared to engage in exercises with them, we're prepared to provide guidance and training with regard to their pilots,'' Mr. Panetta told reporters traveling with him to Indonesia.
The United States will still keep about 160 military personnel to guard its embassy in Baghdad and manage the continuing military relationship. There will also be 4,000 to 5,000 private State Department security contractors, as well as a significant C.I.A. presence. In Afghanistan, about 95,000 American troops remain.
''We fought to give Iraqis a choice,'' said a frustrated senior officer who was not authorized to speak publicly about the White House's decision. Another officer said, ''Bottom line, it is a failure of the Iraqi government.''
American officials continued to express concern about gaps in Iraq's security capabilities to withstand what they view as continuing threats of sectarian violence and Iran's malign influence. But political pressure in Iraq to end the American occupation gradually came to dominate military imperatives.
''Iraq is a highly nationalistic country, and we were not able to dislodge the view that they should not have foreign troops on their soil,'' said Christopher R. Hill, a former American ambassador to Iraq who is now dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver.
Mr. Obama's announcement drew mixed reactions in Washington, with Democrats generally approving while Republicans voiced fears that security gains in Iraq could be reversed without an American presence.
''While I'm concerned that a full withdrawal could jeopardize those gains,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement, ''I'm hopeful that both countries will work together to guarantee that a free and democratic Iraq remains a strong and stable partner for the United States in the Middle East.''
News of the American withdrawal was met with scattered celebrations in Iraq. In Sadr City, the Shiite district in Baghdad that is a bastion of anti-American sentiment, roughly 1,000 people celebrated under the picture of young Shiite men who had been killed by American troops.
''The United States here was just like Saddam Hussein,'' said Muslim Mohammed, 42, a government employee. ''We never thought we'd get rid of Saddam, and we thought his sons would just take over. We thought the Americans would never leave and they would just create excuses to stay longer and longer.''
Mr. Obama, however, has stuck to his plans to end the combat mission and withdraw all troops, in part because he wants to channel energy to reviving the economy. ''After a decade of war,'' he declared, ''the nation that we need to build -- and the nation that we will build -- is our own.''

HEADLINE: Obama Looks to Bush in 2004 for 2012 Strategy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
He'll have hundreds of millions of dollars, the bully pulpit, Air Force One and high-profile supporters from Warren Buffett to Lady Gaga behind him. But President Obama's chances of re-election could come down to a single strategic question: To what degree can the history of 2004 be repeated in 2012?
Or to break the question into its most important component parts: 
Can Mr. Obama overcome the bad economy, and perhaps even turn it to his advantage in certain ways, in the same way President George W. Bush overcame and in a sense turned to his advantage the bloody, expensive and increasingly unpopular war in Iraq eight years ago?
And can Mr. Obama do to his opponent - for now let's say Mitt Romney - what Mr. Bush did to Senator John Kerry in 2004?
The parallels are sufficient enough that Mr. Obama and his team have studied, and to a striking degree are replicating, the Bush re-election playbook.
Already they are building a narrative in which Mr. Obama made politically brave decisions to do what was right for the economy, even if those decisions were unpopular. It's a theme that echoes Mr. Bush's argument in 2004 that he did what it took to keep the country safe, and that even if you disagreed with him, you knew where he stood.
As for defining the opponent, Mr. Obama's supporters are already hard at work hammering home the idea that Mr. Romney is an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who says and does whatever is necessary to advance his political interests. It's an approach that bears a passing similarity to the Bush re-election campaign's efforts to paint Mr. Kerry as an inveterate flip-flopper, a man without core or convictions who. ... You get the idea.
The similarities -- and differences -- between the two re-election efforts are a regular topic of conversation and debate among strategists in both parties. ''Politics is infused with rich ironies,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was Mr. Bush's media strategist in 2000 and 2004, noting that Mr. Obama had reached the White House in large part by running against Mr. Bush's record and policies.
At the heart of both approaches is an insight frequently invoked by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's strategist, in 2004: an election is a choice, not a referendum. By that, he meant that an incumbent's job is not to prove he is perfect - it is to prove that he's better than the other guy.
Mr. Obama's aides now see their job in much the same way.
''If someone is going to beat us, they're going to be thoroughly known when they win,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's longtime strategist. ''They're not just going to win by default. It's way too glib to say that not being Obama is going to be sufficient.''
But it is way too early to know if the strategy will work for Mr. Obama as it did, albeit barely, for Mr. Bush.
Matthew Dowd, who was a Bush strategist in 2004 but voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, said Mr. Bush had somewhat better job-approval numbers during his re-election campaign than Mr. Obama does now. As a result, he said, Mr. Obama is at greater risk of facing voters who have already made up their minds to vote against him almost no matter who the alternative is.
''If he doesn't get some lift in his approval numbers, it will be hard to make this a choice election,'' said Mr. Dowd, who met with Mr. Obama late last year as the White House sought to regain its footing following the big Democratic losses in the midterm election.
The Obama team, he said, ''wants to make Mitt Romney into the Republican version of John Kerry.''
Mr. Obama stacks up relatively well against Mr. Romney and other Republicans in polls of head-to-head matchups in battleground states. But where Mr. Bush successfully cultivated an image as a decisive leader in a way that sharpened the comparison to Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dowd said, Mr. Obama could have trouble drawing as sharp a contrast.
''The value that the American public is looking for is a strong and decisive leader at a time of anxiety and challenge,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''In order to make the contrast, you have to have that value yourself, and Obama doesn't have it.''
Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director in the Bush White House and a senior aide to Senator John McCain's 2008 campaign, said Mr. Obama's chances of replicating the Bush strategy also would be hurt by opposition to specific policies, like the health care bill and the economic stimulus spending.
''Obama at his core seems sensitive to the idea that this is going to be a referendum on him,'' she said. ''You see it in some of their thin-skinned responses to criticism. To me they're revealing some of their feelings of vulnerability on that question.''
Mr. McKinnon, who left Mr. McCain's campaign in 2008 because he admired Mr. Obama and did not want to work against him, said that once Mr. Bush and his team settled on a message in 2004 built around national security, they stuck with it, day in, day out. Mr. Obama, he suggested, has yet to find the re-election story line he can use to project his strengths and draw contrasts to Mr. Romney or whoever wins the Republican nomination.
''We decided even if our strategy was flawed, it was better to have one we stuck with rather than a strategy a month,'' he said of the Bush 2004 campaign. ''Team Obama clearly gets that they need to compare and contrast and they need discipline. The question is, will they have a compelling message and narrative?''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Online Correction: October 21, 2011, Friday

HEADLINE: Governor Cuomo's Choices

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has shown little interest in the challenges facing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York City area subways, buses and commuter trains, or the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the area's ports, airports, bridges and tunnels. 
We hope his nomination of Joseph Lhota, former mayor Rudolph Giuliani's budget deputy, to lead the M.T.A. and Patrick Foye, one of Mr. Cuomo's top economic development advisers, to run the Port Authority means the governor is ready to get in the game.
Mr. Lhota was known as a solid, tough administrator in the Giuliani days. He will need those skills and more. He must be confirmed by the State Senate, and Republicans from the suburbs are primed to demand that he and Mr. Cuomo agree to end a payroll tax that helps finance the M.T.A. Mr. Lhota will have to fight to keep that $1.5 billion in revenue, just as he will have to stop Mr. Cuomo from raiding funds that are already dedicated to keeping the M.T.A. running or are needed to replace aging equipment and structures and continue crucial improvements. He must also negotiate contracts for 57,000 employees.
At the Port Authority, Mr. Foye will have to continue progress at the former World Trade Center site and run the ports, five airports, two tunnels, four bridges, a commuter railroad, a small police force and a major planning agency. Mr. Cuomo wants him to revive the Moynihan Station project to replace Pennsylvania Station -- a good idea.
It is too soon to know whether these two political veterans will be as expert as the administrators they replace -- Jay Walder at the M.T.A. and Christopher Ward at the Port Authority. They do start off with a clear advantage: Unlike their predecessors, they should be able to get the governor to return their calls.

HEADLINE: A Bolivar Ready to Fight Against the Bolivarian State

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and MARIA EUGENIA DIAZ

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela
HUGO CHAVEZ, president of Venezuela, has made Simon Bolivar, the 19th-century aristocrat who liberated much of South America from Spain, the central figure in a ''Bolivarian'' state ideology, invoking his spirit, exhuming his sarcophagus, even starting the construction of a new mausoleum resembling a ship for his hero this year.
But in a turn in the contact sport that is Venezuelan politics, one of the strongest challengers in the quest to unseat Mr. Chavez in a presidential election next year is an activist with actual Bolivar blood in his veins: Leopoldo Lopez, an aristocratic, Harvard-educated economist who is a descendant of the liberator's sister, Juana.
The campaign by Mr. Lopez was made possible here by a ruling in September by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which said that Venezuela's government must lift a disqualification that had prevented Mr. Lopez from running for public office. 
Mr. Lopez had argued that the disqualification amounted to political discrimination; it had been imposed by pro-Chavez officials because of legal claims against him from his time as a member of a nonprofit group and as mayor of Chacao, a municipality in Caracas.
To be sure, there was a catch once Mr. Chavez's governing institutions reacted to the decision by the Inter-American Court, a judicial entity of the Organization of American States. In its own ruling this week, Venezuela's Supreme Court appeared to uphold Mr. Lopez's disqualification from holding office.
The Supreme Court, controlled by judges loyal to Mr. Chavez, called the Inter-American court's decision ''not executable.'' But Luisa Estella Morales, the president of the Venezuelan court, also said that Mr. Lopez ''can freely sign up and participate in elections,'' including next year's race, although she refrained from saying whether he could serve if elected president.
Mr. Lopez, 40, is no stranger to operating within the gray areas of politics in Venezuela, a country where elections are held and public criticism is leveled at Mr. Chavez, but also where bureaucrats hound opposition leaders with legal threats and regulators fine independent news organizations, evidenced by a $2 million penalty imposed this week against the television network Globovision for reporting on deadly prison riots.
''The state seeks to disqualify those seeking an alternative with relentless character assassination,'' Mr. Lopez said in an interview. ''They are afraid of me because I can win.''
Since the Inter-American Court's ruling, Mr. Lopez, whose thinking falls within the center-left range of Latin America's political spectrum, has been the recipient of new bursts of criticism from Mr. Chavez's government.
For instance, one article this week on the Web site of Radio Nacional de Venezuela, the state-controlled radio network, called him a ''right-wing extremist,'' and claimed he was ''constantly committing outrages against the stability of the Bolivarian revolution.''
The article went further, asserting that Mr. Lopez was ''helped by the empire'' -- the fashionable catchall phrase for the United States used in Venezuela -- and calling him a ''manipulating character.'' Then, reflecting the doublespeak honed here in recent years, the article used the phrasing of Carlos Escarra, Mr. Chavez's attorney general, who had called Mr. Lopez's disqualification ''administrative and not political.''
MR. LOPEZ, a product of Venezuela's Americanized elite, graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio and earned a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University. Married to Lilian Tintori, a former television host and kite-surfing champion, his privileged background stands in sharp contrast with that of Mr. Chavez, a former army officer who rose from poverty to forge a political movement chafing at American influence in Latin America.
But Mr. Lopez also seems to have picked up some strategies from Mr. Chavez, who cobbled together a grass-roots political movement in the 1990s after he oversaw a failed 1992 coup. Mr. Lopez has traveled far and wide outside the capital, Caracas, assembling a national movement called Voluntad Popular, or Popular Will, which has congealed into a centrist political party.
Mr. Lopez, who rarely advertises his family ties to Bolivar, gained national prominence during his eight years as the mayor of Chacao, a relatively prosperous municipality in Caracas; he was re-elected to a second term in 2004 with 80 percent of the vote, after he focused on reforming Chacao's schools and its public transportation system.
During a chaotic coup in 2002, which briefly removed Mr. Chavez from office, Mr. Lopez drew the ire of Chavez supporters by taking part in the arrest of Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, who was then the interior minister. Later, in 2006, gunmen shot dead one of Mr. Lopez's bodyguards while he sat in Mr. Lopez's car, an episode that he said was meant to send a chilling message of intimidation.
The government's attempts to disqualify Mr. Lopez from running for office stem from his time as mayor of Chacao, when the authorities accused him of improperly moving money in 2003 from one part of the municipality's budget to another.
Mr. Lopez said he was ''completely innocent,'' contending that the legal claim involved meeting salary obligations to teachers that had been promoted by Mr. Chavez himself. While officials have also disqualified dozens of other people from running for office, Mr. Lopez has pointed out that no Venezuelan court had convicted him of any wrongdoing.
After the Inter-American Court's ruling, an umbrella organization of Venezuela's opposition parties welcomed Mr. Lopez's plan to run in a primary planned for February. In recent polls, he has vied with Henrique Capriles Radonski, the governor of Miranda State, as the leading opposition candidate.
Whoever wins the primary is expected to find himself in an election unlike any in Venezuela's recent history. While Mr. Chavez has dominated the political scene for more than 12 years and his supporters control the National Assembly, Supreme Court and the national oil company, his struggle with cancer has exposed a vulnerability.
STILL, it remains unclear how Mr. Chavez's illness will influence the race. His approval ratings have actually climbed in the months since he revealed his condition, and no other candidate controls the oil-financed resources or the state propaganda apparatus that he has at his command. The president said this week that he had beaten his cancer, the specifics of which have not been disclosed, and renewed taunts of his opponents.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lopez's uncertain candidacy will depend in part on institutions controlled by Mr. Chavez's supporters. A senior government prosecutor said this week that officials would ''opportunely'' disclose the results of criminal inquiries against Mr. Lopez. After the Supreme Court disregarded the Inter-American Court's binding decision, Human Rights Watch called the rebuff a ''blow to the rule of law.''
Nonetheless, Mr. Lopez's multiyear effort to have his name removed from the government's electoral blacklist may be gaining traction. The National Electoral Council, which is also controlled by Chavez supporters, agreed on Thursday to allow Mr. Lopez to run for office.
''It's not an easy fight,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''But like David against Goliath, we have perseverance, faith and we know where to aim.''

HEADLINE: Nevada G.O.P. Relents on Early Primary

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: The Nevada Republican Party has decided to push back the date of its presidential caucuses to Feb. 4 from Jan. 14, a move that brings a sense of order to an otherwise chaotic primary calendar and keeps New Hampshire from scheduling its voting before the New Year. 

 BODY:
The Nevada Republican Party decided on Saturday to push back the date of its presidential caucuses to Feb. 4, a move that brings a sense of order to an otherwise chaotic primary calendar and keeps New Hampshire from scheduling its voting before the New Year.
The Republican National Committee had implored Nevada to reconsider its decision to hold the caucuses on Jan. 14, and the Nevada Republican central committee agreed on Saturday.
The decision represented a victory for the New Hampshire secretary of state, William M. Gardner, who had threatened to schedule his state's primary in December. He is now expected to set the primary for Jan. 10, one week after the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3.
"The voters and our candidates are well served by a nomination process that starts in 2012, and today's action is a major step toward that goal," Matt Strawn, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, said Saturday.
Nevada's initial plan to hold its caucuses on January came, in part, at the request of the Mitt Romney campaign. But the decision touched off a wave of controversy, including pledges by most of the Republican candidates to boycott the Nevada caucuses.
The early phase of the Republican primary calendar also includes South Carolina, which is set to vote on Jan. 21, followed by Florida on Jan. 28.
Mr. Romney, who won the Nevada caucuses four years ago, had worked behind the scenes to try to nudge Nevada Republican officials to move up the date in hopes of creating a friendly spot on the calendar.
"It was just friendly encouragement to accelerate," said Robert List, a former Nevada governor and member of the Republican National Committee. "It's my understanding that they were feeling that if he were to do well in Nevada and New Hampshire that there could be sort of an escalating effect as he moved toward South Carolina and Florida. It could give them some momentum and could be helpful."
But the effort backfired and touched off a storm in New Hampshire. That state's largest newspaper, The Union-Leader, called on Mr. Romney to boycott the Nevada caucuses and uphold the tradition of the New Hampshire primary.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee who helped broker the change, said Saturday that Nevada would have its full slate of delegates restored because its contest now falls under rules of the party's primary calendar.
"With this decision Nevada will receive the attention it deserves," Mr. Priebus said. "And the national spotlight will focus clearly on the devastating effects that President Obama's economic policies have had on the Silver State."

HEADLINE: Cap and Trade: Sweating the Small Stuff

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A punctilious process limited the drama as California air regulators approved a program to reduce emissions linked to climate change. 

 BODY:
One thing built into a politician's DNA is a sense of occasion. Regulators tend to lack that gene. 
One of the most startling things about California's groundbreaking adoption of a market-based policy to cut emissions of the heat-trapping gases was how unstartling the final meeting was. The California Air Resources Board's all-day hearing Thursday was such a well-oiled exercise in democracy and administrative procedure that the momentousness of the occasion was almost lost in the footnotes. 
At the end of the meeting, the board adopted a state-of-the-art system to cap greenhouse gas emissions and create a market by distributing marketable emission permits to polluters. Those with efficient pollution controls can generate an income stream by selling unneeded permits. As the cap ratchets down, the value of the permits should go up.
The session did reflect a meticulous attention to process as the board weighed in on the urgency of addressing climate change. The eight members present spent more than five hours hearing dozens of last-minute pleas from the public as well. The exercise was bracketed by apresentation and by detailed discussions with agency employees. All of the gears and levers in this regulatory machine were on display, along with encyclopedic knowledge about the rule and others that should collectively cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
Representatives of the most polluting industries (see chart below) asked the board to cut them more slack. But except for a couple of witnesses' statements, the daylong session featured less emotion than most zoning board meetings.
Still, this punctilious process may be vital if cap-and-trade in California is to survive challenges and succeed.
Why? Because despite their formality and repetitiveness, such proceedings inform the board about the remaining problems that may need solving. 
Though many of the arguments against the plan had been presented in long written comments and at earlier meetings, two groups of speakers clearly got the board members' attention. 
The first was members of United Steelworkers Local 675 who hold jobs at Conoco Phillips' Southern California refinery complex. Lisa Bowman, a 46-year-old single mother of three who works as a safety and compliance officer, spoke first, arguing that while their union had supported the state law mandating cutbacks in emissions, "some of the impacts of this bill could put us out of work" if the refinery is shut down as unprofitable.
After hearing a dozen pleas from her fellow workers about finding a way to help their employer finance the needed controls, two board members endorsed, at least in theory, a mechanism for isolating the refiner's payment for 10 percent of its needed allowances and finding some way to use that money to help the company install the controls economically, thereby forestalling closure and job losses. The idea went on the staff's to-do list.
The other group whose complaints got attention were Southern California water utilities, which would be held accountable for the pollution associated with the energy it takes to get water to them from distant parts of the state. The board told its staff to explore ways of easing a potential burden on their customers.
But if compliance doesn't cost something, then no price has been put on emissions, which is the point. In general, the board heard the rest of the audience's praise and scorn with equanimity. For four years, the board has been steadily adjusting the rule in any case to reach a balance, dealing with one challenge after another. A lawsuit by environmental justice groups threatened to derail the effort before it was resolved; a referendum ballot to freeze the plan backed by millions of dollars from out-of-state oil companies failed. 
Only after the air board's unanimous vote at 4:58 p.m. did the board's chairman, Mary Nichols, allow herself a rhetorical flourish. "This is a first of its kind, ever, for this or any other agency -- and something that is going to turn out to be a landmark in its own right," she said evenly. "And I'm proud of that." Then she turned to the next item on the agenda.
That, along with a smattering of applause, was that.

HEADLINE: Tracking Subsidies

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
A NEW interactive database developed by New York University lets renters and buyers track nearly all the privately held subsidized housing in New York City.
The need to take stock of affordable apartments, which were quickly disappearing in the last decade as market-rate real estate boomed, led city officials to select the university's Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy to compile the database, called the Subsidized Housing Information Project.
The database has extensive information about 304,800 affordable rental and co-op units in about 2,600 properties. A tutorial is available online at www.furmancenter.org/data/search. An interactive map that lets users filter searches by location, subsidies and physical condition, as well as other criteria, can be reached directly at http://datasearch.furmancenter.org. 
The database, which cost just over $1 million to create, consolidates information from 50 public and private data sources, a testament to how complex affordable housing programs are in New York City, said Vicki L. Been, the faculty director of the Furman Center. That complexity has made it hard to track the affordable housing supply.
''Especially in the up market, the very hot market of the early 2000s,'' Ms. Been said, ''there was a real concern that the city was losing or failing to preserve a lot of the housing that had received subsidies but was reaching the end of those subsidies.''
For instance, dozens of buildings that went up as part of New York's Mitchell-Lama program were due to leave the system, and their owners were electing to quit the program. That was quickly shrinking the stock of subsidized housing, in a city where the high cost of construction and land and the potential profits from market-rate real estate make it difficult to create more.
''It's usually much more efficient and much cheaper to preserve an existing affordable unit than to have to rehabilitate or build a new one,'' Ms. Been said.
With a $940,000 grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and additional foundation and individual support, the center sent recent law graduates into the records rooms of various public agencies, sometimes with dust masks and gloves, since much of the information was not electronic, Ms. Been said. After almost three years of labor, the center was able to pull together data from four major government programs to include the vast majority of New York City's affordable housing. It is still working on capturing what remains from a fifth program.
Of the 235,000 affordable rental units in the database, about 171,000 continue to receive some sort of government subsidy and have a rent or income restriction associated with them, she said. The new database will enable city officials and affordable-housing advocates to see which housing subsidies are about to expire, so they can plan ahead and focus on housing that can be saved.
''It allows us to better understand both what kinds of buildings do expire out of the system, and what happens as a result of that,'' she said. ''So we're using the database internally to do research on trying to understand what will predict whether a particular development will expire out or not.''
The center's Institute for Affordable Housing Policy has already used the database to identify 227 properties throughout the city that are at risk of expiring out of affordability programs by the end of 2015.
While most of those property owners are unlikely to opt out of their subsidy programs, 34 properties with more than 10,300 units are in nonrenewable programs. Those properties will be studied in an effort to preserve them as subsidized, perhaps by shifting them into other programs, Ms. Been said, whereas in the past, they might simply have been lost from the affordable housing stock.
The Furman Center also incorporated its extensive collection of neighborhood information into the database. Visitors to the site can select from a host of variables to create customized maps and tables that can be downloaded, as well as track trends over time.
Martin Dunn, the president of the Dunn Development Corporation, a developer of affordable housing, was a consultant on the database, along with other private housing developers, to ensure data was accurate. He said it should add a wealth of information to create affordable housing policy moving forward.
''There are projects that come to the end of their restriction periods that are in great shape and have real value, and there are ones that are a wreck,'' he said. ''As government sets policies today that will have implications for 30, 40 years into the future, trying to understand what has worked well in the past is obviously very important.''

DENG XIAOPING AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF CHINA
By Ezra F. Vogel
Illustrated. 876 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $39.95.
Two mighty rhetorical questions conclude this enormous biography of Deng Xiaoping (1904-97): ''Did any other leader in the 20th century do more to improve the lives of so many? Did any other 20th-century leader have such a large and lasting influence on world history?'' The answers emerge from this comprehensive, minutely documented book, but not as predictably as Ezra F. Vogel, a Harvard University emeritus professor of social sciences, assumes.
After Mao's death in 1976, Deng became the champion of the economic reforms that transformed the lives of many, but not most, Chinese. (Vogel observes that Mao's immediate successor, Hua Guofeng, was the initiator of the reforms.) Deng had long been a central figure in the Communist Party. Vogel rightly says that ''for more than a decade before the Cultural Revolution'' -- 1966-1976 -- ''no one had greater responsibility for building and administering the old system than Deng Xiaoping.'' Yet, most of Deng's life and career takes up only a quarter of Vogel's 714 pages of narrative. 
By 1978, Deng had become China's ''paramount leader.'' It follows, therefore, that apart from his long period of house arrest and banishment during the years 1967-73, and during another year in 1976-77, when Mao again removed him from the political scene, Deng must share the blame for much of the agony Mao inflicted on China and the Chinese. He certainly bears the major responsibility for the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989.
It is a curiosity of ''Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China'' that Deng the man is almost invisible. There is a well-known list of his personal characteristics: he played bridge; liked bread, cheese and coffee; smoked; drank and used spittoons. He was unswervingly self-disciplined. Though Deng left no personal paper trail, Vogel ably relates what is known.
Deng came from a small-landlord family in Sichuan Province, yet his formal education, apart from his time at a local school when he was a child, consisted mainly of a single year, 1926, of ideological indoctrination at Sun Yatsen University in Moscow. For five years before that, he lived in Paris, where he received a practical, and enduring, education inside the infant Chinese Communist Party, serving under the leadership of the young Zhou Enlai.
After Paris and Moscow, Deng went back to China, and before long had ceased being ''a cheerful, fun-loving extrovert.'' He commanded a small force against warlords, was defeated and may have run away. Eventually, he joined the ''Mao faction,'' rising and falling with its inner-party fortunes. During the Long March of 1934-35 Deng attended the meeting where Mao took supreme power, and after the Communist triumph in 1949, he served as party commissar for the army that occupied Tibet, although he seems not to have set foot there. In the southwest Deng organized the land reform program of 1949-51 ''that would wipe out the landlord class.'' Mao praised Deng ''for his success . . . killing some of the landlords.'' (As part of a national campaign in which two million to three million were killed, ''some'' seems an inadequate word.) In 1957, Deng oversaw the ''anti-rightist campaign,'' a ''vicious attack on 550,000 intellectual critics'' that ''destroyed many of China's best scientific and technical minds.'' As for the Great Leap Forward of 1958-61, when as many as 45 million people starved to death, Vogel provides no evidence that Deng objected to Mao's monomaniacal policies. Frank Dikotter's well-documented book ''Mao's Great Famine,'' however, shows that Deng ordered the extraction of grain from starving peasants for the cities and export abroad.
In late 1966, Vogel tells us, Deng was accused of ''pursuing the capitalist road.'' Under house arrest in Beijing until 1969, he was transferred to Jiangxi Province to work half days in a factory. Red Guards harassed his five children, and the back of one of his sons was broken when he may have jumped from a window after the guards frightened or bullied him. Mao permitted Deng to return to Beijing in 1973.
Vogel contends that during his internal exile Deng concluded that something had gone systemically wrong with China: it was economically backward and isolated from the international scene; its people were poorly educated. China under Deng became an increasingly urban society. And following Deng's view that corruption crackdowns limit growth, many officials, Vogel writes, ''found ways not only to enrich China, but also to enrich themselves.'' The result, he says, is that China is more corrupt than ever and its environment more polluted.
While Deng believed that science and technology were important -- as have many Chinese reformers since the late 19th century -- he feared that the humanities and social sciences could be seedbeds of heterodoxy; he never hesitated in punishing intellectuals, whose divergent views could ''lead to demonstrations that disrupt public order.'' It is telling that for Deng perhaps the worst development in the Communist world after Tiananmen was the execution on Dec. 25, 1989, of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife. Ceausescu was the only Eastern European leader whose troops had fired on civilians.
Vogel calls Tiananmen a ''tragedy,'' and quotes Deng brushing aside doubts from colleagues that using troops to smash the uprising would disturb foreigners; ''Westerners would forget.'' Actually, it is young Chinese for whom the demonstrations in over 300 cities are a dim fact absent from their history lessons. Vogel's account of the crackdown is largely accurate, although he omits the shooting down on Sunday morning of many parents milling about at the edge of the square, searching for their children. In this, as in other parts of this narrative, Vogel could have spoken with journalists who were there, and not just read their accounts. (I declare an interest; I saw these events.) What is disappointing is Vogel's comments about why ''the tragedy in Tiananmen Square evoked a massive outcry in the West, far greater than previous tragedies in Asia of comparable scale.''
Part of the answer, Vogel correctly says, citing another scholar, was the real-time television in Tiananmen. Then he perplexingly adds that viewers ''interpreted'' what they saw ''as an assault on the American myth that economic, intellectual and political freedom will always triumph. Many foreigners came to see Deng as a villainous enemy of freedom who crushed the heroic students.'' Furthermore, Vogel contends, for foreign reporters the Tiananmen uprising ''was the most exciting time of their careers.'' Such comments are unworthy of a serious scholar. He states flatly that ''Deng was not vindictive.'' If he means Deng didn't order his adversaries and critics killed, that is true -- as far as individuals are concerned. But Deng never shrank, either in Mao's time or his own, from causing the murder of large numbers of anonymous people.
The most valuable part of Vogel's account is his survey of Deng's economic reforms; they made a substantial portion of Chinese better-off, and propelled China onto the international stage. But the party has obscured the millions of deaths that occurred during the Maoist decades. In the end, what shines out from Vogel's wide-ranging biography is the true answer to his two questions: for most of his long career Deng Xiaoping did less for China than he did to it.

HEADLINE: It's All Connected: A Spectator's Guide to the Euro Crisis

BYLINE: By BILL MARSH; Seth W. Feaster, Nelson D. Schwartz and Tom Kuntz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Bill Marsh is a graphics editor at The New York Times.
The global financial system is highly interconnected. So problems in one part of the world can reverberate almost everywhere else -- risking a cascade of default, contagion, contracting credit and collapsing economic activity. Exhibit A now is Europe. 
European Union leaders are meeting this week to at last deal with a debt crisis rattling investors worldwide who once thought leading to euro zone countries was virtually risk-free. The graphic here helps you see the intertwined complexities.
Correction: October 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart on Oct. 23 about the European debt crisis misstated the effect that the introduction of the euro in 1999 had on central banks of individual European nations. Such banks were reconstituted to work with the European Central Bank; the central banks did not cease to exist.

GRAPHIC: GRAPHICS: 1 It Starts With The Euro ...
2 ... And Goes Bad In Greece ...Greece financed a large public-welfare state and built up huge debt for its size that it has scant hope of repaying now. In 2010, European financial institutions began bailing out Greece (later Ireland and Portugal, too)
lenders were prodded to agree to modest, voluntary debt write-downs, or ''haircuts.'' But Greece still needs money. And its credit bill grows ever larger as lenders charge more and demand government cutbacks, which in turn have provoked civil unrest. After years of propping up the spendthrift Greeks, the Germans are fed up. The problem is, a chaotic Greek default could hurt all European banks and pension funds that have extended Greece credit down the years, and maybe cause a wider bank panic. So bailouts continue -- for now, at least: BEST CASE: Bailouts in the form of new European credit eventually work. Greece pays down its hefty debts with a combination of growth and continued domestic austerity for years to come. MORE LIKELY: Bailouts don't work. Greek debt grows in an anemic or shrinking economy. The country defaults, either in a negotiated, orderly manner or chaotically, forcing lenders to take big losses either way. But damage could be contained if countries in the euro zone can erect a financial firewall to backstop the credit of the four other shaky nations: Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. This is what the European Union is trying to agree on this week, as France prods a more reluctant Germany. WORST CASE? See below.
3 ... Threatening Contagion ...If the firewall fails to materialize, or inspire investor confidence, or proves inadequate, it would be easy to imagine a run on banks, because the single currency makes it easy to shift money across borders from risky economies to safer ones. That and the lack of central banks in each country -- those went away with the arrival of the euro -- make the euro zone ''the ultimate contagion machine,'' said Kenneth Rogoff, the Harvard economist and co-author of ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.''
4 ... That Could Unfold Quickly ...If nothing is done to prevent it, a chain of events like this one, involving countries on the large chart above, could unfold: GREECE DEFAULTS: In reaction, investors become more concerned about their exposure to other risks in the region, especially the other four most troubled economies. Borrowing costs rise for Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, adding to their debt loads.
MONEY TAKES FLIGHT: Investors fear that richer creditor nations may not bail out other shaky countries. And given the ease of shifting money across borders in the euro zone, a flood of money from risky economies to safer ones like Germany can take place in a matter of hours.
FRANCE NEXT? Meanwhile, the Italian government, barely solvent, is unable to protect domestic banks if there is a loss of confidence in them. French banks, heavily burdened with all manner of Italian debt, totter. Exposure to French banks could lead to losses beyond the Continent.
5 ... And Reach American Shores ...American lenders and money-market funds are already moving their money out of European banks, which are balking at lending to one another, writes the economist Laurence Kotlikoff. ''This is exactly what happened before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008,'' he adds. American banks are heavily exposed to Spain, Ireland and Italy. (American banks' exposure to Greece is smaller and less direct.) On top of this, American exports to the European Union -- collectively the biggest American trading partner -- could suffer if the crisis slowed European growth and caused the euro to depreciate against the dollar.
6 ... Unless Bailouts Are Big Enough ...The troubled euro zone could, by some estimates, require about $1.3 trillion to $2.06 trillion in bailouts -- an amount perhaps bigger than the Spanish G.D.P. or more than half the size of the German economy. The bailout fund set up last year by euro zone countries goes by the ungainly title of European Financial Stability Facility. The fund has only about $600 billion on hand. Here are total European bank exposures to the five most distressed economies, according to the Bank for International Settlements, compared with the size of each economy:
7 ... One of Many Crisis Unknowns Bank secrecy, government secrecy, a paucity of global financial statistics: all contribute to large information voids that leave experts uncertain. Here is a sampling. WHO'S EXPOSED TO BAD DEBT? Some banks are more forthcoming than others -- there is no consistent disclosure. American money market funds are thought to have significant investment in European banks. So-called stress tests of big banks earlier this year are now widely believed to have understated the level of bank risk. Meanwhile, banks say they have been struggling to lessen their exposure to bad debt. WHO INSURED BAD DEBT? Banks and hedge funds sell insurance against investor losses from default by their borrowers. These ''bets'' that losses won't occur are called credit default swaps. With defaults in Greece and elsewhere a real possibility, issuers of these swaps could be on the hook for losses that once seemed unlikely. How those billions would be covered is unknown
who, precisely, insured Greek debt is also unknown. WHERE ARE THESE ECONOMIES HEADED? Signs are not good. Some economists argue that government austerity measures being put in place to cut public debt also dampen economic growth: a hobbled private sector is not hiring, and now neither is the government. A slow economy generates less in taxes
the debt -- which doesn't go away unless there's a default -- is not paid down. ''When you have a financial crisis, growth is slow for a long time,'' Mr. Rogoff said. HOW MUCH IS CHINA OWED? Chinese exposure can only be guessed
whether China will participate in bailouts is uncertain. The same holds true for other big global creditors like Saudi Arabia and other petro-states.

HEADLINE: Taken By Pirates

 BODY:
Thanks to Jeffrey Gettleman, who continually sheds light on the tragedies and injustices in this corner of the world. I appreciate how he also highlights the good fight that many Somali people are undertaking as they make the best of an incredibly complicated situation. As Gettleman highlights in this article, the Somali situation is more about economics than about religious extremism. Economic desperation causes people to do crazy things. This is true in every country of the world. 
MATT ERICKSON, Minneapolis, via nytimes.com
So the Chandlers are going to avoid the Indian Ocean ''for the time being'' and instead ply the waters of the Caribbean (where pirate hostages aren't often left around to survive)? No wonder piracy is thriving.
JAMES, Florida, via nytimes.com
Riveting account! Excellent background information about Somalia, as well as the pirates. I'm as sympathetic to ordinary Somalians as I am relieved and grateful for the Chandlers' survival.

HEADLINE: Hollywood on Wall Street

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
WHAT enormous comfort it must give the Occupy Wall Street protesters to know that celebrities feel their pain.
Roseanne Barr, for example. The comedian bleeds for them. Or, rather, would have others bleed; inspired by the protests, she recommended the guillotine for the greediest bankers.
Such a subtle creature, she, and so oppressed to boot! Back in the 1990s, for the final seasons of her sitcom ''Roseanne,'' she made at least $20 million a year. 
She was not the 99 percent.
The rap mogul Russell Simmons and the rapper Kanye West meandered over to Occupy Wall Street's cradle, Zuccotti Park. By all accounts West was wearing more bling, though Simmons has bigger bucks: his net worth has been estimated as being between $100 million and $340 million. West's is below that, and he made only $16 million or so last year.
They are not even the 99.5 percent.
And while that doesn't disqualify them or Barr or other entertainers from sympathizing with Occupy Wall Street, it does give their public gestures of solidarity a discordant, sometimes specious ring. It also confuses the identity of a protest movement that already has challenges aplenty in the coherence department.
The movement's ''we are the 99 percent'' motto expresses ire over not only the unaccountability of huge financial institutions but also income inequality in America and the concentration of so much wealth and privilege in so few hands. Every time a wealthy messenger gloms on, that aspect of the message gets muddled and possibly compromised.
And the glomming has begun. With a slowly growing number of actors and musicians paying well-chronicled visits to Zuccotti Park, the movement is in danger of becoming a sticky fly strip for entertainers who like to flaunt their self-styled populism: a gadfly strip.
Susan Sarandon has been. Michael Moore has been. While both may have been propelled there by genuine anger, they have so much of it, are so famous for it and spread it so widely that their appearances can do the opposite of elevating a demonstration, making it seem merely fashionable and giving naysayers an easier way to roll their eyes.
Entertainers are members of the well-connected economic elite against which Occupy Wall Street ostensibly rages, whether or not they want to see themselves that way. True, they're not bundling mortgages, and they often have their extravagantly beating hearts in the right place. Many donate generously to charity. Many do remarkable good.
But they nonetheless make oodles of money for themselves and for major corporations with lavishly compensated executives: the corporations that bankroll and distribute their television shows, movies, record albums and concert tours; the corporations that peddle the clothing, electronics and ever-so-important cosmetics and styling products that entertainers are paid so handsomely to model and endorse.
In some cases entertainers even make money for the banking industry itself. This issue came up last week when Alec Baldwin dropped by Zuccotti Park.
Critics noted that he appears in television commercials for Capital One, a banking behemoth. While he responded that he gives his fee away, he's still promoting the company, and there remain other facets of his work and life that render him, like other stars, a very odd fit for a movement concerned with the sway of big companies and the distribution of wealth.
He has homes in both the Hamptons and Manhattan, a fact widely noted in news reports about a New York City tax inquiry into which is his primary residence. He claims the Hamptons.
His television show, ''30 Rock,'' is shown on NBC, which is part of NBC Universal, whose president and chief executive officer, Steve Burke, had a total compensation package worth $34.7 million last year, according to a recent survey of executive salaries in The Hollywood Reporter.
That same survey put the compensation of Brian Roberts, the chief executive officer of Comcast, which owns a controlling stake in NBC Universal, at $31.1 million. Philippe Dauman, the chief executive officer of Viacom, which owns Paramount Pictures, outpaced both of them. According to the company's filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, he had a compensation package last year that totaled nearly $85 million, more than double his 2009 amount. Like Wall Street bankers, entertainment industry executives haven't exactly suffered in this economy.
Celebrities help line those executives' pockets, even if that's not their goal, and then take the extra step of supporting other affluent corporations as pitchmen and pitchwomen. Some of them are seemingly aware enough of how mercenary this can seem that they favor endorsements outside American markets, especially in Asia, where their primary fan base won't notice. At least Sarandon is doing her most recent endorsement work, for the clothing retailer Uniqlo, right here, on billboards in Manhattan and in a full-page ad in last week's New Yorker magazine. I'm betting she chose Uniqlo, admirably, because it's not Prada and its magazine ads push something other than glamour. The merino sweater she models in one ad costs $39.90.
But Uniqlo is part of a multibillion-dollar Japanese corporation, and the vast majority of its clothing is made in China. How does that serve the jobs-hungry young Americans in Occupy Wall Street's fold?
There are many mixed signals in the celebrity assist to Occupy Wall Street, along with a reminder that we too seldom hold stars to account for their own greed.
SOME have reportedly accepted payments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars to show up and even perform at the private parties of superrich despots. The musicians Mariah Carey, Nelly Furtado, Usher and Beyonce (a pitchwoman over time for L'Oreal, Armani, Nintendo, Pepsi) sang for members of the Qaddafi family. Will they be warbling at the funeral? Hilary Swank and Jean-Claude Van Damme attended the 35th-birthday bash for the Chechen tyrant Ramzan Kadyrov. This was not the outgrowth of a long, deep friendship.
Let's hope these entertainers steer clear of Zuccotti Park, but you never know. Performers do love their political pronouncements, even though they view the world from a vantage point as skewed and cloistered in its way as a Fortune 500 chief executive's. There are many causes that want for notice and can benefit mightily from celebrity interventions.
Occupy Wall Street isn't one of them, at least not at this point. It's running strong, with ample news media attention. Entertainers who raise its banner may get some self-promotion and ego inflation from the effort, but they do the protest questionable good. And protesters would be wise to keep all that glitters -- including the gold chain that was on Kanye West's neck -- at arm's length.

HEADLINE: One Country, Two Revolutions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I take no pleasure in seeing anyone lose a job, but I can't say that the recent headlines showing that America's biggest banks have been losing money on their trading operations, and are having to radically shrink as a result, are entirely bad news for the country. Over the last decade, America's banking sector got pumped up by steroids -- in the form of cheap credit and leverage -- every bit as much as Major League Baseball's home run hitters. And if one result of the downsizing of Wall Street is that more of America's best and brightest math and physics students decide to go into science and real engineering rather than financial engineering, the country will be a whole lot better off.
Why? Because, to paraphrase the Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, Wall Street, which was originally designed to finance ''creative destruction'' (the creation of new industries and products to replace old ones), fell into the habit in the last decade of financing too much ''destructive creation'' (inventing leveraged financial products with no more societal value than betting on whether Lindy's sold more cheesecake than strudel). When those products blew up, they almost took the whole economy with them. 
I was on Wall Street two weeks ago, and I've been in Silicon Valley this past week. What a contrast! While Wall Street is being rattled by a social revolution, Silicon Valley is being by transformed by another technology revolution -- one that is taking the world from connected to hyperconnected and individuals from empowered to superempowered. It is the biggest leap forward in the I.T. revolution since the mainframe computer was replaced by desktops and the Web. It is going to change everything about how companies and societies operate.
The latest phase in the I.T. revolution is being driven by the convergence of social media -- Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Groupon, Zynga -- with the proliferation of cheap wireless connectivity and Web-enabled smartphones and ''the cloud'' -- those enormous server farms that hold and constantly update thousands of software applications, which are then downloaded (as if from a cloud) by users on their smartphones, making them into incredibly powerful devices that can perform myriad tasks.
The emergence of the cloud, explained Alan Cohen, a vice president of Nicira, a new networking company, ''means than anyone can have the computing resources of Google and rent it by the hour.'' This is speeding up everything -- innovation, product cycles and competition.
The October issue of Fast Company has an article about the designer Scott Wilson, who thought of grafting the body of an iPod Nano onto colorful wristbands, turning them into watchlike devices that could wake you up and play your music. He had no money, though, to bring his concept to market, so he turned to Kickstarter, the Web-based funding platform for independent creative projects. He posted his idea on Nov. 16, 2010, reported Fast Company, and ''within a month, 13,500 people from 50 countries had ponied up nearly $1 million.'' Apple soon picked up the product for its stores. Said Alexis Ringwald, 28, who recently founded an education start-up, her second Silicon Valley venture: ''I have many friends -- they introduce themselves as 'reformed' Wall St. bankers and lawyers -- who have abandoned conventional careers and are now launching start-ups.''
Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.com, a cloud-based software provider, describes this phase of the I.T. revolution with the acronym SOCIAL. S, he says, is for speed -- everything is now happening faster. O, he says, stands for open. If you don't have an open environment inside your company or country, these new tools will blow you wide open. C is for collaboration because this revolution enables people to organize themselves within companies and societies into loosely coupled teams to take on any kind of challenges -- from designing a new product to taking down a government. I is for individuals, who are able to reach around the globe to start something or collaborate on something farther, faster, deeper, cheaper than ever before -- as individuals.
A is for alignment. ''There has never been a more important time to have all your ships sailing in the same direction,'' said Benioff. ''The power of social media is that it is easier than ever to both articulate, and reinforce, the vision and values that create and inspire alignment.'' And L is for the leadership that does that. Leadership in a SOCIAL world has to be a mix of bottom-up and top-down. Leaders need to inspire, enable and empower everything coming up from below in a company or a social movement and then edit and sculpt it with a vision from above into a final product.
The great thing about the new I.T. revolution, says Jeff Weiner, the C.E.O. of LinkedIn, is that ''it makes it easier and cheaper than ever for anyone anywhere to be an entrepreneur'' and to have access to all the best infrastructure of innovation. ''And despite all of our challenges,'' he adds, ''it is happening here in America.''
Like I said, the news isn't all bad.

HEADLINE: Unreasonable, Maybe, but It's on a Social Mission

BYLINE: By HANNAH SELIGSON

 BODY:
DANIEL EPSTEIN wants to get one thing straight: He is an unreasonable man. Happily, proudly unreasonable. Entrepreneurs who want to change the world, he says, have got to be a little crazy.
And so, to foster some practical zaniness, Mr. Epstein is a co-founder of something called the Unreasonable Institute, in Boulder, Colo. For the last two summers, he has helped preside over this academy for entrepreneurs who want to solve social problems and make some money, too.
Part schmooze-fest, part group hug, this six-week program connects entrepreneurs with one another, as well as with executives, investors and thinkers who might help them. Its name derives from a quotation by George Bernard Shaw: ''All progress depends on the unreasonable man.'' For good measure, Mr. Epstein recently had Unreasonable's logo tattooed on his derriere.
Welcome to the age of the spreadsheet humanitarian. The central idea of the Unreasonable Institute is that profit-making businesses can sometimes succeed where their nonprofit counterparts might falter. Mr. Epstein, 25, and a serial entrepreneur, says the Unreasonable Institute wants people who are willing to think big, even when skeptics scoff. 
Competition is stiff. This year, about 300 people vied for 26 spots. Many who have attended praise the program for its networking opportunities. Some have even gotten businesses off the ground.
One of them is Ben Lyon. Two years ago, Mr. Lyon, a recent college graduate in international relations and economics, was in Sierra Leone and feeling highly discouraged. Through a nonprofit group, he had tried to start a pilot program meant to allow microfinancing organizations to receive loan payments via their cellphones. But he just couldn't get it off the ground.
Today, he is running Kopo Kopo Inc., which is based on that earlier effort. With four full-time employees in Kenya, it offers a mobile payment app that helps people make purchases in areas where banks don't exist or where fees are too high for the poor to open accounts.
How did it happen? Mr. Lyon, 24, originally from Hanover, N.H., attributes his success to a commercial structure he created with the help of the institute. So far he has raised nearly $1 million from institutional investors.
''We select for-profit ideas that we think have the ability to meet the needs of at least one million people,'' says Mr. Epstein, who founded the institute along with Teju Ravilochan, 24, and Tyler Hartung, 26.
The selected entrepreneurs include people like Myshkin Ingawale, 28, of Biosense Technologies, which makes a device that tests women and children for anemia; Luis Duarte, 30, who started YoReciclo (I Recycle) in Monterey, Mexico; and Jamie Yang, 31, founder of a EGG-energy, a company based in Tanzania that sells rechargeable batteries through a portable power grid.
The institute conducts its program at a fraternity house it rents at the University of Colorado. The six weeks are intense and communal. Fellows sleep three or so to a room. A chef prepares three in-house meals a day. The fellows dine at a table seating 60, alongside mentors who might include the chief technology officer of Hewlett-Packard or the former director of Google.org.
On any given day, the fellows might go on a hike or a bike ride with a potential investor, attend a workshop about building corporate partnerships, or take part in ''family pitch night,'' when two entrepreneurs present their companies to the rest of the group for feedback. At the end of the program, the fellows travel to San Francisco and pitch their ideas to a group of investors.
Mr. Epstein says market-based solutions are important in spurring economic growth throughout the developing world.
''This is really in contrast to the prevalent model of international aid,'' says Cynthia Koening, 33, who attended the program this year. Her company, Wello, based in Rajasthan, India, is aimed at people -- most of them women -- who must walk long distances to bring drinking water to the home. Her cylinder-shaped product allows women to roll water home from the source rather than carry it on their heads, which can be dangerous and time-consuming.
Ms. Koening says the decision to run Wello as a commercial business -- it will sell its product, the WaterWheel, to consumers -- was an easy one. ''When people make choices in a market economy, they are deliberately choosing the solution that best meets their needs, she says. ''Also, we don't want to have to depend on donor grants and donations. That's not sustainable.''
MR. LYON, of Kopo Kopo, agrees that it's time to use more commercial muscle to help solve global woes. His company plans to generate revenue through small subscription fees. ''The nonprofit space has been so massive but has had disproportionally little impact in solving some of the world's biggest problems,'' he contends.
But investors can be leery of commercial social ventures. One obstacle is due diligence. Investors generally ''can't go to Liberia or New Delhi to kick the tires before they write a $50,000 check,'' says Nick Flores, investment director at Investors' Circle, a network of more than 150 people who finance businesses with a social or environmental impact.
He says one question kept tugging at him when he attended the institute's pitch day last June: ''Is it financial first or impact first?'' The network, so far, has not invested in any companies based on those pitches, he says.
''One of the only fellows who got a standing ovation was a young man helping rehabilitate child soldiers in Liberia,'' he recalls. ''We will have investors interested in that from an impact standpoint, but the larger question will be how are they going to get their money back?''
Mr. Epstein says: ''These companies are forcing investors to rethink investment terms beyond just having equity that liquidates. They'll have to get creative with their financial mechanisms, but most firms and funds aren't comfortable with that.''
Nevertheless, about half the fellows in last year's class received financing, ranging from $40,000 to $400,000, from the investors they met on pitch day, the institute says. The companies might aim to generate revenue through subscription fees (as Kopo Kopo is doing) or through government contracts, charging for advertising and -- in the most time-honored way of all -- charging for a product or service.
MR. EPSTEIN is no stranger to starting businesses. He turned down Princeton to go to the University of Colorado because he thought it would be ''less academically intense'' and give him give more time to be an entrepreneur.
By the time he was 19, he had started two companies: Tuition Specialists, which helps out-of-state students at the university work through the complicated process of paying in-state tuition legally, and Unreasonable Adventures, an ecotourism Web site.
But neither company fully captured Mr. Epstein's vision of an enterprise that would be good for both shareholders and consumers. So he set about creating the institute, which is a nonprofit, financed through a combination of private donations and grants.
The institute, which has four board members, has raised more than $300,000 to run the program. Entrepreneurs compete fiercely for spots. Finalists raise the $8,000 tuition by mobilizing their friends, families and professional networks to donate in small amounts. (This process avoids what the institute calls the ''rich uncle'' advantage.)
When the two dozen or so finalists who have won the funding race meet, ideas are proposed and retooled, eureka moments happen, and help is offered, sometimes by way of crowd-sourced fund-raising.
During the first week of this year's institute, Raj Janagam, founder of Cycle Chalao, a bicycle-sharing program based in Mumbai, received an e-mail from the Ministry of Urban Development in India requesting a meeting to discuss a government partnership with his company. Mr. Janagam, 23, had been trying to schedule this meeting for two years and had to get back to Mumbai, but he did not have $2,000 for a last-minute plane ticket.
Ties Kroezen, another fellow at the institute, set up a campaign on ChipIn, a Web service that helps individuals and groups raise and collect money for various projects. Five days later, Mr. Janagam had a plane ticket to India.
''I had never raised that amount of money in my life,'' Mr. Janagam said. ''In India, $2,000 is a lot of money. It was amazing the kind of support I got.''
As for the meeting with the ministry, Mr. Janagam says it gave Cycle Chalao national credibility, and moved it closer to a partnership that will help it expand throughout India over the next few years. Forty-eight hours after the meeting, Mr. Janagam returned to the institute.
For others, the benefits are not that instantaneous. Mr. Ingawale, 28, and a 2011 fellow, recently quit his job at McKinsey & Company in Mumbai to start Biosense Technologies, which makes the ToucHb, an iPad-size device that tests women and children for anemia.
In 2008, Mr. Ingawale was in a village outside of Mumbai and witnessed a woman die in childbirth because of complications related to anemia, which she had never been tested for. ''I come from an engineering and consulting background,'' he said, ''so it struck me that there had to be a business solution for a disease that impacts millions of women and children in South Asia.''
Mr. Ingawale and his company have a long road ahead, even though the World Health Organization named ToucHb as one of the new emerging technologies to address global health concerns.
Like any start-up, the company will have to raise capital, but it will also have to navigate issues specific to socially minded ventures: How to market a product in the developing world? And how to strike the right balance between being a profit-making business and having a social mission?
Mr. Ingawale went searching for answers at the Unreasonable Institute. He says he didn't come away with much that was concrete, but he felt more energized.
''Being at the Unreasonable Institute created the complete feeling that we can do anything,'' he says. He also met people like Rajesh Anandan, a senior executive at Unicef. ''That's someone I will definitely be reaching out to,'' he says, ''when it makes sense to deploy ToucHb across the developing world.'' The device is now in clinical trials.
FOR some participants, the institute is just one stop on a kind of social entrepreneurship circuit; they've been awarded numerous fellowships, won different business plan competitions and are regular faces at industry conferences. For others, the institute is their first encounter with this scene. This is especially true for many of the 60 percent of fellows who live outside the United States.
By coming to Boulder this year, Mr. Duarte of Mexico, founder of YoRecicolo, which operates recycling programs, was able to meet like-minded people who work on recycling and waste issues. He even received an invitation to speak at a Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York last month. His company has been profitable since last year.
Like Mr. Duarte, Mr. Janagam of Cycle Chalao found that the institute helped him forge contacts with other people interested in tackling social issues.
''I do not come from a business family,'' Mr. Janagam says. ''I lack connections with high-profile people.'' After six weeks, though, his smartphone was packed with contacts.
Correction: October 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the Unreasonable Institute, which helps people start businesses with a social mission, misspelled the name of a company started a by participant in the program. It is YoReciclo, not YoRecicolo. The article also described incorrectly a tattoo on Daniel Epstein, a co-founder of the institute. It is the institute's logo, not the word ''unreasonable.''

HEADLINE: Knowing When to Refinance

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
REFINANCINGS made up 79 percent of all 2011 mortgage applications as of early October, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, about the same level as last year but well above the 54 percent average of the last decade. Many of these applications have come from so-called serial refinancers in a constant search for the lowest possible interest rate.
Industry experts warn against rushing into a refinancing, especially if you're a first-timer. 
''The first question I ask people is, 'What are your long-term plans -- what are your plans for this house?' '' said David Boone, a first vice president for residential lending at Provident Bank in Jersey City.
If you don't plan on staying in your home long enough to recoup the closing costs of a refinancing, it may not be worth the effort, he said, adding that it takes about a year, on average, for that to happen these days. (A homeowner can expect to pay an average of 3 to 6 percent of the outstanding principal in refinancing costs, according to LendingTree.com.)
''You have to do the math,'' Mr. Boone said. If, for example, closing costs are $2,000 but your monthly savings will be $200, you will break even in 10 months.
Homeowners may also want to forego a refinancing if the difference between their current mortgage rate and new loan rate is a quarter of percentage point or less, he said -- although other mortgage experts say the gap should be closer to a percentage point.
Borrowers will need to consider other financial goals, like saving for college or retirement. ''Think about it in a big-picture kind of way,'' said Betsy Billard, an adviser at Ameriprise Financial in Manhattan. ''Make sure it makes sense all around.'' Can the monthly savings from the refinancing be invested and used toward these goals? How will the refinancing affect your tax bill?
After these issues have been discussed, don't jump at the first advertised low rate dangled in front of you, Ms. Billard said, advising borrowers to shop around for a broker who can offer a variety of loan choices.
Phillip Loria, the president of Amerimutual Mortgage, a broker in Astoria, Queens, says borrowers should also resist becoming fixated on obtaining the lowest possible rate. ''Sometimes people get caught up in that eighth of a percent,'' he said, mentioning one recent client who calculated savings of $90,000 over the life of his refinanced loan. When rates ticked up an eighth of a point, the client held off -- even though he still would have saved some $88,000 over all. ''They try to time the market so perfectly that they end up doing nothing,'' Mr. Loria said.
Here are four questions that borrowers should consider carefully before proceeding with a refinancing, according to experts.
HOW SECURE IS YOUR JOB? If you feel you could be out of work in six months or a year, then don't use up savings to cover fees or increase the down payment. ''You don't want to rob yourself of liquidity because you're throwing it all in your house,'' Ms. Billard said. A follow-up question could be: ''If you think you could potentially be out of a job in six months, how will the refi work for you?''
WHAT ARE THE SAVINGS? Get a good-faith estimate from your lender and make sure it includes all the costs involved. Then compare these numbers with the amount you would save in the first year of the new mortgage. (Look at the difference between your old monthly payment and your expected new one and multiply by 12.)
WHAT ABOUT THE RATE? Are you getting it locked in -- and for how long? How many points are you paying to get a lower rate? Ask to see a rate sheet, Mr. Loria said.
WHAT'S THE RIGHT TIME FRAME? If your children are heading for college in nine years or your retirement is likely in 15, your mortgage term should match up. Most mortgages are made in five-year increments, but some lenders will offer more variety. ''You actually can get a 23-year loan,'' Mr. Boone said. ''You just have to ask.''

HEADLINE: Cuts Threaten To Close Center For Crop Safety In South Texas

BYLINE: By DANNY GUERRA. 
dguerra@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Within 80 miles of Weslaco, there are nine bridges linking the United States and Mexico. Tons of agricultural products move between the countries each day: vegetables from Mexico and cantaloupes from Central America arrive in Texas while beef and grains are sent to Mexican markets and beyond. 
The Kika de la Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Center, where researchers work to ensure the safety of products that cross the bridges, is in the middle of it all. Now, as Congress considers closing the center, there are growing concerns in the agricultural community about the future safety of crops imported into the United States.
Proposed cuts to United States Department of Agriculture research programs have put in jeopardy the South Texas center, and nine others around the country. Although the cuts are not finalized, a House proposal directs the agency to focus on ''highest priority research.'' The Senate version of the budget also includes the closings -- at an estimated one-time saving of $39 million -- but acknowledges that ''laboratory closures often cost money in the short term and do not necessarily provide real savings.''
The Kika de la Garza Center works on pest risk analysis, to identify threats that imported crops could bring into the country. A June report by the Texas AgriLife Research program at Texas A&M University called the center a ''strategic defense'' against invasive species that could harm agriculture and contaminate the food supply.
Texas is the second-largest point of entry for fruits and vegetables into the United States market. The A&M report estimated the value of agriculture in the Lower Rio Grande Valley at $732 million, with a statewide economic impact of $1.6 billion.
Robert Mangan, Kika de la Garza's coordinator, said researchers often traveled to other countries to learn how outbreaks of foreign pests and diseases could affect agricultural products.
''What they are closing are units that can quickly respond to these problems, and once they are lost there will be a long delay in addressing outbreaks that may arise,'' Mr. Mangan said.
In addition to developing quarantine and inspection measures to address contaminants, the center researches fruit fly and fever tick eradication and citrus- and potato-related diseases.
The center is also working with United States Customs and Border Protection to eliminate Carrizo cane, a fast-growing invasive weed that grows up to 30 feet tall along the Rio Grande and hinders law enforcement patrols. That research will continue at another Texas U.S.D.A. facility, Mr. Mangan said.
Under the cuts proposed by the House, Agriculture Department research facilities could transfer their projects to universities, but those institutions would have to provide the financing. Ray Prewett, executive vice president of the Texas Vegetable Association, said that local leaders have held discussions with universities but that ''the likelihood of any projects being salvaged would be limited at best.''
''What worries us the most about the closure is that the center has been doing research that no one else has been doing,'' Mr. Prewett said.

HEADLINE: What the Earth Gives, And What It Inspires

BYLINE: By SUSAN HODARA

 BODY:
WHITE PLAINS
THE diversity of work created by ceramic artists from around the region -- from clay formed so finely it resembles furled paper to orbs that appear immovable in their massiveness -- is currently on view in ''Earth,'' an exhibition at ArtsWestchester's Arts Exchange here, presented in cooperation with Clay Art Center in Port Chester.
''Earth'' opened Oct. 6, appropriately timed to the second annual American Craft Week (Oct. 7 to 16), the purpose of which was to raise the national appreciation of crafts as a vital part of America's culture and economy. The show, which continues through Nov. 23, presents ceramics focusing on environmental concerns, each piece addressing an aspect of the complex realm of nature, sustainability and the community's power to effect change. 
Works by more than 70 artists fill the Arts Exchange, a former bank building in the heart of the city. There are trays, tiles and tapestries on the walls (and one that leans against a wall); sculptural tableaus on pedestals, on the floor and even on the platform above the entryway; and several pieces hanging from the 40-foot-high, coffered ceiling, including two that involve projections. The onetime bank vault is now the site of an intricate installation, some of its elements reaching beyond the door.
Throughout both floors of gallery spaces, birds are prevalent. Some appear content, like the long-beaked, totemic species in Marilyn Richeda's ''Lineage: 5 Spiney Birds'' or the little blue birds that perch on the branches emerging from Kathy Ruttenberg's ''Overgrown,'' a nearly nine-foot-tall woman who wears fishnet stockings, pointy high heels and a skirt decorated with frolicking animals while an owl sits serenely on her arm.
Elsewhere, the birds are more ominous. Brooke Noble's ''Specimens From the Mississippi River Valley'' is an arrangement of 16 bodies cast from migratory birds felled by environmental toxins. Nearby, Liz Surbeck Biddle's ''Gyre'' is a six-foot-wide mixed-media swirl inspired by images of decomposing albatross chicks, their open stomachs revealing multicolored plastic debris. In Lisa Breznak's assemblage of 64 gold-leaf figurines, the birdlike form titled ''Cormorant's Lament'' seems to be howling at the heavens.
Given both the delicacy of birds and their role as harbingers of doom, their recurrence reflects the spectrum of statements made in the show. ''Some of the artists are encouraging us to revere nature and its fragility,'' said Leigh Taylor Mickelson, curator of the exhibition and program director at Clay Art Center. ''Others are agents of social change, using their work to shout a warning about the damaging effects of technology, science and industrialism.''
ArtsWestchester is extending the symbolism in a series of family workshops led by artists from the exhibition. In each, participants will create clay birds that will be added to collective displays. The workshops, Ms. Mickelson said, are ''about coming together, thinking about our ecosystem, and then making something that will be part of a collaborative project.''
The power of communal effort is exemplified in two additional components of ''Earth.'' While half of the artists in the show are represented with sculptural works, the rest contributed to ''The Community Tabletop,'' with 21 individually designed place settings as well as serving trays, salad bowls, salt and pepper shakers, pitchers, candlesticks and an ornate centerpiece, all arranged by Ms. Mickelson. In the same gallery alcove, ''Cups Coming Together'' is a display of 66 cups handmade by area residents in response to ArtsWestchester's open call.
All of the pieces in ''Earth'' are for sale. The sculptural works are priced from $250 to over $28,000. The functional pottery ranges from $21 to $1,700.
''I love using an object that someone else made lovingly,'' Ms. Mickelson said. ''There's something about eating from a bowl and knowing that the artist has pinched its edges with her actual fingers.''
''Earth'' runs through Nov. 23 at the Arts Exchange, 31 Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains. Open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m.; admission is free. Family workshops will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. on Oct. 29, Nov. 5 and 12. For more information: artswestchester.org or (914) 428-4220.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Diversity on Campus

 BODY:
A letter writer suggests using economic status rather than race as a factor in college admissions. Readers offer their views.
The Letter
To the Editor:
''College Diversity Nears Its Last Stand'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 16) offers insight into the legal status of race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Given the good possibility that the Supreme Court will further limit that form of affirmative action, we should look to an alternative approach: considering economic status instead of race.
Addressing racial injustice directly is difficult and has inspired a strong backlash in the culture wars. Using means as a factor offers many of the same advantages -- economic circumstances correlate closely with race -- without the backlash.
Several public universities in states like California, Washington and Florida that have banned race-based affirmative action are already using means as a factor in their admissions decisions. Like traditional affirmative action, giving special consideration to socioeconomic disadvantages can enhance both individual opportunity and campus diversity. Of course, ending affirmative action has reduced racial diversity in many cases. 
But considering race without means might benefit wealthier members of a minority group -- those who are already the most competitive -- which seems unfair and not in keeping with the goals of affirmative action. We should examine whether making economic diversity a priority in college admissions might not offer a better way to address both economic and racial imbalances.
BEN LOWSEN Alexandria, Va., Oct. 16, 2011
The writer is a major in the United States Army and an Asia analyst.
Readers React
The recurring debate over race-based affirmative action often avoids the central question: Has structural racism in society diminished to such an extent that social engineering mechanisms like affirmative action are no longer necessary?
Unfortunately it has not, and there is ample data to support this conclusion. Recent studies confirm that unconscious racism continues to be infused in nearly every aspect of society. Every student of color, whether inner-city or suburban, well off or poor, continues to face this burden. Family wealth, often the deciding factor in whether someone goes to college, is wider along the racial divide today than in many previous years.
There is no doubt that race-based affirmative action continues to accelerate entree into the American middle class for students of color.
Affirmative action is by no means the only, or even the best, mechanism to socially manage the needs of communities of color, or the nation as a whole. But it is better than nothing and should continue.
VICTOR GOODE New York, Oct. 19, 2011
The writer is an associate professor at City University School of Law and former national director of the National Conference of Black Lawyers.
As a white faculty member in a heavily nonwhite community college, I believe that it ultimately does no one any good to prefer one ethnicity or income over another. Ultimately, those who are well prepared will succeed. To do that, they need to enter college with strong skills and exit with stronger ones.
Too many American high school students are unprepared and cannot make the most of preferences or scholarships if they receive them. To make the entire system color-blind, gender-blind and blind in all other ways would open it equally to all and give the United States the best prepared and most well-educated work force.
CAROL STEPHENSON Dallas, Oct. 19, 2011
As it seems likely that the Supreme Court will re-examine race-based affirmative action in college admissions, Mr. Lowsen suggests the use of socioeconomics rather than, or as a proxy for, race.
This sort of class-based affirmative action scheme might be the best option if the court does limit the use of racial preferences. But that doesn't make it a particularly good one. When U.C.L.A.'s law school implemented a race-blind, class-based admissions policy in the late 1990s, minority enrollment fell dramatically and rapidly.
Poverty is not a proxy for race, and to pretend that it is ignores the initial foundation for affirmative action: to correct for demonstrable biases against minorities in attaining higher education. Colleges and universities should be engines of social change, equalizing students (as much as possible) across old lines of race, class and gender. Sadly, weakening the Grutter v. Bollinger ruling -- the 2003 case affirming the narrow use of race as an admissions factor -- would make that progressive vision far more difficult.
BRIAN FARKAS New York, Oct. 19, 2011
The writer is a student at Cardozo School of Law.
Giving lower-income students a boost in college admissions would have great benefits. More people from humble backgrounds would join the political elite and craft policies that help the disadvantaged. Over time, this would reduce the need for affirmative action.
Unlike one's race, one's economic background is not immediately apparent. Thus, means-based affirmative action would avoid casting a cloud of suspicion over anyone's achievements.
The one impediment to means-based affirmative action is cost: Admitting more low-income students would require an increase in financial aid. But it is a price worth paying for a more representative democracy and a more egalitarian society.
ILYA SHLYAKHTER Cambridge, Mass., Oct. 19, 2011
Admissions committees can maintain inclusive admissions practices in spite of anti-affirmative-action lawsuits. Recruiting more minority students to apply to schools could increase the number qualifying for admission based on objective qualifications, like grades. The onus is on schools to enhance outreach to prospective minority applicants.
In addition, admissions committees can enhance diversity by placing a greater focus on subjective criteria. Many graduate programs no longer require G.R.E. scores as part of their admissions decisions. Schools can focus on personal statements and recommendation letters in evaluating a minority applicant's potential to contribute an underrepresented perspective.
In my work at civil and human rights organizations, I have observed that the shortage of disadvantaged minorities is a disservice to their very missions of promoting equality and justice. Schools occupy an influential yet precarious position in remedying societal inequality.
NEEL KANT AGRAWAL Seattle, Oct. 19, 2011
The writer is a law librarianship student at the University of Washington Information School.
Mr. Lowsen suggests the use of economic status as a substitute for racial preferences. I would add another layer of data for consideration: the educational attainment and socioeconomic status of the student's parents and grandparents. I would propose that there be preferences for students born into multigenerational poverty or who are the first to apply for college in their families.
L. M. CAMPOS Jamaica, Queens, Oct. 19, 2011
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Lowsen's suggestion. In terms of diversity, exposure to people from different economic circumstances is at least as important as exposure to people from different races and cultures. And this approach would clearly be much fairer, and would still foster racial diversity so long as race and income continue to be correlated. It is patently unfair that the child of wealthy, well-educated African-American parents should have an advantage over the child of working-class white parents.
I suspect that the increase in economic diversity would be greatest at the most elite universities, which disproportionately educate the country's future leaders. For the country's good, these people should have some exposure to those from less privileged backgrounds.
RACHEL KREIER Port Jefferson, N.Y., Oct. 19, 2011
The Writer Responds
Mr. Goode is right to point out the innate quality of racial prejudice. Public recognition of innate prejudice is the starting point for discussion, but not the end. Our goal is building a society with opportunity and a voice for all. Mr. Agrawal's practical suggestions for admissions committees show that the soul of affirmative action lies in how we use it to reach the goal, not in any particular interpretation.
In an ideal world we would not need to use affirmative action, as Ms. Stephenson suggests. But simply ignoring the realities of racial prejudice and economic inequality would close the door of opportunity to talented people whose only faults lie in the circumstances of their birth.
Clearly, we need to do something. But census data raise serious doubts about whether affirmative action has been effective in addressing racial economic inequality, or if it has only eased certain symptoms while leaving the disease untreated.
As long as we continue to seek a more equitable society, changing our interpretation of affirmative action will not impede us. BEN LOWSENAlexandria, Va., Oct. 20, 2011

HEADLINE: Talking Their Way Out of a Population Crisis

BYLINE: By HELEN EPSTEIN

 BODY:
Helen Epstein is the author of ''The Invisible Cure: Africa, the West and the Fight Against AIDS.''
THE world's seven billionth person is about to be born, according to the United Nations Population Division. Before this century ends, there could well be 10 billion of us, a billion more than previously expected. Nearly all of these extra billion people will be born in Africa, where women in some countries bear seven children each on average, and only 1 in 10 uses contraception. With mortality rates from disease falling, the population of some countries could increase eightfold in the next century.
Africa's future matters to all of us. Globalization, to say nothing of shared interest in scarce resources, connects our fates. In many parts of Africa, people already scramble to obtain food, land and water, and discontent provides fertile ground for extremism. So it is important to think carefully about the response to Africa's exploding population.
Early next year, researchers will publish findings that provide good, if surprising, news: relaxed, trusting and frank conversations between men and women may be the most effective contraceptive of all. 
We know this from Western history. In Europe and the United States, birthrates plummeted between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. A research team led by Ansley J. Coale of Princeton University discovered in the 1980s that this had nothing to do with modern contraceptives, which had not yet been invented, or with government policies. Noting that great shifts in family size seemed to spread like a germ from one Western country to another starting more than two centuries ago, the Australian demographer John Caldwell speculated that the germ was cultural -- it was the very idea that childbearing was something couples could discuss openly and decide for themselves.
Since then, many researchers have found that spousal communication is a powerful predictor of both contraceptive use and smaller family size. The converse is also true: wherever such discussions are silenced by churches, governments, patriarchy or puritanism, birthrates remain high.
Could a ''contraceptive talking cure'' work in Africa in our own century? It just might, and the evidence comes from somewhere almost no one has thought to look: Africa's evangelical churches, long seen as the bane of family planning programs everywhere.
A Columbia University demographer, James F. Phillips, stumbled upon this curious finding about 10 years ago. He and a group of Ghanaian colleagues had spent a decade trying to encourage contraceptive use in the Kassena-Nankana district of northern Ghana, with little success. When they began their work in 1990, the Kassena-Nankana people were among the poorest in the world and losing one child in four to disease and malnutrition. They saw large families as an asset, and the entire culture of these rugged people was devoted to reproduction.
Family planning was not even open to discussion. Women who refused to have sex with their husbands, or who tried to use contraception secretly, were beaten. ''If the man's penis is up,'' explained one, ''unless it enters into the vagina, it won't lie down. So allow him to have his sex and only then can you be free. Is it not better to have the sex than to have the beating?'' When asked about family planning, another woman said, ''If you talk about such issues, you are a fool.''
A team of doctors from the Ghana Health Service created a program to send nurses from hut to hut on motorized scooters treating sick children and pregnant women and offering contraceptive pills and injections. Ten years later, child mortality had fallen by 70 percent. But most women were still afraid to even discuss family planning.
Dr. Phillips and his Ghanaian colleagues knew that for family planning programs to succeed, they would also have to empower women to use contraception. But how?
At first, they organized special ''durbars'' -- all-male political gatherings presided over by the village chief -- to help explain to men that family planning would make their women and children healthier and stronger. These efforts weren't very successful.
Then the team noticed two things: Their data clearly showed that large numbers of women were having fewer children, whether or not they lived near the experimental family planning programs. And large numbers of evangelical preachers were establishing churches in the Ghanaian hinterlands to which, every Sunday, Kassena-Nankana women dressed in Western-style finery headed in droves.
Dr. Phillips assigned a student to see what effect the churches were having on contraceptive behavior. To their amazement, they found that female Christian converts were three times as likely to use family planning as women who retained their traditional African faith, and had significantly smaller families.
The churches certainly didn't promote family planning. But, despite their defense of patriarchal family values, many churches were giving women a voice denied them by their own culture.
TRADITIONALLY, Kassena-Nankana women are not involved in everyday decision making, even about household matters. But the born-again women were forming committees, making speeches and organizing outings, fund-raisers and other activities. Tradition in Kassena-Nankana also forbids women to communicate with ancestors and other spiritual beings; only men can do that. But the Christian women were speaking directly to Jesus about their problems. He was, many of them may have felt, the first man ever to listen. This may have given them a language for speaking to mortal men as well, even about such sensitive matters as contraception.
Dr. Phillips and his colleagues began wondering how to give the Kassena-Nankana women a voice in their own traditional culture. A decade ago, they urged elders there to admit women to the traditionally male-only health and family planning durbars.
At one of the first events, a woman spoke of the burden placed on women by men who demanded that they produce so many children. The official translator refused to interpret her words for the researchers, but the local women in the crowd went wild with enthusiasm.
Dr. Phillips's team also recruited male scouts to keep an ear to the ground for gossip about men who beat their wives, and to then visit them and urge them to stop. According to the forthcoming journal article, since the start of the program wife beating has declined and the fertility rate has fallen to 3.5 children per woman, a drop of more than one birth.
These powerful findings hint at a deeper phenomenon. Being able to express oneself and exchange ideas without fear of reprisal may be the very essence of empowerment, and potentially more important to lowering birthrates than money or access to health services, or even education. The individual human voice, a tool available even to the poorest people, may be the key not just to population control, but to Africa's broader political and economic development as well.

HEADLINE: Bank's Collapse In Europe Points To Global Risks

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
As Europe's debt crisis has deepened, a recurring question is how much risk it poses to the United States economy, and especially American banks.
While American financial institutions have sought to limit any damage by reducing their loans and thus lowering their direct exposure to Europe's problems, the recent rescue of the Belgian-French bank Dexia shows that there are indirect exposures that are less known and understood -- and potentially worrisome.
Dexia's problems are not entirely caused by Europe's debt crisis, but some issues in its case are a matter of broader debate. Among them are how much of a bailout banks should get, and the size of the losses they should take on loans that governments cannot repay.
Among Dexia's biggest trading partners are several large United States institutions, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. To limit damage from Dexia's collapse, the bailout fashioned by the French and Belgian governments may make these banks and other creditors whole -- that is, paid in full for potentially tens of billions of euros they are owed. This would enable Dexia's creditors and trading partners to avoid losses they might otherwise suffer without the taxpayer rescue. 
Whether this sets a precedent if Europe needs to bail out other banks will be closely watched. The debate centers on how much of a burden taxpayers should bear to support banks that made ill-advised loans or trades.
Many on Wall Street and in government argue that rescues are essential, to avoid the risk of destabilizing the financial system -- with one bank's failure to pay its obligations leading to problems at other banks. But others counter that the rescue of Dexia is reminiscent of the United States' decision to fully protect big banks that were the trading partners of the American International Group when it collapsed, a decision that was sharply questioned and examined by Congress.
Critics warn of a replay of the financial crisis in autumn 2008, when governments used taxpayer money to shore up troubled companies, then allowed them to transfer those funds to their trading partners to protect those institutions from losses. In using public money to rescue private institutions, these critics say, policy makers effectively rewarded banks that traded with companies that were in trouble, rather than penalizing them, and that encouraged risky behavior.
''The question is did the A.I.G. experience and the bailouts generally contribute to the current situation?'' asked Jonathan Koppell, director of the School of Public Affairs at Arizona State University. Would the banks, he continued, ''have had a different view in dealing with Greece -- or with Dexia for that matter -- if those who had dealt with A.I.G. hadn't been made whole?''
Given the global and interconnected nature of the financial system, institutions around the world have other types of indirect risk to European debt problems. But the scope of these ties is not fully known, because the exposure is hidden by complex transactions that do not have to be reported in detail.
Dexia, which was bailed out by France and Belgium once before, in 2008, is just a small piece of the broader European debt and banking turmoil. But its collapse comes at a critical point, as European officials are meeting this weekend to work out how taxpayer money should be used to resolve the Continent's debt crisis.
The most acrimonious debate has been over the amount of losses banks should suffer for lending hundreds of billions of euros to countries that may not be able to fully repay. In the case of Greece, big lenders in Europe have tentatively agreed to swallow modest losses on what they are owed, but are resisting proposals that would force them to take a much bigger hit. Even if they accept losses, they may then seek tens or hundreds of billions in capital infusions from their governments.
As the Dexia bailout deal closed last week and was approved by the French Parliament, officials overseeing the restructuring say that the bank will meet all of its obligations in full. Alexandre Joly, the head of strategy, portfolios and market activities at Dexia, said in an interview that the idea of forcing Dexia's trading partners to accept a discount on what they are owed ''is a monstrous idea.'' He added, ''It is not compatible with rules governing the euro zone, and it has never, ever been considered to our knowledge by any government in charge of the supervision of the banks.''
While several government officials in France and Belgium agree that they expect to allow Dexia to use its rescue money to pay its trading partners in full, others said a final decision had not been made. Representatives for Dexia's trading partners, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, said they were not concerned about exposure to Dexia.
Dexia has suffered in several lines of business, including investments in sovereign debt from countries like Greece. But the biggest drain on its cash stemmed from a series of complex, wrong-way bets it made on interest rates related to its municipal lending business. A significant part of Dexia's business is lending money to these localities at a fixed interest rate for relatively long periods, say 10 years. But, because the interest rate that the bank itself pays to finance its operations fluctuates, that exposes it to potential risk. If its cost of borrowing exceeds the interest it charges on loans outstanding, it loses money.
To protect itself, Dexia entered into transactions with other banks. But in doing so, it made a major miscalculation and protected itself only if interest rates rose. Instead, interest rates fell, and according to Dexia's trade agreements, Dexia had to post billions of euros in collateral to institutions on the opposite side of its trades, like Commerzbank of Germany, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.
Dexia is also suffering losses on about 11 billion euros ($15.3 billion) in credit insurance it has written on mortgage-related securities, the same instruments that felled A.I.G., echoing that insurer's troubles. In this business, too, Dexia's problems have been worsened by aggressive demands by some trading partners for additional collateral. According to a person briefed on the transactions, Goldman Sachs, one of Dexia's biggest trading partners, has asked for collateral equal to nearly twice the decline in market value of its deals. As was the case with A.I.G., Dexia must provide the collateral when the prices of the underlying securities fall, even if they have not defaulted.
In all, Dexia has had to post 43 billion euros to its trading partners to offset potential losses, up from 26 billion at the end of April and 15 billion at the end of 2008. The bank's need for cash to meet these demands drained its coffers, and contributed to its need for a government bailout. The Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments provided a guarantee of up to 90 billion euros to Dexia, and Belgium purchased part of it outright.
Dexia declined to specify how much money had already gone to each trading partner. A Commerzbank spokesman declined to comment. Jeanmarie McFadden, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, said that the bank's exposure to Dexia was immaterial and that Morgan Stanley had received adequate collateral to cover it. Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman, said ''we have no reason to believe that Dexia will not continue to meet its contractual obligations after it is restructured.''
As for the aggressive collateral calls by Goldman, Mr. van Praag said: ''Our dealings with Dexia have been perfectly normal. In an environment of widening credit spreads and increased volatility, collateral calls are to be expected.'' The suggestion that Goldman has been more aggressive than Dexia's other trading partners is ''quite odd,'' he said, adding: ''If collateral is owed, we ask for it.'' Mr. Joly of Dexia said the bank did not have ''significant issues'' with Goldman over collateral owed on some contracts.
Economists and financial players are closely watching how European officials handle Dexia's financial contracts, which span the globe, to see what that might mean for other European banks that might need government support. As trading partners demand more cash, those demands could consume more of the money put up by the Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments.
''We know what the guarantees are that the government put down, but you don't know how much the taxpayer will end up paying,'' said Paul De Grauwe, a professor of economics at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. ''I'm pretty sure there are other banks in Europe that have done similar things and may be caught in the crisis that is now brewing. I don't think this is an isolated incident.''
It may be difficult for European governments to avoid making bank trading partners whole, especially American institutions, since the United States government paid full value to foreign banks that dealt with A.I.G. and also opened Federal Reserve programs to troubled foreign banks. Dexia, for example, leaned heavily on emergency lending programs created by the Fed during the depths of the financial crisis. At its peak borrowing near the end of 2008, Dexia received $58.5 billion from the Fed.
Some financial players may also argue that since France and Belgium took equity stakes in Dexia in 2008 -- as part of the government bailout then -- there was an implicit guarantee of the company's obligations, similar to that of the housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States.
Walker F. Todd, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said governments were setting a troubling precedent when they bailed out a company and paid its trading partners in full, as occurred with A.I.G. and as might occur with Dexia.
''In the short run, it would help if the authorities would say they refuse to provide publicly funded money for the payoffs of derivatives,'' he said. ''This is like using public funds to support your local casino. It is difficult to see how this is good for society in the long run.''

HEADLINE: Of Course, She's Worried

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES

 BODY:
My husband's closest friends have three children, each with a separate behavioral diagnosis (A.D.H.D., Asperger's, dyslexia). The mother spends a tremendous amount of time researching and navigating this world. Unfortunately, it's all she talks about, in a stream of medical jargon. Worse, she's constantly relating their diagnoses to my children's behavior. ''Are you worried he's on the spectrum?'' she'll ask, when my 4-year-old spins in the backyard with a bubble wand. How should I deal with this? Stephanie, Boston
If you only have a hammer, the expression goes, everything looks like a nail. 
Your friend has not chosen a hobby, Stephanie -- like denim-bedazzling or hot yoga. She has immersed herself in behavioral disorders to be a better parent to her children. So, it's no surprise that the dulcet tones of medical jargon have seeped into her vocabulary -- or that she spies markers in every kiddie in her path. The poor woman is on lookout for them 24/7.
Why not ''Try a Little Tenderness'' (as Aretha Franklin so beautifully sang it)? No doubt your pal would happily forget everything she knows about these conditions, faster than you could mash up a Ritalin tablet, if her children were magically free from them. Still, it must be very aggravating (and possibly frightening) to have a walking Merck Manual with a diagnosis every time your little ones turn around. Next time she pathologizes your backyard twirler, just say, ''Our pediatrician tells us he's fine.'' And remember: It's true!
I don't mean to minimize your annoyance. But in the scheme of things, I'd cut this mom some slack.
Take a Number, Please
On Saturday, I waited in line about 10 minutes at my local bakery to buy bread. When I was next, an older (but not elderly) woman walked in and approached the counter. I told her she was cutting the line. She replied, ''I was only going to ask a question.'' And I said, ''You can get in line to ask it.'' She stormed out with the words ''New Yorkers!'' My wife thinks I was wrong. What do you think?
Steve Downey, Manhattan
Well, if you'd let the older woman go first, and she'd bought the last loaf of marble rye, forcing you to chase her out of the bakery and wrench it from her hands, you'd have made an excellent episode of ''Seinfeld.'' (And condolences to the family of Frances Bay, the wonderful old bird who played the marble rye victim on ''Seinfeld,'' who died last month at 92.)
Now, back to you, Steve. Technically, you are correct. First come first served means exactly that: for purchases, questions and flirting with the counter help. But personally, if someone (old or young) called out: ''Is any of your bread gluten-free?'' before joining the line, I'd be inclined to let him slide. Then again, I am a transplanted New Yorker, and possibly soft on bakery scofflaws.
Sympathize
I am the new director of a small nonprofit arts organization. The founder and former director periodically asks that I send condolence cards from the organization to families of supporters who have lost loved ones. It seems reasonable to remember the family's commitment to our cause. But it was the founder who had these relationships, not I. Shouldn't she write the notes? I'm also concerned that a card may look like an opportunistic request for a memorial donation. Elise
Kudos for being sensitive to people in sensitive circumstances, New Director. But you'd better get comfy soliciting money, too, or your small arts organization will go the way of many others in this economic downturn -- and I don't mean to Lincoln Center. The founder's desire to shift allegiances from herself to the organization seems smart and forward-thinking. So, write the notes. Just don't include any self-addressed envelopes for cash or checks.
When Not to Groom
I've had two meals recently with two old friends, miles and months apart, both of whom played with their feet while we were chatting and eating. I didn't speak up at the time, but thought of saying: ''I'll wait while you wash your hands.'' Obviously, I survived these encounters. But how much must we endure for the sake of old friendships?
C. B., Chicago
A good, old friend, conservatively speaking, is worth about two million foot fondles. And your suggested line about hand-washing seems a little strict to me. Here are a couple of alternatives: ''Something the matter with your foot?'' you might ask, hopefully making them conscious of their gross behavior. Or schedule pedicures with your club sandwiches. That way, someone else will be touching their feet.

HEADLINE: Building a House of Wax

BYLINE: By DAVID GIFFELS

 BODY:
In the heart of postindustrial Cleveland, in one of those cheery urban-reclamation areas with freshly painted brick buildings and almost unnaturally green lawn spaces, you'll find Gotta Groove Records, one of around 20 plants in the United States that still press vinyl. On the day I visited, the guts of this converted elevator factory were packed with hissing, clanking vintage record presses, and the walls were lined with band fliers and colored LPs. A dry-erase board at the far end of the shop displayed the day's jobs, Tom Waits and Tim Buckley among them.
Gotta Groove's owner, a square-jawed, 55-year-old former corporate attorney named Vince Slusarz, explained why he was running such a seemingly outmoded operation. He spent 24 years with a water-processing-equipment manufacturer, he said, eventually rising to become the chief operating officer. But when he finally left the company in 2008, right around the time the economy was starting to implode, he had to figure out something else to do. 
''I wanted to start a business and see what that was like,'' he said. ''I wanted to do something in manufacturing, because I really believe that's important for this country. And I wanted to do something in Cleveland.''
He toyed with the idea of craft brewing. But as a middle-aged music fan who still had his old LPs, he was intrigued that his college-age daughter had suddenly begun buying vinyl. So he researched the industry, which led him to visit a record plant in Newark that was liquidating its equipment. He bought all of it on the spot and imported it back home. Before long, Gotta Groove was up and running. Its initial run of 100 records took two weeks to complete. Now the company turns out about 20,000 units over the same period of time.
''All these kids getting into vinyl for the first time -- I think it's a reaction to the constant interruptions in our life,'' Slusarz said. ''We're used to instant everything. But to listen to a record, you have to put it on, you have to turn it over. It engages you more.''
He's clearly on to something. This calendar year, Gotta Groove will turn its first profit, in no small part because the LP is the fastest-growing segment of the beleaguered music industry. Last year, 2.8 million vinyl records were sold in the United States, according to the Nielsen Company, which tracks music sales through its SoundScan system. This year's numbers are about 40 percent higher, and the real figures are higher still. Most vinyl now is sold in independent record shops, at rock clubs and through homemade Web sites.
''SoundScan only gets about 15 percent,'' Slusarz told me, smiling. ''The majority of the stuff we press, it doesn't even have a bar code.''
The 11 full-time employees at Gotta Groove -- most of them musicians, sound engineers and vinyl collectors who've been dubbed the Gotta Groovies -- seemed less interested in the bottom line and more into working a job that allows them to talk about and be around music all day. Mitch Ribis, an Iraq war veteran who moonlights with the noise-rock band Fascist Insect, methodically slid finished records into a cardboard shipping box. He asked Slusarz for a job after his band made a record here. Lisa Paulovcin, in loose pigtails, peppered me with music-related questions, including what my favorite Cure album was.
'' 'Head on the Door'?'' I answered hesitantly.
''I knew it!'' she said.
Most of Gotta Groove's records run through the presses automatically, but some custom jobs -- colored or etched vinyl; swirly finishes -- require a higher level of craft. In the middle of the 7,000-square-foot space, I watched as Heather Gmucs hacked a warm, hockey-puck-size disc of red vinyl in two with a kitchen knife. Quickly, she set one half aside and aligned the other with a matching gray half-puck.
Lifting up onto the tips of her brown Chuck Taylors, Gmucs then set the two pieces of hardening vinyl onto a heated silver mold called a stamper and flipped a switch. The plates closed in on each other like a waffle iron, causing the material to soften, merge and press flat as the excess goo spilled out over the edges. Moments later, Gmucs removed a bicolor slab of obscure '90s Christian metalcore: Zao's ''Liberate Te Ex Inferis.'' It took her a little over a minute to make one record; now she only needed to produce about 50 more to fill the 100-LP order.
Until recently, she was the bassist in a popular Cleveland art-punk band called HotChaCha. ''But I quit,'' she said, holding the record up for inspection with a cotton-gloved hand. ''Because I really love doing this.''

HEADLINE: Space Agency Is Considering Fuel Depots In the Skies

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
By considering a proposal to put filling stations in the sky, NASA is looking to accelerate plans to send astronauts to distant destinations.
The filling stations -- NASA calls them propellant depots -- would refuel a spacecraft in orbit before it headed out to the moon, an asteroid or eventually Mars. Currently, all of the fuel needed for a mission is carried up with the rocket, and the weight of the fuel limits the size of the spacecraft.
Next month, engineers will meet at NASA headquarters in Washington to discuss how propellant depots could be used to reach farther into space and make possible more ambitious missions using the heavy-lift rocket that NASA is planning to build. The discussions grow out of a six-month NASA study of propellant depots, completed in July. 
However, the space agency has rejected the study's most radical conclusion: that NASA could forgo the heavy-lift and use existing smaller rockets, combined with fuel depots, to reach its targets more quickly and less expensively. Those targets, for the next two decades at least, include a return to the moon or a visit to an asteroid. (A trip to Mars is unlikely until at least the 2030s.)
''This study highlights some interesting benefits of depots, but it is too singularly focused,'' William H. Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator for NASA's human exploration and operations directorate, said in a statement. ''NASA is actively studying depots and how they can be used with other proposed elements to provide the lowest cost, sustainable exploration plan.''
Under the plan outlined in the document, the propellant depot would be launched first, and then other rockets would carry fuel to the depot before a spacecraft arrived to fill up. That would increase the complexity for an asteroid mission -- 11 to 17 launchings instead of four -- but could get NASA astronauts to an asteroid by 2024, the study said. The total budget needed for the project from 2012 through 2030 would be $60 billion to $86 billion, the study said.
By contrast, a study last year that designed an asteroid mission around a heavy-lift rocket estimated that it would cost $143 billion and that the trip could not happen until 2029. The earlier study briefly considered propellant depots but quickly dismissed them.
Last month, NASA announced the design of the Space Launch System, the new heavy-lift rocket. The goal is for it to lift 70 metric tons on its first unmanned test flight in 2017, and to be developed into a version capable of lifting 130 tons. The blueprint for NASA's direction for the coming years, passed by Congress last year and signed by President Obama, calls on the agency to develop just that rocket.
Critics say the expense of developing and operating the massive new rocket, particularly in an era of tight federal budgets, would doom the project.
At a Congressional hearing in July, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, asked Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the NASA administrator, about the possibility of depots as an alternative to the Space Launch System. General Bolden said that he did not know details about any propellant depot study, but that his agency had looked at alternatives to building a heavy-lift. ''It turned out that was not as economical, nor as reliable,'' he said.
Although General Bolden promised to provide the information, Mr. Rohrabacher said he had obtained the study about propellant depots only through unofficial channels.
''I'm shocked that the leadership in NASA would try to keep a report as significant as this away from decision makers of the legislative branch,'' Mr. Rohrabacher said, adding that the study gave him ''the ammunition to make a case'' to revisit NASA's plans for human spaceflight.
Propellant depots carry risks, too. Fuels like liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen must be kept at ultracold temperatures and, unless the depots were heavily insulated, would boil away over time. And transferring fuel in the weightlessness of space is not straightforward, although perhaps simply setting the depot and spacecraft into a slow spin would generate enough force to push the fuel into the spacecraft.
''It's not a simple thing to transfer cryogenic propellant, on the ground, much less in space,'' said Eugene M. Henderson, an engineer at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, who is one of about 20 people who worked on the study. ''It's a big variable.''
Still, he described the technical challenges as ''fairly trivial'' and said demonstration projects could show that the technology is feasible.

THE END
The Defiance and Destruction of Hitler's Germany, 1944-45
By Ian Kershaw
Illustrated. 564 pp. The Penguin Press. $35.
By the morning of April 18, 1945, the war in Ansbach, a picturesque town in southern Germany, was just about over. With the Wehrmacht in retreat and the United States Army a few miles away, surrender seemed the only option. But Ansbach's military commander, a middle-aged air force colonel named Ernst Meyer, was determined to fight to the bitter end. In an effort to avert a catastrophe, Robert Limpert, a 19-year-old theology student, destroyed what he thought were the phone lines between the town and local army headquarters. Turned in by two members of the Hitler Youth, Limpert was arrested, summarily tried and publicly executed while a crowd of his fellow citizens, some cheering, most silent, looked on. A few hours later, after Meyer had fled and Ansbach was captured without a fight, American troops cut down Limpert's body from where it had been left hanging in the town hall square. 
What happened that sunny spring day in Ansbach captures many of the elements Ian Kershaw examines in his powerful new book: a core of die-hard fanatics, an obedient and still functioning state structure and, perhaps most striking of all, a compliant public that did nothing to interfere with the dying regime's final murderous spasms.
In one important respect, Ansbach was unusually fortunate. At the last minute Colonel Meyer lost the courage of his convictions, and so the town was spared the full measure of destruction suffered by millions of Germans in the terrible twilight of Hitler's Reich.
''The End'' tells the story of the German war from the aftermath of the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in July 1944 until late May 1945 when, three weeks after the Fuhrer's suicide, his successors were arrested and their government dissolved. This is, the subtitle tells us, a tale of both defiance and destruction. As Kershaw shows in harrowing detail, the sheer quantity of human suffering in World War II's concluding chapter defies imagination. During the first four months of 1945, the Allies dropped 471,000 tons of bombs on German cities, twice as much as in all of 1943. Tens of thousands of people died, millions were left homeless. In the east, millions desperately sought to escape the horrors of rape and murder inflicted by invading Soviet troops, who were intent on avenging the German Army's barbaric occupation of their homeland.
Military casualties alone were horrendous: almost half the German soldiers who died in the war were killed in its last 10 months. And of course those who suffered most were the Nazi regime's own victims, forced laborers from all over conquered Europe, prisoners of war on the Eastern front and especially the surviving remnant of Europe's Jews, many of whom perished on senseless death marches that emptied concentration camps before they could be captured by enemy forces. In Auschwitz, for example, where over a million people had been murdered, only 7,000 ill and starving inmates remained when Soviet troops arrived in January 1945.
In the face of escalating military disasters, some German soldiers deserted, but most continued to fight. In the face of relentless bombing and devastating ground warfare, many civilians despaired, but few rebelled. Despite huge dislocations and disruptions, the machinery of the state ground on. Newspapers were printed, wages paid, mail delivered, ''defeatists'' tried and executed.
No one is better qualified to tell this grim story than Kershaw, the author of several essential studies of Nazi Germany, including a definitive two-volume biography of Hitler. A master of both the vast scholarly literature on Nazism and the extraordinary range of its published and unpublished record, Kershaw combines vivid accounts of particular human experiences with wise reflections on big interpretive and moral issues.
At the core of Kershaw's book is a single set of questions: Why did the regime last long after the war was obviously lost, why did the German Army keep fighting to the end and why, in the final hours of its existence, were the citizens of Nazi Germany willing and able to take the lives of those few who, like Robert Limpert, tried to avert more pointless destruction?
There are, Kershaw recognizes, no simple answers to these questions. It is true that Germany's opponents made serious tactical errors that probably delayed the war's end, but neither these errors nor the Allies' insistence on unconditional surrender decisively affected the prolonged agony of the endgame. The decisive factors are all to be found in Germany itself, in what Kershaw calls the ''structures of rule and mentalities'' that kept the regime going at such enormous cost, long after any hope of victory had been extinguished.
Kershaw shows how, despite his physical frailty, psychological instability and increasing isolation, Hitler retained his charismatic authority until Soviet troops were within a few blocks of his underground hide-out. This charisma, together with the ambitions and illusions of those around him, enabled the Fuhrer to compel obedience from the four most powerful men in Germany -- Martin Bormann, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler and Albert Speer -- and from most of the institutions they controlled in the party, the security services and the economy.
But for these institutions to function, the armed forces had to maintain the will and ability to delay the Allies' inexorable advance. To explain the amazing endurance of the Wehrmacht, Kershaw must shift his focus, because outside of Hitler's immediate circle of military advisers -- all of whom had been carefully selected for their belief in his genius -- the spell of the Fuhrer's charisma was less potent. Most generals continued to give and obey orders out of self-interest (Hitler had lavishly rewarded them with tax-free gifts of land and money), fear (of both the enemy and their own government) and a warped sense of duty and patriotism.
What about the population as a whole, the millions of ordinary Germans who fought in the army, worked in the factories and served the state in countless ways? Among them was certainly a minority who, despite everything, continued to believe Hitler would somehow save them. But by the beginning of 1945, the public's faith in its leader and in the possibility of victory had significantly diminished, leaving in its place fear of the regime's terror apparatus and of the invading Soviets, along with a pervasive fatalism. Most Germans faced the end with a mixture of resignation and disillusion that left little room for anything but their own struggle to survive.
Kershaw's analysis works best when he is discussing the military and civilian elites. He convincingly uncovers the compound of personal loyalty, ideological conviction and selfish calculation that motivated those at the apex of power. The further we move from the top, however, the more difficult it becomes to find satisfactory explanations for the country's continued capacity to function. Kershaw succeeds in clearing away a great many misconceptions, he deploys an impressive amount of evidence about the variety and complexity of public opinion and he brilliantly describes the ghastly fate of many ordinary Germans. No one has written a better account of the human dimensions of Nazi Germany's end. But despite his enormous learning and remarkable interpretive skills, we remain perplexed by the widespread passivity of the majority of those who, like that crowd around the gallows in Ansbach, continued to obey a government that had nothing left to offer them but death and destruction.

HEADLINE: A Century of Chevy, From Cheap Date to America's Sweetheart

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT, JAMES G. COBB, PHIL PATTON, STUART ELLIOTT, JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN and NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
Its Impalas dropped us off at school. Its pickup trucks hauled our produce on the farm. Its Corvette sustained our sports car fantasies through the boredom of high school algebra class. Earlier than almost any other automotive brand, Chevy created a palette of vehicles that ranged from the small and thrifty to the sleek and sporty to the large and smartly trimmed.
Once the model line expanded beyond the limited body selections of its first half-century, there was a Chevy for almost everyone. The brand's broad appeal resulted in a place atop the sales charts starting in the 1930s and continuing nearly uncontested for decades. By the mid-1960s Chevrolet sold nearly three million cars and light-duty trucks a year.
But there's more to the story than commercial success. Although it occupied the first rung of Alfred P. Sloan's General Motors hierarchy, a ladder on which customers would move up to more expensive brands as they gained affluence, Chevy developed a following of fans whose devotion lasted a lifetime. After decades of decline, Chevrolet has lately had a resurgence with its Cruze and Malibu sedans, the reinvented Camaro and the Volt, the first mass-produced plug-in hybrid. 
The full Chevrolet story has filled volumes. Here are some highlights of the 100-year journey.
EARLY DAYS
IN a fateful twist of Chevrolet history, the man who lent his name to the automaker is largely forgotten.
Louis Chevrolet was the Mario Andretti of his day. He barnstormed the country, consistently beating the likes of Barney Oldfield. He escaped horrible crashes that claimed the lives of lesser and unluckier drivers, and won the admiration of those considering the purchase of a newfangled horseless carriage.
The Swiss-born Chevrolet was flamboyant, swashbuckling, outspoken and charismatic. He had a bushy mustache, a foppish grin and he chain-smoked smelly yellow French cigarettes.
In 1909, Chevrolet was hired to drive for the Buick racing team. Of course, the entrepreneurial William C. Durant, who founded General Motors, wanted to find a way to leverage Chevrolet's name to his advantage. At first it was enough that the driver's prowess in racing Buicks to victory helped to put that company on its way to sales success.
But Durant, who lost control of G.M. in 1910 after a failed bid to buy Ford, saw a bigger opportunity for Louis Chevrolet than merely selling Buicks. So after acquiring the Little automobile company, Durant sought out the race driver to start yet another auto brand. Louis agreed, and on Nov. 3, 1911, Chevrolet's formation was announced; Louis designed and engineered the large, powerful 6-cylinder automobile that bore his name.
''It was a marvelous machine -- the Model C, as it was called,'' said Jay Leno, a collector and admirer of Chevrolets. ''It was one of the finest and fastest automobiles of the day. It just didn't sell well. It was too expensive.''
Pressured by Durant to come up with a lower-price automobile to compete with the Ford Model T, Louis said he did not want his name associated with a cheaper car. By 1914, Louis offered to sell his stock in the company, and Durant readily agreed.
After Louis moved on, Durant began rebadging the smaller, inexpensive Littles as Chevrolets, and they found willling buyers. By 1916, Chevrolet had generated enough profits for Durant to buy back control of G.M., into which he merged Chevrolet.
With the 1918 introduction of the Model D, powered by an 8-cylinder engine, Chevrolet sought to further increase its sales and market share and challenge Ford. But the low-cost 4-cylinder models continued as the big sellers. In 1927, when Ford's River Rouge plant was shut for a time, Chevrolet briefly took the industry's sales lead.
For its 1929 models, Chevrolet made a huge gamble. While other carmakers were promoting the use of lightweight aluminum, 8-cylinder motors and the advantage of large displacement, Chevrolet seemingly backtracked, introducing a cast-iron 6-cylinder. As the economy slumped, the engine's once-derisive nickname -- the Stovebolt Six -- was transformed into a selling point: ''A Six for the Price of a Four.''
And what of Louis Chevrolet? He went on to form two more automobile companies, Cornelian and Frontenac, which made the car in which his brother Gaston won the 1920 Indianapolis 500. After Gaston died in a racing accident, Louis left the auto industry and began designing aircraft engines with his brother Arthur; his ''Chevrolair 333'' and a brief association with an aviation pioneer, Glenn L. Martin, formed the basis for Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin).
But Chevrolet, despite his engineering and mechanical genius, never lasted long in any partnership. He died in Detroit, virtually penniless and largely unremembered, on June 6, 1941. He was 62.

POPULAR CULTURE
AMERICANS who grew up alongside the Honda Accord or the Hyundai Elantra may not fully appreciate the chromed grip Chevrolet had on popular culture in an age when American wheels ruled the road.
In the 1950s, if you tuned in ''The Dinah Shore Chevy Show'' on your Magnavox console TV, you heard the host belting out ''See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet.'' Starting in 1960, on CBS, George Maharis and Martin Milner roamed ''Route 66'' in a new Corvette, looking for adventure, lending a hand to strangers in need and creating a desirable career goal -- having a cool car, but no permanent job or home address -- for countless young viewers.
Later in the decade, Chevrolet was a primary sponsor of several of the most popular comedies and dramas on television. Samantha, on ''Bewitched,'' parked her broom to cruise in a Chevelle. The Cartwrights of ''Bonanza'' rode horses on the Ponderosa, but during commercial breaks they rounded up Impalas and Chevy IIs.
On the radio, Chevys crowded out the Hot Rod Lincolns and Pink Cadillacs. By 2003, G.M. claimed that some 200 songs had already featured or mentioned Chevrolets. A sign in Detroit boasted, ''They don't write songs about Volvos.''
''Nothing can touch my 409,'' the Beach Boys bragged. In the days of surfer rock and street racing, the engine was so famous there was no need to identify the car. Don McLean drove his Chevy to the levee in ''American Pie,'' and Prince had a thing for a little red Corvette. Bob Seger, whose ''Like a Rock'' became the Chevy Trucks theme, practiced his night moves ''in the back seat of my '60 Chevy.''
At the movies, the sexiest Chevy, the Corvette, co-starred with hunks like Elvis Presley (''Clambake,'' 1967) and Mark Hamill (''Corvette Summer,'' 1978). In ''Terms of Endearment'' (1983), the washed-up astronaut played by Jack Nicholson memorably drove a Corvette with his feet -- into the ocean. That same year, in ''The Right Stuff,'' another space hero said that getting a 'Vette was one of best things about being an astronaut. -- JAMES G. COBB
DESIGN
''AN infamous rear end'' was Alfred P. Sloan Jr.'s complaint about Chevrolets of the early 1920's, and when he gained power at General Motors he had the problem fixed. Sloan, who oversaw G.M.'s growth into one of the world's largest corporations, saw Chevrolet as a way to challenge Henry Ford's dominant Model T: for just a little more money, Chevy would give you much more car, along with a bit of style.
By the late '20s, Chevys wore bright shades of Duco lacquer, a colorful contrast to black-only Fords. And Harley Earl's styling studios were turning out flourishes that appeared first on Cadillacs, then on Buicks and Oldsmobiles, and, eventually, on Chevrolets, trickling down Sloan's ''ladder of brands'' along with engineering innovations.
By 1936, G.M. was able to boast that all of its cars had full stamped-steel bodies -- even Chevrolet. Styling changes became frequent and rapid-fire, manufacturing customer discontent by rendering last year's cars instantly obsolete.
The succession of 1955, '56 and '57 Chevrolets -- three notably different twists on the same basic car -- may be the quintessential example of Detroit's annual model changes.
The tailfins that first appeared on late 1940s Cadillacs and reached unimagined heights through the '50s, arrived on the 1955 Chevrolet in muted form. But these were different: less extreme than Cadillac's, yet more jaunty -- like the sails of a fast racing sloop beside a full-rigged clipper.
The '57 Chevrolet, a design that long ago joined Elvis and the Stratocaster guitar as 1950s icons, wore other Freudian motifs: bulbous bumper breasts nicknamed Dagmars and hood-mounted ports inspired by the machine guns of fighter jets.
But there was another source of themes for Chevrolet. Corvette was the sports car subbrand, conceived in 1953, that provided a series of motifs in models like the Sting Ray that could be adapted to much more mundane cars. The succession of 1960s models offered clutches of 'Vette taillights, replicated in four- and six-packs on cars that even toddlers recognized as Chevrolets.
The reign of Bill Mitchell as G.M.'s top designer in the 1960s produced two generations of the sporty Corvair Monza and the 1967 Camaro pony car, G.M.'s response to the Ford Mustang.
Chevrolet has keenly reflected the national mood. The stance of a late 1960s Chevelle SS radiated confidence like an athlete who never suffered defeat. But the awkward and unreliable Citation of the early 1980s (called the worst car ever in a rant by Geoffrey Wolff in his novel ''Providence'') suggested an America that was frustrated and, after successive gas crises, in the throes of downsizing.
-- PHIL PATTON
MARKETING
WRAPPING an American flag around a brand has long been a popular way to peddle products -- to Americans, certainly, and sometimes to citizens of other countries (say, Coca-Cola and Levi's). In this country, no other automobile line -- and few brands of any kind -- have been as successful as Chevrolet with flag-waving pitches.
After years of unmemorable advertising slogans like ''Eye it, try it, buy it,'' the brand struck pay dirt with the theme ''See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet,'' as promulgated through a catchy jingle that became identified with the singer Dinah Shore after she sang it in two Chevy-sponsored television series that ran from 1951 to 1963.
In an era when the sponsors, not the networks, produced shows, Shore's enthusiastic performance helped to persaude a generation of car buyers that buying a Chevy was almost a patriotic duty. Indeed, who could not think that after listening to lyrics like these:
See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet,
America is asking you to call.
Drive your Chevrolet through the U.S.A.,
America is the greatest land of all.
(The jingle got a new lease on life in February, when the cast of ''Glee,'' in a special episode after Super Bowl XLV, sang the song in an elaborate Chevy Cruze commercial.)
Would it be overreaching to suggest that Chevrolet's identification with the American spirit helped it to become, and stay, the No. 1 car brand for so many years? G.M. kept strengthening that connection in subsequent years with ad themes like ''Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet'' (1975, revived in 2006), ''The heartbeat of America'' (1985) and ''An American revolution'' (2004).
Certainly there have been memorable Chevy ads without red, white and blue bunting. The current theme, ''Chevy runs deep,'' is flagless. But some aspects of a campaign to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Chevrolet brand take a ''See the U.S.A.'' tack.
For instance, an online video series, ''The Road We're On,'' at roadwereon.chevrolet.com, begins with the virtual unfolding of a road map. The first two episodes tell the story of Bridgeville, Pa., and the family-run Chevrolet dealership that opened there in 1918.
-- STUART ELLIOTT
RACING
IN 1920, Gaston Chevrolet, driving a car he and his brothers Louis and Arthur built, won the Indianapolis 500. But he wasn't in a Chevrolet.
Louis had co-founded the Chevrolet Motor Car Company, but by 1915 he had left to start two other companies, including Frontenac. So the Chevrolet brothers raced Frontenacs.
G.M. forbade racing in the early 1920s, a ban that held through the 1940s. But after World War II, as servicemen returned with a passion for performance cars, they were soon racing almost everything except 6-cylinder Chevrolets. By the early 1950s even G.M. was convinced that the market required a performance image. Chevrolet decided it would secure its place with a V-8 of its own.
In a December 1953 memo anticipating the engine to come a year later, Zora Arkus-Duntov, then a staff engineer, proposed that Chevrolet create a performance parts program for the engine. ''Since we cannot prevent people from racing Corvettes,'' the engineer wrote, ''maybe it is better to help them do a good job at it.''
The engineer's advice stuck, and Chevrolet established a performance parts program alongside the introduction of the 265-cubic inch V-8 for 1955.
The first fruit was the $59 Plus-Power option (known as the Power Pack) that included dual exhausts, a new intake manifold and a four-barrel carburetor. The option raised horsepower to 180, from 162, which was enough for Frank Christian to give Chevrolet's its first Nascar win, in the 100-mile Grand National race at the Columbia Speedway in South Carolina.
That ''small block'' V-8 has been racing ever since. Buck Baker won the 1957 Nascar championship with fuel-injected engines. Mark Donohue used small-block-powered Camaros to dominate and win SCCA Trans Am road racing championships.
Bill Jenkins's tube-frame Pro Stock Vega revolutionized N.H.R.A. drag racing in 1972. When all the factories officially pulled out of Nascar in the mid-1970s, the small-block V-8 roared back to prominence, in part through the inspired drives of Dale Earnhardt.
Chevrolet has had racing success with its larger V-8s. But it's the small block that is still at the heart of Chevrolet's racing success.

TECHNOLOGY
WHEN it comes to selling cars, few advertising boasts are more cherished than the claim to being first. For an automaker to declare that its car is first with a new feature is to proclaim inventiveness, boldness and exclusivity, all in a single word.
Chevrolet has only rarely been the leader in this pursuit. It was not first with electric starters (that was Cadillac, in 1912) nor did it pioneer the use of turbochargers (Oldsmobile was an early adopter, in the 1960s). This was no accident: General Motors let its higher-priced brands introduce the breakthroughs. Chevy was the value brand.
Instead, what the marque became known for was a sort of mechanical populism, bringing innovation to the masses. The 1929 Chevrolet was equipped with a 194-cubic-inch 6-cylinder engine that outclassed the 4-cylinder competition. The descendants of this workhorse, known as the Stovebolt Six, remained in production for decades.
When fuel injection arrived with the 1957 models (adding $484 to the $3,176 base price of a Corvette), it had already been in use by Mercedes-Benz. And the slick-shifting 4-speed manual transmission, also a new option for '57 ($188, the same as a Powerglide automatic) was already available, from Chevy's competitors.
When Chevy engineers developed a compact model, the Corvair, for 1960, it was unlike anything made in Detroit. But the car's formula for economy -- an air-cooled, rear-mounted engine -- had been refined in Volkswagens and Porsches.
Likewise, the concept of using aluminum castings to reduce a V-8's weight, successful in Can-Am racing and then in a small number of ZL-1 Corvettes and Camaros, had been done early in the '60s by Buick. The legwork paid off when the small block V-8 line spawned the LS1 version of 1997, and today lightweight Chevy V-8s are available in several models, including the Cadillac CTS-V.
Through its history, certainly, Chevy was first with any number of advances. But that is not its legacy, at least not for its mainstream vehicles. If there's a case to be made that Chevrolet has been typecast as the division that got the hand-me-downs, it's also true that it has done smart things with them. -- NORMAN MAYERSOHN
MISSTEPS
CHEVROLET may be celebrating its centennial, but along with the century's highlights are missteps too glaring to be ignored.
The 1917 Model D, for instance, was powered -- barely -- by a 288-cubic-inch overhead-valve V-8 that wheezed out 36 horsepower. It was short-lived, but at least it ran, unlike the 1923 ''copper-cooled'' 4-cylinder models, which used copper fins instead of water passages to inadequately cool its 135 cubic inches. Production was halted after five months, and all were recalled.
The 1960 Corvair aped Volkswagen's rear-mounted, air-cooled, opposed-piston engine. Unfortunately, Chevrolet also copied VW's diabolical swing-axle rear suspension, which could disastrously fold under the car on corners. Ralph Nader noticed, published ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' in 1965 and created America's first effective safety lobby.
The rust-prone 1971 Vega used a 4-cylinder engine with an aluminum block and iron cylinder head. When the engine overheated, the metals would distort differently, allowing coolant to leak past the head gasket. That damaged the cylinder walls. Almost two million Vegas had been sold when production was stopped after the 1977 models, and many owners swore off G.M. products for a generation -- or longer.
Short-sighted engineering resulted in some legendary maintenance challenges. To change the rearmost spark plugs of the optional V-8 in a 1975 Monza, mechanics had to loosen the engine mounts and raise the motor.
Engineered mostly by Opel, G.M.'s German division, the primitive 1976 Chevette was haphazardly made, sparsely trimmed and underpowered: its base 1.4-liter engine made only 52 horsepower.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalled the 1980 Citation, Chevy's first front-wheel-drive car, for brake problems (three times, in fact), steering gear that detached, fuel lines that leaked and suspension springs that slipped from their seats, among other things. Beyond that, the Citation was brutally unreliable.
The Corvette was not immune from missteps. By 1974, the mighty sports car had been strangled down to 250 horsepower by emissions laws. The next year, output dropped to a paltry 165 -- the lowest ever for a V-8 in a production Corvette. But that's not as bad as the rough-hewn Iron Duke 2.5-liter 4-cylinder used in the basic version of the 1982 Camaro. With only 90 horsepower, it was the only Camaro rated at less than 100 horses.
By 1990, however, Chevrolet seemed to have learned a lesson. A convertible version of the Beretta paced that year's Indianapolis 500, but never made it into production. G.M. found it just couldn't be engineered to the company's standards.
Not so quick: in 2010, word leaked that the company was seeking to ban the use of the Chevy nickname. Saner heads prevailed after public reaction made the absurdity of it all apparent, and the plan was dropped. -- JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN

HEADLINE: Covering Its Own Backyard

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
RICHARD AURELIO counts himself as an old-school newspaper reader. After a varied career as an editor at Newsday, a deputy mayor under John V. Lindsay and the Time Warner executive who founded the all-news New York One cable channel, Mr. Aurelio laments a change he sees in how The New York Times handles local coverage.
''As an ardent follower of The Times every day, the Metro section used to be a must-read. I remember during my time in government and in business I would often read the Metro section before the front section,'' he said. ''Now it is integrated into the front section, and one gets the sense that it has been downgraded, that The Times has become more of a national newspaper.''
Another change he can't get used to is the storytelling method he sometimes finds in The Times now -- quite different from the old just-the-facts approach. The current style emphasizes anecdotes, colorful phrasing and an edgier tone aimed at younger audiences. 
This approach doesn't always go down well with some other readers either. Early coverage of the Occupy Wall Street protests in downtown Manhattan, for example, left some wanting more straightforward treatment and wanting it the old-fashioned way: in print and every day, thank you.
Ruth Dobsevage, a reader from Bethel, Conn., asked, ''Mr. Brisbane, would you care to explain why The New York Times has waited an entire week to cover the Occupy Wall Street protest?'' Other than a blog post on City Room, she added, ''I've seen nothing until I read Ginia Bellafante's dismissive and superficial comments this morning.''
The Times initially covered the protesters on Sept. 17 on the City Room blog on NYTimes.com, getting a good jump. But while a print version of the piece appeared the next day in the New York edition, readers of the national editions never saw it. It was a full week before many saw a story in print, an attitude-heavy column by Ms. Bellafante headlined, ''Gunning for Wall Street, With Faulty Aim.''
Carolyn Ryan, the metro editor, disagreed that The Times was late and listed the many angles of the movement that The Times has covered. ''You can criticize us for many things, but undercovering this movement is not among them,'' she said, adding that The Times had published at least 160 separate pieces on Occupy Wall Street, including blog posts and opinion articles.
To be sure, the early coverage was there, but it was hard for some to find because so much coverage is now online only. That's a reflection of how the metro report has changed in recent years, a change I decided to document by comparing coverage during a two-week period this June with the same two-week period 10 years earlier.
I found that The Times's newshole for metro news -- the space for stories and photographs -- had dropped by almost a third in the Monday through Saturday papers, in part because The Times eliminated the free-standing Metro section in its New York edition in 2008, folding local coverage into the main section.
On Sundays, the contrast was even greater. The volume of news produced by staff members and freelancers dropped by almost two-thirds -- primarily because The Times killed its five unique Sunday regional sections in 2009 and replaced them with a more universal Metropolitan section. The staff of metro reporters, meanwhile, dropped from about 100 to 55 over the 10 years.
These changes brought a new approach to news-gathering. Rather than slimming down just by shaving at the edges, The Times narrowed its metro focus to the city. No longer were pages lavishly sprinkled with labels identifying a great range of coverage locales -- from Hartford sweeping down to Trenton and into Long Island.
Some observers remain puzzled by the changes, especially by the cuts in coverage of the larger region. Bob Papper, Hofstra University's journalism department chairman, told me: ''You have three million people on Long Island, and you kind of decided, never mind. I think it is a mistake to have cut back.''
But editors say the change was a strategic one, driven by powerful trends. Resources were moving to the growing Web operation. The economics of print newspapers were declining. And circulation patterns were changing.
The Times saw its daily circulation shrink by nearly 19 percent over the 10-year period, with most of the decline coming in the New York region. Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst for the Poynter Institute, said The Times was looking outside the New York region to ''a good potential market out there of readers who like what The Times does and who are a desirable demographic for advertisers. They could build that base over a long time of 10 or 15 years.''
Joseph Sexton, the metro editor until early this year and now the sports editor, championed the shift away from regional news in favor of concentrating on the city, and the executive editor, Jill Abramson, said she was happy with the changes, calling the metro department an ''engine of great journalism capturing the vibrancy and urgency of New York.''
Ms. Ryan, who succeeded Mr. Sexton, told me her philosophy was to have ''this ambitious, often magazine-like section for New York residents and beyond, which is really about the experience of life in New York City.'' Criticism of metro coverage ''misses the mark,'' she said, adding, ''What we excel at is surprising readers, online and in print, by breaking big exclusive stories about local crime, politics and city life.''
Crucial to The Times's approach in a time of less print space is City Room, the fourth most popular blog on NYTimes.com. It is where The Times dishes breaking news and a creative menu of features, columns and digital novelties. In City Room, a whole new kind of metro report emerges, with most of its 3,000-plus blog posts a year never surfacing in print.
The Times, of course, still produces exceptional coverage of the big stories. To name just a few: the failings of the New York governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson; the US Airways crash in the Hudson River; Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and his flirtation with a presidential run; and the Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case.
One fan of the approach is Gay Talese, the legendary Times reporter and author who wrote ''The Kingdom and the Power'' about the paper. He told me he thinks storytelling about the city has been taken to a higher level. ''I think the paper is much better now,'' he said.
Better, maybe, but different. For those who like more detailed daily coverage, blanketing the region and appearing in print for the record, The Times doesn't deliver like it used to. For those who appreciate an almost novelistic approach to covering life in the city, it's a new and better day.

HEADLINE: How Mr. Volcker Would Fix It

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AMID all the minutiae of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, it's easy to lose sight of the big question: will consumers, investors and the economy be safer?
That's why a recent speech by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and a voice of reason on matters financial, is so timely and important. Presented last month to the Group of 30, an organization devoted to international economic issues, the speech outlined crucial work that still must be done to safeguard our financial future. ''Three Years Later: Unfinished Business in Financial Reform'' was the title.
''By now it is pretty clear that it was faith in the techniques of modern finance, stoked in part by the apparent huge financial rewards, that enabled the extremes of leverage, the economic imbalances and the pretenses of the credit rating agencies to persist so long,'' Mr. Volcker said in this remarkably candid talk. 
The real treasures were found in his to-do list for further reforms. That heavy lifting includes addressing capital requirements (make them tough and enforceable), derivatives (make them more standardized and transparent) and auditors (ensure that they are truly independent by rotating them periodically).
He also spoke of the perils of institutions that are too large or interconnected to be allowed to fail. Calling this the greatest structural challenge facing the financial system, he said we must shrink the risks these companies pose, ''whether by reducing their size, curtailing their interconnections or limiting their activities.''
He also saw other economic fault lines, which are worth highlighting because few in Washington or on Wall Street seem willing to discuss them. I asked him last week to elaborate on these hazards.
One is the potential for problems in the huge industry of money market mutual funds, which operates ''in the shadows of the banking system,'' he said. Although these funds are typically managed conservatively, he said, they are vulnerable to runs, as occurred when Lehman Brothers collapsed.
''Because they are not subject to reserve requirements and capital requirements, they are a point of vulnerability in the system,'' he said. ''It is really interesting that they did so much lending to European banks. They had to pull back a lot, aggravating the pressures on the European banks.''
Money market funds held $2.63 trillion as of last Wednesday, and, Mr. Volcker said, many people mistakenly think that these funds are as safe as bank accounts. But the safeguards on bank deposits -- strong bank capital requirements and federal deposit insurance, for example -- do not exist for most money market funds. There is also little official surveillance of the funds' investment practices.
The sellers of money funds, of course, do not want to face these kinds of regulations or requirements. In a recent letter to the Financial Stability Board, an international organization charged with developing strong regulatory and supervisory policies for financial institutions, the Investment Company Institute said: ''We do not believe banklike regulation is appropriate, necessary or workable for funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.''
An alternative, Mr. Volcker said, would be to require money market funds to value their assets every day to reflect market fluctuations. This would put an end to the idea that if you put $1 into a money market fund you will always get $1 out, no matter what.
''It seems to me if you are a mutual fund, you should act like a mutual fund instead of a pseudobank,'' he said.
THE other area that cries out for change, Mr. Volcker said, is the nation's mortgage market, now controlled by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the taxpayer-owned mortgage giants.
''We simply should not countenance a residential mortgage market, the largest part of our capital market, dominated by so-called government-sponsored enterprises,'' Mr. Volcker said in his speech. ''The financial breakdown was in fact triggered by extremely lax, government-tolerated underwriting standards, an important ingredient in the housing bubble.''
While he acknowledges that we cannot eliminate Fannie and Freddie anytime soon, ''it is important that planning proceed now on the assumption that government-sponsored enterprises will no longer be a part of the structure of the market,'' he said.
Welcome to the kind of straight talk that few in Washington want to hear. ''This is an opportunity to get rid of institutions that shouldn't exist,'' he told me. ''You ought to be either public or private; don't mix up private profit-making opportunities with an institution that is going to be protected by the government but not controlled by it.''
Mr. Volcker knows more than a little about Fannie and Freddie; in the late 1960s and early '70s, when he was an under secretary of the Treasury, he was among the presidential appointees to Fannie Mae's board, he said.
The government erred, he said, by not putting the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the balance sheet and income statement of the United States. ''They didn't want the mortgage to be a government expenditure,'' he said. ''It was a volatile thing to put on the budget. They made the wrong choice.''
This is precisely the discussion we should be having on the government's approach to housing policy. That is, unless you are a fan of the status quo, as many in Washington are, and are comfortable leaving the risk of mortgage losses on taxpayers' shoulders.
''If the government wants to guarantee mortgages for certain low-income people, O.K., but I wouldn't do much of it,'' Mr. Volcker said. ''A public agency intervening in the mortgage market in a limited way doesn't bother me. But if you want to subsidize the mortgage market, do it more directly than hiding it in a quasi-private institution.''
When a man with the credibility and stature of Mr. Volcker talks, people in positions of power ought to listen. We'll see if they do.

HEADLINE: The Sunny Side Of Doom and Gloom

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine..

 BODY:
SINCE the market ran into serious trouble during the summer, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has clawed its way back to the 1,200 level on four separate occasions. On the first three runs, the rallies quickly lost steam amid fresh sets of worries about the global economy.
No wonder that investors have shown little confidence in the staying power of the latest rebound, which since Oct. 3 has lifted stock prices by 13 percent, leaving the S.& P. at 1,238. Last week, the Investors Intelligence adviser survey, a widely followed gauge that tracks the opinions of more than 100 independent investment newsletters, showed that bears continued to outnumber bulls even though the index had climbed almost half the way back. 
But sentiment can be a funny thing. The best thing that Wall Street may have going for it right now is that so many investors are pessimistic. That's because the mood in the market is often regarded as a contrarian indicator of future activity.
In late April, for example, the number of bullish newsletter advisers outnumbered bears by a ratio of three to one -- with 54.3 percent of advisers expressing optimism at the time and 18.5 percent being bearish. That sense of hope was registered just as the market peaked and started its worst slide since the financial crisis, dropping 19.4 percent by early October in what some strategists have considered to be a bear market. (In recent years, a bear market has often been defined as a 20 percent drop in prices, based on daily closing values.)
Conversely, in the logic of contrarian thinking, negativity can be a very good thing. ''When you see high levels of pessimism, it can be a sign of a market bottom and signal that there's lower risk to buy,'' said John Gray, co-editor of Investors Intelligence.
Sentiment indicators for consumers, on the other hand, are often regarded as a good way to capture the emotional state of households -- yet they're often wrong when it comes to predicting how families will really behave.
Here's a case in point: The most recent Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released on Oct. 14 showed that the mood of households continued to worsen in mid-October, even as the stock market showed new signs of life.
''Consumer confidence is inching itself deeper into the recession zone,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight.
Yet the most recent government data show that retail sales jumped a larger-than-expected 1.1 percent in September. In short, actual consumer spending would seem to point to a much rosier economic outlook, which in turn should help support hopes for a more stable stock market.
Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, says the recent mood of households doesn't seem to reflect some of the positive economic numbers that have been released lately.
''The data on earnings, the economy, and the news out of Europe is not great,'' he says. ''But it is great relative to sentiment.''
He adds that ''the only time the gap between economic data and economic sentiment was as wide as it was in the past couple of months was in late 1999 and early 2000 when the opposite of the current situation was the case: sentiment was much more positive than the data.''
It's not just retail spending that market strategists are watching.
Despite concerns about the outlook of consumers, the S.& P. 1500 retail index has showed surprising strength this year -- it is up more than 7 percent. In fact, this group of stocks is only around 2 percent below its record high.
Similarly, the S.& P. consumer discretionary index -- which tracks shares of S.& P. 500 consumer companies that make goods that households want, not need -- has soared 16 percent since the market bottomed on Oct. 3, outpacing the broad market.
''This does point to the expectation now, at least from investors, that we are going to avoid a new recession,'' said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, an investment management and advisory firm.
To be sure, this doesn't necessarily mean that the stock market has regained its footing. Historically, Mr. Ramsey notes, the severity of bear markets that are associated with recessions is actually quite similar to downturns that occur during times of economic growth.
Nor does it mean that the recent bout of market volatility will be over soon.
But it does mean that the gloomy mood among many investors could turn out to be good for the market in the short term.
In the long run, will that be enough to counteract the real economic worries that are weighing down the market, particularly the continuing fiscal mess in Europe? That's a discussion for another day.

HEADLINE: The Little State With a Big Mess

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
CRANSTON, R.I.
ON the night of Sept. 8, Gina M. Raimondo, a financier by trade, rolled up here with news no one wanted to hear: Rhode Island, she declared, was going broke.
Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow. But if current trends held, Ms. Raimondo warned, the Ocean State would soon look like Athens on the Narragansett: undersized and overextended. Its economy would wither. Jobs would vanish. The state would be hollowed out.
It is not the sort of message you might expect from Ms. Raimondo, a proud daughter of Providence, a successful venture capitalist and, not least, the current general treasurer of Rhode Island. But it is a message worth hearing. The smallest state in the union, it turns out, has a very big debt problem. 
After decades of drift, denial and inaction, Rhode Island's $14.8 billion pension system is in crisis. Ten cents of every state tax dollar now goes to retired public workers. Before long, Ms. Raimondo has been cautioning in whistle-stops here and across the state, that figure will climb perilously toward 20 cents. But the scary thing is that no one really knows. The Providence Journal recently tried to count all the municipal pension plans outside the state system and stopped at 155, conceding that it might have missed some. Even the Securities and Exchange Commission is asking questions, including the big one: Are these numbers for real?
''We're in the fight of our lives for the future of this state,'' Ms. Raimondo said in a recent interview. And if the fight is lost? ''Either the pension fund runs out of money or cities go bankrupt.''
All of this might seem small in the scheme of national affairs. After all, this is Little Rhody (population: 1,052,567). But the nightmare scenario is that Ms. Raimondo has seen the future of America, and it is Rhode Island. As Wall Street fixates on the financial disaster in Greece, a fiscal wreck is playing out right here. And the odds are that it won't be the last. Before this is over, many Americans may be forced to rethink what government means at the state and local level.
Economists have talked endlessly about a financial reckoning for the United States, of a moment in the not-so-far-away when the nation's profligate ways catch up with it. But for Rhode Island, that moment is now. The state has moved to safeguard its bond investors, to avoid being locked out of the credit markets. Last week, the General Assembly went into special session and proposed rolling back benefits for public employees, including those who have already retired. Whether the plan will succeed is anyone's guess.
Central Falls, a small city north of Providence, didn't wait for news from the Statehouse. In August, the city filed for bankruptcy rather than keep its pension promises to its retired firefighters and police officers.
Illinois, California, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Michigan -- the list of stretched states runs on. In Pennsylvania, the capital city, Harrisburg, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month to avoid having to use prized assets to pay off Wall Street creditors. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie wants to roll back benefits, too.
In most places, as in Rhode Island, the big issue is pensions. By conventional measures, state and local pensions nationwide now face a combined shortfall of about $3 trillion. Officials argue that, by their accounting, the total is far less. But with pensions, hope often triumphs over experience. Until this year, Rhode Island calculated its pension numbers by assuming that its various funds would post an average annual return on their investments of 8.25 percent; the real number for the last decade is about 2.4 percent. A phrase that gets thrown around here, a la Rick Perry describing Social Security, is ''Ponzi scheme.''
That evening in September, Ms. Raimondo walked into the Cranston Portuguese Club to face yet another angry audience. People like Paul L. Valletta Jr., the head of Local 1363 of the firefighters union.
''I want to get the biggest travesty out of the way here,'' Mr. Valletta boomed from the back of the hall. ''You're going after the retirees! In this economic time, how could you possibly take a pension away?''
Someone else in the audience said Rhode Island was reneging on a moral obligation.
Ms. Raimondo, 40, stood her ground. Rhode Island, she said, had a choice: it could pay for schoolbooks, roadwork, care for the elderly and so on, or it could keep every promise to its retirees.
''I would ask you, is it morally right to do nothing, and not provide services to the state's most vulnerable citizens?'' she asked the crowd. ''Yes, sir, I think this is moral.''
FOR many Americans, the Ocean State conjures images of Newport mansions and Narragansett chic. The overall reality is more prosaic. Rhode Island today is a place where the roads and bridges rank among the worst in the nation and where jobs are particularly hard to find. Unemployment rose faster during the 2008-9 recession than in any other state. The official jobless rate is now 10.6 percent, versus the national average of 9.1 percent.
The textile mills and jewelry manufacturers that once employed thousands here have dwindled away. The big employers today are in health care and education, both of which rely heavily on government spending that has been drying up.
Many states and cities can credibly say their pension plans are viable, even when those plans are not fully funded. That is because state retirement funds, like Social Security, pay out benefits bit by bit, over many years.
But unlike, say, California, with its large, diverse economy, Rhode Island is so small that there is little margin for error. Leaving the state, to escape its taxes, is almost as easy as moving to the other side of town. Efforts to balance the state budget by shrinking the public work force have left Rhode Island with a problem like the one that plagues General Motors: the state has more public-sector retirees than public-sector workers.
More ominous still, in each of the last 10 years, the state pension fund paid more money to retirees than the fund collected from state employees and taxpayers combined. The fund is shrinking, even though the benefits coming due are growing.
For all the pain here, one important constituency -- Wall Street -- seems satisfied enough. To reassure its bond investors, Rhode Island passed a special law this year giving them first dibs on tax revenue. In other words, bondholders will be paid, whatever happens. Ms. Raimondo has at times been accused of selling out ordinary Rhode Islanders to Wall Street interests, but she says hard choices must be made.
Ms. Raimondo remembers better times in Rhode Island. She grew up in a suburb of Providence, rode public buses to public schools and played in public parks. Her grandfather, who arrived from Italy, studied English in the evenings at the Providence Public Library. (In 2009, city funding for all but the central library went to a nonprofit, the Providence Community Library, which shortened the libraries' hours. These days, libraries are seldom open after 6 p.m.)
But Ms. Raimondo also learned early on about economic forces at work in her state. When she was in sixth grade, the Bulova watch factory, where her father worked, shut its doors. He was forced to retire early, on a sharply reduced pension; he then juggled part-time jobs.
''You can't let people think that something's going to be there if it's not,'' Ms. Raimondo said in an interview in her office in the pillared Statehouse, atop a hill in Providence. No one should be blindsided, she said. If pensions are in trouble, it's better to deliver the news and give people time to make other plans.
BY any standard, Ms. Raimondo is a high achiever. She graduated from Harvard, collected a law degree from Yale and attended Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. After a stint in New York in the venture capital business, she helped found Rhode Island's first venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital.
Then, in 2009, with zero political experience, she ran for the state office of treasurer. Although she is a Democrat in a heavily Democratic state, she stood out because she refused to promise that state jobs and pension benefits would be protected no matter what. She won by a landslide, receiving more votes than any other candidate for any state office. Her long-term ambitions, in politics, business or both, are the subject of speculation in Providence.
No sooner had she been sworn in than the S.E.C. called. She learned that the commission was investigating the finances of various cities and states, including Rhode Island, to determine whether bond investors were receiving truthful information. At the heart of the S.E.C. inquiry were pension funds.
Ms. Raimondo said she wasn't entirely surprised. When she disclosed the investigation, she said: ''For months, Rhode Island has been listed among several states with precarious finances. This challenging position is, in part, due to our significant and growing unfunded pension liability.'' Her first priority, she vowed, would be to ensure that the numbers were right.
Others made similar pledges before. Rhode Island has been trying to fix its pension system for years; it has announced four ''reform'' plans since 2005, each of which has claimed to reduce costs for the state and cities. It has raised minimum retirement ages, slowed accrual rates, capped cost-of-living adjustments -- but always for the youngest or least senior public workers. Retirees, and workers poised to retire, were spared, even though the numbers clearly showed that reducing payments to retirees was the only sure way to fix things quickly.
In recent months Ms. Raimondo has crisscrossed the state in an attempt to sell a different remedy, one in which everyone takes a hit. Yes, it would hurt. But at least the state would avoid having to come up with yet another plan in a year or two. The defined-benefit structure, very popular with public employees, could survive. Still, the battle lines are clear. Eight public workers' unions have already sued, saying the pension changes of 2009 and 2010 were illegal.
On a September evening out in North Scituate, at the historic Old Congregational Church, Ms. Raimondo told a crowd about what had happened in Vallejo, Calif. That city filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and, after grueling negotiations, left pensions intact but drastically cut bus service, police patrols and other government functions, along with the pay of the city workers who provide all those services.
''That's not what we want for Rhode Island,'' Ms. Raimondo said. ''That's not the future we want for our children.''
Others in the crowd had their own stories. Several retired teachers said they had played by the rules and sent a part of every paycheck to the pension fund, as required by law. One man demanded pension cuts for state troopers and judges. A woman said her aged father would be unable to buy medicine if the state stopped adjusting his pension for inflation.
''I feel your anger,'' Ms. Raimondo told the crowd. ''In many ways, I'm angry myself. Many of the shenanigans that went on in past years were just wrong.''
In some ways, the central question is not only what the government owes to pensioners but what citizens owe to one another. From the pews of the church, Cindy Gould, a fourth-grade teacher, said that under the current system, she had 11 years to go until retirement. Under Ms. Raimondo's plan, she might have to work longer. But, Ms. Gould, 54, said she was willing to do so if that meant the elderly would get the medical care they need.
Since the last recession hit, states and cities around the country have embarked on pension changes, often following the Rhode Island pattern. Benefits for state employees who have not yet been hired are usually the first to be cut. Then come changes for those now on the payroll, often in the form of higher mandatory contributions.
Retirees have mostly been off-limits, until now. In many instances, laws or legal precedent shield them. In the corporate sphere, they are supposed to bear losses only in bankruptcy. But those rules do not apply to states, which may not declare bankruptcy in any case. If a government homes in on retirees, a lawsuit is sure to follow, and the resolution will take years. But Ms. Raimondo says Rhode Island doesn't have years. This isn't a question of politics or law, she says, but of simple math. To get the numbers right, Ms. Raimondo quickly assembled a panel of experts that included academics, mayors and union officials. The goal was to figure out what a public pension should be and what Rhode Island could afford. Inflation protection every year, for people who in some cases retired in their 40s, started coming into focus.
Analysts also took a close look at the projected long-term investment return for the pension system: 8.25 percent. Everything rested on hitting that target, but the state's actuary said there was less than a 30 percent chance that would happen over the next 20 years. The board voted to lower the assumption to 7.5 percent. (Given the recent run in the financial markets, even that figure may seem optimistic.)
As a result of that change, the state's pension shortfall instantly rose to $9 billion from $7 billion. The unions said Ms. Raimondo had manufactured a crisis.
She denied it. ''This is about the truth,'' she said, ''and about doing the right thing.''
Then, as if on cue, Central Falls declared bankruptcy. The city's pension fund wasn't just underfunded. It was completely out of money. A receiver for the city sought court permission to reduce by as much as half the base pensions of retired police officers and firefighters.
Suddenly the pension crisis wasn't an abstraction any more. The unthinkable had happened, and the odds were that it would happen again unless the state acted quickly.
Other mayors began stepping forward and warning that their communities were on the brink, too. Here in Cranston, Mayor Allan W. Fung said that unless things changed, he would have to eliminate trash collection, services to the elderly and recreation programs for children, as well as reduce the size of the police force and fire department.
Over in Woonsocket, John F. Ward, the president of the City Council, said that all summer parks programs had been eliminated and that teachers were working with larger classes than their contracts allowed. Half of Woonsocket's streetlights were out because the city couldn't afford to replace them. His son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter had moved to another state.
''To allow the pension system to remain largely unchanged will make it impossible for Woonsocket, and every other urban community, to survive,'' Mr. Ward said.
AT the Portuguese Club in Cranston, Jose M. Berto raised his hand. At 62, he told Ms. Raimondo, he was on the cusp of retirement.
''We're looking at a Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff look like a Boy Scout,'' said Mr. Berto, a supply officer for the state.
He asked if Rhode Island's pension problem was the worst in the nation.
Ms. Raimondo said it was.
''I don't like her message,'' Mr. Berto said after the session. ''But she has been honest, forthcoming. We're in trouble. We're just in so much trouble.''
Correction: October 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Rhode Island pension funds referred incorrectly to the recent history of the Providence Public Library system. It did not close branches in 2009; city funding for all but the central library went instead to a nonprofit, the Providence Community Library, which has kept them open. (The central library did shorten its hours.) And because of an editing error, the article misstated the middle initial of the City Council president in Woonsocket. He is John F. Ward, not John W.

 BODY:
THE STRUGGLE FOR EGYPT
From Nasser to Tahrir Square
By Steven A. Cook
Illustrated. 408 pp. Oxford University Press. $27.95.
On the morning of Feb. 11, 2011, hours before Hosni Mubarak submitted to the millions of his subjects clamoring for his resignation, a half-dozen retired generals sipped coffee poolside at the Gezira Club, kitted up for tennis and contemptuously dismissed the demonstrators in Tahrir Square. ''Who do they represent?'' scoffed a man who until recently had worked in state security. ''They are loud, but don't forget there are 79 million Egyptians who are not in Tahrir Square. They are the majority.''
It never crossed their minds that Mubarak might capitulate, as he would do later that day, or that the passivity of most Egyptians did not equal support for a regime that had squandered Egypt's position at the head of the Arab world while excelling only at abuse and corruption. That rank incomprehension -- one might less charitably call it arrogant cluelessness -- stretched from the coffee klatch at the Gezira Club through the entire government. Yet Egypt had managed to remain a stable linchpin of American policy in the Middle East for decades, until suddenly it wasn't. 
This transformation, along with the internal decline from pride of the Arab world to shameful decaying autocracy, is the subject of Steven A. Cook's ''Struggle for Egypt: From Nasser to Tahrir Square.'' The book clearly was in the making long before the uprising.
Cook's central contention is that since the military coup of 1952, Egypt's leaders have never had an ideology. Instead, they have resorted to an increasingly complicated and cruel apparatus of coercion, bullying the citizenry into consent but failing to create any positive reason to support the state.
Cook isn't trying to tell us why Egyptians revolted in 2011, or what might come next, although his perceptive analysis helps answer both questions. His real aim is to diagnose Egypt's decline and directionlessness in the modern era, from Nasser's charisma to Mubarak's dead-man governing act, and to shed light on America's role. With meticulous historical context and the acumen of a political scientist, Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, weaves together a narrative drawn from archives, interviews and his own firsthand reporting during a decade of visits to Egypt.
His story begins with a quick survey of Egypt's modern political awakening, an excellent primer for the uninitiated. Egypt first revolted against its colonizers in 1882, ushering in an age of ferment that included a British-dominated monarchy and a religious awakening inspired by the pioneers of the Islamist revival. Corruption flourished, as did ego-driven power struggles within the elite. Disgust began to reach a boiling point in 1948, when Gamal Abdel Nasser and his Free Officer compatriots fought in Palestine against the newly declared state of Israel. Between the king's incompetence, the greed of the governing liberals and the Machiavellian scheming of the British, who humiliatingly still occupied the Suez Canal, Egypt's leaders were doomed.
Nasser's coup in 1952 threw all the bums out and placed power in the hands of a small group of young, unknown officers, who promised to advance the national interest as impartial technocrats. A charismatic orator, Nasser became the voice and conscience of Arab nationalism, and experimented with reforms that gave land, education and jobs to the peasantry.
Egypt's people invested great hope in the idea of an apolitical, incorruptible military leadership -- a comprehensible but unfounded reflex that prevails again today. The Free Officers tapped a deep and historically grounded wave of rage against foreign interference, a backlash that has never subsided.
Nasser flirted with the Soviets but never embraced Communism. He used the Muslim Brotherhood to achieve power, then ruthlessly crushed the organization when he realized it was becoming too popular to control.
By the time his mismanaged army collapsed in the 1967 war with Israel, Nasser's reforms had stalled. Anwar Sadat, the weak officer who inherited the presidency in 1970, carved out a power base by gutting what remained of civil society. Sadat relaxed the restrictions on the Muslim Brotherhood and encouraged free enterprise, spawning a wealthy new elite that matured into Mubarak's crony capitalist circle.
Cook does an excellent job telling the story of Sadat's daring trip to Jerusalem, which quickly and unexpectedly led to the Camp David accords -- a peace treaty almost universally reviled in the Arab world, including Egypt. With that one move, Sadat managed to become the darling of the West, while sacrificing almost all his domestic support. Few of his countrymen mourned when he lost his life to an assassin's bullet in 1981, and his vice president, Hosni Mubarak, assumed power.
The lesson for Mubarak and Egypt's ruling class was to risk nothing. Gone was Egypt's sense of destiny as helmsman of the Arab world. Abandoned, too, was the confidence to imagine developmental leaps forward like the Aswan dam.
The joke goes that upon being sworn in, Mubarak took his first ride in the presidential limo. The veteran driver reached a fork in the road. ''Nasser always turned left here,'' the chauffeur said. ''Sadat always turned right. What would you like to do?'' After long thought, Mubarak decided: ''Just stay where we are.''
Under Mubarak, poverty and inequality leveled off for a time but then began to increase again. The sacrifice of liberties ceased to be a Faustian trade-off for security and economic progress once the government could no longer deliver on bread-and-butter issues. Egypt became little more than a byword for a brutal security state -- though one that was a stalwart ally to Washington and Jerusalem.
By the 1990s most of Mubarak's energy was going into suppressing political dissent and fighting to preserve his special relationship with Washington. He deployed an army of secret police officers and informants that rivaled East Germany's, infiltrating everything from the doormen's union to student theater groups. But by 2011, spies, tear gas and heavy-handed repression were not enough to keep him in power.
Readers looking for a full account of this year's uprising will have to wait for the spate of coming books by journalists, insiders and political analysts. What Cook has given us is a scholar's well-informed, analytical history, which offers invaluable insights to anyone interested in how Egypt came to its present impasse. ''The Struggle for Egypt'' is at its best when delivering finely honed details, as when Cook explains the relationship among Egypt, America and Israel. He offers a surprisingly engaging disquisition on Public Law 480, the American ''Food for Peace'' program that was the progenitor of an unhealthy aid-driven relationship between Washington and Cairo.
But Cook's storytelling is laced with cliches and hackneyed images (''jaw-/dropping,'' ''live wire''). This is the kind of book where ''the mist off the Nile . . . creates an odd sense of foreboding and anticipation'' on the morning of the 1952 coup. (Was it really the mist, or was it the tanks surrounding all the government buildings?) He awkwardly drops characters he has met into his account without any apparent connection to the narrative, only to allow them to disappear a few pages later.
These stylistic hiccups, however, are merely occasional irritants in a substantial and engaging book. Cook knows his material and gets the important points right. His account should be particularly sobering for American readers, who will find in these pages a damning exposition of why United States aid and political influence are currently viewed with such profound suspicion in Egypt.
History offers today's Egyptian reformers many warnings, most importantly about the danger of an unaccountable, all-powerful military. Egyptians have long suffered from the gap between their leaders' rhetoric and practice. Nasser, Sadat and Mubarak spoke the language of revolution, Arab pride and economic prosperity, but presided over a military welfare state that impoverished its people and ruled through systemic torture. This disconnect will plague anyone who tries to resuscitate Egypt after Mubarak. For if the man who ruled for 29 years, 3 months and 28 days is gone, the dysfunctional, Orwellian system he did so much to create and sustain lives on.

HEADLINE: For Now, It's a Cheaper Safari

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
IF you've ever dreamed of taking a luxury African safari, the time is now.
After lowering prices amid the recession, high-end safari camps and tour companies are still struggling to bring rates back in line, offering travelers an opportunity to take one of the most expensive vacations there is for as much as 40 percent off. The dollar has also strengthened against African currencies in several popular safari regions, including Namibia and South Africa, making side trips and souvenirs less expensive, too.
Even with such significant price reductions, safaris are still not cheap. And don't expect to find many bargains over the Christmas holiday week when camps are packed. Still, Africa specialists like Nina Wennersten, an owner of Hippo Creek Safaris in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., say that travelers willing to act quickly can score a safari for significantly less than they would have in past years. ''There are some wonderful sales for safari in both East Africa and South Africa before the end of the year,'' she said. Be aware, though, that the window of opportunity may soon be closing as many companies, including Hippo Creek, which operates throughout eastern and southern Africa, are beginning to see an increase in bookings and prices in 2012.
Below, some of the best deals in four African countries. 
Tanzania
While many tourists flock to Tanzania's northern Serengeti during the high season from July to October, to witness the wildebeest migration, the winter months are also a great time to go. From January to March, herds congregate on the southern plains of the Serengeti, and many birds migrate to East Africa from Europe.
During this time, London-based Africa Odyssey is offering a four-night Serengeti mobile camp for $2,550 a person, instead of the usual $3,400, with the camp operator Alex Walkers Serian. Great Safaris, based in Glendale, Calif., has a two-for-one deal on an eight-day Elewana SkySafari that includes northern Tanzania's Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Crater, Tarangire National Park and flight transfers between the sites, from $6,954.
And in southern Tanzania, where young animals and migrant bird species can be found from December to February, the Selous Safari Company is offering low season rates, normally offered only in November and March. The discounted price, which is good through March 2012, starts at $507 a person a night, down from $712 at its Jongomero camp in the remote Ruaha National Park and $610 a person, a night, down from $815 (a 25 percent discount) at its 13-tent camp in the Selous Game Reserve.
South Africa
Situated at the tip of the continent, South Africa is home to the vast Kruger National Park as well as fertile Winelands and scenic beaches. An overabundance of hotel rooms built for last year's FIFA World Cup is now outstripping demand, helping push down the cost of a trip. ''Overall tourism to sub-Saharan Africa this year is down,'' said Nicky Williams, director at Passage to Africa, which specializes in custom safaris.
And the U.S. dollar, which is up roughly 18 percent against the rand (at 7.95 rand to the dollar) versus a year ago according to Travelex Currency Services, is making a trip even more attractive. ''The deals are numerous,'' said Ms. Wennersten, of Hippo Creek Safaris. ''Even Singita in South Africa, outside of the holiday season, is offering the third night at half price. Traditionally, one rarely sees something like this.''
Lion World Tours' South Africa on Sale promotion offers roundtrip international economy airfare from New York or Washington, regional flights in South Africa, four nights in Cape Town and a two-night safari in Pilanesberg National Park from $2,499 a person, based on double occupancy (a savings of $1,000 a couple) for travel in February and March.
Even in January, when many South Africans go on vacation, travelers can find sales. Running more than 35 African safari lodges and camps, &Beyond is offering a four-night Big Cat Safari for the price of three (from 27,646 rand or about $3,495 a person) including domestic flights, two nights at Kirkman's Kamp in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve and three nights at Phinda or Forest Lodge in northern KwaZulu-Natal.
Kenya
Kenya, synonymous with safaris that offer opportunities to see the Big Five (lions, African elephants, buffalos, leopards and rhinoceroses), is facing its own particular hurdle as it tries to combat tourism fallout after a series of violent incidents near the Kenyan-Somali border. Over the last two months, Somali gunmen have kidnapped two Europeans and killed another. In September, a British tourist was snatched from the exclusive Kiwayu Safari Village northeast of Lamu island. Her husband was shot and killed. The most recent incident was the abduction of a French woman from her beach home on nearby Manda island.
While many resorts in that region, which is more popular with European tourists than Americans, have shut down as the government increases security, tour operators are trying to get the word out that Kenya's safari parks have not been affected, and in fact, many are offering deals.
''People are going above and beyond to welcome guests right now in Kenya,'' following the incidents along the northern coast, said Maisa Fernandez, president of Impact Tourism Consulting, which represents several resorts and safari camps in Kenya.
Ms. Wennersten of Hippo Creek wrote in an e-mail: ''Many of the safari camps in Kenya have long-stay (4 nights or more) discounts or 20 percent off regular rates.'' Olarro, a luxury lodge in the Greater Masai Mara region of Kenya, is offering three nights for the price of two from $1,460 a person, including a full day excursion into the Masai Mara meals, and a spa treatment through January, not including Christmas and New Year's. Up to two children under 12 stay free with two adults. And Abercrombie & Kent has a nine-day Kenya Wildlife Adventure, with game viewing in Samburu National Park and the Masai Mara for $4,135 a person, down from $5,700 a person normally.
Botswana
Known for its vast wilderness, roving elephant herds and other big game, Botswana in Southern Africa is usually one of the most expensive safari destinations. But during the so-called green season from December to March, rains arrive. ''Prices are adjusted downward, but it is also birthing season and birding season so it is actually quite a wonderful time to visit while enjoying lower prices,'' said Diane Lobel, president of African Portfolio, a tour operator based in Greenwich, Conn., which offers an eight-day Botswana's Wilderness safari for $5,630 a person from January to March versus $8,690 a person from June 15 to October.
&Beyond recently slashed a weeklong Botswana safari from $4,824 a person to $2,797. And through December, Sanctuary Retreats is offering a five-night Heart of the Elephant safari for the price of four visiting the Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park, a savings of $1,460 a couple.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 2011y

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Practical Traveler column last Sunday, about safaris in Africa, misidentified one of the animals that make up the Big Five, which many visitors hope to see there. The Big Five consist of the elephant, rhinoceros, lion, leopard and the African, or Cape, buffalo -- not the water buffalo, which is not found in Africa. In addition, an accompanying illustration was published in error. It erroneously included a tiger, which is also not found in Africa.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Stability?

 BODY:
Bankers in this country are not letting up on their campaign to undercut the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which is supposed to curb risky behavior and lessen the chances of another meltdown. They are also eagerly joining their overseas brethren in a similarly fierce campaign against new international rules that would require banks to gradually increase the amount of capital they must keep in reserve to cushion against future crises. 
The rules are being developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision -- a group of regulators from 27 countries, including the United States. The Institute for International Finance, a banking lobby group, issued a report claiming that the capital requirements would cut global economic output by 3.2 percent by 2015 and cost 7.5 million jobs. ''There is an acute danger that the pursuit of financial stability imposes too great a cost on economic growth and job creation at a fragile time for the world economy,'' the report said, with no apparent irony.
The estimates are as dubious as they are self-serving. Basel's Bank for International Settlements, the organization of central banks that hosts the supervisory committee, issued its own report, which said the rules would shave just 0.04 percentage points a year from economic growth during the eight-year phase-in period. The benefit of reducing the risk of another devastating financial crisis amounted to 2.5 percent of world gross domestic product per year.
The new rules require all banks to boost their core capital, essentially common shares and retained dividends, up to 7 percent of their assets -- loans and other securities, weighted by their relative risk -- from 2 percent today. The biggest banks, whose demise would pose a larger threat to the world economy, would have to reserve capital equal to up to 9.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.
All banks must also amass enough cash and easy-to-sell assets to survive a 30-day market crisis, and their core capital must equal at least 3 percent of total assets, without adjusting for risk.
The more capital a bank has, the more losses it can sustain on its investments. Capital rules also temper risk-taking. But bankers hate the new restrictions because every dollar set aside is a dollar they cannot lend for profit.
Regulators must resist bankers' pleas. If anything the rules must be tightened, including setting a common risk standard, and the phase-in period is too long. Bankers will keep claiming that the rules will put a drag on growth. These are scare tactics. The real danger is that without more regulation -- and larger cash cushions -- risky behavior from the banks will set off another meltdown.

HEADLINE: Should 65 Be Your Magic Number?

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
Q. In a few years, you will reach the traditional retirement age of 65. You aren't sure if you want to keep working past that age. What factors should you weigh?
A. Consider yourself fortunate if you can choose whether or not to retire. Many older workers have had to postpone retirement because of the volatile stock market and uncertain economy.
First, make sure you would be in a financial position to retire. ''You must understand how much money you have access to today and how deeply you are willing to dip into it if you stop earning entirely,'' says Steve Langerud, director of professional opportunities and an alumni coach at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. 
A trusted financial planner may be able to help you assess whether your 401(k) and/or pension, Social Security income, savings and home equity are enough to support the type of retirement you envision.
Layered atop your financial needs are health concerns, which, of course, can arise suddenly, Mr. Langerud says. Look at your health history and make a plan that includes the possibility of illness, he says.
Q.What else should you consider when deciding whether to retire?
A. Life expectancies keep rising , so realize that if you retire at 65, you are likely to have many more productive years ahead of you than retirees in previous generations did. This will affect your financial and your psychological health.
''People retiring lose their job and title, which are often tied up with their identity,'' says David D. Corbett, founder of New Directions, a Boston firm that helps senior-level executives with career transitions. ''It can also be isolating for many, not having work colleagues or a corporate infrastructure.''
Traditional retirement may lead to a lack of intellectual engagement, which is crucial for good health, says Gary J. Kennedy, director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.
If you think of the brain as a computer, physical and mental activity are ''essentially upgrading its hardware and programming,'' Dr. Kennedy says. If we don't stay engaged, cognitive processes slow down and depression often sets in, he says.
Q.You would like to remain employed at your company but want to make some changes, like cutting back on hours, working in a different position or both. Is management likely to be receptive?
A. Companies are accustomed to helping older workers plan for retirement but not for transitions, says Marc Freedman, author of ''The Big Shift: Navigating the New Stage Beyond Midlife'' and chief executive of Civic Ventures, a group that focuses on life beyond age 50.
Yet your company may be receptive to changing your role while you're still employed, as many businesses worry about losing experienced employees and their accumulated knowledge.
As you discuss new roles with management, keep in mind that you are a resource to the company, not a drain, Mr. Kennedy says, and that you ''still have valuable contributions to make.''
Q. Say you decide to leave your current employer, but want to keep using your skills in some way. Where and how can you do that?
A. Conduct a self-assessment. Look at your career, what you've accomplished and what you feel is left to be done. ''The older our clients get, the further back in their history they look for clues as to what they will do later in life,'' says Mr. Corbett, author of ''Portfolio Life: The New Path to Work, Purpose and Passion After 50.''
''Write a resume that ends the day you got your first job,'' he says. ''Look at the courses you took that you liked but couldn't pursue professionally, outside activities and hobbies.''
Ask family and friends to suggest ways to reach beyond your career and reconnect with the things you enjoy. ''Assemble a personal board of peer advisers, where each of you gives advice to the others about moving forward,'' Mr. Corbett says. ''Share with them what you would love to do and ask for feedback about how to do it. You will get some great ideas this way.''
You should also note your transferrable skills and where or how you could use them, says Stephen Moore, manager of human resource services at Insperity, a business performance solutions provider in Kingwood, Tex.
''I recently worked with a senior-level individual who was successful in his career, comfortable financially and could have stopped working,'' Mr. Moore says. ''He loved woodworking, so he took a job at Home Depot. He stayed employed and connected to a community, and was able to talk about and do something he really loved.''
Mr. Freedman recommends that you prepare for this later-life transition by saving money while in your 50s for things like additional education or unpaid apprenticeships and internships. ''Reinvention sounds very romantic, but it's also hard,'' he says. ''So it helps to prepare as much as you can.''

HEADLINE: Paperback Row

BYLINE: By IHSAN TAYLOR

 BODY:
THE MIND'S EYE, by Oliver Sacks (Vintage, $15.) In these graceful essays Sacks, a practicing neurologist, explores our potential to adapt in the face of disability -- among his case studies is an accomplished musician who loses the ability to read music -- and describes his own ordeal with ocular cancer. 
COMPASS ROSE, by John Casey (Vintage Contemporaries, $16.) Casey's elegiac novel continues a story he began in the National Book Award-winning ''Spartina'' (1989). In the small coastal community of Rhode Island's South County, economic and social shifts have disrupted the lives of the irascible seaman Dick Pierce and the women (wife, daughter, lover) in his life.
SCORPIONS: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices, by Noah Feldman (Twelve, $16.99.) Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor, presents an insightful group biography of four larger-/than-life justices appointed by Franklin D. Roosevelt: Felix Frankfurter, Robert Jackson, Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Although all were committed New Dealers -- they first served together in 1941, and their contentious terms continued through 1954 -- each forged his own theory of the Constitution.
MAGGOT: Poems, by Paul Muldoon (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $14.) In his 11th collection Muldoon, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''Moy Sand and Gravel'' (2002), applies his acrobatic wit to a wide variety of human experience, especially sex, decay and death.
WAIT FOR ME! Memoirs, by Deborah Mitford (Picador, $18.) The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, now 91, is the last of the celebrated Mitford sisters. Her latest memoir transforms the 20th century into a personal pageant: from an eccentric but happy childhood roaming the Oxfordshire countryside, to tea with Hitler in 1937, to her marriage to Andrew Cavendish, the second son of the Duke of Devonshire.
LUKA AND THE FIRE OF LIFE, by Salman Rushdie (Random House, $15; ages 10 and up.) With video game tropes and a multicultural cast of gods and demons, this sequel to ''Haroun and the Sea of Stories'' (1990) is a 21st-century myth. Twelve-year-old Luka, who longs for the kinds of adventures his older brother enjoyed years before, is on a quest to save his father, a storyteller who has fallen into a deep, mysterious sleep. Rushdie's ''exuberant wordplay is evident on every page,'' Mark Athitakis wrote in the Book Review.
THE GHOSTS OF CANNAE: Hannibal and the Darkest Hour of the Roman Republic, by Robert L. O'Connell (Random House, $17.) The battle of Cannae in 216 B.C., where Hannibal obliterated the largest army the Roman Republic had ever put into the field, was unmatched in its carnage. O'Connell scrupulously conveys how Hannibal outwitted his enemies, and how this disastrous turning point in Rome's history ultimately led to the republic's resurgence and the creation of its empire.
A SINGLE SHOT, by Matthew F. Jones (Mulholland/Little, Brown, $14.99.) First published in 1996, Jones's harrowing literary thriller follows a desperate poacher who kills a young woman with a stray bullet, setting in motion a series of violent repercussions.

HEADLINE: Looking for Exciting Matchups? Take the Day Off

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER

 BODY:
Colts (0-6) at Saints (4-2) Sunday, 8:20 p.m. Line: Saints by 14. The famous quote by the former N.F.L. commissioner Bert Bell - ''On any given Sunday, any team in the N.F.L. can beat any other'' - has been a source of reassurance for both fans and television programmers for decades. The league's carefully maintained competitive balance almost guarantees that every week will feature several compelling games between high-quality, evenly matched opponents. Almost. Bell would never imagine a week like this, in which the best (the Patriots) and most fascinating (the Eagles, the 49ers) teams have byes, while the top contenders face pushovers and the mediocre slug it out with the middling. Matchups that looked good when the schedule was announced now merit double-digit point spreads. 
Case in point: the Colts vs. the Saints, a rematch of Super Bowl XLIV that promised to be a seesaw offensive battle, is now little more than a three-hour wake for Indianapolis and a chance to watch Sean Payton coach New Orleans from the booth instead of the sideline. Granted, Curtis Painter, like a frozen burrito under a filling station heat lamp, is slowly warming to the Colts' starting quarterback job. His completion percentage has gone up every week, and the Colts offense no longer looks like an intramural team playing in a downpour. Also, Drew Brees offered hope that Payton might find a way to stand on, or slightly above, the field on the surgically repaired leg he broke in last week's game. ''I'm envisioning some kind of hovercraft on the sideline,'' Brees said. Levitating coaches: another thing that Bert Bell could never imagine. Pick: Saints.
Bears (3-3) at Buccaneers (4-2) in London Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Bears by 1. The Buccaneers rookie defender Adrian Clayborn tried fish and chips for the first time as soon as Tampa Bay arrived in London on Monday. ''It didn't sit well with me at all,'' Clayborn told The Tampa Tribune. ''It messed up my stomach bad.'' Do not let Clayborn anywhere near steak and kidney pie. You would think that most Americans have encountered fish and chips by now, and conversely, that most Britons would be able to differentiate a football team worthy of international acclaim from, say, the Bears. However, Lovie Smith (whose Bears stayed in the United States until Thursday) expects something close to a home-field advantage. ''I'm told we have a big following overseas,'' Smith said, not realizing that many Londoners are still expecting to see William (The Refrigerator) Perry. Smith does not expect his Bears to be jet-lagged, any more than Raheem Morris expects his players to be cramped up from too much bangers and mash. Smith also hopes to win some new fans. ''I know the guys are excited about showing our brand of football over there,'' he said. The Bears brand includes Jay Cutler's occasionally uttering profanities, heard by a microphone, about the coordinator Mike Martz. Though if you really want to hear Cutler swear, get him to try bubble and squeak. Pick: Buccaneers.
Chargers (4-1) at Jets (3-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Chargers by 2. Norv Turner and Rex Ryan are as different as two coaches can be. The mild-mannered Turner has less motivational power than dress-down Friday, but his detail-oriented approach turns quarterbacks into sharpshooters and receivers into precision route runners. Ryan's Homer Simpson-meets-Pagliacci routine keeps the troops fired up, but he is rarely bothered by trifling details, like his offense. Yet their results are the same. Both Turner and Ryan appear to lose control of their locker rooms at times, with Ryan reining them back in with his Asylum's Chief Inmate routine and Turner waiting for the pot to boil over and return to room temperature. Although neither coach has reached the Super Bowl with his current team, each has something to say about it. Ryan said Wednesday that he would have won ''a couple of rings'' had the Chargers hired him instead of Turner in 2007. Turner jokingly responded, ''I was wondering if he had those rings with the ones he's guaranteed the last couple of years.'' When Norv Turner zings you, you know you left yourself open. In news unrelated to Ryan's imaginary jewelry box, Plaxico Burress promises that the Jets offense will soon ''go through the roof.'' It would be nice to at least see them get a few inches off the ground. Pick: Jets.
Texans (3-3) at Titans (3-2) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Titans by 3. The last meeting between these teams was overshadowed by a brawl between Texans receiver Andre Johnson and Titans cornerback/provocateur Cortland Finnegan. Finnegan reinterpreted ''jam at line'' as ''jab to face'' on several plays, until finally he and Johnson ripped each other's helmets off and began swinging. The kerfuffle ended with Finnegan clapping and smiling in the fine ''I got you in trouuuu-ble'' tradition of schoolyard agitators everywhere. The Texans got the last laugh with a 20-0 victory that perpetuated a six-game Titans losing streak. Johnson (knee) is doubtful for Sunday, so Finnegan will not have his favorite playmate, and the Texans will again be without the focal point of their passing game. ''We needed a new hero,'' Gary Kubiak said after last Sunday's 29-14 loss to the Ravens. Kubiak failed to mention if that hero's got to be sure, or it's got to be soon. ''Larger than life'' would not hurt. Pick: Titans.
Broncos (1-4) at Dolphins (0-5) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 1.5 . Fun things to do during this game. 1.) Count the number of incredibly minor accomplishments Tim Tebow receives credit for: completing screen passes and faking handoffs are about to go from remedial quarterbacking skills to ''Things Tebow Does Ever So Well.'' 2.) Try to figure out which Dolphins defender is trying to cover which Broncos receiver. That is exactly what the Dolphins defenders will spend much of the afternoon doing. 3.) Watch the entire Dolphins organization acquire tunnel vision at the 5-yard line, passing to Brandon Marshall on every snap, as if the plays are being called by a tipsy fantasy football enthusiast who needs a big game from the concentration-challenged receiver. Pick: Broncos.
Steelers (4-2) at Cardinals (1-4) Sunday, 4:05 p.m. Line: Steelers by 3 .5. We have reached a crossroad in human history: Larry Fitzgerald is officially quoting Winston Churchill. ''Sometimes doing your best isn't good enough. Sometimes you need to do what's required,'' Fitzgerald said earlier in the week. Fitzgerald got the quote from the special teams coach Kevin Spencer, who got it from Churchill, who got it from his special teams coach. Fitzgerald missed the ''personal responsibility'' part of Churchill's message when he explained that he was not to blame for his lackluster four-catch game against the Vikings. ''We had this other guy, what was his name? Oh, yeah. Anquan Boldin,'' he said, adding, ''I wasn't here by myself. I had some talented guys around me.'' There's something delightfully ironic about signing a cap-straining contract, then complaining about your budget-friendly supporting cast. Any thoughts, Mr. Churchill? ''If we open a quarrel between past and present, we shall find that we have lost the future.'' And shall have caught only a handful of passes. Pick: Steelers.
Redskins (3-2) at Panthers (1-5) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 2.5 . Rex Grossman has a 23-16 career record as a starter. That record is updated and displayed every time he starts a game, more as justification than information: ''Yes, we know you are watching a guy close his eyes and heave the ball into tight downfield coverage, but look, he has won many games, so he must do something right.'' The entire Redskins offense closed ranks around Grossman after his four-interception meltdown against the Eagles, which meant it was only a matter of hours before Mike Shanahan named John Beck (career record: 0-4, earned honestly) the starter. If you did not celebrate the renaissance of Redskins team unity, wise management and long-range planning before last week, it is now probably too late. Pick: Panthers.
Seahawks (2-3) at Browns (2-3) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Browns by 3. Seahawks quarterback Tarvaris Jackson (ankle) was a limited practice participant this week, but Charlie Whitehurst took most of the snaps with the first-team offense. Pete Carroll said he may not choose his starting quarterback until Sunday. The Browns are preparing for both by trying to keep a straight face. Carroll also made waves during the bye week by sending football-suggestive Twitter messages to the N.B.A. star (and Cleveland expatriate) LeBron James, including a picture of a Seahawks jersey with James's name on it. A Browns fan countered by creating a video game montage of a superhuman James playing tight end for the Browns. The montage ends with the Eagles snatching James away to create a Double Dream Team for whom James spends his days watching Vince Young throw interceptions. Pick: Browns.
Falcons (3-3) at Lions (5-1) Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Lions by 3.5 . Jim Schwartz went from ''the coach who may finally be turning the Lions around'' to ''the guy who turned the postgame handshake into the Uproar Festival mosh pit'' in just a few regrettable seconds last week. Mike Smith is no stranger to coaching violence (he almost decked DeAngelo Hall in 2009), but Smith is more worried about Detroit crowd noise than acts of Schwartz. Smith made the Falcons practice while he had jet engine noise pumped through giant speakers. It was a far cry from past years, when teams prepared for Ford Field by practicing in a sensory deprivation chamber. Pick: Lions.
Chiefs (2-3) at Raiders (4-2) Sunday, 4:05 p.m. Line: Raiders by 4.5 . Time stands still in the Raiderverse. Hue Jackson was a Bengals assistant from 2004-6, so he may believe he is getting Early Carson Palmer in exchange for two first-round picks, one of them conditional. That Palmer routinely threw for 4,000 yards per season. Unfortunately, the Raiders are getting Late Carson Palmer, a conscientious objector who sat out all of training camp this year, a player whose efficiency rating has fallen in each of his last five seasons as a healthy starter. Palmer went straight from the recliner to the starting lineup, meaning that the Raiders' game plan this week will be mostly runs, reverses and fake punts, which is really not a stretch for them.
The Chiefs have won two games after an 0-3 start, and beanbags may be the reason. The embattled coach Todd Haley set up a game in the locker room, which has lightened the atmosphere and fostered team unity. The beanbags offer almost as much resistance as the Colts and the Vikings, the two opponents the Chiefs beat to get their confidence back. Haley has also given up shaving during the winning streak in an effort to look more like the St. Louis Cardinals squirrel. Pick: Raiders.
Rams (0-5) at Cowboys (2-3) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Cowboys by 12 .5. Jerry Jones has backed away from his harsh criticism of Jason Garrett's play-calling after last week's loss. Jones wanted Garrett to give Tony Romo more passing opportunities while the Cowboys nursed a 3-point lead, because we all know that never backfires. ''I would say that probably if I had that to do over again, I wouldn't comment, period,'' Jones said later in the week. Was he visited by the Ghosts of Meddling Past, Present and Future? Perhaps Nolan Ryan's low-key demeanor as the Texas Rangers' owner is rubbing off. The new Rams receiver Brandon Lloyd had a reputation as an extraordinary talent with major maturity issues when he played for the 49ers and the Redskins, but he blossomed in Denver under the former Broncos coach Josh McDaniels, now a Rams assistant. Birds of a feather and all that. Pick: Cowboys.
Packers (6-0) at Vikings (1-5) Sunday, 4:15 p.m. Line: Packers by 9. Donovan McNabb, whose declining accuracy has the Vikings passing game look like a game of pin the tail on the donkey, has been mercy-benched so the Vikings can develop the off-brand prospect Christian Ponder. Ponder is best known to magnetic resonance imaging technicians in Tallahassee as the Florida State quarterback who played through multiple injuries; no one knows yet if he can throw a pass without raising health insurance premiums. The Packers have been excellent long enough that we take it for granted, but not for so long that we resent it, placing them in a sports-consciousness blind spot that makes them difficult to comment upon. Pick: Packers.
Ravens (4-1) at Jaguars (1-5) Monday, 8:30 p.m. Line: Ravens by 7 .5. We wrap this week's remarkable run of ho-hum matchups with a game of staggering inconsequence. The Ravens specialize in beating down-and-out teams, often in methodically dull ways. With David Garrard, Matt Turk and Mike Sims-Walker all briefly unemployed in the middle of the week, more recognizable Jaguars were out of the league than on the team's roster. That changed when Jacksonville re-signed Sims-Walker, who was cut by the Rams, who lost two weeks ago to the Ravens, 37-7, to give the Jaguars a shot of adrenaline, or more likely a nice cup of chamomile. Pick: Ravens.
Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line. nThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Start-Up Advantage

BYLINE: By GARRETT CAMP. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
I'M from Calgary, Alberta. My mother was an artist and my father was an economist until they changed careers and became a design/build team. I grew up watching them build homes.
My elementary school had 150 students, with one class for each grade, 1 to 9, so I was with the same kids throughout. When I entered high school, there were 1,700 students. It was a big change.
In 1996, I enrolled in the University of Calgary for a degree in electrical engineering. After my junior year I lived in Montreal, working on speech recognition technology during an internship at Nortel Networks. I also took courses at Concordia University in Montreal. I returned to Calgary in 2000 to finish the degree and stayed for a master's in software engineering. 
I started our company in Calgary with three friends while in graduate school. I like to say StumbleUpon provides a personal tour of the Internet. The responses are more targeted to your interests than they would be with a regular search engine. If you choose a topic on our site that you're interested in, such as art, Web sites related to art appear, as if you're leafing through an art magazine.
I'm interested in sites that help people find information and filter what's available. The Internet is so big that no one can stay on top of everything. I'm also interested in projects in which Internet technologies augment brick-and-mortar businesses. In 2009, I was a co-founder of uber.com, which allows people to book idle town cars and drivers over their cellphones. I'm the chairman.
If I had it to do over, I might have finished school first, then devoted all my time to StumbleUpon instead of dividing my time between the two. In the end, however, it was probably good to take the time I did. From the papers I read in grad school, I learned what researchers were finding about collaborative systems, which was helpful in designing our product.
My co-founders and I knew we wanted to start a company before we had a fully formed idea. At the beginning there were four of us; Geoff Smith and I are left. I remember the timeline. We set up the corporate entity in October 2001, and on Nov. 5, I came up with the name. We finished the prototype in 2002 and I worked on it part time until 2005 when I met with angel investors who provided financing.
The company took off, and in 2006 I moved to San Francisco to be near the start-up scene. Before long, we were getting buyout offers. EBay made a great offer, so in 2007 we agreed to be acquired. Two years later, we assembled a few investors and bought the company back to have total control. We believed we could attract the best people by being a start-up again.
I've met a number of employees and investors through our site. Our first angel investor sent me a message through StumbleUpon and said he liked what we'd done. I met him for dinner and he introduced us to other angel investors. We hired our first business development specialist from Google; he left when eBay acquired us. But when we spun out from eBay, he became one of our investors who helped us buy the company back. I literally stumbled upon our chief scientist when I was on our site and landed on a page that he had added. I realized I had based one of the chapters in my thesis on his work. I contacted him, then hired him.
If the founders of a start-up are considering selling it, I'd advise them to consider the synergies. Could the buyer give you access to something you don't have now, like a certain technology? Would it make your life easier? Are you looking for a change? Things will change, so you have to be ready for that. It took me several months to make the decision.

HEADLINE: Lab Fight Raises U.S. Security Issues

BYLINE: By JENNIFER GOLLAN. 
jgollan@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Synthetic biology -- which includes the development of fuels, organ tissue and tumor-destroying bacteria -- became a focus of government and law enforcement agencies after 9/11 and the anthrax attacks that quickly followed it. The field's ''extraordinary promise,'' a presidential commission concluded in December, is accompanied by ''potential risks'' to humans and the environment.
Even worse, it is possible that such designer organisms could fall into the hands of a ''deranged individual or terrorist, who could create and release a deadly virus, said Richard H. Ebright, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University. The potential for such a chain of events has cast a pall over the discipline, he said.
A dispute at the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, a prominent coalition of biology labs that is led by the University of California, Berkeley, illustrates the potentially dangerous consequences of the research. At the heart of the controversy is a biosafety expert who resigned last summer amid complaints that the coalition was not doing enough to prevent a biological disaster. 
The expert, Paul M. Rabinow, an anthropology professor at Berkeley, was hired to evaluate the security and ethical ramifications of the center's research and report his findings to the top administrators. (The National Science Foundation, which granted about $23.3 million to SynBERC, has required the coalition to include research focused on the ethical, security and social aspects of its work.)
The disagreement at the center -- which is known as SynBERC -- came to a head over the creation and application of security and disaster-preparedness guidelines.
In internal memorandums, published papers and private conversations with Jay Keasling, SynBERC's director, Dr. Rabinow said that he outlined practical methods to improve security and preparedness, but that his recommendations were largely ignored.
In March 2010, the National Science Foundation reported that some parts of SynBERC's research on security and risk ''appear to be primarily observational in nature rather than proactive and developmental.'' The foundation appeared to place some of the blame on Dr. Rabinow, who was paid about $723,000 over five years, and said that ''a change in leadership will be necessary to facilitate significant progress.''
Six months after that recommendation, Dr. Rabinow was replaced by Drew Endy, SynBERC's strategic director and an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford. Dr. Rabinow stayed on at SynBERC as a researcher until July, when he resigned. Three of his doctoral students also left their research positions at SynBERC.
Dr. Rabinow said in an interview that he resigned because he was fed up with what he described as SynBERC's scientists' indifference toward their ''responsibility to larger society, which is funding them, by entrusting them to manipulate life.'' The center includes scientists from the University of California, San Francisco; Stanford; Harvard; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and Prairie View A&M University in Texas.
''It had begun to worry me how profoundly irresponsible these guys are,'' Dr. Rabinow said. ''There are possibilities of all kinds of nefarious things happening. There is no reason that someone couldn't modify a virus; you could release it on an airplane or subway, and it could have profound terror effects.''
Dr. Keasling disputed the account of Dr. Rabinow, who he said had failed to do his job.
''Paul failed in two realms: actively communicating what he wanted to do and actively carrying them out,'' said Dr. Keasling, a professor in the chemical engineering and bioengineering departments at Berkeley and the chief executive of the United States Department of Energy's Joint BioEnergy Institute, which is devoted to biofuel research. ''It became clear over time that he wasn't going to do the job.''
Kevin Costa, SynBERC's administrative director, said officials wanted to implement security proposals but lacked the leadership to do so.
''We were always interested in doing those things, but there wasn't a champion to step up -- whether it be Jay Keasling or Paul Rabinow -- and lead those projects,'' Mr. Costa said. ''I think the bioscientists were looking to Paul to lead the way, and he was waiting for the bioscientists to show more enthusiasm.''
Mr. Costa said Dr. Rabinow never produced a practical handbook written in a way that the project's scientists or industry partners could understand. Further, Mr. Costa said, private companies participating in the project had asked Dr. Rabinow and his team to provide practical advice on how to communicate with the public in case of a disaster -- which, Mr. Costa said, never materialized.
Dr. Rabinow previously held a fellowship from the National Science Foundation to study molecular biology. He also has served as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.
He said one crucial area of concern was that SynBERC scientists possessed the technology to determine which DNA sequences are needed to modify genes and create novel functions. These sequences are stored in public databases and can be generated by private companies or academic facilities that synthesize genes.
Federal laws prohibit the transfer of toxins and pathogenic microorganisms. But Mr. Rabinow is concerned that hackers or rogue scientists could acquire the seemingly benign DNA sequences and build a deadly virus.
''DNA synthesis companies have no way of currently telling, once the sequences are put together, what the result will be,'' Dr. Rabinow said. ''Somebody could manufacture pathogens that are dangerous to the environment.''
SynBERC's leaders did not take the threat seriously enough, said Anthony Stavrianakis, one of Mr. Rabinow's graduate students who also resigned from the center. ''Given the spread of know-how, technology, hacking culture, all set within a changing geopolitics, simply asserting that 'everything is under control,' '' as SynBERC has, ''is not true,'' Mr. Stavrianakis wrote in an e-mail.
SynBERC says that the DNA and proteins used in its research are the same as those used in biological studies since the 1970s and do not pose a new biological or chemical threat.
Dr. Keasling also said that synthetic biologists diligently police themselves.
''Yes, there are going to be risks, but we are getting out in front of it,'' he said. At the same time, he added, the notion of a terrorist using a company to acquire and customize genetic sequences is ''kind of far-fetched.''
Dr. Rabinow said that his work was not difficult to understand and that it was not his responsibility to produce a communication plan for the public. ''I can't be blamed for that,'' he said.
Maria Zacharias, a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation, declined to address specific questions about the disagreement at SynBERC or the underlying reasons for recommending a change in leadership in security. But she said the foundation meets every quarter with SynBERC's researchers to discuss progress on issues like biosafety and biosecurity.

HEADLINE: Latin American Art, Rediscovered Again

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
In November, the Art Dealers Association of America will start its new season of collector forums with ''Latin American Art in Global Collections'' at the Morgan Library and Museum. The panel will be timed to the Pinta, a Latin American Art fair now in its fifth year that coincides with Christie's and Sotheby's Latin American art auctions. Also next month, the Museum of Modern Art will open an exhibition devoted to Diego Rivera's murals. Five years ago, the museum appointed its first curator of Latin American art.
Museums, dealers and collectors are showing a growing interest in the field and an increasing awareness of its value and importance. 
''Latin America is hot, whether you're talking about Bogota, Colombia; Sao Paulo, Brazil; or Buenos Aires, Argentina,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, the director of MoMA. ''You've got institutions with a longstanding interest, biennials, art fairs, new collectors and other institutions that have become increasingly aware of how important Latin America is to any global conversation.''
Art aficionados in the United States are reaching beyond the Western canon to build their collections. The country's growing Hispanic population also represents a new potential constituency of collectors and museum-goers.
And there is a crop of curators who are more internationally minded. ''There is a multilingual generation of U.S. curators,'' said Susana Torruella Leval, a trustee at the Metropolitan Museum of Art who formerly served as the director of El Museo del Barrio.
To Latin American art experts, the larger world is discovering what they have known all along: that the field is rich and worthy of attention.
''We seem like an evergreen, to be rediscovered over and over,'' said Julian Zugazagoitia, who stepped down as Museo del Barrio's director last year to become director of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo.
At the same time, Mr. Zugazagoitia and others say, there is a growing sophistication about the field, a stronger body of scholarship.
''Over the last 10 to 15 years, museums have created a deeper understanding of their holdings or a different focus on creating collections,'' Mr. Zugazagoitia said. ''One of the important things that has come out is an awareness of how rich and varied Latin American art is.''
The examples of that stepped-up activity abound. The Institute of Fine Arts at New York University has a colloquium on Spanish and Latin American art; the theme of this year's is architecture. Art schools in Chicago and Texas are now graduating a number of scholars in the field. And in March, the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Calif., together with the Getty Research Institute held, ''Between Theory and Practice: Rethinking Latin American Art in the 21st Century,'' a two-part symposium that took place in Southern California and in Lima, Peru.
''There is a growing vibrancy and energy and new enthusiasm in Latin American art, but also a growing awareness of the history and the cross-references between Latin American art and European art,'' said Linda Blumberg, the executive director of the Art Dealers Association of America.
Several institutions have led the way, Ms. Leval said, like the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston under Peter C. Marzio, who died last year; the Bronx Museum of the Arts under Holly Block; and the New Museum under Marcia Tucker, who died in 2006.
El Museo del Barrio, which recently reopened after an extensive renovation, has become perhaps New York's leading Latino cultural institution. In June, the museum plans to explore the visual arts and aesthetic development across the Caribbean in collaboration with the Queens Museum of Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem.
The Modern has a long track record with Latin American Art; its holdings include the sculptor Gego, the painter Jesus Rafael Soto and the painter and sculptor Joaquin Torres-Garcia.
Most recently, the museum has established a special fund for Latin American and Caribbean acquisitions, with Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, a longtime champion of Latin American art at the museum, as its chairwoman.
In 2004, Ms. Cisneros donated nine works of postwar Latin American paintings and sculptures from her collection, including works by artists never before represented in the museum's collection, like the Venezuelan painter Armando Reveron, the Brazilian object-maker Lygia Clark and the Argentine sculptor Gyula Kosice.
The Modern is planning a major exhibition on the influence of Ms. Clark, to open in May 2013, and a survey show of Latin American architecture from the 1920s to the 1970s, to open around the same time.
The museum also recently established a Latin American collectors group, along with the curator position, held by Luis Perez-Oramas and endowed by Estrellita Brodsky, who is herself an independent curator.
''It deserves its own attention,'' she said. ''It shouldn't be lumped into this big massive thing, which runs the risk of being more derivative.''
Places like Brazil, which has a vibrant cultural infrastructure of collectors, dealers and artists, have become their own art hubs. ''It's part now of a circuit,'' Mr. Lowry, of MoMA, said. ''There is a strong argument to be made that a number of artists from the region are among the most interesting artists working today.''
Because there is a strong market for Latin American art within Latin America, the prices for pieces from the region remain high. ''Economies like Brazil's, with strong currency, make it really hard to compete,'' Mr. Lowry said. ''So if you want to buy at the top of the market in Latin America, you will be paying very comparable prices to New York or London or Paris.''
''This,'' Mr. Lowry added, ''is not a flash in the pan.''

HEADLINE: The Saudi Ambassador of Sangfroid

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
There were women who lost their heads over Adel al-Jubeir, back when the Saudi ambassador was a charming playboy. I had the opposite experience. He saved me from losing my head.
In 2002, I was walking around a luxury mall in Riyadh with Jubeir, a cosmopolitan graduate of the University of North Texas and Georgetown University, when the robed, bearded religious police bore down on us, pointing at me and scolding in Arabic.
''They say they can see the outline of your body,'' Jubeir translated. It took a surprisingly long time, given his stature as a top adviser to the future King Abdullah, but he talked the mutawwa out of beheading or lashing me, or whatever pound of flesh they wanted to exact because they saw an inch of flesh. 
Given that his father was a diplomat too -- one of the first Saudis to have a college degree -- maybe the 49-year-old's equanimity is in his genes. He is far more understated than his flamboyant predecessor, Prince Bandar, who was so plugged into the Bush dynasty he was known as ''Bandar Bush.''
Jubeir stayed cool even when American officials informed him several months ago about the latest stunning chapter in the Saudi Arabia-versus-Iran Great Game for supremacy in the Middle East: an outlandish plot by an Iranian-American used-car dealer in Texas who said his cousin was a senior member of the Iranian Quds Force.
The car dealer wanted to recruit someone from a Mexican drug cartel for $1.5 million to kill Jubeir with a car bomb or at a Washington restaurant -- no matter the collateral damage. But the bungler hired a paid D.E.A. informant posing as a cartel hit man instead.
As evidence mounted of money transfers and taped conversations, Jubeir accepted that, as President Obama said, the plot was ''paid by and directed by individuals in the Iranian government.'' Iran denies that, and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Fareed Zakaria: ''Do we really need to kill the ambassador of a brotherly country?''
''It went from 'I can't believe this,' '' the ambassador said with a dry smile, ''to 'Man, these guys really know how to ruin a man's day.' ''
He had to force himself to live a normal existence for months, not telling family or staff, until a criminal complaint was unveiled and the Texas car dealer was before a judge.
Gathering his shaken staff in the embassy, he said: ''Nothing befalls us except that which God has written for us. If anything, it should reinforce our resolve. Otherwise the bad guys win.''
He got a standing ovation.
His family was ''shocked'' and his frightened twin 9-year-old daughters called his office to grill him. He reassured them that there was ''a bad guy but no danger.'' Still, they pressed: ''O.K., when are you coming home?'''
Over lunch at the embassy in his first interview since then, he told me in his whispery voice that he was surprised the plotters had assumed he'd be hanging at modish restaurants. These days, the slender, smartly tailored ambassador is more of a nester, spending time with the twins and his 9-month-old son.
''I work so much, I enjoy sitting at home doing nothing,'' said the diplomat with the rough commute -- 12-hour flights to Riyadh several times a month.
I asked if he thought he was targeted because of his tough position on Iran, underscored in a 2008 diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks quoting him reiterating that King Abdullah wanted the U.S. to ''cut off the head of the snake.''
''You should ask the perpetrators, not me,'' he said wryly. ''We do what we have to do, and we can't let issues like this deter us.''
For many centuries, the protection of emissaries has been a cardinal principle enshrined in relations between nations, even ones at war. If you kill envoys whose messages you don't like, you end up with the law of the jungle.
The plot against Jubeir was so bizarre that it spawned a bouquet of conspiracy theories. But many believe that if the plotters had recruited a criminal who was not a U.S. informant, it could have succeeded and people might have assumed that it was Al Qaeda seeking revenge for the killing of Osama.
It shows how little we know about Iran that there are two opposing theories about the motive: One, that Iranians engaged in an act of desperation because they're weak. Two, that Iranians engaged in an act of bravado because we're weak. At first, Iran charged the U.S. with fabricating the plot in order to distract from our economic woes.
Skeptics assert that Iran, ever more ideological and obsessed with restoring the glory of the Persian Empire, has been emboldened by getting away with murder, literally, for three decades. They suggest that America has let it off lightly on everything from the 1983 U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut to the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing to Iran's meddling in Iraq, sending weapons and operatives to kill our soldiers.
Some worry that America spends too much time hoping that Iran will become more reasonable when, in reality, it's trying to get nuclear weapons so it can become less reasonable.
News of the plot, denounced by the kingdom as ''sinful and abhorrent,'' has made Saudi Arabia more sympathetic in an enemy-of-my-enemy sort of way. At a recent fete here, Jubeir was thronged by politicians, diplomats and journalists, all asking how he was bearing up.
Some Saudi commentators demanded immediate measures against Iran. Asked about it, Jubeir said, ''You have to be deliberate.'' The Saudis have asked the U.N. to make sure ''the perpetrators are accountable,'' he said.
As I left, I asked the ambassador about the painting in his office of Arab tribesmen riding horses and camels.
''It's artistic license,'' he noted with amusement. ''Camels don't ride with horses. They ride separately. Horses go faster and camels go longer.''

 BODY:
THE playwright David Henry Hwang has been in high demand in China in recent years -- not for works like his Tony Award-winning ''M. Butterfly,'' which is essentially banned there, but because of his standing as the only son of Asia to be represented regularly on Broadway. In 2005 he was invited to Shanghai to discuss Broadway-style shows that might fill the lavish cultural centers under construction across the country. Yet China's appreciation for status symbols like Broadway and Mr. Hwang did not translate into understanding more mundane aspects of American life.
''We went to one brand-new cultural center that had gorgeous Italian marble, fine Brazilian wood, smart German design and these horribly translated signs for handicapped restrooms that read, 'Deformed Man's Toilet,' '' Mr. Hwang recalled. ''You saw this over and over -- an eagerness among Chinese and Americans to impress one another, yet wildly basic misunderstandings because of language and cultural differences. I realized I'd never seen a play deal with this, where the characters are groping to relate to each other while keeping the dignity of their own language.'' 
Mr. Hwang's latest play, ''Chinglish,'' now in preview performances on Broadway at the Longacre Theater, is his effort to grapple with East-West relations from a vantage point that is new for him. Starting with his earliest plays at Stanford -- his first, ''FOB,'' went straight from a dormitory production to a run at the Public Theater in New York in 1980 -- he has explored multiculturalism, the stranger-in-a-strange-land tensions that affect Asian-Americans and others of hyphenated ethnicity. With ''Chinglish,'' which has no Asian-American characters, Mr. Hwang has moved on from multiculturalism (''it's no longer cutting edge,'' he said) to consider internationalism today, specifically the frustrations experienced by Americans and Chinese who are united in capitalist greed but divided by their cultural sensibilities.
The New York production may well create its own cultural divides. Some English-speaking theatergoers will be put off by parts of ''Chinglish,'' given that about a quarter of the dialogue is in Mandarin. (English supertitles will be projected onto a stage wall.) Mr. Hwang, who was born and raised in Los Angeles, isn't fluent in Mandarin, so he had his lines translated by associates.
Non-English dialogue is very rare on Broadway, but Mr. Hwang said he is hoping for a ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' moment for the theater, recalling the huge commercial success of that 2000 action-fantasy film about swordsmen and secrets in 18th-century China.
''You can't be a playwright without believing there's an audience for adventurous work,'' said Mr. Hwang, a boyish-looking 54-year-old, whose mop of spiky black hair was reminiscent of that of Billie Joe Armstrong, the lead singer of Green Day. ''In this case I thought 'Chinglish' would be kind of amusing, but it's been a pleasant surprise when people actually laugh out loud.''
Still, ''Chinglish'' is one of the biggest commercial risks on Broadway this season. The production cost about $3.5 million to mount, and when it opens on Thursday it will competing for an audience with other new American plays like ''Other Desert Cities,'' ''The Mountaintop,'' ''Seminar'' and ''Venus in Fur.'' Most straight plays are capitalized at $2 million to $3 million, and turning a profit is still difficult. (Plays sell fewer tickets than musicals do.)
Mr. Hwang and Jeffrey Richards, one of the lead producers, are well aware of the risk. In an unusual move the ticket discount flyer for ''Chinglish'' does not describe the play or even include its title on the cover, but rather notes that, in 2007, Mr. Richards and his business partner, Jerry Frankel, ''discovered a gem of a play in Chicago and brought it to Broadway.'' That was ''August: Osage County,'' which went on to win the Tony Award for best play and make money for its investors.
Mr. Richards said that the discount flier's emphasis on ''August: Osage County'' was not meant to suggest that the producers lacked faith in ''Chinglish.''
''The two plays will hopefully be positioned similarly, where many of the same people who took a chance on 'August' will take a chance on 'Chinglish,' since both are cases where the plays and the playwrights are the stars,'' Mr. Richards said.
Many Broadway theatergoers who have traveled in a non-English-speaking country will have an easy time relating to the main character, Daniel, a Cleveland businessman struggling, to humorous effect, with the language and customs of China as he negotiates with government officials over buying his company's (properly translated) signs. But many of the play's insights about the Chinese come through another key character, Xi Yan, a cagey, attractive bureaucrat whom Daniel falls for. Xi (pronounced ''she'') has attitudes about romance, marriage and business relationships -- or ''guanxi'' -- that will probably be eye opening to Americans unfamiliar with China.
Late in the play, for instance, Xi talks to Daniel about ''qingyi'' -- a word for a mature kind of love, a marital partnership (Xi earns laughs by saying it means comrade) -- and sets up a surprising clash between the two characters about different types of affection.
''A lot of the ways Xi looks at the world are culturally Chinese, in ways that I can identify with, but some of our audiences haven't,'' said Mr. Hwang, describing the audible gasps at key moments during the play's Chicago run. ''There are just so many fundamental misunderstandings about our two cultures, about ideas that Americans tend to think of as intrinsic, like the role of love in long-term marriages. We don't have a term in English, really, for qingyi. 'Love' is a clumsy word the way we use it. It can mean anything from altruistic love to brotherly love to lust.''
Jennifer Lim, who plays Xi in the Broadway production (as she also did in a critically acclaimed run at the Goodman Theater in Chicago over the summer), said the character was by far the most nuanced and compelling portrait of an Asian woman that she has played.
''I've gone out for the manicurists and all the other Asian roles, where the characters are all about attitude and comic relief, but most of those parts weren't recognizable as people,'' said Ms. Lim, who was born and raised in Hong Kong. ''But a fully rounded Chinese woman on Broadway, mostly speaking her native language -- and she is a lead character? Honestly I never thought I'd see it, let alone play it.''
Mr. Hwang began kicking around ideas for ''Chinglish'' a couple of years ago with Leigh Silverman, who directed his last play in New York, the 2007 production of ''Yellow Face,'' a semi-autobiographical work about cultural role playing and stereotyping. ''Yellow Face'' was Mr. Hwang's attempt to close the book on the cultural wars of the 1990s -- particularly, his public opposition to the casting of Jonathan Pryce, a Welsh actor, as a Eurasian in the Broadway production of ''Miss Saigon,'' and the subsequent flop of his own Broadway play ''Face Value,'' which was inspired by the ''Saigon'' debate and closed during previews.
''I wanted to use the play to figure out how I felt about China, which is cool now in a way that I never would have imagined as a child,'' Mr. Hwang said. ''There's something about China and its rush to capitalism that I find confusing. At the same time, we live in an America where capitalists oppose any government interference with free markets, while in China you have a very controlled, state-planned market where economic growth is better than ours.''
Ms. Silverman, who is also directing ''Chinglish,'' said she saw the play as a kind of bookend to ''M. Butterfly,'' which made Mr. Hwang's reputation when it opened on Broadway in 1988, running for almost two years. Both plays focus on white Westerners who go to China and find themselves in romances that are complicated by secrecy and cultural barriers. Whereas the Frenchman in ''M. Butterfly'' suffers tragic consequences from the delusion that his lover, a male opera diva, was a woman, ''Chinglish'' suggests that delusions of romance are a hindrance to professional success in modern China.
Mr. Hwang did not disagree with the link to ''M. Butterfly,'' which he said he believed would have a Broadway revival in the next few years.
''I wasn't consciously thinking that 'Chingish' was talking to 'M. Butterfly,' but I do see a relationship there, especially in how the power balance has started to shift between East and West,'' Mr. Hwang said. ''The two countries are at a point now where we'd be very smart to engage in a deep level and try to see things from the other people's points of view.''

HEADLINE: The Bad Guys vs. The Worse Guys

BYLINE: By LUKE MOGELSON

 BODY:
One afternoon this summer, in a park beside the Ajmil River, I sat with seven residents of Shahabuddin, a collection of villages in northern Afghanistan's Baghlan Province. It was the first week of Ramadan, and the park was almost empty, but still the men -- some middle-aged, others stooped and gray-bearded -- whispered conspiratorially and became silent whenever anybody walked close. Several minutes into our conversation, one of the younger men, who'd been mutely worrying at a piece of grass, rose and abruptly stalked off. The others, embarrassed, apologized for him. ''If Nur-ul Haq finds out we spoke to you,'' one of them explained, ''he will kill us.'' 
Nur-ul Haq is the commander of the Afghan Local Police in Shahabuddin. Since last winter, he has been primarily responsible for the security of the several thousand families living there. As one of the elders warily eyed two men in turbans squatting under some nearby shade, he told me that Haq and his local police had been felling people's trees and selling them as timber. Another of the elders joined in and named three men whom he accused Haq of murdering. ''These three murders are known to everyone,'' he said. ''Nobody knows how many others he has killed.'' The former principal of a local school said that he and his eight brothers were forced to leave their village after they reported to the government that the local police had seized their family's land. ''Nur-ul Haq threatened to come with tanks and take us all out of our home and kill us if we continued to complain about him,'' the man claimed, adding that he and his brothers were considering moving to Pakistan.
The elders estimated that more than 100 families had fled Shahabuddin because of the local police. The people were defenseless, they said, and indeed they all seemed cowed and frightened. But before we parted ways, one of them, with a note of defiance, assured me: ''Nur-ul Haq has no place in this province. As long as the foreign troops are here, he is king. The minute they go, he should leave the country.'' Another agreed: ''I bet he can't stay for one night in Baghlan if there are no foreign troops.'' Grinning at the prospect, the old man added, ''The people will rise against him.''
Haq's unit is one of 51 local police forces that have been established across rural Afghanistan over the last year, employing more than 8,000 villagers. Eventually, the force is expected to reach 30,000 in more than 100 sites. The rapid rollout reflects a spirited commitment to the program by the U.S. military, which claims that local police throughout the country have subdued insurgents and helped tip formerly ambivalent communities toward the government. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates has called the Afghan Local Police ''potentially a game-changer,'' and Gen. David Petraeus described it as ''almost the personification of counterinsurgency.'' Every U.S. officer I spoke with considers it essential to achieving a measure of stability in Afghanistan that will be sustainable in our absence. ''This is our last shot,'' one major told me. ''If this doesn't work, we got nothing.''
Under the auspices of Afghanistan's Interior Ministry, the A.L.P. is technically ''Afghan-owned'' -- a point that American officials are keen to emphasize. It would be more accurate, though, to describe it as a collaboration between the government of Afghanistan and an elite branch of the United States military called the Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command (or Cfsocc, pronounced ''SIFF-sock''). The origins of the A.L.P. truly began with its predecessor program, the Community Defense Initiative, which in the summer of 2009 embedded small teams of Green Berets in Afghan villages to mobilize resistance against the Taliban and other militants. The following year, when Petraeus assumed command in Afghanistan, one of his priorities was to formalize the effort and increase its scale.
Now districts that are chosen to be local police sites designate roughly 300 men to receive uniforms, salaries, AK-47's, training from U.S. Special Operations Forces and a mandate to defend their home villages against insurgents. In theory, each local police recruit must be approved by community elders and vetted by Afghanistan's domestic intelligence service, while each commander answers directly to a district chief of police. These safeguards, along with a strict limit on powers (the A.L.P. can't make arrests, patrol outside their districts or possess any heavy weaponry) are intended to prevent local police from resembling the predatory militias so abhorred by Afghans for their rampant depredations throughout the 1990s.
But selectively arming portions of any given population, no matter the precautions, can be risky business in Afghanistan, and the question looming darkly over the military successes of the A.L.P. -- which Petraeus credited to the fact that ''no one protects their home like a homeowner'' -- is what other purposes might their American-supplied guns and training find, especially after foreign troops leave the country. One highly positioned Afghan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was not optimistic. ''When you have a headache, you take pills,'' he told me. ''Some pills will cure your headache but damage your stomach in the process. That is what we have with the A.L.P. The local police are a temporary solution. Long-term, they are poison.''
So far, the most troublesome region for the A.L.P. has been the north, where ethnic, political and tribal factions have long persecuted one another. ''Land disputes, water disputes, women disputes are a portion of the aftermath of three decades of war,'' says Gran Hewad, a native of Baghlan Province and a political researcher at the Afghanistan Analysts Network. The two predominant ethnicities in Baghlan are the Pashtuns and the Tajiks. After the defeat of the Taliban in 2001, the previously subjugated Tajiks consolidated power in the province, monopolizing government posts and proliferating the ranks of the national police. Today, about 80 percent of Baghlan's national police hail from Andarab, an entirely Tajik district that is staunchly anti-Pashtun. To help offset the imbalance, the A.L.P. in Baghlan has been made almost exclusively Pashtun. While this solution may solve one problem, it has also created another. Factionalism in the north goes beyond ethnicity, and within the Pashtun community itself various distinct tribes harbor feuds that match in animosity those with the Tajiks; additionally, within each tribe, conflicts among families can date back generations. Every one of the numerous allegations of A.L.P. misconduct in Baghlan Province that Hewad and his colleagues have learned about comes from a Pashtun victim. Most have also come from Shahabuddin.
The first time I met Nur-ul Haq, I was brought to his compound in the small village of Gaji by a Pashtun tribal elder named Pir Muhammad, who made a point of denouncing critics of Haq and the A.L.P. as Tajiks conniving to keep Pashtuns under their thumb. ''They were ruling over us,'' he said. ''With the arrival of the local police, people took a breath of relief.'' Although the congested streets and mobbed bazaars of the provincial capital Pul-i-Khumri are just a 20-minute drive away, Shahabuddin's mud-walled compounds and rutted roadways, traveled as frequently by donkey as by car, feel a world apart. Many villagers rarely visit the city, expressing a vague disdain for those who live there; the reverse, of course, is also true. To get to Gaji, we followed a dirt road through vivid green rice paddies, cotton fields and melon patches sprawling between the brown foothills of the Karkar and Choghsang mountains. On either side of a narrow bridge, over turbulent water that tumbled the bloated carcass of a large animal, several local police officers stood in mismatched ensembles of traditional dress and government-issued uniforms, manning two shoddy fortifications made from sandbags and plywood. Recognizing Pir Muhammad, they let us pass.
Haq's compound wasn't far from there. When we arrived, a group of villagers were lounging under a canopy, hashing out a disagreement over water rights and watching an old TV with a ceramic eagle perched on top. Compared with the elders, the middle-aged Haq looked unexceptional and unassuming: dark and sinewy with shaggy black hair, unadorned by turban, vest or weapon. As he led us to a private room with diaphanous pink curtains, I noticed a scorpion tattooed on his arm. ''Two years ago, this whole area was under Taliban control,'' Haq said as we reclined on large cushions, forgoing, because of Ramadan, the customary tea. Like the rest of him, Haq's voice was unexpectedly small but tense, carrying a threat of excitability, as if something in him were coiled and ready to spring.
He described how, before he and his comrades routed them, the Taliban roamed freely and occupied families' homes and hanged recalcitrant villagers in the trees. Most were foreign or from other provinces, and to recruit local allies they relied on a campaign of violence and intimidation. Haq said that after several attacks on his home, he requested assistance from the governor and provincial chief of police, who ''bluntly told me they couldn't help me.'' Rather than capitulate to the Taliban, Haq joined the Hezb-i-Islami insurgent movement led by the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. ''I decided to take up arms against the provincial government in Pul-i-Khumri because they were not providing us with protection against the Taliban,'' he explained.
This might be true -- Haq might have joined one insurgent group, reluctantly, only to defend himself against another -- or it might be as good an example as any of the ubiquitous myth-making in Afghanistan, where personal narratives must often be rewritten to reflect an ever-shifting landscape of allegiances and adversaries. Whatever his motives, over the next two years, Haq and his fellow Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin (H.I.G.) insurgents fought a series of turf battles with the Taliban until, eventually, the government offered them protection in exchange for disarmament. He agreed, but after six months in a safe house in Pul-i-Khumri, he said, ''we decided we needed to have our weapons back and return to our villages.''
When Haq returned to Shahabuddin, the fighting resumed, culminating last fall in a Taliban siege of the compounds he and his outmatched men were occupying. ''There were more than 500 Taliban,'' Haq said, ''and only about 30 of us. I was able to get to the Pul-i-Khumri government and ask for help. The chief of police kept making excuses. Consequently, I went to the Americans.'' About a month earlier, a small U.S. Special Forces team arrived in Shahabuddin, and when Haq appealed to them, he said, ''right away they decided to help me.'' The ensuing battle lasted four days, ending when the Americans called for heavy air support. Seven of Haq's men were killed, and with the endorsement and facilitation of the Special Forces, those who survived became Shahabuddin's local police. No major confrontation with the Taliban has happened since.
When I mentioned the complaints of criminal abuse, Haq, with a shrug of annoyance, also chalked them up to Tajik machinations. ''It is obvious,'' he said. ''We were able to stop some of the corruption in the government. They were benefiting from our insecurity.'' He gestured at the elders gathered outside. ''They don't like people resolving their problems in the traditional way. They would like to see these people standing in their doorways, offering them bribes.'' He added: ''The Pul-i-Khumri government is no good. If the American forces leave today, the Pul-i-Khumri government will probably do us more harm than the Taliban.''
To speak with government officials in Pul-i-Khumri about the A.L.P. is to glimpse the wilderness of ethnic and political hostilities that makes outside intervention so challenging. One of the most vociferous critics of the program is the head of the provincial council, Rasoul Khan. Probably more than any other individual, he is responsible for the Tajik power grab in Baghlan after 2001, and the marginalization of the Pashtuns that followed. He has been accused of seizing Pashtun lands, running drugs and brutally dispensing with his enemies. ''He has his own subcommanders, who are using government facilities, police vehicles, police uniforms,'' Hewad, of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, said. ''After the fall of the Taliban, this man, who was in the trenches against them, came to the government with a huge amount of his fighters and militias from the mountains.'' The senior Special Forces sergeant in Baghlan told me: ''Rasoul Khan is one of the most crooked dudes you'll ever meet. He's got so many connections, all the way to the president himself. He can literally order a hit on anybody he wants.''
At the Provincial Council building in Pul-i-Khumri, I found Rasoul Khan surrounded by a retinue of hardy-looking Tajiks, who nodded in agreement with everything he said. ''As the representatives of the people, we are against the establishment of the A.L.P.,'' he insisted. ''The danger of the A.L.P. is much worse than the Taliban. The people becoming members are all criminals. They've killed at least nine people so far.''
Others dismiss these objections as self-serving. In his heavily guarded office above a hectic commercial street in downtown Pul-i-Khumri, a council member named Moh Faisal told me that the A.L.P. was anathema to Rasoul Khan because it represented a Pashtun threat to the Tajik hegemony over which he presided. ''In the past, he was involved in drug trafficking and killed lots of people,'' Faisal said. ''Now all his relatives, friends and associates are in the government. The national police in Baghlan are not accountable to the chief of police. They are accountable to Rasoul Khan.''
Nearly everyone in Pul-i-Khumri seemed to agree with this. The provincial police chief at the time, Brig. Gen. Abdul Rahman Rahimi, was a Pashtun; the fact that the vast majority of his men were Andarabi Tajiks rendered him largely ineffectual, his authority mostly nominal. Not long after speaking with Faisal, I visited Rahimi in his opulent Pul-i-Khumri office, where each wall was lined with plush leather couches on which petitioners could wait to be invited into a much smaller and less stately room for private conversation. When it was my turn to see the general, he said: ''An area that could not be secured by 500 national policemen is secured by 50 A.L.P. But what is really important is that the A.L.P. must be regulated.'' Ultimately, that regulation should come from the chief of police. But the general claimed that the Americans had hampered his ability to do his job and that U.S. Special Forces protected A.L.P. commanders from criminal investigations. ''The rules say the local police must be under the direct supervision of the national police,'' Rahimi said. ''Our friends in the Special Forces must not intervene in this.'' Toward the end of our conversation, his cellphone rang. After listening to the other line for several moments, and perhaps forgetting my recorder was on, he said in Dari: ''All three of them must be here for the investigation. Otherwise, the investigation cannot proceed.''
Rahimi was speaking of Nur-ul Haq, his younger brother Faz-ul Haq and their cousin Abdur Rahman. On later trips to Shahabuddin, I spent time with Faz-ul Haq and Rahman (who Human Rights Watch, in a recent report, says is accused of raping a 13-year-old boy), visiting A.L.P. checkpoints and accompanying foot patrols. As we made our way through verdant farmland irrigated by hand-dug canals, Faz-ul Haq seemed to have a story for each compound and cotton field we passed: here had been a Taliban headquarters, here a bloody firefight, here an R.P.G. attack. At his checkpoint in Omarkhel village, Rahman told me that as bad as it had sometimes been in Shahabuddin, he had only made the 20-minute drive to Pul-i-Khumri twice during the last year. ''They were terrorizing us, stealing from us,'' he said of the Taliban. But the Tajiks in the capital ''are stronger than the Taliban,'' he said.
''They never want to come,'' General Rahimi now said into the phone, impatiently. ''They are evading it by various means.'' When he hung up, I asked whom he'd been talking to. He said it was the U.S. Special Forces. The general was no doubt affected by Ramadan and the day's long fast, but he looked and sounded like a man overwhelmed by competing influences. ''The Special Forces must hand these guys over,'' he said. ''If they don't, it will jeopardize the entire program.''
The commander of U.S. Special Operations Forces in northern Afghanistan calls Rahimi's characterization ''an absolute lie.'' When we spoke, he stressed that it lay with Rahimi, not the Americans, to investigate complaints and make arrests. ''I'm not here to defend Nur-ul Haq,'' he said. ''But what I do know is I've seen a string of baseless allegations that when we followed up couldn't be substantiated.'' The leader of the Special Forces team working in Shahabuddin told me that he had personally escorted Haq to see criminal investigators in Pul-i-Khumri. ''If they want to arrest him, they can arrest him,'' he said.''We're not going to stop them in any way.'' In fact, it makes sense that Rahimi would want to give an impression of disapproving of Haq (thereby appeasing certain Tajiks in the provincial government), while also refraining from arresting him (which might result in Haq's removal and risk upsetting the precarious stability Shahabuddin now enjoys). Accusing American Special Forces of obstructionism would afford the general a convenient means of doing both.
All the same, whatever forces might influence Rahimi's actions, or lack thereof, the allegations remain. ''If they are true, obviously Nur-ul Haq won't be an A.L.P. commander,'' the Special Forces team leader told me. The problem, he said, was that no accusers had come forward, which only fed suspicions of Tajik subterfuge. I mentioned what a villager had told me: ''We are too afraid to raise any complaints against the local police. If we complain in the day, they will come in the night to take us from our homes. If they capture somebody, they tell the Americans he is Taliban.'' I also repeated the claim of the elders who said that more than 100 families had left Shahabuddin since Haq took control. If true, wasn't this evidence enough of mistreatment? The team leader acknowledged that many villagers had moved to the city. But here, too, the story was more complicated than it seemed. Before Haq joined the government, residents of Shahabuddin were obliged to ally with one of two insurgent groups -- H.I.G. or the Taliban -- and bitter grievances endured between those who chose differently. When the Taliban controlled Shahabuddin, supporters of Haq were forced to flee to the city; last year, when Haq returned and ousted the Taliban, many of those who stayed did the same. ''Whether they're innocent or not, they have this Taliban association,'' the Special Forces team leader said. ''And then the other families that are in the area have the H.I.G. association. And either way, they despise each other.''
At the end of the day, the team leader said, the situation in Baghlan was enormously complicated, and you never truly knew whom to believe. ''We're really trying to do the right thing,'' he said. ''One of my intelligence sergeants said it the right way: 'Everybody in some way or form is a bad guy here. So you just have to pick the people who are less bad than others to work with you.' '' The Special Operations commander in northern Afghanistan agrees. ''Given the guy's background, he's clearly not an angel,'' he said of Haq. ''We struggle with it. He's an imperfect solution. If not him, then who?''
About a month after I first visited Baghlan Province, the long-simmering antipathy between its local police and the Pul-i-Khumri national police finally erupted in violence. According to several Afghans and Americans involved, one of Haq's local police officers, a man named Sher Muhammad, was in Pul-i-Khumri on the last day of Ramadan when he was told that a relative, a 15-year-old boy named Humayun, was being used for sex by a powerful national police colonel -- a Tajik from Andarab.
Enraged, Sher drove directly to a highway checkpoint in the middle of a busy bazaar that was commanded by the colonel, whose name is Ghani, and demanded to know where Humayun was. The guards at the checkpoint told him it was none of his business. Sher went to his truck and got his rifle. When he returned to the checkpoint and insisted on seeing Humayun, Colonel Ghani ordered his men to shoot. A national police officer named Mestaray put two bullets in Sher's leg.
Abdul Halim, an Afghan Special Forces sergeant, happened to be passing through the bazaar in his truck. When I met with him, Sergeant Halim said that as he approached the national police checkpoint, ''I saw Sher lying on the ground, and a man in civilian clothes hitting him in the face with an AK-47.'' Halim stopped, disarmed Mestaray and helped the bloodied Sher across the road. Mestaray fled into a fortified compound where Colonel Ghani's battalion quartered. By this time, a crowd had gathered. ''While I was trying to get the crowd off the road, I saw a national police officer pointing his gun at Sher,'' Halim recounted. ''I said: 'Don't shoot him. He's already shot.' He didn't listen. He opened fire and shot Sher a couple of times in the back.'' Sher collapsed, and the gunman retreated into the same building as Mestaray.
An ambulance arrived to take Sher to the hospital, and shortly thereafter more armed men came onto the scene: the deputy chief of police, additional soldiers from the Afghan Special Forces, about 10 U.S. Special Forces soldiers and a large group of Afghan Local Police officers. As the Afghan and U.S. Special Forces tried to separate the national and local police, the ambulance returned to the scene with Sher's corpse, riddled with eight bullets. At this point, the American team leader, who was also there, told me, ''It really started getting out of control.'' The Americans managed to persuade the A.L.P. to attend to Sher's body while they tried to retrieve Colonel Ghani. They then followed behind an Afghan Special Forces team led by Master Sgt. Bilal Ahmed Sheenwari. Sheenwari later told me that when he reached the national-police compound, he found Colonel Ghani and nine other police guarding the front gate. ''I told Ghani, 'We need the guys who attacked Sher,' '' and here the colonel again ordered his men to open fire. A chaotic gun battle ensued between the Afghan Special Forces and Afghan national police. Sheenwari said the police officers fired on them with AK-47's, PK machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. ''We received fire, too,'' the American team leader said. ''All the Americans almost got hit with R.P.G.'s. It was a pretty hectic 15 minutes. There were civilians everywhere. There were A.N.P., A.L.P., A.S.F.'' He called for air support, and soon an F-16 and an Apache helicopter joined the fray. ''We got a personal phone call from Lt. Gen. Baba Jan'' -- the national police commander for northern Afghanistan -- ''telling us please don't kill everybody out there. That's what stopped us from doing anymore.''
Colonel Ghani and two other men were wounded. But Ghani, Mestaray and the officer who killed Sher have all since disappeared. The U.S. Special Forces and A.L.P. believe that Rasoul Khan evacuated them from the compound via a back road and is now concealing their whereabouts. When I later asked him whether he knew where Ghani was, Rasoul Kahn said Ghani was taken to India for medical treatment -- a story the U.S. Special Forces are convinced is untrue.
Humayun, the boy, has vanished as well. No one knows if he's alive or dead, but the A.L.P. are eager for retribution. When I asked the Special Forces team leader if he was worried about what might still result from the unresolved conflict, he said: ''Yes. Very much so.''
Proponents and critics of the A.L.P., when arguing its merits or its faults, each invoke Afghanistan's long history of irregular armed groups and diffuse, localized power dynamics. ''Our idea was to use the Musahiban dynasty as a model,'' Seth Jones, a former senior Cfsocc adviser, told me when I met with him near his office at the RAND Corporation in Washington. Encompassing the rule of Nadir Shah, Zahir Shah and Daoud Kahn, the Musahiban dynasty extended from 1929 until the communist coup of 1978, a period of relative peace often referred to as Afghanistan's golden age. Jones argues that Nadir Shah and his successors were able to achieve such stability ''because they understood the importance of local power'' and refrained from trying to displace it.
Critics of the A.L.P. point to a different precedent. The senior Afghan government official who views local police as ''poison'' in the long term, for example, also told me: ''Look at our history, especially the mujahedeen, and you see that the A.L.P. is the wrong program for our country. People are very tired here. Why did the people accept the Taliban? Most Afghans are not extremists. But they were tired of the militias, the mujahedeen.'' For Afghans who see the local police as potentially uncontrollable, the strategy represents a distressing step backward, not toward the Musahibans but the chaos that came later, during the anarchic '90s, when warlords and militias terrorized the country. Far from a golden age, this period is often called topakiyaan -- ''the time of the men with guns.''
In a country as fragmented as Afghanistan, no strategy can be expected to succeed or fail uniformly on a national scale, especially one, like the Afghan Local Police, that targets not the province or the district but the village. As problematic as the program has become amid the ethnic melee of the north, the majority of A.L.P. sites are concentrated in the south, where a comparatively homogenous Pashtun population has proved more hospitable. One of the earliest A.L.P. locations in southern Afghanistan was Kandahar's Arghandab District. Last summer, as part of President Obama's surge, American troops in Arghandab waged some of the most intense fighting of the war, dislodging large numbers of Taliban and winning a tenuous peace that the A.L.P. and the national police must now work together to maintain.
Before the surge, a Taliban checkpoint blocked the entrance to an area in Arghandab called Tabin, and villagers were regularly hanged from the trees that shade the slow-moving river there. Today, a local police headquarters stands around the bend, and Nesar Ahmed, an intense young man with a prosthetic right leg, commands 16 motley irregulars, whose Kalashnikovs are plastered with brightly colored stickers and wrapped in psychedelic fabric and turquoise beads. Nine months ago, Nesar told me, ''this entire area had turned into a hell.'' Now farmers can travel to Kandahar City from Tabin during the harvests, and they can irrigate their crops at night, when it is cool. ''They've already sold the fruit in their trees,'' he said, waving at the pomegranate orchards up the road.
Nesar is a cousin of Muhammad Issak, an ascendant personality in Arghandab, who functions both as Tabin's malik, or chief, and as its national police commander. When I met with Issak in Tabin, he was just returning from the funeral of a local tribal elder who was killed by Taliban assassins two days earlier in Kandahar City. Light-skinned and thin almost to the point of frailty, Issak affects a groomed mustache rather than a beard, and favors a sidearm discreetly holstered beneath his plaid vest; a gold watch hangs loosely from his small wrist. In an unlit room just wide enough to accommodate two bunk beds, Issak sat on the bottom mattress, one leg draped effetely on the other, while Nesar and his men crouched around him on the floor, nodding at his words.
The son of a mullah and a former teacher, Issak enlisted with the national police during the Taliban resurgence in 2006. Last year, after rising to the rank of company commander in Kandahar City, he brought 90 of his officers back to Tabin, where they set up checkpoints in six different villages, and Issak promptly began working with U.S. Special Operations Forces to establish the A.L.P. ''I asked the people to send their youth,'' Issak said. ''Every clan from the seven mosques sent two or three of their boys.''
The boys included a teenager in an ill-fitting brown uniform, another sporting leather ammo pouches over a bright red T-shirt, a third with a purple scarf tied around his head, Rambo-style, and an older man whose long black beard showed the first wisps of gray. They all appeared timorous and awkward, still unused to their status as armed men. I asked the older one why he joined the A.L.P. ''We could not take care of our orchards and fields because there was fighting in them,'' he said. ''There were I.E.D.'s in every field and roadway. I joined when I felt there was a need for me to bring security to my area. I want to go back to my field.''
Down the road from Tabin, past labyrinthine ruins of old, mud-walled compounds, through lush fields of okra and low-growing vineyards, a collection of villages called Nagahan has been a focal point for U.S. Special Operations Forces since before the advent of the A.L.P. The local police commander, Muhammad Nabi, distinguished himself throughout Arghandab during the jihad against the Soviet Union, but later fled Afghanistan under Taliban rule and was pushing a handcart around Quetta, Pakistan, scraping by as a street vendor, when he heard of plans to recapture Kandahar with the help of American forces in late 2001. He returned to join the fight, then laid down his arms; two years ago, the U.S. military gave them back, under the Community Defense Initiative. ''I did not want it,'' Nabi told me, ''but they insisted that I take the lead here.''
At that time, there were 10 Taliban checkpoints in Nagahan. ''We liberated this area from them in one year,'' Nabi told me. A few days later, I met with a yellow-toothed elder named Meera Jan, who shared fond memories of fighting alongside Nabi before the surge and the A.L.P. When I asked him what their force was like then -- how were they organized? what sorts of resources did they have access to? -- Meera Jan reached into his kameez and brought out a filth-encrusted elastic belt, the reflective kind U.S. soldiers wear when jogging on military bases. He held it up for me to admire, as if its properties were magical, and explained that in lieu of uniforms, an American officer had distributed the belts to distinguish the armed villagers from insurgents.
''We defended our area with this belt,'' Meera Jan said.
By last June, Nabi's militia had grown sufficiently effective to incite the Taliban to an act of desperation. Several hundred people were celebrating the marriage of a local couple when a stranger intruded, wrapped in a shawl. Nabi was a few feet away when the man detonated himself. The blast was devastating, and though Nabi escaped with minor shrapnel wounds and a ruptured eardrum, scores were killed, many of them women and children. (News reports at the time put the toll at 40; everyone I spoke with in Nagahan said 85.) One of the wedding guests, a man named Noorullah, told me a story I hadn't heard from anyone else -- that before reaching the ceremony, the bomber stopped to ask a local boy where exactly it was being held. Noorullah claimed the boy embraced the man in greeting and felt some pieces of metal attached to his arms and back. He followed him to the wedding, and when they arrived, the boy asked one of the commanders for a gun, intending to kill the bomber. Assuming the boy was up to mischief, the commander refused. ''By the time he made others understand, it was too late,'' Noorullah said. He told this story very slowly and very quietly, and when he finished he added: ''The bomber blew himself up in front of me. My children were killed.''
The victims are buried in several mass graves, marked by the colored flags reserved for martyrs. The attack galvanized the community against the Taliban. Such unanimous resolve is just one of several preconditions that have made parts of Arghandab uniquely suited to the A.L.P. -- but that are also often lacking elsewhere in Afghanistan. Before I left the district, the chief elder for Naghan's 20-member shura, who said he lost 20 relatives in the wedding attack, told me: ''The locals are with Nabi. The shura has appointed him, and the people will continue to support him, with or without the Americans.''
The vast differences between the A.L.P. in Kandahar and Baghlan underscore the vexing nature of a war that varies profoundly from district to district, village to village. While members of the local and national police in Arghandab are literally family, in Pul-i-Khumri they seem destined for bloodshed. A week after Sher Muhammad was murdered, Pashtun elders in Baghlan Province convened a shura to discuss possible courses of action. More than 1,000 men attended. One result was a list of seven demands submitted to the governor, the last of which was that Rasoul Khan ''be brought to justice'' for ''multiple crimes,'' including hiding Colonel Ghani and the national police officers who shot Sher Muhammad. The petition assigned one week for a satisfactory response, at which point the Pashtuns would block the two main roads into Pul-i-Khumri.
The day before the deadline, I returned to Baghlan and met with Rasoul Khan, who spoke ominously about the local police. ''If the government does not control the irresponsible actions of the A.L.P.,'' he said, ''many such clashes can happen in the future.'' At the end of our meeting, he told me that the Tajiks of Andarab were holding their own council, in response to the Pashtun shura. I followed him as he led a small entourage of armed men out of the provincial council building to a massive tent under which several hundred Tajiks sat in plastic chairs and on carpets and cushions, listening to Mustafa Mohsini, Rasoul Khan's older brother. ''The local police have created chaos in the area that nobody can solve,'' Mohsini intoned in a deep, sonorous voice. ''They do whatever they want. They incite ethnic rifts. They are threatening our people and our tribe.''
The following morning, I visited Haq again in Shahabuddin. When I mentioned the gathering of Andarabis in the capital, he nodded in irritation. ''We know about it,'' he said. ''They have invited a few Pashtuns who have collaborated with them in the past. I told them: 'You are not allowed to go there. If you want to go, talk instead to your hat and ask it when you want to die, because I will kill you.' ''
In the end, the Pashtun demonstration was postponed a week, and then indefinitely, to allow a period of mourning for Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former president of Afghanistan whose assassination in Kabul on Sept. 20 made the future of the country that much more uncertain. Five days later, General Rahimi was replaced as provincial chief of police by Asadullah Sherzad, who is also Pashtun. ''It's definitely showing right now that Rasoul Khan is trying to get to him,'' the Special Forces team leader recently told me. When I asked what Sherzad was doing about the investigation into Nur-ul Haq, Faz-ul Haq and Abdur Rahman, he said: ''It seems to have kind of gone away. He just said, 'I trust the Special Forces not to incorporate criminals.' ''
Envisioned as a two- to five-year program, the Afghan Local Police are eventually supposed to be subsumed by the National Security Forces. But if the Interior Ministry does disband the A.L.P. at some future point, what will become of its members? Brig. Gen. Jefforey Smith, until last month the NATO deputy commander for police training in Afghanistan, told me that the A.L.P. will not be required to meet the National Security Forces' recruiting goals. He also said, ''By and large, a lot of them don't want to join the national services and be at risk of having to move away from their villages.'' I asked what happens, then, when the program is terminated and there are suddenly 30,000 armed, trained and organized Afghans scattered throughout the country, unwilling or unable to enlist with the national forces but also no longer employed by the A.L.P. ''That's the $64 million question,'' General Smith said. ''In theory, the improvement of security over time creates opportunity for improved governance and economic development, and with that you have other employment opportunities that don't exist today.''
In Arghandab, when I asked Cmdr. Muhammad Nabi what he would do if the A.L.P. were discontinued, he replied that if at that point the national police and the army were capable of providing adequate protection for his village, ''it is not a problem with us to have the A.L.P. disarmed. We will return to cultivating ladyfingers. We will take out our tractors and start farming.'' Asked the same question in Shahabuddin, Haq said: ''That decision will be made by the elders. If they make the decision to turn in our weapons, we will gladly turn them in to the Afghan government.'' Then he thought for a moment and added: ''But not to the government in Pul-i-Khumri. As long as the government in Pul-i-Khumri remains the way it is now -- an Andarabi organization -- we are going to protect ourselves however we can.''

HEADLINE: The Paradox Of the New Elite

BYLINE: By ALEXANDER STILLE

 BODY:
Alexander Stille is a professor of international journalism at Columbia.
IT'S a puzzle: one dispossessed group after another -- blacks, women, Hispanics and gays -- has been gradually accepted in the United States, granted equal rights and brought into the mainstream.
At the same time, in economic terms, the United States has gone from being a comparatively egalitarian society to one of the most unequal democracies in the world.
The two shifts are each huge and hugely important: one shows a steady march toward democratic inclusion, the other toward a tolerance of economic stratification that would have been unthinkable a generation ago.
The United States prides itself on the belief that ''anyone can be president,'' and what better example than Barack Obama, son of a black Kenyan immigrant and a white American mother -- neither of them rich. 
And yet more than half the presidents over the past 110 years attended Harvard, Yale or Princeton and graduates of Harvard and Yale have had a lock on the White House for the last 23 years, across four presidencies. Thus we have become both more inclusive and more elitist.
It's a surprising contradiction. Is the confluence of these two movements a mere historical accident? Or are the two trends related?
Other nations seem to face the same challenge: either inclusive, or economically just. Europe has maintained much more economic equality but is struggling greatly with inclusiveness and discrimination, and is far less open to minorities than is the United States.
European countries have done a better job of protecting workers' salaries and rights but have been reluctant to extend the benefits of their generous welfare state to new immigrants who look and act differently from them. Could America's lost enthusiasm for income redistribution and progressive taxation be in part a reaction to sharing resources with traditionally excluded groups?
''I do think there is a trade-off between inclusion and equality,'' said Gary Becker, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago and a Nobel laureate. ''I think if you are a German worker you are better off than your American equivalent, but if you are an immigrant, you are better off in the U.S.''
PROFESSOR Becker, a celebrated free-market conservative, wrote his Ph.D. dissertation (and first book, ''The Economics of Discrimination'') to demonstrate that racial discrimination was economically inefficient. American business leaders seem to have learned that there is no money to be made in exclusion: bringing in each new group has simply created new consumers to court. If you can capture nearly three-quarters of the economy's growth -- as the top 1 percent did between 2002 and 2006 -- it may not be worth worrying about gay marriage or skin color.
''I think we have become more meritocratic -- educational attainment has become increasingly predictive of economic success,'' Professor Becker said. But with educational attainment going increasingly to the children of the affluent and educated, we appear to be developing a self-perpetuating elite that reaps a greater and greater share of financial rewards. It is a hard-working elite, and more diverse than the old white male Anglo-Saxon establishment -- but nonetheless claims a larger share of the national income than was the case 50 years ago, when blacks, Jews and women were largely shut out of powerful institutions.
Inequality and inclusion are both as American as apple pie, says Jerome Karabel, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of ''The Chosen,'' about the history of admission to Harvard, Yale and Princeton. ''I don't think any advanced democracy is as obsessed with equality of opportunity or as relatively unconcerned with equality of condition,'' he says. ''As long as everyone has a chance to compete, we shouldn't worry about equality. Equality of condition is seen as undesirable, even un-American.''
The long history of racial discrimination represented an embarrassing contradiction -- and a serious threat -- to our national story of equal opportunity. With Jim Crow laws firmly in place it was hard to seriously argue that everyone had an equal chance. Civil rights leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were able to use this tradition to draw support to their causes. ''Given our culture of equality of opportunity, these kinds of rights-based arguments are almost impossible to refute,'' Professor Karabel said. ''Even in today's conservative political climate, opponents of gay rights are losing ground.''
The removal of traditional barriers opened up the American system. In 1951 blacks made up less than 1 percent of the students at America's Ivy League colleges. Today they make up about 8 percent. At the same time, America's elite universities are increasingly the provinces of the well-to-do. ''Looking at the data, you see that the freshman class of our top colleges are more and more made up of the children of upper- and upper-middle-class families,'' said Thomas J. Espenshade of Princeton, a sociologist.
Even the minority students are more affluent, he noted; many of them are of mixed race, or the children of immigrants or those who benefited from affirmative action.
Shamus Khan, a sociologist at Columbia and the author of ''Privilege,'' a book about St. Paul's, the prep school, agreed that there had been a change in the composition of the elite. ''Who is at elite schools seems to have shifted,'' he said. ''But the elite seem to have a firmer and firmer hold on our nation's wealth and power.''
Still the relatively painless movement toward greater diversity should not be dismissed as mere window dressing.
''After the immigration reform of 1965, this country went from being the United States of Europe to being the United States of the World. All with virtually no violence and comparatively little trauma,'' Professor Karabel said. This is no small thing, particularly when you compare it to the trauma experienced by many European societies in absorbing much lower percentages of foreign-born citizens, few of whom have penetrated their countries' elites.
Moreover, inequality has grown partly for reasons that have little or nothing to do with inclusion. Almost all advanced industrial societies -- even Sweden -- have become more unequal. But the United States has become considerably more unequal. In Europe, the rights of labor have remained more central, while the United States has seen the rise of identity politics.
''There is much less class-based organization in the U.S,'' said Professor Karabel. ''Race, gender and sexual orientation became the salient cleavages of American political life. And if you look at it -- blacks, Hispanics and women have gained somewhat relative to the population as a whole, but labor as a category has lost ground. The groups that mobilized -- blacks, Hispanics, women -- made gains. But white male workers, who demobilized politically, lost ground.''
One of the groups to become mobilized in response to the protest movements of the 1960s and early 1970s was the rich. Think tanks dedicated to defending the free-enterprise system -- such as the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation -- were born in this period. And it is not an accident that the right-wing advocate Glenn Beck held a national rally on the anniversary of King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Republicans now defend tax cuts for the richest 2 percent using arguments and language from the civil rights movements: insisting that excluding the richest earners is unfair.
Removing the most blatant forms of discrimination, ironically, made it easier to justify keeping whatever rewards you could obtain through the new, supposedly more meritocratic system. ''Greater inclusiveness was a precondition for greater economic stratification,'' said Professor Karabel. ''It strengthened the system, reinvigorated its ideology -- it is much easier to defend gains that appear to be earned through merit. In a meritocracy, inequality becomes much more acceptable.''
THE term ''meritocracy'' -- now almost universally used as a term of praise -- was actually coined as a pejorative term, appearing for the first time in 1958, in the title of a satirical dystopian novel, ''The Rise of the Meritocracy,'' by the British Labour Party leader Michael Young. He warned against the creation of a new technocratic elite in which the selection of the few would lead to the abandonment of the many, a new elite whose privileges were even more crushing and fiercely defended because they appeared to be entirely merited.
Of the European countries, Britain's politics of inequality and inclusion most resemble those of the United States. Even as inequality has grown considerably, the British sense of economic class has diminished. As recently as 1988, some 67 percent of British citizens proudly identified themselves as working class. Now only 24 percent do. Almost everybody below the Queen and above the poverty line considers himself or herself ''middle class.''
Germany still has robust protections for its workers and one of the healthiest economies in Europe. Children at age 10 are placed on different tracks, some leading to university and others to vocational school -- a closing off of opportunity that Americans would find intolerable. But it is uncontroversial because those attending vocational school often earn as much as those who attend university.
In France, it is illegal for the government to collect information on people on the basis of race. And yet millions of immigrants -- and the children and grandchildren of immigrants -- fester in slums.
In the United States, the stratification of wealth followed several decades where economic equality was strong. The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed underscored the excesses of the roaring '20s and ushered in an era in which the political climate favored labor unions, progressive taxation and social programs aimed at reducing poverty.
From the 1930s to the 1960s, the income of the less affluent Americans grew more quickly than that of their wealthier neighbors, and the richest 1 percent saw its share of the national income shrink to 8.9 percent in the mid-1970s, from 23.9 percent in 1928. That share is now back up to more than 20 percent, its level before the Depression.
Inequality has traditionally been acceptable to Americans if accompanied by mobility. But most recent studies of economic mobility indicate that it is getting even harder for people to jump from one economic class to another in the United States, harder to join the elite. While Americans are used to considering equal opportunity and equality of condition as separate issues, they may need to reconsider. In an era in which money translates into political power, there is a growing feeling, on both left and right, that special interests have their way in Washington. There is growing anger, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, that the current system is stacked against ordinary citizens. Suddenly, as in the 1930s, the issue of economic equality is back in play.

HEADLINE: Successes Overseas Are Unlikely to Help Obama at Home

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Carl Hulse contributed reporting from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg from Philadelphia.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's announcement that the last American soldiers will leave Iraq by the end of this year capped a momentous week in which he could also take credit for helping dispatch one of the world's great villains, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Conventional wisdom holds that none of this will matter to Mr. Obama's frayed political fortunes, which will be determined by the economy rather than the notches he is piling up on his statesman's belt.
Yet Mr. Obama's withdrawal from Iraq -- a campaign pledge kept -- and the successful NATO air campaign in Libya -- with no American casualties, and at a tiny fraction of the cost of Iraq -- allowed him to thread a political needle: reaffirming his credentials as a wartime leader while reassuring his Democratic base that he is making good on the promises that got him elected.
This one-two punch may also strengthen the president's hand against his eventual Republican opponent, according to Mr. Obama's supporters, by depriving Republicans of a cudgel typically used on Democratic presidents, that they are weak on national security. The swift and fierce criticism of his Iraq decision by the Republican candidates shows how reluctant they are to cede this advantage to him. 
''There is an aggregate effect to all the president's foreign policy successes,'' said Bill Burton, a former White House aide who is a senior strategist at Priorities USA Action, a political action committee backing the Obama campaign. ''The notion of who is a stronger leader will be deeply influenced by the promises the president kept.''
Mr. Burton said he could foresee television advertisements playing up Mr. Obama's foreign successes, including the deaths of both Osama bin Laden and Colonel Qaddafi, though he did not say whether his group had made such plans. On Saturday, Mr. Burton circulated a memo to producers of the Sunday talk shows drawing a contrast between the cost of the Iraq war and the lower-cost Libya operation.
Still, there is little doubt the election will be dominated by the economy and the weak job market, where the president is dealing with a steady drip of bad news and scant hope of improvement before Election Day.
A discussion of foreign policy has been largely absent from the debates among the Republican presidential contenders, a striking fact given that the nation is enmeshed in three major military conflicts and that Republicans have historically claimed an edge in national security.
''Foreign affairs is important, but when placed against the scale of the problem with jobs and the economy, it's dwarfed,'' said David Winston, a Republican strategist. ''It's the equivalent of a house on fire: he's fixing the window while the rest of the house is burning down.''
Karl Rove, a former strategist to President Bush, said, ''To the degree Obama tries to suggest he should be re-elected because of foreign policy strength, he looks like he's dodging the main issue.''
Mr. Obama's poll numbers also show he is getting little credit for his successes. His approval rating shot up 11 points, to 57 percent, in a New York Times/CBS News survey after he ordered the commando raid in Pakistan that killed Bin Laden in May, but fell back below 50 percent a month later as fears about the economy punctured the euphoria.
Last week's successes could fade too -- if sectarian violence in Iraq flares up after the American troops leave, if Libya becomes another Somalia or if a terrorist group manages to stage an attack on American soil.
''If things go off track in the next year or two, it's not going to matter what the military successes were,'' said David Rothkopf, a foreign policy expert who has written a history of the National Security Council.
Even as former Bush administration officials praised Mr. Obama for the victory in Libya, the Republican presidential candidates were trying to draw attention to the failed talks between the United States and Iraq over legal immunity for a small force of trainers that the Pentagon had wanted to remain.
Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Herman Cain all criticized the president's decision, with Mr. Romney issuing the most strident condemnation.
Declaring that Mr. Obama put ''at risk the victories that were won through the blood and sacrifice of thousands of American men and women,'' he said, ''the unavoidable question is whether this decision is the result of naked political calculation or simply sheer ineptitude.''
Mr. Burton said Mr. Romney was on the wrong side of this debate. He derided Mr. Romney's broader foreign policy positions as ''absolutely incoherent'' and said ''that incoherence will be boiled down into some kind of theme as we move on.''
The Republican candidates have espoused a range of foreign policy views, from the retrenchment favored by Representative Ron Paul of Texas to the assertion of American primacy voiced by Mr. Romney.
On Libya, the candidates have seemed off balance from the beginning of the uprising -- a pattern typified by Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. Before NATO intervened, he called for the United States to impose a unilateral no-fly zone.
After the United States and NATO forces acted -- imposing such a zone, among other steps -- Mr. Gingrich said on NBC, ''I would not have intervened. I think there were a lot of other ways to affect Qaddafi.''
Mr. Gingrich insisted that he had not switched his position but rather was responding initially to the president's stated, and in his view, mistaken goal of removing Colonel Qaddafi from power.
The president has stumbled at times, and he has had a rocky relationship with Israel, a fact that could affect his support among American Jews. But that is offset at least in part by his lethal counterterrorism operations -- some of which, like the secret drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda propagandist in Yemen, the president does not even acknowledge publicly.
''Osama, Awlaki, Qaddafi and now Iraq all underscore one thing: When it comes to being commander in chief, there is not a single Republican who can measure up to that,'' said Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's former White House chief of staff who is now the mayor of Chicago. ''It shows the power of the man and the office he occupies.''
The president seemed mindful of that, as well as the promises he made to Democrats while running for office, in his weekly address and a mass e-mail he sent to supporters on Saturday.
''After a decade of war,'' Mr. Obama declared, ''we're turning the page and moving forward with strength and confidence.The drawdown in Iraq allowed us to focus on Afghanistan and achieve major victories against Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. As we remove the last of our troops from Iraq, we're beginning to bring our troops home from Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: Fake Lawyers and Notaries Prey on Immigrants

BYLINE: By JESSICA WEISBERG and BRIDGET O'SHEA.

 BODY:
On May 6, just hours before his asylum hearing, Mario de la Rosa, a Mexican immigrant living in Waukegan, waited in the parking lot of a CVS pharmacy for the person representing him in his case, Margaret Carrasco, to arrive. She never did.
Eventually, Mr. De la Rosa said, he drove to Ms. Carrasco's home, where she handed him a messy stack of forms, all filled out in English and unintelligible to Mr. De la Rosa, who speaks only Spanish. Ms. Carrasco apologized for being too ill to appear in court, he recalled. He believed her. He had no reason not to. 
He said he felt lucky to work with Ms. Carrasco, a bilingual immigrant activist in Waukegan and, he thought, a lawyer. She even allowed clients to pay her $500 fee in installments.
But sick or not, Ms. Carrasco, 51, may have had a more pressing reason to avoid representing Mr. De la Rosa in court: she does not have the proper legal accreditation to do so. On Oct. 14, Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit against Ms. Carrasco, accusing her of misrepresenting herself as an immigration lawyer and charging her clients ''unconscionable fees'' for services she did not even render.
Ms. Carrasco, who could face more than $100,000 in penalties, did not respond to text, telephone, Facebook or e-mail messages seeking comment.
She is one of many people who are thought to profit unduly from immigrants' vulnerable combination of low legal literacy and high-stakes situations. Recent changes in federal immigration policy, coupled with a downturn in the economy, may have created a need for more, and more affordable, legal assistance, according to immigration activists.
President Obama's ''prosecutorial discretion'' initiative, announced in August, created a working group to review the 300,000 deportation cases currently before immigration courts and to suspend or halt proceedings for immigrants who have not been convicted of serious crimes.
Caroline Schoenberger, an immigration lawyer at the Chicago Legal Clinic and the former Chicago commissioner of consumer services, said many people found the new program confusing.
''People keep calling about the 'new law' and about applying for work visas,'' Ms. Schoenberger said. ''They think that deportation has been halted completely.''
More than a million people have been deported since President Obama took office three years ago, compared with 1.57 million people deported during President Bush's eight years in office. New federal programs like Secure Communities, which enables local law enforcement officials to check a person's immigration status, have left many immigrants in need of legal assistance. That is what happened to Mr. De la Rosa, who was pulled over for a traffic violation, then turned over to federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities when he was found to be in the country illegally.
Notaries are particularly well positioned to capitalize on confusion among immigrants, especially those from Latin America -- the largest Chicago immigrant population -- as notaries there have considerably more legal agency than they do in the United States.
Victims have mistakenly assumed that a ''notario'' can represent them legally, advocates say. Notaries have such cachet in this community that some people claim to be notaries public when they are not, to draw clients. Ms. Carrasco is accused in the lawsuit of identifying herself as a ''notario publico'' as well as a lawyer; in fact, though she had a notary license, it expired in July 2010.
There are more and more people in deportation proceedings, said Mony Ruiz-Velasco, a lawyer with the National Immigrant Justice Center who has recently taken on Mr. De la Rosa's case. ''People want to hear good news, and legitimate immigration lawyers can't always give them good news.''
Scams preying on the fears of immigrants are not limited to the Hispanic community. Last month, Ms. Madigan filed suit against Vytautas Lekarauskas, 26, who faces up to $100,000 in penalties. He is accused of running a fraudulent Web site that looked like an official government agency and offered fee-based help with passport, green card and citizenship applications.
Mr. Lekarauskas claimed on his Web site to be a lawyer educated at the University of Chicago. According to the complaint, he never attended the University of Chicago or any other law school. Mr. Lekarauskas could not be reached for comment.
The nature of these small, easily mobile businesses make them difficult to prosecute. ''They set up shop someplace, and then they'll disappear,'' said Fred Tsao, policy director for the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights.
Scams often go undetected because the victims are reluctant to seek help from the authorities. ''They might know where to go, but despite the best outreach and assurances by the authorities, simply might not trust them,'' Mr. Tsao said.
In 2004, Chicago collected $200,000 from Antonio Rodriguez Perez, a local notary who had taken money from clients without providing promised services, and wrote letters to each of his victims explaining how to receive recompense for damages. ''Very few people took advantage of it,'' said Ms. Schoenberger, who oversaw the prosecution of the case. ''People were afraid.''
Ms. Carrasco has been preying on the immigrant community since 2006, according to the attorney general's office.
Mr. De la Rosa, the sole financial provider for a stepson with cerebral palsy who Mr. De la Rosa said could not receive proper medical treatment in Mexico, will have his case retried. ''I'm grateful I have another chance,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stealing The Show

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
She's almost 90 and still living very much in the present, quietly painting every day in her West Side studio. Yet Francoise Gilot -- Picasso's muse and lover and the mother of two of his children -- is about to revisit her past.
In May, John Richardson, Picasso's biographer, together with Valentina Castellani, a director of the Gagosian Gallery, will present an exhibition that chronicles the years when Ms. Gilot and Picasso were together -- from roughly 1943 through 1952 -- living in Vallauris, a small hillside town near Cannes in the south of France. It will be the gallery's fourth Picasso exhibition and will include paintings, sculptures, drawings, pottery and prints.
Ms. Gilot doesn't mind dredging up what must seem like many lifetimes ago. ''When you are old your life has different chapters,'' she said the other day, standing near a colorful abstract painting perched on an easel.
''I was an artist before I ever met Picasso,'' she emphatically explained. Yet those years ''are very much a part of my life.'' 
Like other blockbuster shows that are proliferating among some of today's most prosperous galleries, Mr. Richardson believes the exhibition will be an eye-opener because ''nobody realizes the tremendous importance of Francoise to Picasso during that whole period.''
The show, which will open at Gagosian's newly renovated Madison Avenue gallery, is poised to generate as much excitement as the other Picasso shows that Mr. Richardson has masterminded. (The first, ''Picasso: Mosqueteros,'' in 2009 drew more than 100,000 visitors, a figure more normally associated with a museum exhibition.)
And the show, like all the others, will be a costly undertaking that involves getting loans from museums, publishing a lavish catalog with scholarly essays and bringing in an architect to redesign the gallery. It's a lot of work and expense. Often dealers say nothing is for sale; generally, however, one or two works are available -- at the right price -- making these shows profitable after all.
Larry Gagosian says he believes that either way, the headaches were worth it. ''Now we get offered all kinds of Picassos,'' he said. ''Everything from a print worth $4,000 to, well, the sky's the limit.''
With his network of 11 galleries around the world, Mr. Gagosian is by far the most visible of all the dealers presenting these kinds of crowd-pleasing shows. But other blue-chip galleries including Acquavella and Pace have been presenting them on and off for decades. ''I'll never forget in the early '70s when we had a Matisse show,'' William Acquavella recalled. ''We had people waiting on line in the pouring rain.''
His gallery, just two blocks north of Gagosian's Madison Avenue headquarters, is attracting crowds right now with ''Georges Braque: Pioneer of Modernism,'' which opened on Oct. 12. The show, which was organized by Dieter Buchhart, an Austrian curator, includes 42 paintings, many on loan from museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Tate in London. ''It's good advertising,'' Mr. Acquavella said. ''Braque is an amazing artist and hasn't really gotten his due.''
This fall, with the exception of the giant de Kooning retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art -- an exhibition that was six years in the making -- and ''Picasso's Drawings, 1890-1921: Reinventing Tradition,'' at the Frick Collection, there are few museum exhibitions generating the same kind of excitement. Museums made their 2011-12 schedules in 2008, when the economy turned bleak and many were pulling back, which explains the proliferation of the permanent collection shows.
The prosperous, blue-chip galleries have the financial muscle to fill that void, often asking art historians and curators to help organize shows for them and write essays for the catalogs. But it is not only content that attracts visitors. The gallery shows are free and museums are not. (An adult who is not a member but wants to visit the Museum of Modern Art, for instance, has to pay $25 admission.)
''Galleries have more flexibility and can work on far shorter deadlines,'' said John Wilmerding, an American art scholar and art history professor at Princeton, who is organizing two coming shows for the Acquavella Galleries. ''Museums are laden down with timetables and bureaucracy. And a lot of dealers have the resources to put together serious shows. They're willing to do all the things you have to do -- line up the loans, pay the insurance, get reproduction rights, publish scholarly catalogs. It's all very time-consuming.''
Mr. Wilmerding, who sits on the boards of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and the National Gallery of Art, among others, has also noticed a sea change in museums' attitudes toward lending works from their collections to galleries. ''It used to be that the National Gallery wouldn't lend to dealers shows, but now that's loosened up considerably,'' Mr. Wilmerding said.
It was 20 years ago, when he first joined the Guggenheim board, that loan requests started coming from dealers, he recalled. ''Now, not a meeting goes by when there's not a request.'' And the requests are taken more seriously as these gallery exhibitions have become more and more scholarly. In addition, most of the big dealers are generous supporters of the major museums and have private collections with works they gladly lend when asked.
Sometimes a show turns into an accidental blockbuster. At the Paula Cooper Gallery in Chelsea last winter, as word spread of Christian Marclay's ''The Clock,'' a 24-hour montage of clips from movies and television that depict particular minutes in the day, synchronized with the moment they are shown, the audience kept building. Visitors of all ages found themselves glued to the video, not just because of its intrinsic charm but because it kept viewers on their toes as they tried to identify where the clips were from.
''We had no idea it would be so popular,'' said Steven P. Henry, director of the gallery. ''It became its own kind of happening. We had people waiting on line three or four hours in the bitter cold.''
''The first couple of weeks attendance was normal, a couple of hundred people a day, perhaps 300 on a Saturday,'' he recalled. But as word spread, that figure doubled and finally tripled. ''We had to let people stay as long as they wanted,'' he said. On weekends the gallery was kept open for 24 hours.
''People stayed for multiple hours,'' Mr. Henry said. ''I don't know of anyone who saw the whole thing.''
The video was a big hit this summer at the Venice Biennale, where Mr. Marclay won the prize for best artist. Not surprising then that it has been sold to several museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art. (The asking price was $550,000.)
''People started bonding as they waited on line,'' Mr. Henry said. His gallery knows of three ''Missed Connections'' postings on Craigslist. In one, a woman wrote: ''We made eye contact in the two-hour line outside the Paula Cooper Gallery today. You wore a black Tribeca bag and had bike clips on your jeans. I meant to say hello, but found myself too shy. ... ''
''It was a real New York moment,'' Mr. Henry said.
The attention-getting, high-impact exhibitions on gallery schedules continue unabated. Expensive to produce and labor-intensive, they are generally organized by galleries with an international network of contacts, deep pockets and multiple spaces.
At the Pace Gallery, its chairman, Arne Glimcher, said: ''We've always done these sorts of exhibitions. When we had a Bonnard/Rothko show in 1997, on the last day we had a line down to Park Avenue and had to stay open later.'' It is the scholarship that Mr. Glimcher said he enjoyed the most. And the public seems to respond. Among the earliest blockbusters that Pace presented was ''Piet Mondrian: The Process Works,'' in 1970. Over the years the gallery has organized shows pairing artists like Barnett Newman and Rothko, Dubuffet and de Kooning. Standouts included ''The Women of Giacometti,'' in 2005 and ''Picasso, Braque and Early Film in Cubism,'' in 2007.
On Friday, the gallery opened ''Calder 1941,'' at its 57th Street gallery. The show explores an important year in Calder's career when the sculptor was beginning to make ever-more-sophisticated mobiles and stabiles. Fifteen examples of these works are on view, many of which have not been publicly exhibited for decades.
In February, Pace will also present a retrospective of the famous Happenings, those fleeting performances, primarily from the 1950s and '60s, that are considered classics of the genre today. The exhibition will include work by the main participants, including Jim Dine, Simone Forti, Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman, Red Grooms, Carolee Schneemann and Lucas Samaras.
With its large staff and multiple outlets around the world, Gagosian organizes more shows than any other gallery. In the months leading up to the Picasso/Francoise Gilot exhibition opening in May, there are several other big shows in the works. Among them is ''The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg,'' opening Nov. 3 on Madison Avenue, which will give visitors an inside peek at the art that Rauschenberg lived with, both in Manhattan and at his home and studio on Captiva Island in Florida. There will be examples of work by some of his old friends, including John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Jasper Johns and Cy Twombly as well as others he collected over the decades by Magritte, Robert Mapplethorpe and Brice Marden.
In January, in every Gagosian Gallery around the world, Damien Hirst will be showing ''The Complete Spot Paintings 1986-2011.'' On view will be a total of about 300 works, many on loan from major museums around the world.
And in April, Gagosian's 24th Street gallery will be devoted to the work of Lucio Fontana, an artist who has long been popular in Europe but has only recently been gathering a fan base of collectors in the United States. Organized by the curator Germano Celant, in collaboration with the Fondazione Lucio Fontana in Milan and Ms. Castellani from Gagosian, the show is called ''Lucio Fontana: Environmental Spaces,'' and will include a group of installations never shown in the United States before -- a group of room-size environments, along with drawings, sketches and paintings made at the same time. In one environment there is a giant amoeba shape suspended in a darkened room illuminated by neon light. These works have an ephemeral quality to them, but were reconstructed for this exhibition using documents provided by the foundation that include the artist's drawings, photographs and other archival material.
The Acquavella Galleries have just signed on to represent the California artist Wayne Thiebaud, who turns 91 next month, in the United States. A year from now it will present a show of his work organized by Mr. Wilmerding, the art historian and Princeton professor. It will be a kind of retrospective of the painter's work, with examples from his entire career that Mr. Thiebaud has kept in his studio.
Mr. Wilmerding is also working on an exhibition about the still-life tradition in Pop Art, scheduled for the spring of 2013. ''The still life has often been the stepchild to landscape, history and figurative painting,'' he said. By examining themes like food and drink, household objects, flowers, trees and body parts, he explained, he hopes to ''slice and dice Pop in a different way.''

HEADLINE: Will Dropouts Save America?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ELLSBERG

 BODY:
Michael Ellsberg is the author of ''The Education of Millionaires: It's Not What You Think and It's Not Too Late.''
I TYPED these words on a computer designed by Apple, co-founded by the college dropout Steve Jobs. The program I used to write it was created by Microsoft, started by the college dropouts Bill Gates and Paul Allen.
And as soon as it is published, I will share it with my friends via Twitter, co-founded by the college dropouts Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams and Biz Stone, and Facebook -- invented, among others, by the college dropouts Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin Moskovitz, and nurtured by the degreeless Sean Parker.
American academia is good at producing writers, literary critics and historians. It is also good at producing professionals with degrees. But we don't have a shortage of lawyers and professors. America has a shortage of job creators. And the people who create jobs aren't traditional professionals, but start-up entrepreneurs. 
In a recent speech promoting a jobs bill, President Obama told Congress, ''Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin.''
Close, but not quite. In a detailed analysis, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that nearly all net job creation in America comes from start-up businesses, not small businesses per se. (Since most start-ups start small, we tend to conflate two variables -- the size of a business and its age -- and incorrectly assume the former was the relevant one, when in fact the latter is.
If start-up activity is the true engine of job creation in America, one thing is clear: our current educational system is acting as the brakes. Simply put, from kindergarten through undergraduate and grad school, you learn very few skills or attitudes that would ever help you start a business. Skills like sales, networking, creativity and comfort with failure.
No business in America -- and therefore no job creation -- happens without someone buying something. But most students learn nothing about sales in college; they are more likely to take a course on why sales (and capitalism) are evil.
Moreover, very few start-ups get off the ground without a wide, vibrant network of advisers and mentors, potential customers and clients, quality vendors and valuable talent to employ. You don't learn how to network crouched over a desk studying for multiple-choice exams. You learn it outside the classroom, talking to fellow human beings face-to-face.
Start-ups are a creative endeavor by definition. Yet our current classrooms, geared toward tests on narrowly defined academic subjects, stifle creativity. If a young person happens to retain enough creative spirit to start a business upon graduation, she does so in spite of her schooling, not because of it.
Finally, entrepreneurs must embrace failure. I spent the last two years interviewing college dropouts who went on to become millionaires and billionaires. All spoke passionately about the importance of their business failures in leading them to success. Our education system encourages students to play it safe and retreat at the first sign of failure (assuming that any failure will look bad on their college applications and resumes).
Certainly, if you want to become a doctor, lawyer or engineer, then you must go to college. But, beyond regulated fields like these, the focus on higher education as the only path to stable employment is profoundly misguided, exacerbated by parents who see the classic professions as the best route to job security.
That may have been true 50 years ago, but not now. In our chaotic, unpredictable economy, even young people who have no interest in starting a business, and who want to become professionals, still need to learn the entrepreneurial skills that will allow them to get ahead.
True, people with college degrees tend to earn more. But that could be because most ambitious people tend to go to college; there is little evidence to suggest that the same ambitious people would earn less without college degrees (particularly if they mastered true business and networking grit).
And while most people who end up starting businesses likely have college degrees, those degree-bearers should be well aware (as they learned in their freshman statistics classes) that correlation does not equal causation. Assuming that college was responsible for their success gives higher education more credit than it deserves.
AFTER all, there is not one job market in America, but two. The formal market we always hear about -- jobs that get filled through cold resume submissions in reply to posted ads -- accounts for only about 20 percent of jobs.
The other 80 percent get filled in the informal job market. Any employer knows how the informal job market works: you need a position filled, so you ask your friends, colleagues and current employees if they know anyone who would do a good job.
In this informal job market, the academic requirements listed in job ads tend to be highly negotiable, and far less important than real-world results and the enthusiasm of the personal referral.
Classroom skills may put you at an advantage in the formal market, but in the informal market, street-smart skills and real-world networking are infinitely more important.
Yet our children grow up amid an echo chamber of voices telling them to get good grades, do well on their SATs, and spend an average of $45,000 on tuition -- after accounting for scholarships -- while taking on $23,000 in debt to get a private four-year college education.
It's time that we as a nation accepted a basic -- and seldom-mentioned -- fact. You don't need a degree (and certainly not an M.B.A.) to start a business and create jobs, nor is it even that helpful, compared with cheaper, faster alternatives.
Parents could turn the system on its head if they weren't so caught up in outmoded mentalities about education forged in the stable economy of the 1950s (but profoundly misguided in today's chaotic, entrepreneurial economy).
Employers could alter this landscape if they explicitly offered routes to employment for those who didn't get a degree because they were out building businesses.
And the government could divert some of the money it now spends encouraging college for all, and instead promote the idea that creating a start-up is a worthy, respectable alternative to academics. This would go a long way to helping our unemployment problem.
If I were betting on the engines of future job creation, I wouldn't put my money on college students cramming for tests and writing papers with properly formatted M.L.A.-style citations in order to bolster their resumes for careers in traditional professions and middle-management jobs in large corporate and government bureaucracies.
I'd put my money on the kids who are dropping out of college to start new businesses. If we want to get out of the jobs mess we're in, we should hope that more will follow in their footsteps.

HEADLINE: Nevada G.O.P. Delays Caucus After Protests

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
The Nevada Republican Party decided on Saturday to push back the date of its presidential caucuses to Feb. 4, a move that brings a sense of order to an otherwise chaotic primary calendar and keeps New Hampshire from scheduling its voting before the New Year. 
The Republican National Committee had implored Nevada to reconsider its decision to hold the caucuses on Jan. 14, and the Nevada Republican central committee agreed on Saturday.
''We just basically want to be the adults in the room here,'' said Amy Tarkanian, the Nevada Republican chairwoman. ''This is not a matter of New Hampshire being a bully or telling us what to do.''
The decision represented a victory for the New Hampshire secretary of state, William M. Gardner, who had threatened to schedule his state's primary in December. He is now expected to set the primary for Jan. 10, one week after the Iowa caucuses that are scheduled to kick off the Republican nominating contest on Jan. 3.
''The voters and our candidates are well served by a nomination process that starts in 2012, and today's action is a major step toward that goal,'' Matt Strawn, chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa, said Saturday.
Nevada's initial plan to hold its caucuses on January came, in part, at the request of the Mitt Romney campaign. But the decision touched off a wave of controversy, including pledges by most of the Republican candidates to boycott the Nevada caucuses.
The Republican National Committee had intended the first ballots in the presidential campaign to be cast in February, but several states accelerated the dates of their contests. The early phase of the Republican primary calendar also includes South Carolina, which is set to vote on Jan. 21, followed by Florida on Jan. 28.
Mr. Romney, who won the Nevada caucuses four years ago, had worked behind the scenes to try to nudge Nevada Republican officials to move up the date in hopes of creating a friendly spot on the calendar.
''It was just friendly encouragement to accelerate,'' said Robert List, a former Nevada governor and member of the Republican National Committee. ''It's my understanding that they were feeling that if he were to do well in Nevada and New Hampshire that there could be sort of an escalating effect as he moved toward South Carolina and Florida. It could give them some momentum and could be helpful.''
But the effort backfired and touched off a storm in New Hampshire. That state's largest newspaper, The Union-Leader, called on Mr. Romney to boycott the Nevada caucuses and uphold the tradition of the New Hampshire primary.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee who helped broker the change, said Saturday that Nevada would have its full slate of delegates restored because its contest now falls under rules of the party's primary calendar.
''With this decision Nevada will receive the attention it deserves,'' Mr. Priebus said. ''And the national spotlight will focus clearly on the devastating effects that President Obama's economic policies have had on the Silver State.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Spending, Taxes and the Infrastructure

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Making the Most of Our Financial Winter'' (Economic View, Oct. 16), in which Robert J. Shiller advocates increased spending on infrastructure to provide jobs -- with all of it made possible by taxes: 
Have we not learned from the failed stimulus that both the Bush and Obama administrations have tried? And do we really think the wealthy who will be the target of the taxes won't find ways around them? And won't the higher taxes give them less incentive to engage in the economic activity that will generate the required revenues?
Let's also not forget about the alternative minimum tax, another levy intended to force the rich to pay more taxes. This tax now afflicts many middle-class taxpayers and has required frequent fixes by Congress so it doesn't impact even more.
Why trust our government, which is responsible for such fiscal travesties as the ''Big Dig'' and the ''bridge to nowhere,'' to wisely and efficiently spend the additional taxes that would be extracted by the jobs proposal? The main beneficiaries won't be the American people, but a favored few unions and politically connected corporations.
David Kelson
Scarsdale, N.Y., Oct. 17
To the Editor:
To Robert J. Shiller's case for infrastructure spending now, I would add the following:
As an architect with 40 years of experience, I know that the best time for infrastructure work is when the economy is weak, because labor and material costs, contractor profit margins and financing costs are lowest then.
Delaying necessary maintenance and repairs can increase their costs exponentially, and excessive delays can turn manageable repair work into a costly replacement project.
Timely infrastructure spending provides a powerful damper on inflation. Unfortunately, the common response to a severe economic downturn is to defer capital projects and maintenance, resulting in a construction bust. That creates pent-up demand, leading to a construction boom as economic times improve. And that, in turn, drives inflation with higher construction and borrowing costs.
We have ample evidence that many crucially important projects are now long overdue. Democrats and Republicans may disagree on many issues, but providing funds now for essential infrastructure projects shouldn't be one of them. Joseph C. Rizzo
Spring Lake, N.J., Oct. 19
To the Editor:
In arguing for President Obama's jobs proposal, Robert J. Shiller says it would be comparable to farmers using their winter downtime to work on their farms' infrastructure -- repairing buildings and equipment, for example, in preparation for future crops.
While time is an asset that is completely lost if not used, those who use their time to work need food, tools, etc. The food may come from seeds to be planted in the spring (savings) and the work may not be very productive if the repairs are temporary or poorly done (typical of government projects).
So here is the important question: Shall we deplete our seed stock (savings) to produce something of questionable value, especially when the seed is crucial to our future survival? While we can ''print money,'' we cannot as easily replace seeds that have been consumed to ''look busy.''

HEADLINE: Right, Less Might

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
Sam Tanenhaus is the editor of The New York Times Book Review.
THE Republican debate Tuesday night included many heated exchanges, but relatively few on the subject of foreign policy. There was instead surprising unanimity, whether it was Mitt Romney and Rick Perry debunking foreign aid, Ron Paul warning that America has become an empire, or Michele Bachmann, in what now seems an ill-timed critique, objecting to President Obama's having ''put us in Libya.''
Collectively, the candidates were channeling a broad shift in thinking on the right about America's global responsibilities. It has been only a few years since George W. Bush labeled himself a ''war president'' leading a crusade for worldwide democratization. And the sentiments were not his alone. In December 2004 a majority of conservative Republicans agreed ''it is best for the future of our country to be active in world affairs,'' according to the Pew Research Center.
In 2011, a roughly equivalent majority believe America ''should pay less attention to problems overseas and concentrate on problems at home.'' 
In a time of severe economic woe -- a ''national emergency,'' as Mr. Obama termed it in mid-September -- foreign policy issues often lose their immediacy. But with the exception of impassioned support for Israel, conservatives have been embracing a retreat from the greater world that recalls the isolationism of a bygone age in which belief in American ''exceptionalism'' combined with distrust of other countries and ''entangling alliances,'' even with other democracies. The most conspicuous example is the strong anti-interventionist sentiment in the period leading up to World War II, when conservatives flocked to rallies organized by the America First Committee, with its slogan ''England will fight to the last American.'' This carried over into the first years of the cold war, when conservatives opposed both the Marshall Plan and NATO and exhibited what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. described in 1952 as ''a petulant desire to seal off America from the winds of change.''
That same year, as it happened, the Republicans, after a bitterly fought primary season, rejected the isolationist Robert A. Taft and nominated Dwight D. Eisenhower, an internationalist who established a pattern of engagement repeated by the Republican presidents who followed, from Richard M. Nixon through Ronald Reagan and the two Bushes. And as recently as 2008, Republicans criticized Mr. Obama for his inexperience in foreign policy, in contrast with their nominee, the war hero John McCain.
Of course that was before Mr. Obama's election and the rise of the Tea Party movement. Its ascendancy is ''proof positive of the rise of isolationism on the right,'' Lawrence F. Kaplan, a columnist for The New Republic and co-author, with William Kristol, of ''The War Over Iraq: Saddam's Tyranny and America's Mission,'' wrote in an e-mail. ''It's no coincidence that the Tea Party has adopted the Don't Tread on Me flag as its own,'' Mr. Kaplan added. ''My bet is they have the federal government, not far-away Islamists, in mind.''
Even as the Republican presidential contenders have tapped into isolationist anxieties, they have sat for foreign-policy tutorials with holdovers from Mr. Bush's presidency, many of them standard-bearers of the aggressive interventionism that Tea Partiers reject.
Mr. Romney's team includes the authors Eliot A. Cohen and Robert Kagan, both identified with the Iraq war. Mr. Perry has met with Donald H. Rumsfeld. Herman Cain has professed his admiration for the writings of John R. Bolton, a hawkish figure in the administrations of both Bushes.
A result is that many of the candidates occupy an awkward position, caught between ''isolationist'' and ''missionary'' views, as one Republican foreign policy sage, Henry A. Kissinger, characterized them in a recent interview. One example of the contradiction may be the candidates' relative silence on the good news from Libya and their attacks Friday on Mr. Obama's plan to withdraw American troops from Iraq.
This makes it difficult for the candidates to find a consistent voice, as has been apparent in televised debates aimed at the base. ''I'm a hawk, but I'm a cheap hawk,'' Newt Gingrich said on Tuesday, evidently aiming to assure both camps without explaining just what he meant.
Others have elaborated on their thinking in more formal venues, as Mr. Romney did in his address to cadets at the Citadel two weeks ago. Reversing his previous skepticism toward Mr. Obama's growing portfolio of foreign commitments, Mr. Romney now implied he would outdo him by advocating a more muscular foreign policy. This would be the cornerstone of a ''new American century,'' Mr. Romney said, reviving a phrase popularized by the magazine publisher Henry R. Luce in 1941.
The allusion was odd, perhaps. But Luce may provide a plausible model. A moderate East Coast Republican, rather like Mr. Romney, he deplored his party's isolationist wing, and championed the presidential nomination of the interventionist Wendell L. Willkie in 1940.
For Luce, Willkie ''was a bulwark against a dangerous Right, which in the absence of credible leadership might so obstruct support for the Allies that the great crusade for democracy could be lost,'' Alan Brinkley notes in ''The Publisher,'' his recent biography of Luce. Might Mr. Romney be reviving this approach? ''Assuming Romney sticks to his American Century stance,'' Mr. Brinkley recently wrote in an e-mail, ''he seems to sound a lot like Luce -- taking a strong stance on America in the world while at the same time carefully staying away from the far right.''
And yet the parallel struck some as strained -- ''off target,'' the Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis, the author of a new biography of the cold-war strategist George F. Kennan, said in an interview. Luce issued his call to arms more than a year into World War II, with America still on the sidelines. ''The context then was a great galloping national security crisis,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''We had that sense of crisis after 9/11. I don't see anything comparable to that at the moment.''
If Americans do see a global challenge today, it is the one coming from rising economic powerhouses like China and India. In fact Mr. Romney has mentioned China, but in military terms borrowed from cold-war debates when each in a succession of American presidents was referred to as ''the leader of the free world,'' an expression that has disappeared from common usage.
''The 21st century is not likely to be the American century,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''It's likely to be something else in which America is not dominant.'' He does see a historical parallel, but not the one Mr. Romney drew. ''The problem of the economists not knowing what is going on and not able to give politicians answers echoes the '30s,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''There are foreign policy implications. It means you have to cut what you expect to do.''
And this, in turn, can foster isolationist sentiments no matter who the president is. Mr. Gaddis cites the most improbable case of all, Franklin D. Roosevelt. When he took office, in 1933, an American delegation had already been scheduled by his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, to participate in an international conference, held in London, meant to tackle the Great Depression. Convinced America needed to go it alone, Roosevelt sent an adviser to the conference with orders ''to torpedo it,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''In that context Roosevelt was profoundly isolationist, more than Hoover,'' who is otherwise remembered as one of the most strident isolationists of his day.
Over time Roosevelt's thinking evolved, and he ushered in a new era of American internationalism built on strong alliances. And a Republican president will most likely respect this inheritance -- so at least Mr. Kissinger believes. ''They will go through a neocon and semi-isolationist phase in some of the campaign rhetoric,'' he said, ''but they will end up in practice with something close to the realistic position.''
This position assumes that America, which remains, after all, the world's one superpower, has no choice but to assert its leadership in a complex world -- as, perhaps, Mr. Obama demonstrated in his Libya policy. He followed a middle course criticized by neoconservatives, who found it too timid, and by isolationists, who warned against ''mission creep.'' But it seems to have been vindicated last week with the death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Do the current Republican contenders realize that foreign policy requires subtle calibrations of this kind? Possibly, but don't expect much evidence of it during this primary season.

HEADLINE: Abortion Takes Center Stage at Iowa G.O.P. Forum

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Gov. Rick Perry of Texas sought to win over social conservative voters in Iowa on Saturday night as he drew a distinction between his opposition to abortion with the views of his leading Republican rivals and declared, ''Being pro-life is not a matter of campaign convenience; it is a core conviction.''
At a forum for Republican presidential hopefuls, Mr. Perry urged party activists to study the abortion positions of his opponents. He offered veiled criticism of Herman Cain, who told an interviewer last week that he was against abortion, but that the decision to have the procedure was a personal one. 
''It is a liberal canard to say I am personally pro-life, but government should stay out of that decision,'' Mr. Perry said, drawing enthusiastic applause from a crowd of social conservative voters. ''If that is your view, you are not pro-life, you are pro-having your cake and eating it too.''
With the Iowa caucuses about 10 weeks away, six Republican presidential candidates appeared before about 1,000 activists at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner. They delivered speeches and took questions about the economy, energy policy, abortion and marriage.
Mr. Cain, a former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza, made only a passing reference to abortion during his remarks. He sought to clarify his views, saying ''no abortions, no exceptions,'' but did not directly address a television interview last week that raised alarm among some social conservative voters and anti-abortion activists.
''I would strengthen all of our current laws that prevent abortion,'' Mr. Cain said Saturday night. ''I believe that abortion should be clearly stated and illegal across this country.''
Mr. Cain, who has become a leading Republican presidential contender in several national and state polls, stirred controversy last week when he told an interviewer on CNN that he opposed abortion but did not believe that it was his role to impose his views on others. His comments drew a sharp rebuke from several of his rivals.
The Republican audience greeted Mr. Cain warmly, but several voters said they wanted to hear him explain his views on abortion in greater detail. As other candidates worked the crowd, Mr. Cain stayed in his campaign bus until it was his time to take the stage. He left the room shortly after he finished speaking.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, whose candidacy has been overshadowed by the recent enthusiasm surrounding Mr. Cain, implored voters to carefully consider the records of the Republican candidates. She said that political figures and government had a duty to prevent abortion.
''This is the year when social conservatives can have it all,'' Mrs. Bachmann said. ''This is our year where we don't compromise. This is our year when we don't settle.''
Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Representative Ron Paul of Texas also addressed the crowd, which gathered on the grounds of the Iowa State Fair.
Mr. Santorum did not mention his Republican rivals by name, but asked the crowd to consider: ''Can they be trusted? Did they stand up and fight the tough battles?'' He reminded the audience about his support for a ban on partial-birth abortions.
The Iowa caucuses, which open the Republican presidential nominating contest on Jan. 3, are often heavily attended by social conservatives.
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who campaigned in Iowa last week, did not attend. He finished second in Iowa four years ago, with former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas winning the caucuses, largely because of his support from social conservative voters.

HEADLINE: A Golden Touch Without the Glitter

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
SHE'S not the Ronson who dated Lindsay Lohan. That's her fedora-wearing fraternal twin, Samantha, a celebrity D.J. and singer. She's not the Ronson who in 2008 won three Grammys, including one for producer of the year for working with Amy Winehouse. That's her brother Mark, the recently married record producer.
Rather, the shy woman with enviable rocker-messy hair who was sitting, largely unnoticed, in the NoHo restaurant the Smile on a recent sunny Friday morning is Charlotte Ronson, the clothing designer, who in the last few years has quietly and somewhat surprisingly evolved into one of the most successful retail entrepreneurs of her generation.
Ms. Ronson, who began designing feminine grunge-inspired looks under the label C. Ronson in 2000 and who has shown at New York Fashion Week since 2006, has also scored deals with the cheap-chic chains Urban Outfitters and Uniqlo. Since 2009, she's had a diffusion line, I Heart Ronson in J. C. Penney's 600 stores, and last month her beauty collection arrived at Sephora, the makeup emporium's first-ever collaboration with a fashion designer on a full-scale beauty line. 
Ms. Ronson, who was born in London and raised in the more privileged downtown corridors of Manhattan by her mother, Ann Dexter-Jones, and a stepfather, Mick Jones, of the rock band Foreigner, has an aesthetic of studied nonchalance (her Sephora collection includes a hair spray called A Perfect Mess, intended to help achieve beachy, tousled locks) and a demeanor to match.
Sitting at the Smile, which is near her apartment, she resembled a cat perched on a ledge, waiting, watching, wary -- and not smiling very much. Dressed in floral shorts and army-green canvas espadrilles of her own design, along with a 3.1 Phillip Lim gray, long-sleeve T-shirt, Ms. Ronson answered questions succinctly. She was hands-on with the Sephora collection, she said, making sure her lip gloss, flavored with lemon and mint, was ''not sticky''; that the hair spray didn't leave hair ''crunchy''; and that her eyeshadows didn't ''crease.''
Lest you cynically suspect mere famous-name rubber-stamping: ''We had over 30 rounds of design, an unusually high number,'' Nancy Rappaport, the director of product development at Sephora, wrote in an e-mail later. ''It was Charlotte who brought all of the elements together (the muse, the sketch image, the fabric inspiration, the textures).''
In a crowded market, Ms. Ronson, 34, has pulled off the rare feat of retaining indie cred -- her Charlotte Ronson line is sold at boutiques like Blue & Cream in Manhattan and East Hampton, and online at shopbop.com -- while also going truly mass. ''She is on a roll,'' said Robert Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys, a New York research company that monitors consumer perception of brands. ''I don't think it's happenstance. I think it's a well-thought-out strategy in terms of expanding the brand. There are plenty of companies out there looking for just that, an association with someone like Ronson.''
Now that work has kicked up a notch and her twin, Samantha, lives in Los Angeles, they keep in touch by calling, e-mailing and texting frequently. ''I just hire her for things so I can hang out with her,'' said Charlotte jokingly, while eating cheese fries and a salad at the Coffee Shop in Union Square on another day. Asked if she was in a relationship, she replied, ''Nothing serious.'' (She had a brief consultation with her publicist, sitting next to her, and elaborated: ''It's always mine to have as my own -- not that anyone cares.'' Laughter.)
In a phone interview, Samantha Ronson said that Charlotte was born with a reserved nature. ''She can be, I guess, standoffish,'' she said. ''She's just careful -- waits and watches to see if someone is good or not. I'm like 'Hey, let's be best friends.' ''
The more sedate twin has proved just enough Ronson for J. C. Penney, which has already renewed its original deal with her twice. I Heart Ronson's kittenish print dresses and back-studded leggings have helped raise the company's profile among 18-to-30-year-olds, who otherwise think of it as ''my grandmother's and mother's store,'' said Elizabeth Sweney, its senior general merchandise manager. ''She has an eye for mixing fabrics, that when combined, create a very special and individualistic item with a personality of its own,'' Ms. Sweney added in an e-mail. ''Charlotte also has an eye for taking a vintage print and making it new and relevant.'' Many of her work-to-play dresses for $50 come with a belt, so as Ms. Ronson put it, it's a ''complete ensemble,'' one priced to be recession-friendly.
However legitimate her design bona fides, though (Ms. Ronson graduated from New York University in 1999 with a bachelor's degree in studio art), the fact that she and her siblings give parties that attract fellow celebrity offspring like Nicole Richie (father: Lionel) and Rashida Jones (Quincy Jones and Peggy Lipton), and the attendant paparazzi, is also doubtless part of her appeal to retailers. Ms. Ronson's runway shows are family affairs, with Samantha as D.J.; their angelic-looking half sister Annabelle Dexter-Jones walking (Ms. Dexter-Jones, 24, is also the face of her campaigns); and their mother, a socialite and jewelry designer, often in the front row.
''We appreciate that she has a network of famous friends,'' Ms. Sweney said, adding that the debut party for the I Heart Ronson line at the Chateau Marmont had a stocked closet from which guests like Paris Hilton and Mischa Barton could take freebies.
Ms. Ronson told me, ''I just think it's nice to be known for what you do, not who you know or who you're related to.''
--
LIKE most fashion powerhouses, Ms. Ronson has an effective business partner: Aaron Nir, 46, who first noticed her as president of Sanei International, a large apparel company in Japan. He suspected she would catch on with the teenage-to-20s market there.
In 2005, when Mr. Nir started managing Ms. Ronson's American operations, one of the first orders of business was to change the brand C. Ronson -- known for customized tank tops, vintage T-shirts and rompers -- to the more grown-up Charlotte Ronson, with embroidery, more sophisticated fabrics and more trims.
Back then, Ms. Ronson had also pushed a cutesy underwear line called Tooshies and worked with Damon Dash, a founder of Roc-a-Fella Records and Rocawear. That collaboration ended in C. Ronson Inc. suing ROC Apparel Group LLC, maker of Rocawear, for money owed. They settled for $325,000.
''This was a business matter, never personal,'' Ms. Ronson said of the lawsuit in an e-mail. ''It has been resolved and I'm glad it's behind me.'' (Attempts to reach Mr. Dash were unsuccessful.) By contrast, Mr. Nir is a bespectacled figure in a blazer who stands out among the P.Y.T.'s at Ronson parties. ''People must be looking at me and thinking, who is the old dude with no hair,'' he said.
In 2009, Mr. Nir became a full partner in the company. ''It was the interest I saw from potential partners that validated my interest,'' he said. ''When Urban Outfitters said we want to do a special one-off brand called Play by C. Ronson, that was a very large-scale commitment.'' (A $2.3 million payout at wholesale, he said.) ''It sort of raised my eyebrows.''
These days, he dreams of turning Charlotte Ronson into a global lifestyle brand. He hinted at an imminent handbag deal, and envisions eyewear, housewares, bedding, jewelry and more shoes. ''We're constantly approached by companies,'' Mr. Nir said.
Uniqlo sought out Ms. Ronson, whose day-to-night looks aren't uncomfortably glamorous, to create six pieces of knitwear. ''Especially Japanese girls, they understand and also like her taste and very sophisticated, feminine fitting,'' said Yukihiro Katsuta, the research and design group officer of Uniqlo. ''Don't get me wrong, it's not girly-girly. It's not too young. It's sophisticated, tasteful and very feminine. That's why we could sell out in New York, too.''
Gene Krell, the creative fashion director of Conde Nast's Asian and Pacific editions, said that Ms. Ronson's looks have appealed to young and middle-aged women there in part because ''the Japanese still have a preoccupation with kawaii,'' or cuteness. Despite her success there, he said, referring to Vogue Japan, ''in my office, she's rarely the topic of conversation.'' (Stateside, her designs are more a staple of Teen Vogue than Vogue).
But the perennially youthful-looking Ms. Ronson, long a mainstay of Manhattan party pages, is still very much a draw on the New York scene. She's had a ''Gossip Girl'' cameo, and is pals with Becka Diamond, a dark-rooted blond-haired D.J., and Sky Ferreira, a grungy saucer-eyed model and singer of catchy tunes like ''Sex Rules.''
Both women came to a late-summer dinner in honor of Ms. Ronson's Sephora beauty collection on the rooftop of Hotel Chantelle, a restaurant on the Lower East Side. As guests nibbled on small portions of roast chicken and organic-vodka-infused cupcakes, a video introducing Charlotte Ronson Beauty played above their heads. At one point in the video, Ms. Ronson has her arm up, posing, her sunlit golden-brown hair falling seductively in her eyes. Catching a glimpse of that pose, Ms. Ronson grimaced and mouthed, ''Awkward.''
--
IN early September, days before her runway show at New York Fashion Week, Ms. Ronson did a hair and makeup test to get the look just right. ''It feels too red,'' she said, referring to a lip hue. Next, the designer and Natasha Royt, a stylist, asked Gilbert Soliz, a makeup artist for Sephora, to try a poppy-colored lip with the choker necklaces they were using. After a belt was fastened around the model Katrina Hoernig's neck, Mr. Soliz applied eyeliner under her upper lashes for a less done-up look -- classic understated Ronson -- then worked on her mouth.
Ms. Ronson, wearing her gray scalloped-edge booties ($285), a floral Anastasia keyhole dress ($335) and a disorderly bun -- A Perfect Mess, contained -- examined the shiny orange lips and nixed them. ''It goes too far,'' she said.
Ms. Royt, who has worked on seven collections with Ms. Ronson, said that she has urged her to make more runway-only ''wow'' pieces (known as ''press dresses''), but she often declines. Stubbornly commercial, Ms. Ronson replies: ''I don't want to put anything on the runway that my customers can't buy.''
After her latest show, she waved and blew a quick kiss on the runway in front of a rowdy crowd that included Kelly Osbourne, Joy Bryant and Peaches Geldof. As she explained later: ''I'm happy to be behind the scenes.''
The Ronson Rundown
BORN in London, Charlotte Ronson moved to Manhattan at 6 with her mother, Ann Dexter-Jones (who had broken up with Laurence Ronson, a real estate entrepreneur); her brother Mark; and her twin, Samantha. Her mother went on to marry Mick Jones of Foreigner, and raise a brood of artistically inclined children:
Mark Ronson, 36, a founder of Allido, a record label. In 2008, he won three Grammys, including one for producer of the year for his work with Amy Winehouse. He is a D.J. (who spun at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's wedding in 2006) and has put out three albums, the latest, ''Record Collection,'' in 2010. Last month, Mr. Ronson married Josephine de La Baume, an actress and model. Mark Ronson is collaborating with the singer Katy B on the theme song for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Samantha Ronson, 34, Charlotte's twin. She lives in Los Angeles and is a singer and songwriter, and a D.J. who usually chooses the set list for Charlotte's runway shows. Last month, at the latest one, she played ''Chasing the Reds,'' a single by her band, Samantha Ronson and the Undertakers, and ''You Gave Me Nothing,'' a song by her brother Mark. In April, Samantha was the D.J. at an event for Reuters at this year's White House Correspondents' dinner.
Annabelle Dexter-Jones, 24, Charlotte's half sister, and the ethereal muse pictured in her campaigns and promotional videos. Recently, she has been romantically linked to Andre Saraiva, the night life entrepreneur, and has starred in his short film, ''The Shoe.'' She is designing a capsule collection of her own as well as studying acting at the William Esper Studio.
Alexander Dexter-Jones, 27, Charlotte's half brother, a D.J. at private events. He is also producing and writing songs for an album by a new band he started with Alexandra Lenas, who is engaged to Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook. CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

HEADLINE: A Silicon Valley School That Doesn't Compute

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
LOS ALTOS, Calif. -- The chief technology officer of eBay sends his children to a nine-classroom school here. So do employees of Silicon Valley giants like Google, Apple, Yahoo and Hewlett-Packard.
But the school's chief teaching tools are anything but high-tech: pens and paper, knitting needles and, occasionally, mud. Not a computer to be found. No screens at all. They are not allowed in the classroom, and the school even frowns on their use at home.
Schools nationwide have rushed to supply their classrooms with computers, and many policy makers say it is foolish to do otherwise. But the contrarian point of view can be found at the epicenter of the tech economy, where some parents and educators have a message: computers and schools don't mix.
This is the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, one of around 160 Waldorf schools in the country that subscribe to a teaching philosophy focused on physical activity and learning through creative, hands-on tasks. Those who endorse this approach say computers inhibit creative thinking, movement, human interaction and attention spans. 
The Waldorf method is nearly a century old, but its foothold here among the digerati puts into sharp relief an intensifying debate about the role of computers in education.
''I fundamentally reject the notion you need technology aids in grammar school,'' said Alan Eagle, 50, whose daughter, Andie, is one of the 196 children at the Waldorf elementary school; his son William, 13, is at the nearby middle school. ''The idea that an app on an iPad can better teach my kids to read or do arithmetic, that's ridiculous.''
Mr. Eagle knows a bit about technology. He holds a computer science degree from Dartmouth and works in executive communications at Google, where he has written speeches for the chairman, Eric E. Schmidt. He uses an iPad and a smartphone. But he says his daughter, a fifth grader, ''doesn't know how to use Google,'' and his son is just learning. (Starting in eighth grade, the school endorses the limited use of gadgets.)
Three-quarters of the students here have parents with a strong high-tech connection. Mr. Eagle, like other parents, sees no contradiction. Technology, he says, has its time and place: ''If I worked at Miramax and made good, artsy, rated R movies, I wouldn't want my kids to see them until they were 17.''
While other schools in the region brag about their wired classrooms, the Waldorf school embraces a simple, retro look -- blackboards with colorful chalk, bookshelves with encyclopedias, wooden desks filled with workbooks and No. 2 pencils.
On a recent Tuesday, Andie Eagle and her fifth-grade classmates refreshed their knitting skills, crisscrossing wooden needles around balls of yarn, making fabric swatches. It's an activity the school says helps develop problem-solving, patterning, math skills and coordination. The long-term goal: make socks.
Down the hall, a teacher drilled third-graders on multiplication by asking them to pretend to turn their bodies into lightning bolts. She asked them a math problem -- four times five -- and, in unison, they shouted ''20'' and zapped their fingers at the number on the blackboard. A roomful of human calculators.
In second grade, students standing in a circle learned language skills by repeating verses after the teacher, while simultaneously playing catch with bean bags. It's an exercise aimed at synchronizing body and brain. Here, as in other classes, the day can start with a recitation or verse about God that reflects a nondenominational emphasis on the divine.
Andie's teacher, Cathy Waheed, who is a former computer engineer, tries to make learning both irresistible and highly tactile. Last year she taught fractions by having the children cut up food -- apples, quesadillas, cake -- into quarters, halves and sixteenths.
''For three weeks, we ate our way through fractions,'' she said. ''When I made enough fractional pieces of cake to feed everyone, do you think I had their attention?''
Some education experts say that the push to equip classrooms with computers is unwarranted because studies do not clearly show that this leads to better test scores or other measurable gains.
Is learning through cake fractions and knitting any better? The Waldorf advocates make it tough to compare, partly because as private schools they administer no standardized tests in elementary grades. And they would be the first to admit that their early-grade students may not score well on such tests because, they say, they don't drill them on a standardized math and reading curriculum.
When asked for evidence of the schools' effectiveness, the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America points to research by an affiliated group showing that 94 percent of students graduating from Waldorf high schools in the United States between 1994 and 2004 attended college, with many heading to prestigious institutions like Oberlin, Berkeley and Vassar.
Of course, that figure may not be surprising, given that these are students from families that value education highly enough to seek out a selective private school, and usually have the means to pay for it. And it is difficult to separate the effects of the low-tech instructional methods from other factors. For example, parents of students at the Los Altos school say it attracts great teachers who go through extensive training in the Waldorf approach, creating a strong sense of mission that can be lacking in other schools.
Absent clear evidence, the debate comes down to subjectivity, parental choice and a difference of opinion over a single world: engagement. Advocates for equipping schools with technology say computers can hold students' attention and, in fact, that young people who have been weaned on electronic devices will not tune in without them.
Ann Flynn, director of education technology for the National School Boards Association, which represents school boards nationwide, said computers were essential. ''If schools have access to the tools and can afford them, but are not using the tools, they are cheating our children,'' Ms. Flynn said.
Paul Thomas, a former teacher and an associate professor of education at Furman University, who has written 12 books about public educational methods, disagreed, saying that ''a spare approach to technology in the classroom will always benefit learning.''
''Teaching is a human experience,'' he said. ''Technology is a distraction when we need literacy, numeracy and critical thinking.''
And Waldorf parents argue that real engagement comes from great teachers with interesting lesson plans.
''Engagement is about human contact, the contact with the teacher, the contact with their peers,'' said Pierre Laurent, 50, who works at a high-tech start-up and formerly worked at Intel and Microsoft. He has three children in Waldorf schools, which so impressed the family that his wife, Monica, joined one as a teacher in 2006.
And where advocates for stocking classrooms with technology say children need computer time to compete in the modern world, Waldorf parents counter: what's the rush, given how easy it is to pick up those skills?
''It's supereasy. It's like learning to use toothpaste,'' Mr. Eagle said. ''At Google and all these places, we make technology as brain-dead easy to use as possible. There's no reason why kids can't figure it out when they get older.''
There are also plenty of high-tech parents at a Waldorf school in San Francisco and just north of it at the Greenwood School in Mill Valley, which doesn't have Waldorf accreditation but is inspired by its principles.
California has some 40 Waldorf schools, giving it a disproportionate share -- perhaps because the movement is growing roots here, said Lucy Wurtz, who, along with her husband, Brad, helped found the Waldorf high school in Los Altos in 2007. Mr. Wurtz is chief executive of Power Assure, which helps computer data centers reduce their energy load.
The Waldorf experience does not come cheap: annual tuition at the Silicon Valley schools is $17,750 for kindergarten through eighth grade and $24,400 for high school, though Ms. Wurtz said financial assistance was available. She says the typical Waldorf parent, who has a range of elite private and public schools to choose from, tends to be liberal and highly educated, with strong views about education; they also have a knowledge that when they are ready to teach their children about technology they have ample access and expertise at home.
The students, meanwhile, say they don't pine for technology, nor have they gone completely cold turkey. Andie Eagle and her fifth-grade classmates say they occasionally watch movies. One girl, whose father works as an Apple engineer, says he sometimes asks her to test games he is debugging. One boy plays with flight-simulator programs on weekends.
The students say they can become frustrated when their parents and relatives get so wrapped up in phones and other devices. Aurad Kamkar, 11, said he recently went to visit cousins and found himself sitting around with five of them playing with their gadgets, not paying attention to him or each other. He started waving his arms at them: ''I said: 'Hello guys, I'm here.' ''
Finn Heilig, 10, whose father works at Google, says he liked learning with pen and paper -- rather than on a computer -- because he could monitor his progress over the years.
''You can look back and see how sloppy your handwriting was in first grade. You can't do that with computers 'cause all the letters are the same,'' Finn said. ''Besides, if you learn to write on paper, you can still write if water spills on the computer or the power goes out.''
Grading the Digital School: Articles in this series are looking at the intersection of education, technology and business as schools embrace digital learning.

HEADLINE: U.S. Scales Back Diplomacy in Iraq Amid Fiscal and Security Concerns

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting from Baghdad, an employee of The New York Times from Mosul, Iraq, and Steven Lee Myers from Dushanbe, Tajikistan.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Beyond the final withdrawal of troops that President Obama announced Friday, America's fiscal troubles are dictating a drastic scaling back of plans for diplomatic, economic and cultural programs once deemed vital to steadying Iraq, building a long-term alliance and prying the country from Iran's tightening embrace.
As recently as this summer, the State Department had planned to establish a 700-person consulate in the still-restive northern city of Mosul. And as recently as the spring, the United States was moving ahead with plans for a consulate in the ethnically divided and potentially explosive city of Kirkuk.
Those plans have now been shelved or indefinitely postponed, and pleas from some Iraqi leaders to open diplomatic offices in the Shiite-dominated south, where Iran wields outsize influence, were summarily rejected. 
Taken together, the shrinking of the United States' military and diplomatic ambitions underscores the reality that a post-America Iraq is taking shape more rapidly and completely than many Iraqis and Americans had envisioned. That has heartened many Iraqis and Americans, weary of more than eight years of war and occupation, but left others fearful.
''The United States should not turn its back on Iraq,'' Labid Abawi, the deputy foreign minister, said in an interview on Saturday. ''Iraq needs the United States, and the United States needs Iraq.''
The shifting relationship comes at a delicate time for Iraq and the region.
The country finds itself surrounded by nations undergoing significant change. Iran, which has long sought to increase its influence on its neighbor, has been emboldened by the Arab Spring, which ousted or diminished several Western-leaning leaders. At the same time, Syria has been suffering through months of unrest that Iraqi leaders fear could spill over the border, reopening what was once a thoroughfare for fighters from Al Qaeda.
Domestically, many issues remain unresolved. Twenty months after a national election, the country's leading political blocs cannot agree on who should run the Defense and Interior Ministries. The Parliament still has not passed legislation about how the country's oil and gas revenues should be divided -- years after the Bush administration set such a law as a benchmark for progress.
The issue of whether Baghdad or the Kurdish region should hold sway over Kirkuk also remains unresolved.
American officials emphasize that they still plan a major increase in diplomatic and cultural programs -- the building blocks of so-called soft power -- scattering branch offices across the country in the largest diplomatic mission since the Marshall Plan.
On Saturday, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stressed the ties that will remain -- and issued what appeared to be a barely veiled warning to Iran.
''As we open this new chapter in a relationship with a sovereign Iraq, to the Iraqis we say: America is with you as you take your next steps in your journey to secure your democracy,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. ''And to the countries in the region, especially Iraq's neighbors, we want to emphasize that America will stand with our allies and friends, including Iraq, in defense of our security and interests.''
But the expansion of a diplomatic presence will be much smaller than imagined, a victim not only of budgetary constraints but also of a growing awareness that the decision to withdraw American soldiers makes it much harder for diplomats to safely do their work. The State Department's more extensive plans were drawn up at a time when military officials were pushing to keep up to 20,000 soldiers in Iraq next year.
Christopher R. Hill, a former United States ambassador to Iraq, worries that even a less-expansive presence might be risky.
''I and many other people have concerns of the sustainability of keeping so many diplomats in so many far-flung places,'' he said. ''If you don't have freedom of movement, you do go back to the question of whether it is worth the outlay of the budget and risk and personnel for keeping these people there.''
The reactions in Baghdad on Friday night and Saturday, after Mr. Obama's remarks, were muted, a possible reflection of the country's mixed emotions.
Many Iraqis -- especially ethnic Kurds, secular intellectuals and Sunnis skittish about Shiite power -- have expressed anxiety about what the country might become without an American military presence.
''Obama's announcement to withdraw all U.S. troops is a victory for the Iraqis, but we have to be aware of Iranian influences and their attempts to exert control over Iraq,'' said Haidar al-Mulla, a spokesman and lawmaker with Iraqiya, the political bloc that won the most seats in last year's parliamentary elections.
But others, like those who recently celebrated the closing of a major American base in Mosul, saw only possibilities in the increasing signs that the United States was definitively pulling back. Students, poets and local officials raised the Iraqi flag on Monday and held placards that read, ''Congratulations to the city of Mosul on this great day, the last occupier soldier has left.''
One celebrant, Sheik Shakir Ghalib, said: ''The day of the end of the occupation means such a great happiness I can't describe it. The happiness is overwhelming to me. As I see the people of my city celebrate the departure of the Americans from the city of prophets, my eyes cry and we pray for God to bless our martyrs and release our detainees.''
The discussions over the last year about America's future role in Iraq, both within the United States government and between the two countries, have laid bare the diminishing ability of the United States to shape outcomes in Iraq, as well as a relative lack of interest in a Congress consumed by domestic issues.
''I guess very thoughtful people believe there should be some residual presence in Iraq,'' said Mr. Hill, who now runs the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. ''But there are many Americans who don't want to hear the word 'Iraq' and are not really behind a continued presence.''
Given that, Mr. Hill said, ''I'm not surprised there is downward gravity about what we really want to see there.''
The State Department's plans still need approval from the Iraqi government and financing from Congress. The department has requested $6.2 billion to finance its operations for the 2012 fiscal year.
The plans for Mosul were among those that fell victim not only to anticipated budgetary constraints, but also to the reality that the military was pulling out. Without American soldiers in the mix, the State Department realized that the vast majority of the 700-person staff would have to be contract security guards. Officials concluded that the cost of security outweighed the benefit of having a small number of diplomats and program officers in the field.
In Kirkuk -- where the potential for violence had previously been the centerpiece of arguments by military officials for a longer troop presence -- the State Department indefinitely postponed plans for a consulate. It will now rely on an office to be financed by the Pentagon to maintain a bare-bones diplomatic function.
An even earlier plan called for a branch office in Diyala Province, but that was quickly abandoned. Two consulates have, however, been opened, in Basra and Erbil.
Other programs were also affected. State Department plans had called for nearly 350 contract workers for an ambitious police training effort, according to an American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were meant to be confidential. Now the figure is close to 100.
There will now be 10 Office of Security Cooperation locations, which manage the sale of weapons and training, when previous plans called for 15.
The stakes in Iraq remain clear, as do the inevitable questions about its future. Will a fragile government tilt toward authoritarianism and more violence, or become stable and democratic? Will the United States leave a positive legacy, a return of sorts for what it spent in lives and dollars over the course of the war? That is a goal no number of troops could guarantee.
''There were never going to be enough to guarantee an acceptable outcome,'' said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It would have slightly increased the odds.''
Mr. Hill, the former ambassador, expressed similar misgivings about whether any amount of continued intervention could create the strong ally the United States hoped would be the legacy of a war that took so many American and Iraqi lives and strained America's coffers.
''We can say it is an ally,'' Mr. Hill said, ''but an invasion is never a very good basis for forming an alliance.''

 BODY:
WHERE CHINA MEETS INDIA
Burma and the New Crossroads of Asia
By Thant Myint-U
361 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $27.
As economies and societies all around them have flourished, two countries have been strikingly left out of the East Asian boom of the past generation: North Korea and Myanmar. The strategic importance, internal miseries and governing oddities of North Korea are obvious and frequently in the news. Myanmar, by contrast, is rarely mentioned. When it does appear, it is usually as the object of some new calamity -- like the 2008 cyclone that killed over 100,000 people, many of them perishing after Myanmar's benighted military rulers refused outside aid -- or as the setting for dramas involving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner whose party triumphed in the 1990 national elections but who has spent most of the years since then under house arrest. 
The central premise of Thant Myint-U's new book, ''Where China Meets India,'' is that Myanmar both deserves and is destined to play a much more crucial role in world economic, political and even military events. (A note on names: the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or Slorc, which replaced the military regime of General Ne Win in the late 1980s and which still maintains control under a different title, changed the English version of the country's name to Myanmar. Some newspapers, including this one, use that name while many Western governments, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have stuck with Burma, as Thant does in his book.) What's not yet clear, the author argues, are the likely consequences of Myanmar's impending reintegration into the world -- for its own people, for the nearby powers of India and China, and for other nations, notably the United States. ''Where China Meets India'' is not mainly a political book, but it ends with a sharp argument that American policy toward Myanmar is flawed in a way that is about to become more costly for all parties involved, except the Chinese.
Thant, who was born in New York of Burmese parents, is a former United Nations official and the author of a previous well-received book, ''The River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma.'' He is also a grandson of U Thant, the secretary general of the United Nations in the 1960s. He tries hard here to emphasize the centrality of Myanmar's geographic, cultural and historic positioning between India and China, both of which have interacted with Burmese tribes and rulers over the years.
Now and for the immediate future, that influence comes overwhelmingly from China -- because of its high-speed growth, because of its trade across its rugged land border with Myanmar, because of its demand for that country's raw materials and for commodities that can come in by sea to Myanmar's ports. China has roughly America's geographic scale and layout, with a dry and mountainous interior. ''What China is lacking is its California,'' Thant points out, ''another coast that would provide its remote interior provinces with an outlet to the sea.'' He quotes Chinese strategists who see Myanmar not exactly as a new California but ''as the bridge to the Bay of Bengal and the waters beyond.''
Thant's book is an engaging combination of history, contemporary travelogue and personal and family recollections, along with a certain amount of policy analysis. Western readers are likely to be especially drawn to its rich, loving, but tragic portrayal of Myanmar. As he did in his previous book, Thant explains its colonial legacies, its repressive and erratic government, its deep ethnic divisions, drug trade and civil wars, as well as the look and feel of its cities and landscape.
What may come as news to many Western readers (and would be unacceptable to many in China) is Thant's exhaustive account of how very separate were the kingdoms, tribal areas and small independent states that are now amalgamated into the modern nations of the region. ''For much of its early history,'' he notes, ''Burma's neighbor to the northeast was not China, but the independent kingdom of Yunnan'' -- now a Chinese province -- ''with Dali as its capital.'' Thant's description of the historic variety of China's component parts is convincing and fair-minded. Yet this is a loaded, even dangerous, theme within China, because of the government's hypersensitivity about what it calls ''splittism'' in any form -- the concept that China's extent might ever have differed from its current borders, including those in Tibet and Xinjiang.
Thant also ably portrays the mixture of opportunism and wariness with which the people of Myanmar and their neighbors view the coming of new Chinese factories, plantations, mines and dams. ''Burma is naturally very rich in the very commodities that will be most valued in the 21st century, . . . and China will likely bankroll any efforts to exploit these resources,'' Thant writes. ''What's unclear is whether the majority of Burmese people will benefit at all.''
My main concern about his book involves its on-scene Chinese coverage. Thant appears to have spent less time there than in the other venues, and his descriptions often sound touristy, padded or just plain wrong. I don't know who told him that Beijing's name means ''Northern Peace,'' but it doesn't -- it's ''Northern Capital,'' in contrast to the ''Southern Capital'' of Nanjing. He has a famous neighborhood in Beijing placed in the wrong part of town, and he says, remarking on the enormous ''photograph'' (actually a painted portrait) of Mao Zedong that dominates Tiananmen Square, that it was ''the only place I saw a photograph of him anywhere in China.'' That is hard to imagine. While living in China, I came across images of Mao many times a day, not even counting his presence on every unit of Chinese currency from the 1-renminbi bill to the largest, 100 renminbi. Some of Thant's China-travelogue sections also have a notebook-emptying feel: ''A bellhop in a red uniform showed me upstairs. . . . After the bellhop left I studied the hotel brochure and saw that in addition to the basic singles and doubles (I had taken a single, called a 'Deluxe') there were various classes of suites.''
But most of ''Where China Meets India'' is engaging and strong, particularly when it reformulates an argument Thant has made over the years -- that America's exclusions and trade sanctions have outgrown their usefulness. The American boycott of Cuba has the same obsolete quality. The difference is that Myanmar has an alternative financier immediately at hand.
In one possible outcome for the country's future, Thant says, ''Western sanctions stay in place, and they reduce the influence of Western democracies to near zero.'' He quotes a Chinese businessman who puts this prospect more pithily: ''I hope Western sanctions will remain forever.'' Thant argues that the ripple effects of a Myanmar that had become a full but resentful Chinese satellite would alarm India and disrupt the region. The better option, he says, would be selective engagement by the West (which, if recent headlines are to be believed, may already be in progress), much like America's with China over the past 30 years -- a tactic that has not ended disagreements but has made relations easier. Even if you aren't persuaded, it's a case worth hearing and a trip, in Thant's company, worth taking.

HEADLINE: Four Nations, Four Lessons

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
AS the economy languishes, politicians and pundits are debating what to do next. When we look around the world, it's hard to find positive role models. But as we search for answers, it is useful to keep in mind those fates that we would like to avoid.
The recent economic histories of four nations are noteworthy: France, Greece, Japan and Zimbabwe. Each illustrates a kind of policy mistake that could, if we are not careful, presage the future of the United States economy. Think of them as the four horsemen of the economic apocalypse. 
Let's start with Zimbabwe. If there were an award for the world's worst economic policy, it might well have won it several times over the past decade. In particular, in 2008 and 2009, it experienced truly spectacular hyperinflation. Prices rose so fast that the central bank eventually printed 100 trillion-dollar notes for people to carry. The nation has since abandoned using its own currency, but you can still buy one of those notes as a novelty item for about $5 (American, that is).
Some may find it hard to imagine that the United States would ever go down this route. But reckless money creation is apparently a concern of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president. He suggested in August that it would be ''almost treasonous'' if Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, were to print too much money before the election. Mr. Perry is not alone in his concerns. Many on the right fear that the Fed's recent policies aimed at fighting high unemployment will mainly serve to ignite excessive inflation.
Mr. Bernanke, however, is less worried about the United States turning into Zimbabwe than he is about it turning into Japan.
Those old enough to remember the 1980s will recall that Japan used to be an up-and-coming economic superpower. Many people then worried (too much, in my view) that Japan's rapid growth was a threat to prosperity in the United States, in much the same way that many people worry today (too much, in my view) about rapid growth in China.
The concerns about Japanese hegemony came to a quick end after bubbles in the real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. Since then, Japan has struggled to regain its footing. Critics of the Bank of Japan say it has been too focused on quelling phantom inflationary threats and insufficiently concerned about restoring robust economic growth.
One of those critics was Mr. Bernanke, before he became Fed chairman. Watching Japanese timidity and failures has surely made him more willing to experiment with unconventional forms of monetary policy in the aftermath of our own financial crisis.
The economists in the Obama administration are also well aware of the Japanese experience. That is one reason they are pushing for more stimulus spending to prop up the aggregate demand for goods and services.
Yet this fiscal policy comes with its own risks. The more we rely on deficit spending to keep the economy afloat, the more we risk the kind of sovereign debt crisis we have witnessed in Greece over the past year. The Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt over the summer is a portent of what could lie ahead. In the long run, we have to pay our debts -- or face dire consequences.
To be sure, the bond market doesn't seem particularly worried about the solvency of the federal government. It is still willing to lend to the United States at low rates of interest. But the same thing was true of Greece four years ago. Once the bond market starts changing its mind, the verdict can be swift, and can lead to a vicious circle of rising interest rates, increasing debt service and budget deficits, and falling confidence.
Bond markets are now giving the United States the benefit of the doubt, partly because other nations look even riskier, and partly in the belief that we will, in time, get our fiscal house in order. The big political question is how.
The nation faces a fundamental decision about priorities. To maintain current levels of taxation, we will need to substantially reduce spending on the social safety net, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the new health care program sometimes called Obamacare. Alternatively, we can preserve the current social safety net and raise taxes substantially to pay for it. Or we may choose a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. This brings us to the last of our cautionary tales: France.
Here are two facts about the French economy. First, gross domestic product per capita in France is 29 percent less than it is in the United States, in large part because the French work many fewer hours over their lifetimes than Americans do. Second, the French are taxed more than Americans. In 2009, taxes were 24 percent of G.D.P. in the United States but 42 percent in France.
Economists debate whether higher taxation in France and other European nations is the cause of the reduced work effort and incomes there. Perhaps it is something else entirely -- a certain joie de vivre that escapes the nose-to-the-grindstone American culture.
We may soon be running a natural experiment to find out. If American policy makers don't rein in entitlement spending over the next several decades, they will have little choice but to raise taxes close to European levels. We can then see whether the next generation of Americans spends less time at work earning a living and more time sipping espresso in outdoor cafes.

HEADLINE: Recession-Ravaged Yards, Inviting Skaters to Drop In

BYLINE: By ROBERT ITO

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
MANY people got their first glimpse of backyard pool skating in the 2002 documentary ''Dogtown and Z-Boys,'' the director Stacy Peralta's paean to the Southern California skateboard scene of the 1970s. A record-setting drought had emptied swimming pools throughout the region, and imaginative locals found that they made awesome skate parks, though often illegal ones. In Mr. Peralta's telling, the skills the riders honed in those backyard arenas led to the rise of vert skating, begetting a new generation of skate heroes and ultimately the X Games.
Three decades later pools across the state are bone dry again, this time thanks to thousands of foreclosed, abandoned homes. With all those empty backyards has come a resurgence in the sport and, over the last three years, the rise of a new kind of skater film, one that looks and feels nothing like ''Dogtown,'' now a classic. 
There's Steve Payne's ''Fresno,'' about one Central California town's housing crisis and the pool skaters who couldn't be happier about it, and two films by the skater-director Josh Henderson, ''Cancer Dust'' and ''Block Party,'' which intercut thrilling action sequences in cities hard hit by the economy (Phoenix, Fresno and New Orleans make appearances) with shots of wipeouts, open wounds and general drunkenness. There have been somber shorts (''Cannonball''), action-only compilations with the subprime-mortgage crisis as a backdrop (''A Badlands Adventure'') and countless self-produced YouTube videos.
Gaining the most notice and critical acclaim is ''Dragonslayer,'' which will be released in New York on Nov. 4. The film charts a year in the life of an itinerant professional skateboarder and single father, Josh Sandoval, a k a Skreech. Winner of the best documentary prize at this year's South by Southwest and Hot Docs festivals, ''Dragonslayer'' is a tale of young love and skating mayhem set against the recession-wracked suburbs of Central and Southern California.
The Hollywood Reporter described it as a ''beautifully photographed'' work that ''lets its subject speak for himself, even when his words and behavior tend to counteract the filmmakers' apparent affection for him.''
That movie's director, the first-time filmmaker Tristan Patterson, said his entry in the genre isn't a pool-skating film at all. ''I'm making a movie about Josh,'' he said at his home in the Echo Park neighborhood here, ''and one of the things he does is ride pools.''
Nevertheless it is the most riveting look at the life and world of skateboarders since ''Dogtown.'' Unlike that film, which sought to chronicle nothing less than the transformation of a sport, ''Dragonslayer'' is pretty void of action, and that's sort of the point. Mr. Sandoval, now 25, gets tattooed, smokes copious amounts of marijuana, skates at assorted sites, falls in love with Leslie Brown, an ambitious teenager with dreams of college, and embarks on a failed road trip.
It's not clear just how much the film's protagonist has been personally affected by the recession, but his wanderings, from one backyard overgrown with weeds to the next, reveal a landscape ravaged by it.
''There was this experience of always picking him up or going to meet him, and suddenly you're in Modesto,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''It's like he's transient, and yet he's always home.''
In many ways Mr. Sandoval's life and travels are a lot like the clandestine sport itself. Existing on the fringes, pool skating has always thrived during times of crisis. The 1991 firestorm in the Oakland hills spawned a short-lived pool-skating boom there that was documented in the 2004 film ''Skating Through the Ashes.'' More recently Mr. Henderson shot skaters riding pools behind homes devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
''We're just land pirates,'' said Steve Alba, who has skated over 5,000 pools by his rough count, and who recently introduced the Salba Cruz line of boards and apparel. ''During the earthquake in L.A. back in '94 we skated hundreds of pools for three years running, because there were just so many red-tagged homes.''
And cameramen have been there to document nearly every spectacular trick and spill. Pool skating ''was such a brand-new thing that we literally wanted to see what we looked like riding them,'' Mr. Peralta said of the early films. ''Even now the reason it's photographed so much is because it's so ephemeral. These pools sometimes only last for weeks or days, so you want a memory of it. Getting it on film is like having a trophy.''
For Mr. Patterson the process of documenting a subculture wary of outsiders presented its own challenges. ''You're constantly thinking about boundaries,'' he said. ''If Skreech was entering a new environment that I hadn't filmed at, I kind of came in behind him and tried to stay quiet. I wasn't walking into an environment going, 'I'm making a movie about this kid, and this is what I want to see here.' ''
On location for ''Fresno'' skaters asked the director, Mr. Payne, not to film the fronts of houses and thus reveal the pools' locations. And forget your typical shooting schedule. ''They go skating when they wake up,'' Mr. Payne said, ''and they stop when it gets too hot, or when the bars and the strip joints open.''
Once the skaters do show up, there's still the matter of making the pools skateable. Cleaning scenes have become a staple of the genre, as skaters spend hours draining fetid water, shoveling out debris and extracting the occasional bullfrog or opossum. In ''Cancer Dust'' Mr. Henderson tweaked the ritual by hiring local models to perform the task decked out in high heels and fishnets.
''Dragonslayer'' begins with such a scene. After a montage of skating shots Mr. Sandoval, bare-chested, is shown draining and scrubbing a particularly wretched-looking pool in Delano, Calif. Finally he drops in, and after a couple of spills he's flying around the pool, blissfully reaping the fruits of his labor. That is, until a woman storms from the house and boots him out. Total riding time: about five minutes.
But those are some minutes. ''I think he has found happiness in a pool,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''That's where things make sense. A lot of people are like that. You find something you love, and that can be healthy, and it can be really unhealthy. The world makes sense to Keith Richards when he's playing his guitar. The rest of the time life is difficult.''

HEADLINE: Blending Hip-Hop And Heraldry

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
A FEW weeks before the opening of his first solo show, ''Herald,'' at the Marlborough Gallery in Chelsea, Rashaad Newsome rendered himself as a coat of arms.
''This is me,'' he said one recent afternoon in his studio in Chelsea, pointing to a square of black alligator skin with alternating shiny and matte swatches. It was decorated with a shield patterned by gold fleur-de-lis -- a symbol of his hometown, New Orleans -- and a leather baseball hat with the points of a crown: urban royalty. The frame was heavy gold rope, like the chains worn by 1980s rappers, and topped with Swarovski crystal fleur-de-lis at the corners, for added bling. According to the rules of heraldry -- the art and technique of creating richly detailed symbols of achievement, status and clan that dates to at least the 12th century -- Mr. Newsome's armorial representation was done in the style, if necessarily not the size and shape, of a standard flag. 
''The standard flag has two functions,'' he explained. ''It's hoisted going into battle, and when you win, you plant that flag.'' This flag was to be hung near the center of the exhibition, a pronouncement of Mr. Newsome's elevated status. And he had no illusions about its symbolism. ''It could be my triumph into this completely new territory that is Marlborough,'' he said, smiling slightly, leaving any other possibility -- like retreat -- unspoken.
''Herald,'' which opened last week and will be on view through Dec. 3, offers up Mr. Newsome's modern-day take on heraldry, centuries of European tradition mashed up with hip-hop's latest swagger, like a coat of arms inspired by the young rapper Nicki Minaj. It represents the culmination of several strands of his work: history applied to the juxtaposition of high and pop art; symbols isolated, mixed and re-appropriated; the exploration of African-American culture. And along with a related appearance at Performa, the performance art biennial, where he will present the festival's first-ever rap battle, it could mark his breakthrough as a young artist. At 31 he is aiming for a contemporary art bull's-eye, the intersection of the classics and the street.
Mr. Newsome has fans in many corners of the art world, who praise him for his ability to render urban life in a formal studio context. ''He is very much a child of this generation who embraces everything that moves and is pop and is music, and puts it in a blender and makes it their own, so I'm impressed by that,'' said Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1. ''I've seen his work now for at least three-plus years, and it has become very accomplished. I see him as on the verge of a larger audience understanding what he tries to establish.'' PS1 had a role in that: last year, as part of its ''Greater New York'' exhibition, it showed Mr. Newsome's ''Conductor,'' an installation that used hip-hop YouTube clips -- focused on rappers' hands -- to create a video for Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' (with a rap beat added). It came shortly after ''Five,'' Mr. Newsome's performance piece for the Whitney Biennial, which reinterpreted vogueing.
Naima J. Keith, an assistant curator at Studio Museum in Harlem, was introduced to Mr. Newsome's performances through that piece. She compared his work to that of Kehinde Wiley, another artist who has overlapped contemporary black culture with canonical art to great acclaim.
''I think that's still a juxtaposition that's really interesting, that I don't think has been overworked,'' she said, adding that she liked that Mr. Newsome covers it in a multitude of styles -- collage, video, performance. ''You can really see the trajectory between all those different practices,'' she said. ''He's definitely someone I'm keeping my eye on.''
Mr. Newsome's ''rap joust,'' an open call for aspiring M.C.'s to be held on Nov. 2, has drawn the interest of MTV, which is helping promote it. It will be judged by downtown personalities including Alanna Heiss, the former director of PS1, who called Mr. Newsome's work ''beautiful'' and ''brainy''; Charlie Ahearn, the director of the seminal early rap film ''Wild Style;'' Chris Chambers, a music executive who has worked with Drake and Big Boi; and Andre J, the occasionally feminine and bearded model. The winner will appear on ''Swag,'' a mixtape Mr. Newsome has composed, to be released in volumes in the coming months, with tracks from the likes of Erykah Badu, Diplo and Laurie Anderson.
It was that kind of multimedia ambition that attracted the Marlborough Gallery. An august family-run institution with locations in Manhattan and London, it is rebranding its Chelsea space as a destination for younger, on-the-verge artists; Mr. Newsome's exhibition is the first to reflect that transformation, said Max Levai, who helps run the gallery.
''It's a new approach for Marlborough, and Rashaad is central to that programming,'' said Mr. Levai, the 23-year-old son of Pierre Levai, the Marlborough president. ''Herald'' features video -- the first time the gallery has worked with a video and performance artist, Max Levai said -- as well as Mr. Newsome's collaged coats of arms in ornate, carved antique frames. The collages are built from images taken from hip-hop magazines like XXL and the Source (fresh bling, women's legs, car rims, marijuana) and luxury publications like Sotheby's catalogs (old bling). Densely packed on the canvas, they give Mr. Newsome's work a baroque richness: the sweep of a hairweave, repeated hundreds of times, looks like brushstrokes; the color and compositions mimic Renaissance art. More than half the works sold before the exhibition opened, Mr. Levai said.
''A coat of arms is really a collage of objects that represent social status and economic status and status as a warrior,'' Mr. Newsome said, ''so they're kind of like portraits without using the figure.'' It proved a natural fit with hip-hop, a self-referential art form obsessed with status, class and gilded accessories. Royalty too: ''Everybody wants to be the king of hip-hop,'' Mr. Newsome added.
Mr. Newsome, who is mild mannered but intensely focused enough to retain the arcana of heraldry, became interested in the subject while living in Europe several years ago. He graduated from Tulane with a degree in art history and moved to New York in 2000, studying film editing and video production and taking odd jobs. He lived in a loft in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and often threw parties, D.J.-ing to pay the rent. In 2006 he received a grant from the Franklin Furnace Fund, devoted to avant-garde art, which he used to work on ''Shade Compositions,'' a video and performance piece. In it, a group of black women employ a vocabulary of what Mr. Newsome calls ''ghetto gestures'' and phrases -- like a head-snapping, lips-pursed ''excuuuuse-me'' -- that build into a musical rhythm.
Around 2005 a friend offered him a spot in a squat in Paris, and, eager to live rent free, he went. Traveling around, he was struck by examples of heraldry in every corner, a shorthand for the notion of pedigree. ''It's completely embedded in the culture all throughout Europe,'' he said. ''In the beginning I was drawing them and taking photos of the architecture.''
But collage was the cheapest way for him to work. He began researching the history of heraldry, with its myriad rules and medieval terms, like ''pursuivant,'' or junior officer of arms, which is what Mr. Newsome (unofficially) calls himself. Eventually he found his way to the Royal College of Arms in London, an exalted practitioner in the field, which agreed to participate in his artwork.
He did a video interview with the Windsor Herald, an official whose role dates to the 1300s -- and even now a man so formal Mr. Newsome said he never learned his given name -- and got a tour of a wood-lined archival room, where valuable, centuries-old armorial achievements are kept. ''It was like being in 'Harry Potter' or something,'' Mr. Newsome said. (The visit may have made less of an impact on the Windsor Herald, William Hunt. ''Oh, a chap who, a black fellow who does a lot of zany designs?'' Mr. Hunt said in a phone interview last week, when prodded to recall Mr. Newsome. Asked to comment on the possible overlap between hip-hop and heraldry, Mr. Hunt said: ''I'm almost 65. I haven't a clue what hip-hop looks like.'')
Mr. Newsome had his first show of heraldic-inspired works, ''Standards,'' at the Ramis Barquet gallery in Chelsea in 2009; the video with the Windsor Herald, called ''Pursuivant,'' in which Mr. Newsome is faux-knighted, followed. Since then he has moved away from the look of the traditional coats of arms -- with a prescribed composition where each symbol adheres to strict codes -- to create his own allover forms like ''Black Barbie,'' the piece inspired by Ms. Minaj. Working on it led him to the rapper Lil Kim; in hip-hop circles the two women have a beef. Lil Kim, known as the queen bee of rap, now has her own coat of arms, complete with a bee-adorned frame. (Though the frames are meticulously sourced antiques, Mr. Newsome gives them a contemporary rap gloss too; he has some detailed at the Bronx body shop that's featured on ''Funk Flex Full Throttle,'' an MTV show about car culture hosted by Funkmaster Flex.) The music videos in the ''Herald'' show are like the coats of arms come to life, to a beat that Mr. Newsome created.
Pageantry, battling and remixing have always been part of heraldic tradition; coats of arms were used in jousts, and each ''has to differ in two ways from every one that was made before it,'' Mr. Newsome said. From there, the idea of the multi-sample mixtape and the Performa MC battle -- ''Medieval Times meets 'American Idol' meets Freestyle Friday,'' the rap face-off on BET, is how Mr. Newsome described it -- came naturally.
''He has a way of translating ideas that appear on MTV or appear on the street and somehow twisting it or distilling it -- he puts a frame around it,'' said RoseLee Goldberg, the founder of Performa, who has followed Mr. Newsome for several years. She added that his work ''leaves a very powerful visual impression; it's like it stays in your retina for some time.''
But even as Mr. Newsome's work has earned art world recognition -- he has performances planned for the Miami Art Museum during Art Basel Miami and at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art next spring -- he expressed frustration that, aside from the Warhol and Basquiat references in Jay-Z and Kanye West's album ''Watch the Throne'' aside, the art scene is not part of mainstream hip-hop culture. ''You start to meet these collectors and things like that -- there's so many people in the world of my reference point that don't participate in that,'' he said, ''and I would like for them to participate. I think it would really drastically change the artwork.''
In his studio, surrounded by cutout images of booties and gems, heads of rappers and gold chains, he voiced a quiet hope that his work would serve as an invitation. As he makes his way to being a self-appointed king of arms, that, he said, is part of his quest.
Correction: October 30, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the artist Rashaad Newsome, who blends hip-hop and heraldry, misidentified the position held by Pierre Levai of the Marlborough Gallery in Chelsea, where Mr. Newsome's first solo show is being held. Mr. Levai is the gallery's president, not a director.

HEADLINE: Rescued By Design

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
I JOINED the line to get into the United Nations the other day, fiddling with my iPhone before shuffling through security. The couple in back (he was toting an iPad) mused about what a design guru Steve Jobs had been. They headed toward the information desk and I toward ''Design With the Other 90 Percent: Cities,'' an infelicitously titled but inspired show organized by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and now installed (since the museum is closed for renovations) in the United Nations visitors' lobby.
Design shows may conjure up fizzy displays of Van Cleef & Arpels or stylish tributes to Helvetica and classic automobiles. Design implies for most people the beautiful things an affluent society makes for itself.
This show is not about that kind of design. The objects here tend to look rugged and sometimes embarrassingly simple, as in ''Why hadn't anyone come up with that idea before?'' Their beauty lies elsewhere: in providing economical, smart solutions to address the problems of millions of the world's poorest people. 
If the genius of Mr. Jobs was giving us sleek and effortless products that answered questions consumers hadn't thought to ask yet (can my mobile phone feature a speech-recognition system that reminds me to pick up my dry cleaning?), the designs in this case wrestle with what have long seemed intractable crises. I left stirred by how designers have tackled global pandemics like the proliferation of slums and the spread of infectious disease.
This is a design show about remaking the world, in other words. And that's thrilling, whether it's happening in Cupertino, Calif., or Uganda, where H.I.V. infects hundreds of people a day, and the latest news cellphone-wise has been the design and distribution of a text-messaging system that spreads health care information.
Text to Change, as the project is called, entails a collaboration by a pair of Dutch communication and technology specialists with local phone service providers and health care organizations. In Kibera, an area of Nairobi, Kenya, and one of the densest slums in Africa, the challenge was different. Traditional wood and charcoal fires cause rampant respiratory disease there. Refuse fills the streets. So a Nairobian architect designed a community cooker, fueled by refuse residents collect in return for time using the ovens.
From cellphones and cookers to cities: in Thailand, a public program called Baan Mankong Community Upgrading has, for the last eight years, been improving conditions in hundreds of that country's 5,500 slums, bringing residents together with government and nongovernment agencies to design safer, cleaner places to live.
Along the Bang Bua Canal in Bangkok, where thousands of families have long squatted in rickety stilt houses linked by flimsy walkways, all teetering above polluted floodwater, architects from nearby Sripatum University were enlisted to devise row houses, detached houses and semidetached houses, along the lines of what residents said they wanted. Hundreds of decrepit stilt structures were demolished, new homes built in their stead, often from recycled doors and timber, on solid ground and near the former stilt houses, so that communities would not be broken up and families uprooted.
More than just upgrading housing and infrastructure, the strategy in Bang Bua included low-interest loans and renewable 30-year leases for slum residents, making them, for the first time, legal stakeholders in their properties. This helped to end the old cycle of evictions (in many slums around the world evictions are used to clear space for shopping malls and expressways) that left the poor in Bangkok perennially helpless and hopeless. With money from the loans, the residents of Bang Bua also decided to build a center for the elderly and disabled, and to set aside a fund for libraries, child care and school fees for the poorest families.
''It's easy to build a house, much harder to build a community,'' as Cynthia E. Smith, the show's curator, told me. ''Cities are very complex, and what the best designers illustrate is how to give form to sometimes very simple ideas. Good design involves bringing not just a fresh eye to problems but, most of all, listening to the people who live in those communities. We're talking about a billion people living in informal settlements today,'' she added. ''You can see them as a billion problems or a billion solutions.''
This show follows a smaller one Ms. Smith organized in 2007 at the Cooper-Hewitt. That exhibition included among its 34 objects a filtered drinking straw that prevents the spread of typhoid and cholera; a bamboo treadle pump that helps poor farmers in Cambodia and India extract groundwater during the dry seasons; and the Q Drum, a doughnut-shaped plastic container, easily rolled, even long distances by children, which is used to transport up to 13 gallons of water.
The 2007 exhibition set the stage for this larger undertaking about whole cities, which couldn't be timelier. We live in an era of unprecedented urban migration. Ms. Smith mentioned the billion people living in informal settlements, or slums. That number is projected to double by 2030, triple by 2050, according to the United Nations Human Settlements Program. By then one of three people on the planet will supposedly be living in favelas in Brazil, barrios in Ecuador, shack settlements in South Africa, bidonvilles in Tunisia or chapros in Nepal -- the names are nearly as endless as the number of these sprawling, unplanned, impoverished places.
Ms. Smith spent a couple of years seeing what designers have been doing to improve living conditions in them. As at Bang Bua, one lesson seems strikingly obvious: the need to solicit the people living in poverty to come up with their own solutions. In so many slums -- Dharavi in Mumbai, India; Corail in Bangladesh; Cape Town, South Africa; and in American cities too -- the poor are left out of the process. But urban-renewal projects always work best when they're ground up, not top down.
''The poor,'' Somsook Boonyabancha, founding director of the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights, puts it in the show's catalog, ''are the creators and implementers of the most comprehensive and far-reaching systems for solving problems of poverty, housing and basic services.''
So in Diadema, a huge industrial city outside Sao Paulo, Brazil, 30 percent of the population used to live in favelas during the 1980s, when the homicide rate was shooting into the stratosphere. The government turned to residents for advice, asking them to help set priorities for the city budget, suggest upgrades for neighborhoods and approve construction projects, which employed workers who lived in the communities.
A land-tenure program awarded residents the right to stay on their property for 90 years, encouraging them to maintain their homes and invest in the neighborhoods. Residents helped to widen and pave streets, install clean-water and sanitation systems. Today, according to Ms. Smith, three percent of Diadema's residents live in favelas, and the annual homicide rate, a standard measure of civic order and public health, has dropped to 14.3 per 100,000 from its high of 140 during the 1990s.
Ms. Smith also includes in the exhibition the by-now textbook case of Medellin, Colombia, once the world capital of drug cartels, murder and despair. Progressive political leaders there, starting roughly a decade ago, decided somewhat counterintuitively to invest most heavily in the worst slums, building a cable car system to link the city's center with the isolated, crime-ridden areas that blanketed the surrounding hills. New libraries and parks, public schools and pedestrian walkways were built around the pylons of the transport system so that the most beautiful and ambitious public architecture in the city went into the poorest neighborhoods. Medellin became a changed place.
In Dakar, Senegal, designers working with community organizers developed an irrigation system to recycle wastewater in the crowded slum of Yoff. And in La Vega, one of the settlements lining the steep slopes around Caracas, Venezuela, a team of architects, engineers working with a geologist, again taking cues from residents, devised a series of new stairs and plazas, so impassable climbs became manageable, neighborhoods were linked and nobody was forced to move out of their homes.
I was struck by a map in the show that located 238 schools in Kibera, that dense settlement in Nairobi, which occupies a territory smaller than Central Park. I recall discovering a similarly astonishing number of schools and universities on trips to Gaza. Ms. Smith points out the case of Pune, one of India's many booming cities, where laborers constantly move from one informal settlement to another, following construction projects and taking their families with them. As a consequence their children often aren't enrolled in school.
In response a team of designers decided a decade ago to bring the schools to them, via buses equipped with classrooms for 25 that pick the students up where they live. Students receive old-fashioned handbooks that keep track of academic progress and list phone numbers for education centers around Pune (a second bus network is under way in Mumbai) so that when the children move, their parents can find schools in the new neighborhoods and teachers can pick up where the students left off.
Simplicity itself.
One last example, from Bangladesh: Mohammed Rezwan, a local architect, has designed ''community lifeboats'' that serve as floating schools, libraries and health clinics. With sea levels rising, nearly 20 percent of the land there is predicted to be under water by 2050. The low-lying Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta, the most densely populated area in the world, will flood. Working with native boat builders Mr. Rezwan adapted the traditional flat-bottom bamboo riverboat to create his Noah's Arks. He outfitted the boats with waterproof roofs and solar panels, installed computers, high-speed Internet and portable solar lamps made from recycled kerosene lanterns. Traditional materials, local building techniques and renewable energy sources produced a model of contextual design.
I'm hoping to check out this fleet and also a few of the cities the show celebrates, to see how they're doing, firsthand. Meanwhile I gather there are now 54 of Mr. Rezwan's boats in operation in Bangladesh, serving 90,000 families.
That's design guru stuff too.

HEADLINE: 2 Japanese Bankers at Heart of Olympus Fee Inquiry

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The F.B.I. is investigating a mysterious $687 million payout by Olympus, which the Japanese company has described as a fee for advice on the takeover of a British company. 

 BODY:
For two decades, a pair of Japanese bankers toiled away in relative anonymity on Wall Street, hopping from firm to firm. 
Now the two - Hajime Sagawa and Akio Nakagawa - are at the center of a growing firestorm over a mysterious $687 million payout by Olympus, the Japanese company that runs a lucrative medical equipment business and a less successful, if better known, digital camera business. The money has been described as a fee for advising Olympus on the 2008 takeover of a British company, the Gyrus Group. 
But the fee amount was more than 30 times the norm on Wall Street. And it went, in part, to a tiny unknown firm run by Mr. Sagawa and Mr. Nakagawa, a review of public records shows. The bulk of the fee later went to a Cayman Islands company that also had ties to at least one of the men. After the deal closed and the fees were paid, both firms closed up shop. 
The F.B.I. is now investigating the $687 million payment, according to two people briefed on the case. The focus of the investigation is not yet clear, and a spokesman for the F.B.I. in New York, James M. Margolin, declined to comment.
"We are not aware of any investigation" in the United States over the Gyrus deal, said Yoshiaki Yamada, a spokesman for Olympus in Tokyo. He said he could not comment further, including whether Olympus had been contacted by United States authorities.
During the last week, shareholders and analysts questioned why a public multinational company like Olympus would award such an outsize payment for advisory fees. According to securities lawyers and corporate governance experts, federal authorities will probably examine whether the steep fees point to deeper ties between Olympus and the bankers, or even kickbacks to Olympus officials involved in the deal. 
"This is about following the money," said Jonathan R. Macey, a professor of corporate law and governance at Yale. "It's very unusual and raises a classic red flag, pointing to either a waste of company assets or corruption." 
Olympus has said its payments were "appropriate." On Friday, the company said it would set up an independent panel to examine its past merger payments - a week after the company fired its chief executive, who said he had questioned the eye-popping fee. 
The firing of Michael C. Woodford, who is British, and his subsequent accusation that he was forced out because he planned to expose the fees, has rocked the company. Its shares have fallen 50 percent since Oct. 14. Many analysts have suspended their outlook for Olympus, saying the company's future had been thrown into disarray by the seriousness of the matter.
Olympus has been trying to recover since losing almost 115 billion yen ($1.5 billion) during the 12 months ended March 31, 2009. At the time, the loss was widely attributed to the effects of the global financial crisis, but it has now been linked to a sharp write-down in the value of three companies acquired earlier that year. 
Mr. Woodford has raised questions about those acquisitions, saying Olympus paid $773 million for the three companies with no due diligence, and later wrote down 76 percent of their value.
Mr. Sagawa and Mr. Nakagawa have not been accused of wrongdoing, and they have no apparent ties to the three other deals. A lawyer for Mr. Sagawa did not respond to requests for comment. Efforts to locate a valid address or phone number for Mr. Nakagawa in Japan were unsuccessful. 
The two Japanese bankers, according to interviews and regulatory records, appear to have first become colleagues in 1988 at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment house where Michael R. Milken helped pioneer the market for high-yield bonds. Over the years, the careers of the two Wall Street journeymen traced very similar paths.
Mr. Sagawa, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., was traveling on Friday, but his wife, Ellen, came to his defense. "My husband is a straight arrow," she said from the family's waterside home, which is assessed at $1.3 million. 
Mrs. Sagawa said she met her husband in the 1970s, when she was teaching English in Japan. Mr. Sagawa, or Jim as he is known in America, was a young and rising star at Nomura, the Japanese securities firm.
Over the years, Mr. Sagawa climbed the ranks of finance, soon landing in New York at Drexel, then a much-envied firm that came to represent the Wall Street boom of the 1980s. Mr. Sagawa, according to court papers in an unrelated matter, earned $360,000 in his final year at the firm, a tidy sum in 1989. 
At Drexel, Mr. Sagawa crossed paths with another up-and-coming banker, Mr. Nakagawa, who had started in the brokerage business at Merrill Lynch. The pair left Drexel in the spring of 1990 as it was falling apart.
 Both men soon landed at PaineWebber, and departed after Mr. Sagawa was laid off in 1996, regulatory records show. 
Mr. Sagawa toyed with the idea of retirement, but instead began a brokerage venture of his own, Axes America. He set up shop in Stamford, Conn., while also renting space in the Graybar Building overlooking Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. 
Mr. Sagawa was finally his own boss, president and chief executive of Axes America, regulatory records show. Mr. Nakagawa, at least for a time, was chairman of the firm's global operations, according to an archived version of the firm's Web site. 
"We have entered a major revolutionary period of the Japanese financial and securities industries in wave of deregulation and globalization," Mr. Nakagawa wrote on the Axes Web site. "We sincerely hope that we can contribute to society and its prosperity through our customers' prosperity."
The firm owed its name, Mr. Nakagawa said, to an aspiration to "become the axes of global capital markets."
For years, the two men ran a sleepy operation arranging private securities transactions and advising on mergers. Mr. Sagawa even found time to sail around the world. And in late 2002, Axes reconnected with its Drexel roots, organizing a conference in Tokyo that featured Mr. Milken, the former Drexel executive who pleaded guilty to securities law violations in 1990 and now runs an economic research institute.
In the United States, meanwhile, Axes generated mediocre revenue and hired only a handful of employees. In 2008, its final year, the firm reported a modest $8 million profit, according to a securities filing. During its years of operation, the firm generated sporadic business and never set off regulatory alarm bells. 
Mr. Sagawa "was a nice guy" and "he seemed O.K. to me," said Howard Spindel, a consultant who advised Axes when it opened its doors.
By 2006, as the firm began to quietly fade into the annals of Wall Street, a lucrative opportunity presented itself.
An Olympus official familiar with Axes sought the firm's counsel. It is unclear who at Olympus made the gesture, and whether this person approached Mr. Sagawa or Mr. Nakagawa.
"We understand that members of the board may have had previous dealings with Sagawa prior to his involvement with Axes," said a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report that examined the relationship between Olympus and Axes using a trove of internal documents and letters. Mr. Woodford, the ousted Olympus chief, had commissioned the report earlier this year. 
Under the guidance of Axes, Olympus was examining several targets, including Tyco, records show. Olympus later settled on a British medical device company, the Gyrus Group, agreeing to buy it for $2 billion. 
The advice did not come cheaply. While Olympus agreed to pay Axes 5 percent of the deal's value, the contract was not truly capped at 5 percent. 
 The fee also included an unusual option for Axes to buy shares of Gyrus. "An arrangement whereby a financial adviser received a mixture of cash, share options and warrants is surprising," the PricewaterhouseCoopers report noted, as advisers tend to be paid solely in cash.
The law firm Weil, Gotschal & Manges told Olympus in a 2008 document, recently provided to The New York Times, that cash payouts were preferable, but that an unnamed financial adviser "strongly resisted the cash payment on the grounds that this will crystallize an immediate tax liability." Weil Gotschal only reviewed the options for paying the fee, not the legality of the fee itself. The unnamed adviser was apparently Axes.
While the report did not lay out possible motivations or describe the actions as "improper conduct," PricewaterhouseCoopers added that "given the sums of money involved and some of the unusual decisions that have been made, it cannot be ruled out at this stage." 
On Feb. 1, 2008, the Gyrus deal was officially done. Weeks later, on March 5, Axes notified American regulators it was shutting down, records show. Mr. Nakagawa stopped registering with American regulators even earlier, though he continued to represent Axes in Japan. The firm's lease in the Graybar Building in New York ran until April 2011, according to a securities filing, so Axes paid about $85,000 to end it. And with that, the 11-year-old firm disappeared, even as its stake in Gyrus continued. 
Axes assigned its Gyrus shares to a new Cayman Islands operation with a somewhat similar name, Axam Investments, according to a securities filing. Details on Axam and its owners are fuzzy, but Mr. Sagawa signed documents as a director, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. No public records link Mr. Nakagawa to Axam. 
Mr. Sagawa also ran an obscure firm in Florida, Sagawa Capital, which was in the business of "proprietary investing," among other things, according to a filing with local officials.
Both Axam and Sagawa Capital drew little notice for two years. Then, in early 2010, Axam moved to unload its Gyrus shares, selling them to Olympus for $620 million. 
Ultimately, Olympus spent $687 million on fees, or 36 percent of the value of the Gyrus deal, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. An adviser's fee typically amounts to about 1 percent. 
"This is such an extraordinary deviation from normal fees," said Jeffrey Manns, an associate professor at George Washington University Law School who is an expert in securities law. "No one would have entered into this transaction if they were showing good business judgment," he added, as most countries prohibit corporate boards from "rubber-stamping" such large fees.
After the payout in March 2010, Mr. Sagawa shut down his businesses one by one. In June 2010, Axam was removed from the Cayman Islands company registry "for nonpayment of license fees," according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
And by December, Sagawa Capital, too, was extinct.

HEADLINE: The 'Enabling Violation' of International Adoption

BYLINE: DRUCILLA CORNELL


HIGHLIGHT: Defining adoption as "trauma" betrays a prejudice in favor of the traditional heterosexual family. 

 BODY:
On April 24, 1993, I legally adopted my daughter in Asuncion, Paraguay. I will never forget that day. I was a complete nervous wreck. Our adoption was being expedited because the first free elections in decades were to be held that spring, following the 35-year rule of the dictator Alfredo Stroessner, who was ousted in a military coup in 1989. There was much uncertainty as to whether the election would even take place, and concern that another military coup might prevent it. Tanks were in the street, and there was a sense that the country might well fall in to a civil war.
Against this background, adopting a baby might have seemed like a small issue. But in fact, all the opposition parties agreed on one thing: they would quickly stop all adoption to the United States, and indeed, in 1995, a law was passed to suspend adoptions from Paraguay until there had been a complete overhaul of adoption procedures. 
I will never forget - having always considered myself a progressive person - the night my hotel was surrounded by demonstrators protesting against us for stealing Paraguayan children. I was staying in a hotel whose guests were exclusively United States citizens adopting Paraguayan children. I tried to comfort myself by remembering how scrupulous I had been in working with my Paraguayan lawyer to follow all the rules and procedures that were to govern adoption under the old regime. But of course, the old regime was a dictatorship, and completely corrupt. So how could we really be sure that we had not fallen into a corrupt situation, one in which the children being adopted had not been given up willingly by their families, or at the very worst stolen and trafficked?

I had read stories about children being stolen from their parents; these stories were all over the press at the time I was in Paraguay. And of course, the issue is still with us today. Recent news stories reporting the abduction in China of children for international adoption have again brought to light the flaws and complexities of a system (or many systems) by which children are adopted. They have also raised questions about the ethical responsibilities of those systems and those who participate in it.
I still believe that I legally adopted my daughter, but only because I was able, by paying a friend of my daughter's birth mother under the table, to get as much of her story as I could, including that she had legally put her daughter up for adoption. There were many other difficulties that at times almost overwhelmed me, including the ill health of my then-daughter-to-be, who urgently needed medical care, which could only be provided by the solicitation of bribes.
The adoption of children is an act fraught with innumerable intersecting personal histories and motives. While not traditionally known to be a topic of philosophy, it is in fact deeply intertwined with many of the most fundamental issues of the discipline - personal and political freedom, self-determination, free will, and of course, human rights.
Central to all of these matters is the issue of the child's best interest, or more broadly, children's rights. An international treaty, the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, which the United States ratified in 2008, has gone some way toward establishing protections for children and parents in the adoption process. But of course problems remain.
There is a voluminous literature arguing that the act of child adoption itself constitutes a trauma. For example, the writer Betty Jean Lifton argued that no matter what adoptive parents do, an adopted child has undergone a foundational trauma. I have argued against that position because for Lifton, biological connection is the only way for a family to constitute itself through a foundational narrative of belonging. On that view, an adopted child will necessarily be robbed of such a narrative, and will be without answers to basic questions like "When did mommy meet daddy?" and "What happened on the day I was born?"
But of course it is not only adopted, children who lack such narratives. Those who do not live in conventional heterosexual families are also cut off from them. The normalization of the heterosexual family - mommy and daddy and baby makes three - does not describe the majority of families. If one narrative of family belonging - in this case traditional heterosexual - is treated as the only valid one, it cuts off other possibilities for other stories of how one becomes a family and belongs to a family. Thus, the very argument that adoption is foundationally traumatic shuts down possibilities that would allow adopted children to tell different family stories and be part of different kinds of families. The argument itself becomes exclusionary.
In my own writing on adoption, I have emphasized the importance of what I call the "imaginary domain," both within the United States and in the context of international adoption. The imaginary domain is an aesthetic idea that represents the psychic and moral space individuals need in order to come to terms with the complex identifications all of us face in our relationships with our family, our sexuality, and our national and linguistic identities.
One way of trying to facilitate the protection of an adopted child's imaginary domain is through open adoption, in which the biological mother or parents and the adoptive family know each other. However, open international adoption is very difficult; some of the countries that still allow international adoption either do not have records of the birth parents or have laws and practices that prevent access to the birth parents. There is also a deeper problem. Many of the countries that allow adoption are at times unable to control the privatization of adoption, with the result that some orphanages end up in the hands of mafias. This raises the specter of children who, if they have not been outright stolen, have in some way or another been coercively removed from their family of origin.
In 2009, Madonna was caught in a legal battle in which some members of the family the second child she adopted from Malawi claimed that they had not truly chosen to put their child up for adoption. In a country struggling with a weak or collapsed economy, it is often difficult to maintain the line between legal adoption and trafficking. It is not surprising, then, that many countries, as they attempt to constitute themselves as independent powers in the global economy, outlaw international adoption altogether, as a signal to the world that they want to take matters of intergenerational relationships into their own hands. For example, China, which used to be one of the most sought-after countries by the adoption agencies of the United States, has now drastically limited international adoption to the Global North. Indeed, one country after another has limited or shut down adoption to countries in the Global North over the last 10 years.
How, then, do we confront the reality that some countries from which children have been adopted are now ferociously opposed to international adoptions, for the reasons given above? And what does it mean that with some exceptions, international adoption is generally a one-way street from the Global South to the Global North?
Often those who adopt children from the Global South are hailed as saviors of children from countries that have fallen into hell, on the grounds that those children were unlikely to grow up to lead meaningful lives, or even to physically survive. Adopting such children can seem like a humanitarian gesture, which allows the adopting parents to pat themselves on the back for "saving a life." Why is this humanitarian gesture problematic? After all, these parents are breaking out of the conception that an acceptable family involves members who look alike, are from the same culture, speak the same language, and so forth. Many parents have even insisted that their children have access to the culture and language of the country from which they were adopted. Such measures are of course extremely important if one takes seriously the literature on trauma and adoption that emphasizes that the break that occurs in a child's life when she or he is adopted be at least open to a meaningful narration, so that the child can begin to understand the complexity of her or his life. The need for this kind of narration is basic to what I have called the imaginary domain, and if it is denied, the psychic life of the child can be rendered fragile.
Of course, such measures are to be applauded as attempts to protect the imaginary domain. But they cannot entirely escape the underlying narrative that children from the Global South are better off if they are removed from those countries to the more "developed" world of Europe and the United States.
As an adoptive mother, I have had to think about my own responsibilities towards an adopted child from Paraguay, who, by all signs at the time, would not have survived if I had not adopted her. The way I think of it now is that my own action was what the literary theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has called an "enabling violation." I enabled my daughter's life by adopting her, but in another sense it was a violation for my daughter, who was uprooted from her home, her language and her country of birth. I may have violated the people of Paraguay by participating in an adoption process that the vast majority of Paraguayans deeply disapproved of and ultimately sought to end. I have of course tried to make sure that my daughter always knew the story, not only of her adoption, but of what I could gather of her birth mother's decision. But I will never feel at ease until my daughter and I visit her birth mother and hear it directly from her.
There is no easy way in which the adopted child's imaginary domain can be facilitated, although dual citizenship seems to be a minimum guarantee to adopted children, so that they can return to their country of birth if they so desire. Ultimately, international adoption is profoundly implicated in relations of inequality that cannot be addressed on the basis of one family alone. Perhaps, then, if we at least recognize international adoption as an enabling violation, we can avoid the worst kinds of self-righteous humanitarianism, and find ourselves pointed towards a struggle for a more just world.

HEADLINE: Events Erode Hope of a Tax Overhaul Before Election Day

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Even in good times, tax reform poses steep political challenges. And these aren't exactly good times. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Even in good times, tax reform poses steep political challenges. And these aren't exactly good times.
That helps explain the angst among advocates of revamping the tax code as they have watched events erode their hopes of near-term success on Capitol Hill. The escalating tax debate among Republican presidential candidates ensures the issue won't go away, but it also means any resolution will probably wait until after Election Day 2012.
For a moment earlier this year, a breakthrough on taxes seemed possible.
President Obama saw an opportunity to repair fractured relations with corporate America, business leaders sensed a potential remedy for their core grievance with Washington on economic policy, and Congressional Republicans saw a rare chance to persuade the administration to cooperate on a central piece of their agenda.
Taken together, there was potential for addressing two big sources of voter discontent: the budget deficit (by bringing in more revenue) and the weak economy (by spurring growth).
Yet the same forces that have divided Washington on other issues have bogged down this one, too. 
The White House still hasn't released its long-planned "white paper" on corporate tax changes, and doesn't plan to for at least another month.
The corporate tax plan soon to be released by Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, will amount to a draft to spur discussion.
And prospects for the sweeping individual and corporate tax changes presented by the Simpson-Bowles presidential advisory commission fizzled along with the "grand bargain" on deficit reduction that Mr. Obama sought with the House speaker, John A. Boehner.
"Passage is at least two years out from the start of a serious process," said Michael F. Mundaca, until recently the top tax policy official at the Treasury Department.
A serious process, he added, hasn't begun.
 No Momentum
It looked serious when the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, at Mr. Obama's direction, began talks with business leaders in January on a corporate tax overhaul. His goal was to reduce the 35 percent top rate without widening the deficit, which meant eliminating tax provisions benefiting specific industries.
But those discussions didn't produce enough consensus to build momentum. Two of the main tax breaks under reconsideration - for depreciation and production of goods within the United States - would both hit domestic manufacturing.
Resistance from manufacturers underscored the range of political landmines at the time. Now, the Occupy Wall Street movement, by dramatizing income inequality and taking aim at "corporate greed," has added new ones.
Mr. Mundaca, who now works for the accounting firm Ernst & Young, anticipated a withering public reaction to tax change options that would put the manufacturing sector at a disadvantage:
"Who are the winners? Multinationals, high tech, pharmaceuticals and Wall Street. Who are the losers? People who make stuff in the U.S.
"People are going to say, 'You're nuts. Why did you even come out with this?' " Mr. Mundaca concluded.
Conservative economists see an excellent reason: that cutting corporate rates would make America's system more internationally competitive and jump-start growth. Because doing so would increase economic activity, Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute argued, Congress could cut the top corporate rate to 30 percent from 35 percent without eliminating tax breaks or losing revenue at all.
Using that supply-side reasoning, Republicans on the special Congressional deficit reduction committee have promoted tax reform as a source of revenue, which Democrats are demanding as part of any compromise.
 Arguing Over Methods
But Democrats reject the "dynamic scoring" methods that supply-side economists rely on to estimate revenue gains (as do Congressional tax experts in their official analyses of legislative proposals). Like the Simpson-Bowles commission, Democrats insist that additional revenue from tax reform be calculated without using them.
Which is precisely what led Mr. Boehner, hamstrung by his balky Republican caucus, to abandon compromise talks with Mr. Obama this summer.
That places the tax reform debate, like the broader deficit discussion, in the polarizing jet stream of the 2012 campaign. So as Mr. Obama takes aim at "millionaires and billionaires," Republicans are pursuing the longstanding conservative aim of lightening tax burdens on the owners of capital.
Herman Cain's "9-9-9" plan would eliminate capital gains taxes while cutting individual and corporate rates. This week, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas will unveil a single-rate plan for individuals and corporations. Both directly challenge the spirit of Occupy Wall Street.
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is girding for a "fairness" debate with Mr. Obama next fall, and so he has moved more cautiously. He would cut the corporate rate to 25 percent but eliminate capital gains taxes only for those earning under $200,000.
As voters grow ever angrier with Washington, the White House and Congress still have a year to fashion an unlikely tax deal - just as President Bill Clinton and Republican lawmakers compromised on welfare reform in 1996. But that would require Republicans to snatch an issue from their 2012 nominee, and potentially hand a victory to a vulnerable Democratic president.
Mr. Mundaca has a word for what could make that happen: "Miracles."

HEADLINE: 7 Billion

BYLINE: By JOEL E. COHEN. 
Joel E. Cohen, a mathematical biologist and the head of the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University and Columbia University, is the author of ''How Many People Can the Earth Support?''

 BODY:
ONE week from today, the United Nations estimates, the world's population will reach seven billion. Because censuses are infrequent and incomplete, no one knows the precise date -- the Census Bureau puts it somewhere next March -- but there can be no doubt that humanity is approaching a milestone.
The first billion people accumulated over a leisurely interval, from the origins of humans hundreds of thousands of years ago to the early 1800s. Adding the second took another 120 or so years. Then, in the last 50 years, humanity more than doubled, surging from three billion in 1959 to four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987 and six billion in 1998. This rate of population increase has no historical precedent.
Can the earth support seven billion now, and the three billion people who are expected to be added by the end of this century? Are the enormous increases in households, cities, material consumption and waste compatible with dignity, health, environmental quality and freedom from poverty? 
For some in the West, the greatest challenge -- because it is the least visible -- is to shake off, at last, the view that large and growing numbers of people represent power and prosperity.
This view was fostered over millenniums, by the pronatalism of the Hebrew Bible, the Roman Empire, the Roman Catholic Church and Arab thinkers like Ibn Khaldun. Mercantilists of the 16th through the 18th centuries saw a growing population as increasing national wealth: more workers, more consumers, more soldiers. Enlarging the workforce depressed wages, increasing the economic surplus available to the king. ''The number of the people makes the wealth of states,'' said Frederick the Great.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pronatalism acquired a specious scientific aura from social Darwinism and eugenics. Even today, some economists argue, incorrectly, that population growth is required for economic growth and that Africa is underpopulated.
This view made some sense for societies subject to catastrophic mortality from famines, plagues and wars. But it has outlived its usefulness now that human consumption, and pollution, loom large across the earth.
Today, while many people reject the equation of human numbers with power, it remains unpalatable, if not suicidal, for political leaders to admit that the United States and Europe do not need growing populations to prosper and be influential and that rich countries should reduce their rates of unintended pregnancy and help poor countries do likewise. With the globalization of work, the incentive for owners of capital today to ignore or not address rapid growth in the numbers of poor people remains as it was for the kings of yore: lower wages for workers at any level of skill offer a bigger economic surplus to be captured.
But just as pronatalism is unjustified, so are the dire -- and discredited -- prophecies of Thomas Malthus and his followers, who believed that soaring populations must lead to mass starvation.
In fact, the world is physically capable of feeding, sheltering and enriching many more people in the short term. Between 1820, at the dawn of the industrial age, and 2008, when the world economy entered recession, economic output per person increased elevenfold.
Life expectancy tripled in the last few thousand years, to a global average of nearly 70 years. The average number of children per woman fell worldwide to about 2.5 now from 5 in 1950. The world's population is growing at 1.1 percent per year, half the peak rate in the 1960s. The slowing growth rate enables families and societies to focus on the well-being of their children rather than the quantity.
Nearly two-thirds of women under 50 who are married or in a union use some form of contraception, which saves the lives of mothers who would otherwise die in childbirth and avoids millions of abortions each year -- an achievement that people who oppose and people who support the availability of legal abortions can both celebrate.
But there is plenty of bad news, too. Nearly half the world lives on $2 a day, or less. In China, the figure is 36 percent; in India, 76 percent. More than 800 million people live in slums. A similar number, mostly women, are illiterate.
Some 850 million to 925 million people experience food insecurity or chronic undernourishment. In much of Africa and South Asia, more than half the children are stunted (of low height for their age) as a result of chronic hunger. While the world produced 2.3 billion metric tons of cereal grains in 2009-10 -- enough calories to sustain 9 to 11 billion people -- only 46 percent of the grain went into human mouths. Domestic animals got 34 percent of the crop, and 19 percent went to industrial uses like biofuels, starches and plastics.
Of the 208 million pregnancies in 2008, about 86 million were unintended, and they resulted in 33 million unplanned births. And unintended births are not the whole problem. Contraceptives have been free since 2002 in Niger, where the total fertility rate -- more than seven children per woman in mid-2010 -- was the world's highest. Women in Niger marry at a median age of 15.5, and married women and men reported in 2006 that they wanted an average of 8.8 and 12.6 children, respectively.
Human demands on the earth have grown enormously, though the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents are no bigger now than they were when humans evolved. Already, more than a billion people live without an adequate, renewable supply of fresh water.
About two-thirds of fresh water is used for agriculture. Over the coming half century, as incomes rise, people will try to buy agricultural products that require more water. Cities and industries will demand more than three times as much water in developing countries. Watershed managers will increasingly want to limit water diversion from rivers to maintain flood plains, permit fish to migrate, recycle organic matter and maintain water quality.
Water shortages are projected to be significant in northern Africa, India, China, parts of Europe, eastern Australia, the western United States and elsewhere. Climate changes will increase the water available for agriculture in North America and Asia but decrease it in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Similar stories could be told about land, overfishing and carbon and nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere.
Where is this taking us? The coming half century will see huge shifts in the geopolitical balance of numbers, further declines in the number of children per woman, smaller but more numerous households, an increasingly elderly population, and growing and more numerous cities.
The United Nations Population Division anticipates 8 billion people by 2025, 9 billion by 2043 and 10 billion by 2083. India will have more people than China shortly after 2020, and sub-Saharan Africa will have more people than India before 2040.
In 1950, there were nearly three times as many Europeans as sub-Saharan Africans. By 2010, there were 16 percent more sub-Saharan Africans than Europeans. By 2100, according to the Population Division, there will be nearly five sub-Saharan Africans for every European.
In some ways, the growth in the numbers of people matters less than the growth in the numbers of households. If each household has its own refrigerator, air-conditioner, TV and car, the average energy demand for a given number of people goes up as the average number of people in a household goes down.
The urban population of developing countries is expected to grow by a million people every five days through at least 2030, while the rural population falls. Many cities will eat into prime agricultural land unless they grow in density, not extent. And nearly half of urban population growth by 2015 will occur in cities of fewer than half a million people.
The coming revolution in aging is well under way in the more developed countries. It will go global in the next half century. In 1950, for each person 65 and older, there were more than six children under 15. By 2070, elderly people will outnumber children under 15, and there will be only three people of working age (15 to 64) for every two people under 15 or 65 and older. Pressures to extend the ''working age'' beyond 65 will grow more intense.
Is economic development the best contraception? Or is voluntary contraception the best form of development? Does the world need a bigger pie (more productive technologies) or fewer forks (slower population growth through voluntary contraception) or better manners (fewer inequities, less violence and corruption, freer trade and mobility, more rule of law, less material-intensive consumption)? Or is education of better quality and greater availability a key ingredient of all other strategies?
All these approaches have value. However much we would like one, there is no panacea, though some priorities are clear: voluntary contraception and support services, universal primary and secondary education, and food for pregnant and lactating mothers and children under 5.
These priorities are mutually reinforcing, and they are affordable. Providing modern family planning methods to all people with unmet needs would cost about $6.7 billion a year, slightly less than the $6.9 billion Americans are expected to spend for Halloween this year. By one estimate, achieving universal primary and secondary education by 2015 would cost anywhere from $35 billion to $70 billion in additional spending per year.
IF we spend our wealth -- our material, environmental, human and financial capital -- faster than we increase it by savings and investment, we will shift the costs of the prosperity that some enjoy today onto future generations. The mismatch between the short-term incentives that guide our political and economic institutions and even our families, on one hand, and our long-term aspirations, on the other, is severe.
We must increase the probability that every child born will be wanted and well cared for and have decent prospects for a good life. We must conserve more, and more wisely use, the energy, water, land, materials and biological diversity with which we are blessed.
Henceforth we need to measure our growth in prosperity: not by the sheer number of people who inhabit the earth, and not by flawed measurements like G.D.P., but by how well we satisfy basic human needs; by how well we foster dignity, creativity, community and cooperation; by how well we care for our biological and physical environment, our only home.

HEADLINE: Victory Exalts a New Master of Manchester

BYLINE: By KABIR CHIBBER

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, England -- The sign said ''Old Trafford welcomes supporters of Manchester City,'' but in the stadium, it did not feel that way.
The City supporters in blue trying to get into the east stand of Manchester United's stadium before Sunday's game were separated by a wall of security and horse-mounted police before being greeted by sniffing dogs and airport-style pat-downs. Still, their spirits were high.
''Top of the league!'' they shouted. ''And that's a fact!'' 
City made the case emphatically on the field, too. City handed United its worst home defeat since 1955, a 6-1 drubbing that showed that City fans were right to believe the balance of power in the city had shifted. As United Manager Alex Ferguson told The Associated Press, ''I can't believe the score line.''
If City wanted to prove it has what it takes to win the Premier League, it could not have done it better than humiliating its most bitter rival. City now leads United by 5 points in the standings.
''People called us noisy neighbors, and here we are,'' City's Micah Richards said after the match. ''This victory is what dreams are made of.''
City is based in the northeast part of Manchester and United on the south side, but they are separated by only four miles. It is a subway series for a city too small to have a subway.
Always claiming to be the true representatives of Manchester, City supporters endured years of misery while United turned into one of the most famous sports teams in the world.
''Sometimes we were so bad, you thought you could get a game yourself,'' said Eric Hamill, 54, a longtime City fan clad in a light blue jersey. ''But the fans never wavered.''
After an infusion of oil money from Abu Dhabi, a revitalized City went into this match, the 161st meeting of the two clubs since 1881, with confidence.
''They are top of the league,'' Ferguson said before the match. ''We have to do something about it.''
The controversial Italian striker Mario Balotelli scored after 22 minutes, placing the ball in the corner of the net after combining with James Milner and David Silva. Balotelli, playing a day after he was forced to flee a blaze started by fireworks in his home, quickly pulled up his shirt to reveal the words ''why always me?''
The second half proved decisive. United defender Jonny Evans was shown a red card only minutes after halftime for pulling down Balotelli, and down to 10 men, United looked traumatized. Silva, Milner and Balotelli combined again to score City's second goal. Showing off the depth of its squad, City also had goals from two of its recent big-money signings: Sergio Aguero (one) and Edin Dzeko (two).
City has not won England's top league since 1968. In the 25 years that Ferguson has been in charge of Manchester United, he has won 12 league titles and 2 European Cups. This is only his second loss to City in the league at Old Trafford.
City was purchased by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan, a member of the royal family of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, in 2008 for $330 million. Since then, he has embarked on an extraordinary buying spree -- nearly $1 billion in investments -- to acquire the world's best talent.
City's trophy cabinet went untouched until last year, when it won the F.A. Cup -- after beating United on the way to the final. Most painfully, the win forced United supporters in the Stretford End of Old Trafford to take down a banner that had been a long-running gag mocking the length of time since City last won a major trophy. (It was 35 years.)
''I don't particularly like coming to Old Trafford because they tend to be arrogant after so many years of success,'' said Hamill, who attended the game with his 22-year-old son. ''They can't get their heads around the fact those days may well be over.''
At a nearby pub -- the Trafford -- United fans started the day taunting their City counterparts with chants.
But as the game went on, and the goals went in, the mood turned to disbelief, and then silence set in. For a few moments, all that could be heard were the words from the jubilant fans in blue. ''The city is ours,'' they sang, again and again.

HEADLINE: 2 Japanese Bankers at Heart of Olympus Fee Inquiry

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS; Hiroko Tabuchi and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For two decades, a pair of Japanese bankers toiled away in relative anonymity on Wall Street, hopping from firm to firm.
Now the two - Hajime Sagawa and Akio Nakagawa - are at the center of a growing firestorm over a mysterious $687 million payout by Olympus, the Japanese company that runs a lucrative medical equipment business and a less successful, if better known, digital camera business. The money has been described as a fee for advising Olympus on the 2008 takeover of a British company, the Gyrus Group.
But the fee amount was more than 30 times the norm on Wall Street. And it went, in part, to a tiny unknown firm run by Mr. Sagawa and Mr. Nakagawa, a review of public records shows. The bulk of the fee later went to a Cayman Islands company that also had ties to at least one of the men. After the deal closed and the fees were paid, both firms closed up shop.
The F.B.I. is now investigating the $687 million payment, according to two people briefed on the case. The focus of the investigation is not yet clear, and a spokesman for the F.B.I. in New York, James M. Margolin, declined to comment. 
''We are not aware of any investigation'' in the United States over the Gyrus deal, said Yoshiaki Yamada, a spokesman for Olympus in Tokyo. He said he could not comment further, including whether Olympus had been contacted by United States authorities.
During the last week, shareholders and analysts questioned why a public multinational company like Olympus would award such an outsize payment for advisory fees. According to securities lawyers and corporate governance experts, federal authorities will probably examine whether the steep fees point to deeper ties between Olympus and the bankers, or even kickbacks to Olympus officials involved in the deal.
''This is about following the money,'' said Jonathan R. Macey, a professor of corporate law and governance at Yale. ''It's very unusual and raises a classic red flag, pointing to either a waste of company assets or corruption.''
Olympus has said its payments were ''appropriate.'' On Friday, the company said it would set up an independent panel to examine its past merger payments - a week after the company fired its chief executive, who said he had questioned the eye-popping fee.
The firing of Michael C. Woodford, who is British, and his subsequent accusation that he was forced out because he planned to expose the fees, has rocked the company. Its shares have fallen 50 percent since Oct. 14. Many analysts have suspended their outlook for Olympus, saying the company's future had been thrown into disarray by the seriousness of the matter.
Olympus has been trying to recover since losing almost 115 billion yen ($1.5 billion) during the 12 months ended March 31, 2009. At the time, the loss was widely attributed to the effects of the global financial crisis, but it has now been linked to a sharp write-down in the value of three companies acquired earlier that year.
Mr. Woodford has raised questions about those acquisitions, saying Olympus paid $773 million for the three companies with no due diligence, and later wrote down 76 percent of their value.
Mr. Sagawa and Mr. Nakagawa have not been accused of wrongdoing, and they have no apparent ties to the three other deals. A lawyer for Mr. Sagawa did not respond to requests for comment. Efforts to locate a valid address or phone number for Mr. Nakagawa in Japan were unsuccessful.
The two Japanese bankers, according to interviews and regulatory records, appear to have first become colleagues in 1988 at Drexel Burnham Lambert, the investment house where Michael R. Milken helped pioneer the market for high-yield bonds. Over the years, the careers of the two Wall Street journeymen traced very similar paths.
Mr. Sagawa, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla., was traveling on Friday, but his wife, Ellen, came to his defense. ''My husband is a straight arrow,'' she said from the family's waterside home, which is assessed at $1.3 million.
Mrs. Sagawa said she met her husband in the 1970s, when she was teaching English in Japan. Mr. Sagawa, or Jim as he is known in America, was a young and rising star at Nomura, the Japanese securities firm.
Over the years, Mr. Sagawa climbed the ranks of finance, soon landing in New York at Drexel, then a much-envied firm that came to represent the Wall Street boom of the 1980s. Mr. Sagawa, according to court papers in an unrelated matter, earned $360,000 in his final year at the firm, a tidy sum in 1989.
At Drexel, Mr. Sagawa crossed paths with another up-and-coming banker, Mr. Nakagawa, who had started in the brokerage business at Merrill Lynch. The pair left Drexel in the spring of 1990 as it was falling apart.
Both men soon landed at PaineWebber, and departed after Mr. Sagawa was laid off in 1996, regulatory records show.
Mr. Sagawa toyed with the idea of retirement, but instead began a brokerage venture of his own, Axes America. He set up shop in Stamford, Conn., while also renting space in the Graybar Building overlooking Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.
Mr. Sagawa was finally his own boss, president and chief executive of Axes America, regulatory records show. Mr. Nakagawa, at least for a time, was chairman of the firm's global operations, according to an archived version of the firm's Web site.
''We have entered a major revolutionary period of the Japanese financial and securities industries in wave of deregulation and globalization,'' Mr. Nakagawa wrote on the Axes Web site. ''We sincerely hope that we can contribute to society and its prosperity through our customers' prosperity.'' The firm owed its name, Mr. Nakagawa said, to an aspiration to ''become the axes of global capital markets.''
For years, the two men ran a sleepy operation arranging private securities transactions and advising on mergers. Mr. Sagawa even found time to sail around the world. And in late 2002, Axes reconnected with its Drexel roots, organizing a conference in Tokyo that featured Mr. Milken, the former Drexel executive who pleaded guilty to securities law violations in 1990 and now runs an economic research institute.
In the United States, meanwhile, Axes generated mediocre revenue and hired only a handful of employees. In 2008, its final year, the firm reported a modest $8 million profit, according to a securities filing. During its years of operation, the firm generated sporadic business and never set off regulatory alarm bells.
Mr. Sagawa ''was a nice guy'' and ''he seemed O.K. to me,'' said Howard Spindel, a consultant who advised Axes when it opened its doors. By 2006, as the firm began to quietly fade into the annals of Wall Street, a lucrative opportunity presented itself.
An Olympus official familiar with Axes sought the firm's counsel. It is unclear who at Olympus made the gesture, and whether this person approached Mr. Sagawa or Mr. Nakagawa.
''We understand that members of the board may have had previous dealings with Sagawa prior to his involvement with Axes,'' said a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report that examined the relationship between Olympus and Axes using a trove of internal documents and letters. Mr. Woodford, the ousted Olympus chief, had commissioned the report earlier this year.
Under the guidance of Axes, Olympus was examining several targets, including Tyco, records show. Olympus later settled on a British medical device company, the Gyrus Group, agreeing to buy it for $2 billion.
The advice did not come cheaply. While Olympus agreed to pay Axes 5 percent of the deal's value, the contract was not truly capped at 5 percent.
The fee also included an unusual option for Axes to buy shares of Gyrus. ''An arrangement whereby a financial adviser received a mixture of cash, share options and warrants is surprising,'' the PricewaterhouseCoopers report noted, as advisers tend to be paid solely in cash.
The law firm Weil, Gotschal & Manges told Olympus in a 2008 document, recently provided to The New York Times, that cash payouts were preferable, but that an unnamed financial adviser ''strongly resisted the cash payment on the grounds that this will crystallize an immediate tax liability.'' Weil Gotschal only reviewed the options for paying the fee, not the legality of the fee itself. The unnamed adviser was apparently Axes.
While the report did not lay out possible motivations or describe the actions as ''improper conduct,'' PricewaterhouseCoopers added that ''given the sums of money involved and some of the unusual decisions that have been made, it cannot be ruled out at this stage.''
On Feb. 1, 2008, the Gyrus deal was officially done. Weeks later, on March 5, Axes notified American regulators it was shutting down, records show. Mr. Nakagawa stopped registering with American regulators even earlier, though he continued to represent Axes in Japan. The firm's lease in the Graybar Building in New York ran until April 2011, according to a securities filing, so Axes paid about $85,000 to end it. And with that, the 11-year-old firm disappeared, even as its stake in Gyrus continued.
Axes assigned its Gyrus shares to a new Cayman Islands operation with a somewhat similar name, Axam Investments, according to a securities filing. Details on Axam and its owners are fuzzy, but Mr. Sagawa signed documents as a director, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. No public records link Mr. Nakagawa to Axam.
Mr. Sagawa also ran an obscure firm in Florida, Sagawa Capital, which was in the business of ''proprietary investing,'' among other things, according to a filing with local officials.
Both Axam and Sagawa Capital drew little notice for two years. Then, in early 2010, Axam moved to unload its Gyrus shares, selling them to Olympus for $620 million.
Ultimately, Olympus spent $687 million on fees, or 36 percent of the value of the Gyrus deal, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. An adviser's fee typically amounts to about 1 percent.
''This is such an extraordinary deviation from normal fees,'' said Jeffrey Manns, an associate professor at George Washington University Law School who is an expert in securities law. ''No one would have entered into this transaction if they were showing good business judgment,'' he added, as most countries prohibit corporate boards from ''rubber-stamping'' such large fees.
After the payout in March 2010, Mr. Sagawa shut down his businesses one by one. In June 2010, Axam was removed from the Cayman Islands company registry ''for nonpayment of license fees,'' according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.
And by December, Sagawa Capital, too, was extinct.

HEADLINE: Shifting Attitudes on Global Warming

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Where Did Global Warming Go?'' (Sunday Review, Oct. 16) notes that Europe, Australia, China, India and Brazil are all moving ahead with policies to reduce heat-trapping pollution, while most American politicians duck the issue or actively question the reality of the problem.
Unfortunately, the article offers a sweeping -- and in my opinion wrong -- claim that Americans are just ''wired to be holdouts.'' Yes, Americans value personal freedom, but we also believe, by 71 percent to 28 percent, that the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to do its job of protecting us from dangerous carbon pollution, according to a CNN-Opinion Research Corporation poll. 
Yes, American cars and homes are larger, on average, than those in Europe, but we support stricter energy efficiency standards by 73 percent to 26 percent. And 76 percent of Americans trust scientists for information about global warming, while only 37 percent trust their member of Congress, according to researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities.
So perhaps the problem is not so much how Americans are wired, but rather how American politicians are wired to campaign cash from those with a vested interest in not accepting reality.
DANIEL A. LASHOF Director Climate and Clean Air Program Natural Resources Defense Council Washington, Oct. 18, 2011
To the Editor:
''Where Did Global Warming Go?'' describes the shameful fact that almost all Republican presidential candidates deny that man-made climate change is a serious problem. And President Obama has stopped talking about climate change.
As your article points out, political leaders in almost all other nations not only acknowledge that climate change is a serious danger but also are actively working to address it.
The Republican presidential candidates compete in their debates to show how much they believe in American exceptionalism. That America's politicians are virtually alone in the world in failing to act on climate change is indeed exceptional. But it is not an exceptionalism that Americans can be proud of.
SETH HEALD Rixeyville, Va., Oct. 16, 2011
To the Editor:
Your article concludes that global warming agnosticism is mostly an American thing. I disagree. Around the world, the opinion that global warming is a clear and present danger is much diminished. There is a realization that the case for global warming was uncertain at best, and certainly greatly exaggerated.
Global warming remains a hypothesis. At least in this one instance, the United States showed itself more prudent, and rightly more skeptical, than many. Politics has always been the plague of science.
CLAUDE ROESSIGER Wolfeboro, N.H., Oct. 16, 2011
To the Editor:
I wholeheartedly believe that stronger federal leadership is needed to change the United States' stance on climate change, but thankfully local officials aren't waiting for environmental legislation to come from on high. Instead, mayors from New Haven to Nashville are competing to be the greenest city with the best sustainability plans, have enabled smart-growth neighborhoods rather than sprawl, and have reduced local sources of emissions and pollution in the air and water.
President Obama need not look all the way to Europe to see sustainability in action, but to Washington. The city is now home to the country's largest bike share system, is the first to tax plastic bag use, is ranked second in public transit use for commuting and is ranked fourth among the country's largest metropolitan areas for green economy jobs.
DIANA LIND Philadelphia, Oct. 16, 2011
The writer is editor at large of Next American City magazine.
To the Editor:
American readers may get the impression that Australia's introduction of a carbon tax plan is indicative of a national embrace of environmentally progressive policies. In fact, the tax has been nothing if not controversial. The main opposition party, backed by an increasingly hysterical right-wing media, has virulently opposed the tax. As a result, the current government, a fragile coalition, has seen its political capital plummet.
The Labor Party now faces likely defeat at the next election. In these overheated times, American and Australian politics have this in common: take a stance to slow global warming and risk political suicide.

HEADLINE: Economy Casts Shadow on Advertisers' Forum

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Phoenix
THE annual conferences of the Association of National Advertisers are billed as gatherings for the ''Masters of Marketing.'' A question that remained unanswered after the 2011 conference, which was held here from Thursday through Sunday, was whether members were mastering the art of marketing during an uncertain economy.
The conference, which drew a record attendance estimated at 1,700, was the fourth the association has put on since the financial crisis began in September 2008. The 2008 and 2009 conferences were dominated by discussions of recessions, bailouts and even the Great Depression. The conference last year was more upbeat, though references to ''the new frugality'' and ''the pain of the economy'' were frequent.
This time, the speakers and their audiences seemed buffeted by crosswinds, relieved that the worst had not happened but worried about the sluggish pace of growth and continued high unemployment -- both of which are discouraging consumers from buying the products sold by the big national marketers that belong to the association. 
''Certainly, it's been a roller coaster of a year, with all the volatility,'' Stephen Quinn, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for the Walmart U.S. division of Wal-Mart Stores, told the opening general session. ''We're being disrupted, just like many of the people in this room.''
Although ''we're finally seeing growth coming back into our stores'' in this country, Mr. Quinn said, ''things are fundamentally different, and permanently different, with the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer.''
One major change is ''the hollowing out of the middle class,'' he added, which is creating ''the hourglass economy where our country is divided between the haves and the have-nots.''
''Seven of Wal-Mart's top 10 states have a higher unemployment rate than the national average,'' Mr. Quinn said, including California, Florida and Ohio, and shoppers are talking about ''adding water to their milk and taking half the dosage of their prescriptions.''
That is a reason ''why we brought back layaway'' plans, he added, which can help budget-minded consumers because ''you pay for something first and then you get it.''
Yet when ''so many people feel sour,'' Mr. Quinn said, Wal-Mart sees a need to ''reject negativity'' and project optimism. He offered a preview of a cheerful Christmas commercial, complete with a merry song, which carries the theme ''More joy for all.''
Some speakers, like Esther Lee, senior vice president for brand marketing and advertising at AT&T, did not mention the economy in their remarks. ''It's not that we're not conscious of it,'' she said later, in an interview, but ''we're not really seeing the same kind of impact'' as a Wal-Mart because so many consumers perceive telecommunications services ''as an essential part of life.''
Even so, Ms. Lee said, AT&T is ''always very conscious with our data plans of making sure there's something for everybody,'' and is ''looking down the road at device portfolios that fit different types of consumers.''
One speaker, Dana Anderson, senior vice president for marketing, strategy and communications at Kraft Foods, balanced a serious message with a humorous, offbeat style of presentation. For instance, at one point she used the expression ''blowing a dog whistle at the Humane Society.''
''We are living in a 'vuca' world,'' Ms. Anderson said, meaning one that is ''volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous,'' which is ''going to require from us a new set of skills.''
She urged the audience to be more flexible, to learn from experimentation and to be open to intuitive, rather than rational, solutions to problems.
Ms. Anderson also declared that ''mediocrity is exhausting,'' which drew loud applause from the audience, and described how it is ''so much fun to leap'' into the unexpected.
Several other speakers also suggested that a blessing of uncertain times is an increased willingness to take risks with bold ideas. Bryan Reese, senior vice president and chief marketing and innovation officer at Bolt-house Farms, talked about the success of an unorthodox test campaign for his company's baby carrots, which carried the theme ''Eat 'em like junk food.''
Consumers who stopped buying baby carrots to save money, or did not want to consider vegetables as snacks, were wooed with wacky ads that echoed ads for tortilla chips and chocolate along with vending machines that looked as if they sold junk food but were stocked with bags of baby carrots.
''We have traditionally been a very conservative organization,'' Mr. Reese said, but he advocated that his audience begin to ''think bigger'' because ''it can and does work.''
Antonio J. Lucio, global chief marketing, strategy and corporate development officer at Visa, said the only way to encourage growth was ''innovation,'' and to underline his point he repeated the word three times.
Mr. Lucio called his post ''the hardest job I've ever had,'' and said one reason was the introduction of a campaign, carrying the theme ''More people go with Visa,'' as the financial world reeled in 2008.
The theme turned out to be right for the times, he said, because amid the turmoil consumers perceived it as a reassuring message about ''safety in numbers.''
''It created a level of comfort and trust,'' he added.
In an interview after his speech, Mr. Lucio said that Visa had more recently been studying how ''the affluent segment in the United States is growing, growing very fast,'' even as economic conditions challenge other groups of consumers.
Visa also is looking at how the demand for travel services has remained strong, he added.
Andrew Robertson, president and chief executive of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, said he believed the ''tone of the conversation'' at the conference ''seems consistent with the results being reported quarter by quarter'' by many marketers, which have increased their sales and earnings despite the uncertain economy.
It makes sense, he added, if ''you make the distinction between the market and the markets.''
Asked if the conference had the right balance of discussion about the economy and other issues, Mr. Robertson, who was raised in South Africa and England, replied by paraphrasing a comment attributed to Lord Nelson, ''Either there are no ships, or we can't see them.''

HEADLINE: Slaughter of Horses Goes On, Just Not in U.S.

BYLINE: By A.G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
LINCOLN, Neb. -- The closing of the country's last meat processing plant that slaughtered horses for human consumption was hailed as a victory for equine welfare. But five years later just as many American horses are destined for dinner plates to satisfy the still robust appetites for their meat in Europe and Asia.
Now they are carved into tartare de cheval or basashi sashimi in Mexico and Canada.
That shift is one of the many unintended consequences of a de facto federal ban on horse slaughter, according to a recent federal government study. As the domestic market for unwanted horses shrinks, more are being neglected and abandoned, and roughly the same number -- nearly 140,000 a year -- are being killed after a sometimes grueling journey across the border. 
''When they closed the plants, that put more of a hardship on our horses than the people who wanted to stop the slaughter can imagine,'' said John Schoneberg, a Nebraska horse breeder who recently took in three horses from a nearby farmer who said that he was unable to pay for feed and would otherwise turn them loose.
The study's findings have been fiercely contested by animal welfare groups, which argue that most of the problems stem from the economic downturn and the high price of feed. The study also breathed new life into the long-smoldering battle over whether to allow the resumption of domestic horse slaughter or, alternatively, to prohibit the animals from being shipped abroad for their meat.
In recent weeks lawmakers have pushed Congress to take action in both directions. The Government Accountability Office, which conducted the study, concluded that either option would be better than the status quo, but advocates on both sides, while hopeful, said a resolution did not appear imminent.
''It's just a hot political issue,'' said Dr. Whitney Miller, a lobbyist for the American Veterinary Medical Association, which supports allowing horse slaughter. ''It's hard to see something definitive happening.''
The effect of the standoff has been deeply felt in rural states like Nebraska. Horse breeders and the owners of livestock auctions say that eliminating slaughter basically removed the floor for horse prices, allowing the market to collapse and forcing many out of the business. One reason, they say, is that owners are now forced to pay hundreds of dollars to euthanize and dispose of unwanted horses when they used to receive about that much to sell them to slaughterhouses.
This year, Nebraska became one of a number of states -- along with Arkansas, Montana, North Dakota and others -- that have pushed to resuscitate the dormant horse slaughter industry, which produced meat valued at an estimated $65 million a year before closing. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican, signed a law to take steps to regulate horsemeat at the state level that passed the single-chamber legislature, the Unicameral, with only one dissenting vote.
These efforts have been fiercely opposed by animal rights groups, which rejected as ridiculous the argument that horses would be better off if they could be killed for meat. Pointing to their own research, they say any increase in improper care for horses can be connected to the economy, rather than to the elimination of slaughter. And if prices have declined, they say, that is because the ban removed an incentive to overbreed horses.
Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, said that horse owners should commit to providing lifetime care for the animals. He said surveys had found widespread opposition to killing horses for their meat.
''Horses are different than cows and pigs in one very important sense, in that they are not raised for slaughter,'' he said.
But there is an enduring chasm in how horses are viewed.
''A horse, to me, is a livestock animal like a cow, sheep or a goat,'' said Orbie Bonnett, a Nebraska rancher who stopped selling horses after prices plummeted. ''A lot of folks nowadays look at a horse like a pet, like a dog or a cat. When you have a lot of money folk looking at this that way, well, there goes your slaughterhouses, there goes your market and there goes your horse folk -- they just can't make it anymore.''
The United States, much of it settled on horseback, has never really taken to eating horse except in times of need. But elsewhere, the meat -- lean and protein-rich -- is prized as a delicacy. Selling to a slaughterhouse has long been a way to make some money, to get rid of an old or unwanted horse no longer able to perform at a racetrack, show ring or ranch.
The last slaughterhouses for horses, in Texas and Illinois, closed after Congress stripped financing for federal inspections of horse slaughter in 2006, a move that effectively banned the sale of the meat. That year, only 105,000 horses were slaughtered domestically; 33,000 from the United States were slaughtered abroad. Last year, 138,000 or more were slaughtered abroad, according to government figures. (The population of horses in the United States is about nine million.)
''It's slightly hypocritical to allow these horses to be slaughtered anyway up in Canada or Mexico and not allow people here to get the income or serve the meat,'' said Hugue Dufour, a chef in New York who cooked horse while working in Canada.
Now owners have to pay to get rid of horses. Debby Brehm, director of the Nebraska Quarter Horse Association, spent $200 last month to euthanize a sick horse and $150 more for it to be hauled to a rendering plant. Other owners keep them but are unable to bear the thousands of dollars a year it can cost to feed and care for them. As a result, the sight of malnourished animals is familiar, Ms. Brehm said, and stories abound of horses abandoned on public and private land and even, in one audacious case, in someone else's horse trailer.
''You see a lot of malnourished and abandoned horses that probably would have been humanely slaughtered before,'' said Windy Allen, a horse trainer in the state.
Others say the ban is costing them money, too.
The Southeast Nebraska Livestock Auction used to sell about 100 horses every month, but now that may be the total for a year, said Dale Steinhoff, the owner. At Central Nebraska Packing, which used to slaughter horses but now buys more than one million pounds of horsemeat a year for sale to zoos, the meat is far more expensive when imported from Canada, said Lloyd Woodward, general manager.
And, even as they pay less, those who buy the animals for slaughter -- a group known as ''kill buyers'' -- say they are struggling to cover their costs.
''The Mexicans are getting rich off us,'' said Derry Mayfield, who buys about 40 horses a month and sometimes has them given to him for no cost. ''They're buying these horses cheap because they can. We have no other options.''

HEADLINE: Empty Fields Fill Urban Basins and Farmers' Pockets

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
BRAWLEY, Calif. -- Three generations of Al Kalin's family have worked their 2,000 acres of carrots and sugar beets, wheat and alfalfa for almost a century in the Imperial Valley, a scorching swath of Southern California desert that was unfit for farming until water from the Colorado River was diverted here in 1901.
But now Mr. Kalin and his brother enjoy a choice that their parents and grandparents never had. They can continue to farm all their land, or they can stop farming some of it and earn more than $500 an acre -- more than the market value of a crop like alfalfa in a given year -- simply by not using the water required to nourish those crops. Water saved is sent on to thirsty cities and suburbs to the west: San Diego, Los Angeles and Palm Springs.
With water increasingly scarce in the West, some other communities are allowing farmers to sell their allotment of it for whatever price they can find, in some cases thousands of dollars for the amount it takes to grow an acre of a crop. But this comes with a hitch. Working farms provide jobs and income to their many suppliers. There are 450 farmers in the Imperial Valley, but half the jobs held by the 174,000 residents are tied to agriculture. 
When land is idled, the communities around the farms can wither. Residents here point to the neighboring Palo Verde Valley, where farmers can sell more than a quarter of their water supply at much higher prices in a process they control. As a result, nearly a third of the agricultural land was not farmed this year; over time, businesses and workers have suffered.
Imperial's fear is that a century after Colorado River water allowed this land to be a cornucopia, unfettered urban water transfers could turn it back into a desert. So the deal that Imperial water managers struck limits how much water can be sold and for what price, and it controls how much acreage is enrolled in the program and for how long.
Many farmers, including the Kalins, have resisted the temptation to sell. ''There is something about that fallowing, it just doesn't sit well with my brother and I,'' Mr. Kalin said.
The Imperial Irrigation District, where they farm, controls more water than any other place in the West -- about 20 percent of the annual flow of the Colorado. ''It's built into the DNA here that water is a birthright,'' said Kevin Kelley, the irrigation district's general manager.
The chance to profit from water sales is an unsettling phenomenon here. Even though less than 5 percent of Imperial County's 500,000 acres of agricultural land has ever been idle at any given time, many residents believe that unrestrained water sales would unravel the fabric of the community.
Water sales began here in 2003, when, under pressure from the Department of the Interior, the ultimate authority over Colorado River flow, the irrigation district's board agreed to export 10 percent of its usual allotment, or just under 100 billion gallons, to cities over nearby dry mountains. Farmers had been accused of using water inefficiently, and the board feared being forced to forfeit water. The water sale was the largest recorded in the West.
To avoid an aquatic gold rush, rules were set. Farmers work through their water district and cannot negotiate directly with urban districts. Fields proposed for the program are selected randomly and can go out of production for only two years at a time.
Some Imperial Valley farmers objected to the restrictions and sued in state court, seeking direct control of their water. That suit is pending. These farmers know that the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which is called Met and serves 17 million people, is paying Palo Verde Valley farmers seven times as much for water than what Imperial farmers receive from their irrigation district. The board of the district in Imperial opposes any more water deals. But many worry that the cities will get their way eventually.
''If we ship any more water out, we've compromised our future,'' said Gary Wyatt, an Imperial County supervisor.
Mr. Kalin said: ''There was nothing here before the water was here. There will be nothing here after it's gone.''
The program to idle land started as an organized way to export the 10 percent. The water's price ranges from more than $200 to more than $500 per fallowed acre, though irrigating that same acre costs farmers far less. The district has not let the price go up, even as farmers see much higher prices paid elsewhere. The program is expected to end in 2017, when the cities' needs can all be met through conservation.
Stella Mendoza, the board's president, rules out selling more water but acknowledges the omnipresent pressure. ''There's no peace on the river,'' she said. ''Met is still after us.''
Farmers in Palo Verde, who deal more directly with Met, receive a one-time payment of $3,170 to enroll an acre in the program and about $600 each year it is left fallow. There, too, farmers hoped a deal would inoculate them from pressure to transfer even more water.
In the Palo Verde Irrigation District, farmers have the final say about their water's fate. In Imperial, the board of the irrigation district, elected by the whole community, has control.
''The problem with the Palo Verde deal is that it ignores all of the interests of everyone else in the community,'' said Robert Glennon, a law professor at the University of Arizona. '' 'It's my water, my money, and I don't give a darn about anyone else.' ''
Palo Verde officials counter that their deal with Met included $6 million for a fund to create jobs; the fund's director said it had filled about 60 by spending money to train truck drivers and invest in small businesses. As water flowed to the cities, things changed in Palo Verde. Wheat and alfalfa were cut back. An agricultural equipment dealership owned by Waymen and Carolyn Dekens closed in 2009; Mrs. Dekens blamed both water sales and the recession.
''Agriculture kept our business going,'' she said.
Another equipment supplier, Mike Hudson, said the program had helped him by preventing small-farmer bankruptcies.
Environmentalists say the Imperial water transfer has harmed the fast-shrinking Salton Sea, a briny lake that sits below sea level. Water irrigating farm fields drains into the Salton Sea; water sent to cities does not. Promises were made, but no money was set aside to mitigate the air pollution from the dust blowing from the widening shore.
This problem is one reason Imperial County's supervisors and others filed their own state lawsuit to undo the deal. They won the first round; the appeal will be argued next month.
Ralph Strahm, 54, a third-generation farmer, is one of 100 Imperial farmers to enroll in the program, signing up several parcels among his 4,000 acres. It works well for his business. ''It gave the land time to rest and gave us time to do improvements,'' Mr. Strahm said.
When crop prices are high, as they are now, he leans against leaving his land idle. He always grows winter vegetables like carrots and lettuce, which fetch the highest prices. But when the price for water-intensive alfalfa drops, he does the math. If he would earn, at best, $75 more per acre than if he left the land fallow, he decides that the risk and work are not worth the return and offers to leave it idle.
At most, only 18,000 of Imperial's 500,000 agricultural acres are in the program at the same time.
Mr. Strahm said he sensed his neighbors' disapproval. ''There's been some standoffishness,'' he said. But he would not hesitate to enter the lottery again.
One of the reasons some environmental groups favor an active and open market in water is that higher prices give farmers an incentive to conserve. Economists believe that markets will help fix the uneven distribution of water around the West and may prompt a rethinking of the whole system.
An expanding geothermal industry in Imperial needs more water. And there are new uses for land: solar-power businesses file proposals almost weekly. Mr. Kelley, the district's general manager, said that if the economy diversified, he could envision a future when water sales would be more palatable.
Mr. Kalin knows that eventually crop prices will fall and that it will look more appealing to leave land fallow. ''When times are bad or the banker is knocking on your door,'' he said, ''everything's different.''
But for now, the Kalins choose farming.

HEADLINE: Personal Eco-Concierges Ease Transition to Green

BYLINE: By JENNIFER A. KINGSON

 BODY:
They will run your errands by bicycle, recommend a spa that gives vegan manicures or buy organic clothes for you and your dog. They will even book you a dream vacation and buy the appropriate carbon offsets.
Green living is just so much easier when you have your own personal environmental concierge.
''The problem with going green is that people think it takes so much work, so much effort, so much conscious decision-making,'' said Letitia Burrell, president of Eco-Concierge NYC, a year-old business in Manhattan that tries to make it easy for people to rid their homes of toxins, hire sustainable-cuisine chefs and find organic dry cleaners.
Memberships range from $175 a month to $3,500 a year, depending on the level of service. Or you can opt for a la carte service at $25 to $50 an hour. 
It is a niche business, but a clever one. At least a half-dozen services of this type have sprung up around the country in recent years, both to help time-starved consumers manage their lives and to assuage the guilt of those who worry that they are letting the planet down.
''There are people who come to us gung-ho and they want to make a sweeping lifestyle change,'' said P. Richelle White, who left a corporate advertising job four years ago to start Herb'n Maid, a green cleaning and concierge service in St. Louis. ''These are busy professionals who don't have the time to do the research themselves about different products and services.'' Ms. White charges $39 for the first hour and $29 an hour subsequently; she was considering introducing monthly subscriptions.
Personal concierge services originated in hotels but made the leap to people's homes in the last decade or so, said Katharine C. Giovanni, who runs an industry trade group, the International Concierge and Lifestyle Management Association.
''The green idea, that's really taking off,'' Ms. Giovanni said. And in a bad economy, she said, a concierge service is an ''excellent home-based business to start up for people who have been liberated from their companies.''
Clients generally come to eco-concierges for a specific reason, say, to help rid their apartment of clutter or set up a pristine nursery for a new baby, and then gradually get excited about other possibilities.
Tracy Stamper, a fitness instructor in St. Louis, hired Herb'n Maid a few years ago for green cleaning after products used by a conventional service aggravated her husband's asthma. That set her on a slippery green slope. Ms. White referred her to a hairstylist, within walking distance, who would color her hair with natural dyes. Instead of using Drano to unclog bathtubs, Herb'n Maid gave her a less harsh product.
Then Ms. Stamper's husband bought a solar-powered fan for the attic; the neighbors wanted one, too. Next up for the Stampers may be switching to organic clothing made with no chemical dyes or pesticides.
''My husband and I both look for ways to up the ante,'' Ms. Stamper said.
The concierge companies say they vet the vendors they work with, sending out questionnaires, checking on eco-certification status and meeting with them directly. Amy Mayfield, who runs Eco-Modern Concierge in Houston, said she was ''pretty hard core'' about minimizing her own carbon footprint and was constantly researching the best ways to go about it.
She runs her clients' light errands on a Vespa scooter, takes cloth grocery bags to do their shopping and takes their leftover food to homeless shelters. When she is hired for pet care, the treats are vegan and homemade and the toys are made from recycled materials.
Do such small steps add up to a larger difference? Some climate experts say not really, explaining that only nations and industries have the collective might to dial back global warming.
''The changes necessary are so large and profound that they are beyond the reach of individual action,'' Gernot Wagner, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a recent New York Times Op-Ed article.
Eco-concierges see it their way -- that every contribution counts.
''We want to take baby steps with our clients, so it's not, 'Oh, I have to change everything in the house,' '' said Leeann Brzozowski, the owner of QiLiving in Manhattan.
There are no guilt trips. Ms. Brzozowski recommends buying carbon offsets, using low-emission cars, and drinking organic coffee in reusable mugs -- but clients are free to do as they please.
One steady customer is Adrienne Smith, who runs a tour bus company, Harlem Hip-Hop Tours, from her home on the Upper West Side. Under Ms. Brzozowski's tutelage, Ms. Smith redecorated her apartment with nontoxic paint, replaced her vinyl shower curtain with linen and switched to more expensive recycled paper for her printer.
But last December, when she asked Ms. Brzozowski to plan her birthday party, Ms. Smith knew what she wanted: a not-so-green affair with 50 to 80 people at a hot club with an open bar and a hip-hop deejay.
''She doesn't bombard you with, 'You have to do something green,' '' Ms. Smith said of her concierge.
For those who successfully court the wealthy, there is money to be made. Carrie Starner-Keenan, a concierge in San Francisco who used to work in estate management, said her clients tended to be people with huge properties.
''I'm currently on the way to a client with three homes, one of them a 10,000-square-foot beach house,'' she said in an interview from her car. ''I'm changing all the pesticides and cleaning products, changing all the light bulbs, setting up systems and manuals for the staff.'' Her hourly rate starts at $75.
She even put her instruction manuals on computer disks for future household help.
''To be perfectly honest with you, it's their staff that is working with making the changes and having to transition into different cleaning products,'' Ms. Starner-Keenan said. ''The top 2 percent of wealth, they're not going to have to make the sacrifice.''
Because their services are labor-intensive, the concierges say, they do not take on too many customers at a time. Ms. Burrell of Eco-Concierge said she had about 10 clients who were monthly subscribers, four of whom paid for ''elite'' memberships. ''We can't spread ourselves too thin,'' she said.
Pauletta Brooks, a jewelry designer in Chelsea, bought two hours of Ms. Burrell's time and used it to help set up a storefront on Etsy.com to sell her work.
''I was pleased with the help I got,'' she said, ''but I don't quite get the 'eco' part of it. You're not really saving energy, because you're just paying someone else to use that energy for you.''

HEADLINE: More Jobs Predicted for Machines, Not People

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
A faltering economy explains much of the job shortage in America, but advancing technology has sharply magnified the effect, more so than is generally understood, according to two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The automation of more and more work once done by humans is the central theme of ''Race Against the Machine,'' an e-book to be published on Monday.
''Many workers, in short, are losing the race against the machine,'' the authors write. 
Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business, and Andrew P. McAfee, associate director and principal research scientist at the center, are two of the nation's leading experts on technology and productivity. The tone of alarm in their book is a departure for the pair, whose previous research has focused mainly on the benefits of advancing technology.
Indeed, they were originally going to write a book titled, ''The Digital Frontier,'' about the ''cornucopia of innovation that is going on,'' Mr. McAfee said. Yet as the employment picture failed to brighten in the last two years, the two changed course to examine technology's role in the jobless recovery.
The authors are not the only ones recently to point to the job fallout from technology. In the current issue of the McKinsey Quarterly, W. Brian Arthur, an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute, warns that technology is quickly taking over service jobs, following the waves of automation of farm and factory work. ''This last repository of jobs is shrinking -- fewer of us in the future may have white-collar business process jobs -- and we have a problem,'' Mr. Arthur writes.
The M.I.T. authors' claim that automation is accelerating is not shared by some economists. Prominent among them are Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern and Tyler Cowen of George Mason University, who contend that productivity improvement owing to technological innovation rose from 1995 to 2004, but has trailed off since. Mr. Cowen emphasized that point in an e-book, ''The Great Stagnation,'' published this year.
Technology has always displaced some work and jobs. Over the years, many experts have warned -- mistakenly -- that machines were gaining the upper hand. In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes warned of a ''new disease'' that he termed ''technological unemployment,'' the inability of the economy to create new jobs faster than jobs were lost to automation.
But Mr. Brynjolfsson and Mr. McAfee argue that the pace of automation has picked up in recent years because of a combination of technologies including robotics, numerically controlled machines, computerized inventory control, voice recognition and online commerce.
Faster, cheaper computers and increasingly clever software, the authors say, are giving machines capabilities that were once thought to be distinctively human, like understanding speech, translating from one language to another and recognizing patterns. So automation is rapidly moving beyond factories to jobs in call centers, marketing and sales -- parts of the services sector, which provides most jobs in the economy.
During the last recession, the authors write, one in 12 people in sales lost their jobs, for example. And the downturn prompted many businesses to look harder at substituting technology for people, if possible. Since the end of the recession in June 2009, they note, corporate spending on equipment and software has increased by 26 percent, while payrolls have been flat.
Corporations are doing fine. The companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to report record profits this year, a total $927 billion, estimates FactSet Research. And the authors point out that corporate profit as a share of the economy is at a 50-year high.
Productivity growth in the last decade, at more than 2.5 percent, they observe, is higher than the 1970s, 1980s and even edges out the 1990s. Still the economy, they write, did not add to its total job count, the first time that has happened over a decade since the Depression.
The skills of machines, the authors write, will only improve. In 2004, two leading economists, Frank Levy and Richard J. Murnane, published ''The New Division of Labor,'' which analyzed the capabilities of computers and human workers. Truck driving was cited as an example of the kind of work computers could not handle, recognizing and reacting to moving objects in real time.
But last fall, Google announced that its robot-driven cars had logged thousands of miles on American roads with only an occasional assist from human back-seat drivers. The Google cars, Mr. Brynjolfsson said, are but one sign of the times.
As others have, he pointed to I.B.M.'s ''Jeopardy''-playing computer, Watson, which in February beat a pair of human ''Jeopardy'' champions; and Apple's new personal assistant software, Siri, which responds to voice commands.
''This technology can do things now that only a few years ago were thought to be beyond the reach of computers,'' Mr. Brynjolfsson said.
Yet computers, the authors say, tend to be narrow and literal-minded, good at assigned tasks but at a loss when a solution requires intuition and creativity -- human traits. A partnership, they assert, is the path to job creation in the future.
''In medicine, law, finance, retailing, manufacturing and even scientific discovery,'' they write, ''the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines.''

AFGHAN LEADER WOULD BACK
PAKISTAN IN CLASH WITH U.S.
Days after he stood with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and accused Pakistan of harboring his country's enemies, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan said his country would support Pakistan if it ever went to war with the United States. He appeared to be trying to reassure Pakistan of Afghanistan's friendship after months of increasing tensions between the neighboring countries, while also urging Islamabad to sever its ties to militant extremists.

QUAKE JOLTS EASTERN TURKEY 
At least 138 people were killed and about 350 were injured after a powerful earthquake struck eastern Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a news conference. The death toll was expected to rise, perhaps significantly, with many people reported to be stuck beneath dozens of collapsed buildings. The earthquake, measured at a magnitude of 7.2 by the Turkish seismic institute, occurred in Van Province, not far from the border with Iran. Page A4
JOINING THE FIGHT IN SOMALIA
Foreign military forces have joined the offensive against the Shabab militant group in Somalia as Kenyan troops advanced toward the rebel stronghold of Kismayu from two different directions, officials in Kenya said. A Kenyan military spokesman, Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir, said that ''one of the partners,'' possibly the United States or France, had been behind airstrikes in the past few days, killing a number of Shabab militants. Page A6
STAYING STRONG IN THE PACIFIC
Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said that despite hundreds of billions of dollars in expected cuts to the Pentagon budget, the United States would remain a Pacific power even as China expanded its military presence in the region. Mr. Panetta, who is on his first trip to Asia as defense secretary, made the comments at a meeting of Southeast Asian nations on this Indonesian resort island. Page A9

EX-GOVERNOR STILL POPULAR,
BUT LOUISIANA MOVES ON
Residents of Crowley, La. cheered for Edwin Edwards, the Grand Marshal at the 75th International Rice Festival. Mr. Edwards, who served four terms as Louisiana's Democratic governor and one 10-year sentence on federal bribery and racketeering charges, is still a popular figure in the community but last week voters went to their polling places and by a three-to-one margin voted to give Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal a second term. Page A12
FARMERS PAID NOT TO PLANT
In southern California, some farmers have been given an option either to farm all their land in a year, or stop farming some of it and earn more than $500 an acre -- more than the market value of a crop like alfalfa in a given year -- simply by not using the water required to nourish their crops. Water saved is sent on to thirsty cities and suburbs to the west: San Diego, Los Angeles and Palm Springs. Page A12
ECO-FRIENDLY ASSISTANCE
For people who worry they are letting the planet down, eco-concierges, for a price, can help make green choices, from beauty salons to household supplies. At least a half-dozen services of this type have sprung up around the country in recent years, both to help time-starved consumers manage their lives and to assuage the guilt of those who worry that they are letting the planet down.

TOUGH PRIVATE SCHOOLS
TRY TO LIGHTEN LOAD
The director of the high school at Dalton, a rigorous private school on the Upper East Side, sent a letter to parents this summer announcing that tests and papers would be staggered to make sure students did not become overloaded and January midterms would be pushed back two weeks so students would not have to study during vacation. Similar strategies are being adopted by other high schools to address student stress. Page A17

IN A GLOOMY ECONOMY,
SITCOMS MAKE A COMEBACK
Comedy has surged back this fall, elbowing past other genres to reclaim supremacy among viewers. So far this season, sitcoms occupy seven of the top 10 spots among entertainment programs (not counting football) in the category of most financial importance to network executives -- viewers between the ages of 18 and 49.

AFTER A LIFE OF OPERA,
A BROADWAY DEBUT
The ageless mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias had never heard a note of Stephen Sondheim's score for ''Follies'' when her agent first approached her about auditioning for the small, poignant role of Heidi Schiller. So when the show opened in September, after a run at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Ms. Elias made her Broadway debut at 82. Page C1
A BIBLICAL CELEBRATION
The Bush Theater in London is producing ''Sixty-Six Books,'' a collection of short plays, poems and songs, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible. The anniversary of the Bible -- a standard text among Protestants and a drawer filler in hotel rooms worldwide -- coincided with the 40th anniversary of the Bush, a respected theater company that focuses on early-career playwrights.

VICTORY OVER UNITED
CROWNS CITY AS MASTER
If Manchester City wanted to prove it has what it takes to win England's Premier League title, it could not have done it better than humiliating its most bitter rival in its own backyard. The win forced United supporters in the Stretford End of Old Trafford to take down a banner that had been a long-running gag mocking the length of time since City last won a major trophy.

HEADLINE: Kirchner Achieves an Easy Victory In Argentina Presidential Election

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Charles Newbery contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina cruised to re-election on Sunday, riding a wave of economic prosperity in her quest to continue the political dynasty begun by her late husband, former President Nestor Kirchner.
As recently as two years ago, Mrs. Kirchner had seemed a long shot to win a second four-year term. Her combative style, highlighted by a heated dispute over agricultural export taxes, sent her approval ratings below 30 percent. Economists predicted doom for the subsidy-heavy economic model first orchestrated by Mr. Kirchner to help the country recover from its economic collapse in 2001; rising inflation and accusations of doctored economic statistics clouded her prospects. 
But on Sunday, one year after her husband died of a heart attack, Mrs. Kirchner, Argentina's first elected female president, completed a remarkable political turnaround. With about 81 percent of voting stations tabulated, she was leading with about 53 percent of the vote, while her closest challenger, Hermes Binner of the Broad Progressive Front, had about 17 percent. The ample margin would be enough to avoid a runoff and be the widest victory since democracy was restored in 1983.
In a speech late Sunday in Plaza de Mayo, Mrs. Kirchner called for national unity and thanked the ''multitudes of young people'' who supported her.
The economy emerged as the central issue on voters' minds. By many measures Argentina is booming: the economy is expected to grow by 8 percent this year, the fastest growth in Latin America; employment has reached record levels; and the poverty rate has been cut by more than half since 2007, the government said. The country continues to benefit from heavy government spending, high commodity prices and strong demand from China for its agricultural products.
Still, by re-electing Mrs. Kirchner, 58, voters seemed willing to look past some troubling signs. Inflation has soared to over 20 percent in the past year, second only to Venezuela's among major Latin American economies, economists said. And the government has continued to govern with a heavy hand and little tolerance for opponents, including among the news media.
Opposition candidates tried to seize on those issues but gained little traction with voters.
''This election really seemed to defy the normal rules of politics,'' said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ''But that is what happens when things are going well in the economy and there is a dearth of alternatives.''
The Argentine government has continued to insist that the inflation rate is less than 10 percent, but the International Monetary Fund and private economists say the government data is unreliable. The issue has resonated less with voters because salaries have roughly kept pace with inflation, thanks to the Peronist government's tight relations with union chieftains.
Mrs. Kirchner, a former senator, was first elected president in 2007 with promises to continue the economic model employed by her husband, who steered the country out of financial collapse but decided not to run for re-election, supporting his wife's candidacy instead.
Mr. Kirchner had hewed to a strategy of keeping Argentina's currency, the peso, heavily devalued from its 1990s' levels, a move that made exports more competitive and spurred growth in manufacturing. But it also entailed subsidies for food and fuel and spending on social programs to win lower-income voters.
The Kirchners were a political power couple that drew comparisons to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Mrs. Kirchner's victory in 2007 spurred talk that the Kirchners would alternate as president for another 12 years.
With her emotional speeches and designer suits, Mrs. Kirchner appealed to the masses, especially the working classes, the power base her husband had built.
During her campaign in 2007, Mrs. Kirchner vowed to re-engage Argentina with the international community, which Mr. Kirchner had largely eschewed while in office. He cut off talks with the International Monetary Fund after Argentina defaulted on $95 billion in foreign debts.
But the promised detente did not materialize, and foreign investors stayed away, especially after signs emerged that the government's statistical agency was doctoring economic data, including the inflation rate.
As a result, Argentina has remained largely unable to borrow abroad, and it receives relatively little foreign direct investment, lagging behind Colombia and Peru and receiving less than half the amount flowing into Chile, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
''Argentina is kind of an outlier in the region -- a post-authoritarian, democratic government that has not embraced the principles of macroeconomic stability in the same way that Chile, Brazil and Uruguay have done,'' said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. ''That has been a huge disincentive to foreign investment.''
While Brazil's star has risen, Argentina's regional and international profile ''has diminished dramatically'' under the Kirchners, said Riordan Roett, the director of the Latin American program at Johns Hopkins University. ''They carry no geopolitical weight.''
Still, despite predictions that the economic model would collapse, the economy grew by 9.2 percent last year. Mrs. Kirchner's approval ratings began to climb even as the government accused the country's largest media group, Clarin, of bias and fined private economists who disputed official economic figures.
Then, in October 2010, when Mr. Kirchner, who had suffered from heart problems, died, an outpouring of sympathy followed and Mrs. Kirchner's approval ratings rose. She began to soften her public image, calling for unity and dialogue, a shift that won over more of the middle class, which had grown weary of the government's authoritarian style, said Roberto Starke, a political analyst in Buenos Aires.
Meanwhile, the opposition failed to unite behind a candidate. Rivals like Eduardo Duhalde, a dissident Peronist, and Ricardo Alfonsin, a senator and son of Raul Alfonsin, the first civilian president after the dictatorship, divided the anti-Kirchner vote.
''None of them could get any traction with the government's vulnerabilities -- corruption and cronyism,'' Mr. Shifter said.
As a result, the election became a referendum on the economy, analysts said.
Argentina's continued success relies on commodity prices remaining high and on strong demand from China and Brazil, but economists say those factors may soon be undermined by the global economic downturn. Growth is expected to slow to 4.6 percent next year, in line with the rest of the region, but inflation may remain stubbornly high, economists said.
''When the money runs out, there will be a political reckoning,'' said Karen Hooper, an analyst at Stratfor, a global intelligence company in Austin, Texas.

HEADLINE: Events Erode Hope Of a Tax Overhaul Before Election Day

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Even in good times, tax reform poses steep political challenges. And these aren't exactly good times.
That helps explain the angst among advocates of revamping the tax code as they have watched events erode their hopes of near-term success on Capitol Hill. The escalating tax debate among Republican presidential candidates ensures the issue won't go away, but it also means any resolution will probably wait until after Election Day 2012.
For a moment earlier this year, a breakthrough on taxes seemed possible. 
President Obama saw an opportunity to repair fractured relations with corporate America, business leaders sensed a potential remedy for their core grievance with Washington on economic policy, and Congressional Republicans saw a rare chance to persuade the administration to cooperate on a central piece of their agenda.
Taken together, there was potential for addressing two big sources of voter discontent: the budget deficit (by bringing in more revenue) and the weak economy (by spurring growth).
Yet the same forces that have divided Washington on other issues have bogged down this one, too.
The White House still hasn't released its long-planned ''white paper'' on corporate tax changes, and doesn't plan to for at least another month.
The corporate tax plan soon to be released by Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, will amount to a draft to spur discussion.
And prospects for the sweeping individual and corporate tax changes presented by the Simpson-Bowles presidential advisory commission fizzled along with the ''grand bargain'' on deficit reduction that Mr. Obama sought with the House speaker, John A. Boehner.
''Passage is at least two years out from the start of a serious process,'' said Michael F. Mundaca, until recently the top tax policy official at the Treasury Department.
A serious process, he added, hasn't begun.
No Momentum
It looked serious when the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, at Mr. Obama's direction, began talks with business leaders in January on a corporate tax overhaul. His goal was to reduce the 35 percent top rate without widening the deficit, which meant eliminating tax provisions benefiting specific industries.
But those discussions didn't produce enough consensus to build momentum. Two of the main tax breaks under reconsideration - for depreciation and production of goods within the United States - would both hit domestic manufacturing.
Resistance from manufacturers underscored the range of political landmines at the time. Now, the Occupy Wall Street movement, by dramatizing income inequality and taking aim at ''corporate greed,'' has added new ones.
Mr. Mundaca, who now works for the accounting firm Ernst & Young, anticipated a withering public reaction to tax change options that would put the manufacturing sector at a disadvantage:
''Who are the winners? Multinationals, high tech, pharmaceuticals and Wall Street. Who are the losers? People who make stuff in the U.S.
''People are going to say, 'You're nuts. Why did you even come out with this?' '' Mr. Mundaca concluded.
Conservative economists see an excellent reason: that cutting corporate rates would make America's system more internationally competitive and jump-start growth. Because doing so would increase economic activity, Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute argued, Congress could cut the top corporate rate to 30 percent from 35 percent without eliminating tax breaks or losing revenue at all.
Using that supply-side reasoning, Republicans on the special Congressional deficit reduction committee have promoted tax reform as a source of revenue, which Democrats are demanding as part of any compromise.
Arguing Over Methods
But Democrats reject the ''dynamic scoring'' methods that supply-side economists rely on to estimate revenue gains (as do Congressional tax experts in their official analyses of legislative proposals). Like the Simpson-Bowles commission, Democrats insist that additional revenue from tax reform be calculated without using them.
Which is precisely what led Mr. Boehner, hamstrung by his balky Republican caucus, to abandon compromise talks with Mr. Obama this summer.
That places the tax reform debate, like the broader deficit discussion, in the polarizing jet stream of the 2012 campaign. So as Mr. Obama takes aim at ''millionaires and billionaires,'' Republicans are pursuing the longstanding conservative aim of lightening tax burdens on the owners of capital.
Herman Cain's ''9-9-9'' plan would eliminate capital gains taxes while cutting individual and corporate rates. This week, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas will unveil a single-rate plan for individuals and corporations. Both directly challenge the spirit of Occupy Wall Street.
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is girding for a ''fairness'' debate with Mr. Obama next fall, and so he has moved more cautiously. He would cut the corporate rate to 25 percent but eliminate capital gains taxes only for those earning under $200,000.
As voters grow ever angrier with Washington, the White House and Congress still have a year to fashion an unlikely tax deal - just as President Bill Clinton and Republican lawmakers compromised on welfare reform in 1996. But that would require Republicans to snatch an issue from their 2012 nominee, and potentially hand a victory to a vulnerable Democratic president.
Mr. Mundaca has a word for what could make that happen: ''Miracles.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Panetta's Pentagon, Without the Blank Check

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tan and ruddy-faced, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta took his seat in a hearing room one morning this month ready for battle. The enemy, he warned lawmakers ominously, was ''a blind, mindless'' one that could ''badly damage our capabilities'' and ''truly devastate our national defense.''
Mr. Panetta meant not Al Qaeda, the Taliban or Iraqi insurgents, but a creation of Congress poised to inflict what he deemed unacceptable budget cuts on a Pentagon that, he admitted, had ''a blank check'' in the decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
''After every major conflict -- World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union -- what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep, across-the-board cuts that impacted on equipment, impacted on training, impacted on capability,'' he said. ''Whatever we do in confronting the challenges we face now on the fiscal side, we must not make that mistake.'' 
As President Obama's C.I.A. director, Mr. Panetta oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden last spring. Now as the president's new defense secretary, he is charged with closing the books on multiple fronts -- just last week, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was killed in Libya and the last American troops were ordered home from Iraq by the end of the year. But the biggest challenges ahead may be retrofitting the military for a new era of austerity and guarding Mr. Obama's national security flank heading into a turbulent election year.
''It is one of these watershed points,'' said former Senator David Boren, co-chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board. ''It's just like the end of the cold war when you're about to shift gears and we're going to have to reprioritize what we have to do.''
The daunting task has fallen on Mr. Panetta, a 73-year-old former civil rights chief, congressman, budget director and White House chief of staff whose career dates to the days of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Returning to Washington from his California walnut farm in 2009, Mr. Panetta knew little of fighting wars. What he did know was Washington institutions, a trait that made him a throwback to the so-called wise men commanding respect across party lines. Who else these days is confirmed 100 to 0 by the Senate?
But you don't get to 100 to 0 without compromise or evolution. The cold war dove who opposed Ronald Reagan's contra war in Nicaragua in the 1980s and George Bush's Persian Gulf war of 1991 has become a war on terror hawk, authorizing more drone strikes in Pakistan than George W. Bush.
The critic who denounced torture during Mr. Bush's tenure took office and argued against investigating whether it happened. The co-author of the Iraq Study Group report calling for withdrawing troops recently pressed to keep more troops there.
The careful positioning has made Mr. Panetta one subject on which Mr. Obama and many Republicans agree. ''I'm a Leon Panetta fan,'' said former Representative Pete Hoekstra, who is no Obama fan. ''He's fairly hawkish and aggressive on national security issues,'' agreed Representative Mike Rogers, the House intelligence chairman.
Representative Peter King, the homeland security chairman, said Mr. Panetta could have served ''the toughest Republican president, not just a Democratic president.''
How long that lasts, of course, remains uncertain. He is treading into dangerous territory as he searches for $450 billion in defense cuts over 10 years. If a new Congressional debt committee cannot forge a deficit-reduction agreement by Thanksgiving, Mr. Panetta faces what he calls a ''doomsday mechanism'' mandating an additional $500 billion in cuts.
The issues on the table are enormous -- the financial health of a debt-ridden country, military readiness to confront a still-dangerous world and many thousands of jobs and contractor businesses in Congressional districts around the country. The political crosscurrents are treacherous for a party so sensitive to its public standing on security that Mr. Panetta is the first Democrat to serve as defense secretary since 1997.
While Tea Party Republicans on Capitol Hill and some of the party's presidential candidates call for significant defense cuts -- a position that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago -- many Republicans still oppose slashing military spending.
Moreover, Mr. Panetta faces a kaleidoscope of interests within his own building, where officers have mastered the art of lobbying for their own programs, resisting cost-cutting lawmakers and wearing down defense secretaries. Will this time be different or has a war-weary electorate changed the dynamics?
''He's going to preside over some very tough decisions,'' said former Representative Jane Harman, a Democrat now directing the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ''Budget cutting done wrong could be devastating for our national security, so the stakes are huge.''
No one understands better than Mr. Panetta. ''The real test for the country, as well as for the administration,'' he said over a breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon in his Pentagon office, ''is going to be whether or not ultimately we can't deliver on trying to solve the economic issues, but also deliver on the issues that I'm involved with in terms of war and peace.''
The Five Rules of Panetta
To figure out how Mr. Panetta has survived so long in a town that chews up others, start by listening to him talk. He has a joyfully foul mouth. When he traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq last summer, he used 18 curse words in a single troop talk and caused a stir by telling Iraqis dawdling over a tough issue to ''damn it, make a decision.'' Asked about his candor by NBC News, Mr. Panetta said jovially: ''Hey, I'm Italian. What the frick can I tell you?''
If the salty language makes him earthy, it is the infectious laugh that has eased his way through 45 years of public life. When Pentagon stenographers transcribed a recent interview, they dutifully recorded ''laughs'' or some variation 33 times, plus four ''chuckles.'' He laughed his way through a guest judge stint on ''Top Chef,'' and during his Pentagon swearing-in joked about installing a seven-second delay in his microphone, ''but I can't imagine why the hell that would be necessary.''
Mr. Panetta's journey had its twists. A son of Italian immigrants from Monterey, Calif., Mr. Panetta came to Washington in 1966 as a Republican and became director of the Office for Civil Rights until his aggressive enforcement of desegregation prompted President Richard M. Nixon to fire him. Returning home, he switched parties and ran for Congress in 1976, rising to chairman of the House Budget Committee before being tapped as Bill Clinton's budget director and later chief of staff.
''He was a major contributor to the success that my husband had,'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an interview, recalling the deficit reduction package he helped negotiate that paved the way for a balanced budget. ''He is a problem solver, a strong leader and manager. He also calls it like he sees it.''
Jennifer Palmieri, a former longtime aide, said Mr. Panetta has a straightforward formula for survival in Washington. She has packaged them into what she calls The Five Rules of Panetta:
''You can't slam dunk anyone.'' Work with opponents.
''Any [expletive] can burn down a barn; it takes a leader to build one.''
''He who controls the paper controls the outcome.''
''Never let them see you sweat.''
''In a negotiation, take what you can get. And then come back for more.''
Those negotiating skills will prove critical as he guides another president on federal spending while jousting with other security agencies, including his former agency, the C.I.A., over a shrinking pie. ''He'll be particularly well suited to take on the budget challenges at the Pentagon,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
The decisions Mr. Panetta makes -- whether cutting an aircraft carrier, scaling back the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter or paring back expensive health care costs for active and retired service members -- could determine if the military can still fight two land wars simultaneously, confront new types of high-tech warfare and fulfill promises to those who risked lives for their country.
Pentagon critics argue deep cuts would simply trim bloat. Military spending has doubled since the Sept. 11 attacks, to $688 billion from $316 billion, with 1.4 million men and women currently in uniform. Even excluding the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the base budget has increased 78 percent in 10 years. Yet much of that growth has benefited districts of lawmakers torn between taming the deficit and defending jobs and businesses back home.
''That is where his contacts on the Hill will pay off,'' said Bruce Riedel, who led an Obama administration review of Afghanistan. ''But he's still going to have to tell the services that they'll have to do with less money.''
Surprise Pick for C.I.A.
If Mr. Panetta's warnings about defense cuts have won favor among generals, they fit a pattern of adapting to whatever institution he runs. He arrived at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2009 with little experience in spycraft, yet won over a building of people suspicious of outsiders.
Even Mr. Panetta considered himself a surprising pick to run the C.I.A. When John Podesta, who ran the Obama transition, called to broach the idea, Mr. Podesta recalled, ''I get cold silence. And then finally he said to me, 'You're kidding, right?' ''
Mr. Podesta initially considered him for deputy defense secretary, essentially heir apparent to the holdover secretary, Robert M. Gates. But Rahm Emanuel, then the incoming White House chief of staff, suggested the C.I.A., figuring Mr. Panetta could ''calm the place down'' after a decade of turmoil. ''I told the president it would be a risk because it wasn't what the Washington oh-so-wise people expected,'' Mr. Emanuel said from Chicago, where he is now mayor.
He was right about the reaction. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat and Senate intelligence chairman, called it ridiculous to appoint an intelligence novice. But she, like others, changed her mind as Mr. Panetta improved agency morale and rebuilt relations with Congress. ''It was a real revelation for me because I thought the C.I.A. had to be C.I.A.,'' she said.
Mr. Panetta wooed lawmakers with coffees, dinners and access. Last January, he hosted Mr. Rogers, the new Republican intelligence committee chairman, for chicken dinner and confided they might have found Bin Laden. Being brought into the loop made a difference. ''He would have had an ally had it gone bad,'' Mr. Rogers said.
Mr. Panetta, who in 2008 criticized Mr. Bush for turning America into ''a nation of armchair torturers,'' became a champion of the C.I.A. within the Obama administration. His advocacy of a truth commission vanished and he insisted on redacting legal memos authorizing harsh tactics. At various points, he took on the White House counsel, the attorney general, the director of national intelligence and the Democratic House speaker.
When Attorney General Eric H. Holder reopened investigations into whether C.I.A. officers had gone beyond the memos, Mr. Panetta protested in four-letter fashion. ''Leon had a different view and expressed this view to me in very candid circumstances,'' recalled Mr. Holder, who eventually dropped inquiries in all but two cases.
Those who saw Mr. Panetta as a reformer were disillusioned. ''It was so disappointing to me,'' said Ilana Sara Greenstein, a former C.I.A. officer and a vocal agency critic. ''I felt like early on he just became co-opted.''
George Brent Mickum IV, who represents the Guantanamo Bay detainee Abu Zubaydah, who was waterboarded 83 times, recalled Mr. Obama's campaign statements. ''He has essentially reneged on all of these promises,'' he said, adding that Mr. Panetta ''ran interference for those who potentially could have been accused of war crimes.''
Michael Morell, the deputy C.I.A. director, rejected the criticism. ''Believe me, the place did not co-opt him. He co-opted the place,'' Mr. Morell said. Mr. Panetta said re-examining the Bush era would be distracting. ''If I'd spent my time persecuting people for the past, I would have never been able to have gotten any traction to move forward with what I wanted to achieve,'' he said.
His tenure was capped by the Bin Laden raid. A friend, Ted Balestreri, co-owner of Monterey's Sardine Factory restaurant, had dared him to find Bin Laden, vowing to open an 1870 bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild, priced at $10,000, if he did. Four months later, Mr. Panetta called his wife, Sylvia, in California. ''Call Ted,'' he said, ''and tell him he owes me that bottle of wine.''
An Obvious Choice
That might have been the moment to go out on top. But Mr. Obama had one more assignment. Of 15 names Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser, presented to succeed Mr. Gates, Mr. Panetta was the obvious choice. ''What presidents really value is coming down on the issue, and Leon comes down,'' Mr. Donilon said. ''There's not a lot of 'on the one hand, on the other hand.' ''
Mr. Panetta was reluctant. He would be history's oldest incoming defense secretary. The walnut farm beckoned. ''I asked myself the same question -- why would he continue?'' Sylvia Panetta recalled. ''Leon is loyal. When the president asks, you do what you have to do.''
Mr. Panetta has not shown his hand about how he plans to transform the military or his vision for what war will look like in the future. But his very appointment signaled the growing integration of intelligence and armed forces. During his 28-month tenure at the C.I.A., Mr. Panetta authorized drone strikes about 200 times, underscoring the evolution of warfare.
In a world of diffuse threats -- rather than a cold war, he says America faces a ''blizzard war'' of myriad challenges -- Mr. Panetta is the one with his finger on the trigger. And nothing prepared this Catholic school student and antiwar liberal for ordering someone's death in the middle of the night.
''I suddenly realized at the C.I.A. that I had to make life-and-death decisions about people,'' he said on his plane heading to Afghanistan last summer. ''In many ways, it was life-and-death decisions about an enemy who we were confronting. In this job,'' he added, ''I have to make life-and-death decisions about our people.'' Either way, he said, ''I've said more Hail Marys in the last two years than I have in my whole life.''
A few weeks later, he flew to Dover Air Force Base to honor 30 service members killed in Afghanistan. In his office the next morning, Mr. Panetta was in a somber mood, recalling a father who lost his boy and thinking of his own son James, a Navy reservist who earned a Bronze Star in Afghanistan. ''You see those dreams that are kind of crushed,'' he said. ''And it brings home how big a sacrifice people make in war.''
Asked about inspirations, Mr. Panetta nodded toward portraits of Dwight D. Eisenhower and George Marshall. ''These two guys were always, you know, kind of heroes of mine,'' he said. ''So every once in a while, I turn around in that chair and look at them and say, you know, what the hell would you do?''
He laughed. ''The problem is,'' he said, ''they're not talking back.''

HEADLINE: Well-Known Felon Still Draws a Crowd, but Louisiana Has Moved On

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
CROWLEY, La. -- If the test of a first-rate intelligence, as F. Scott Fitzgerald claimed, is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time, there was the whiff of brilliance amid the scent of barbecue and fry-grease at the 75th International Rice Festival.
On Saturday morning, the voters here in Acadia Parish woke up, went to their polling places and by a three-to-one margin voted to give the Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, a second term, heartily endorsing his honor-student image and his tax-averse, avidly pro-business platform. That done, they came here to the parish seat to cheer on the grand marshal of this year's rice festival parade -- perhaps the country's most famous populist ex-convict and the last heir of Huey Long. 
''Most of the time I'm Republican,'' said Milton Trahan, a 61-year-old crane operator wearing an ''I Voted'' sticker. But, Mr. Trahan said, ''if he'd had his name on the ballot, he'd have won.''
Mr. Trahan was speaking of Edwin Edwards, a Democrat who served four terms as Louisiana's governor and one 10-year sentence on federal bribery and racketeering charges, and who had just taken the festival stage in front of the parish courthouse.
''As you know, they sent me to prison for life,'' said Mr. Edwards, who turned 84 in August but whose humor is still cornstarch-dry. ''But I came back with a wife.''
He had delivered that verse before, but it always got a laugh, as everyone knew of the wife: Trina Grimes Scott, whom Mr. Edwards married in July and who is 51 years his junior (a reality show about their marriage was in the works, but it seems to have been shelved).
In other appearances, Mr. Edwards had followed this line with far more ribald lyrics, but this was a family crowd. He ended with a few words in Cajun French.
The ceremonies at the rice festival in Crowley were only slightly less suspenseful than the election going on around the state.
Technically, Saturday's election was a primary, of the nonpartisan, everyone-against-everyone Louisiana variety. (Mr. Edwards instituted the so-called jungle primary system in his first term, a strategic move that backfired for the Democrats and earned him the wry nickname ''Father of the Louisiana Republican Party.'')
But for most races, a runoff was not going to be necessary. The Republican state treasurer ran unopposed, and most other Republican statewide officeholders, including Mr. Jindal, might as well have. There was a tight race between two Republicans for lieutenant governor; one of them won.
There are, to be sure, old Edwards allies who are still in power, like State Senator John Alario, the dean of the Louisiana Legislature. Of course, he switched parties and became a Republican last year. ''I think politics has passed him by,'' Mr. Alario said after a birthday roast of Mr. Edwards at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans this summer.
''What you saw were lots of elderly people,'' Mr. Alario said of the crowd at the roast. ''You didn't see a whole lot of youth there, other than his new wife.''
Indeed, populism in Louisiana these days is mostly of the Tea Party brand, and any politician who hopes to survive knows that wisecracks about political skullduggery or skirt chasing, no matter how well-turned, are to be uttered only in private. Political malfeasance became a lot less funny after Hurricane Katrina, and politicians who have been caught engaging in the bawdier sort of malfeasance, like Senator David Vitter, have survived by changing the subject, not joking about it.
''With the economy the way it is, it's hard to take a lot of this with a sense of humor,'' said C. B. Forgotston Jr., a longtime gadfly in state politics. ''I don't think we're back to the days when people don't want good government, they want good entertainment. It's just too expensive.''
Still, here on Saturday the booth selling ''Edwin Edwards President 2012'' T-shirts was doing a brisk business; the children's sizes were already sold out. Along the parade route, people held up ''EDWARDS GOVERNOR'' signs that someone had kept around for 20 years. Women clambered for autographs and men for handshakes.
Granted, Mr. Edwards first made his name in Crowley, beginning his political career with a race for the City Council in 1954. And everyone seemed to have a relative who had at one point been in Mr. Edwards's employ.
But it is more than just familiarity, explained Jacinda LeJeune, 49, who works at a steel company in Lake Charles (and whose uncle was once on Mr. Edwards's security detail).
She watched Mr. Edwards, who had bared his suspenders and shirtsleeves in the hot afternoon and was waving from the back of a convertible, and she pointed out how different he was from all the other politicians.
''We all knew he was going to steal,'' she said. ''But he told us he was going to do it.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Plan Stalled, Obama to Try New Economic Drive

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With his jobs plan stymied in Congress by Republican opposition, President Obama on Monday will begin a series of executive-branch actions to confront housing, education and other economic problems over the coming months, heralded by a new mantra: ''We can't wait'' for lawmakers to act.
According to an administration official, Mr. Obama will kick off his new offensive in Las Vegas, ground zero of the housing bust, by promoting new rules for federally guaranteed mortgages so that more homeowners, those with little or no equity in their homes, can refinance and avert foreclosure. 
And Wednesday in Denver, the official said, Mr. Obama will announce policy changes to ease college graduates' repayment of federal loans, seeking to alleviate the financial concerns of students considering college at a time when states are raising tuition.
The president's announcements will bookend a three-day Western trip during which he also will hold fund-raising events in the two cities -- both Nevada and Colorado are election battlegrounds -- as well as in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The ''We can't wait'' campaign is a new phase in Mr. Obama's so-far unsuccessful effort -- punctuated until now by his cries of ''Pass this bill!'' on the stump -- to pressure Republicans to support the job creation package he proposed after Labor Day. It comes after unanimous votes by Senate Republicans in the past week to block the plan; House Republican leaders have refused to put the measure to a vote.
Polls show overwhelming support for pieces of the $447 billion package, which includes expanded tax cuts for workers and employers, and spending for infrastructure projects and for state aid to keep teachers and emergency responders at work. But Republicans oppose provisions in Mr. Obama's plan that would offset the costs with higher taxes on the wealthy.
Should the bill ultimately fail, Democrats believe they at least have the better political argument, and they vow to exploit what they call the Republicans' obstruction in the 2012 campaign.
Yet any political benefit would be small consolation for the White House, given the forecasts of nonpartisan economists that without such a stimulus plan, the economy is likely to relapse into recession next year just as the president faces re-election.
''The only way we can truly attack our economic challenges is with bold, bipartisan action in Congress,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, Mr. Obama's communications director. ''The president will continue to pressure Congressional Republicans to put country before party and pass the American Jobs Act, but he believes we cannot wait, so he will act where they won't.''
Privately, some Republicans worry that they could suffer from that line of attack. On Sunday the Senate Republican minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, offered an alternate narrative, saying that Mr. Obama, for all his complaints about Republican opposition, had given little prominence to his signing of three free-trade agreements that won bipartisan approval this month.
''They're ashamed to mention any of the things that they do with Republicans because it steps on their story line,'' Mr. McConnell said on the CNN program ''State of the Union.'' ''Their story line is that there must be some villain out there who's keeping this administration from succeeding.''
By resorting to executive actions, using his wide-ranging authority to oversee federal laws and agencies, Mr. Obama seems intent on showing that he is not powerless in the face of Republican opposition but is trying to strengthen the economy and help Americans in trouble.
Aides said Mr. Obama would announce at least one initiative each week through the rest of the year, including steps to help returning veterans and small businesses. Yet the officials acknowledge that the coming policy changes, executive orders and agency actions are generally less far-reaching than the legislative proposals now before Congress.
Recent executive actions provide examples of what is to come.
This month the administration expedited approval of payments to small businesses with government contracts. It announced waivers for states with schools falling short of the proficiency standards of the 2002 No Child Left Behind education law -- a move that prompted some senators to compromise on an alternative rewrite of the law.
And last week the administration eased regulations stemming from the 2010 health insurance law to encourage hospitals and doctors to coordinate on Medicare patients' care for better results at lower cost.
The housing proposal that Mr. Obama will announce in Las Vegas is rooted in the independent Federal Housing Finance Agency, the office created to oversee the government-sponsored housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after they were forced into conservatorship at the outset of the financial crisis in 2008.
Though the collapse of housing values is considered a major factor holding back economic growth, because of its effect on consumer spending, government programs to stem foreclosures have fallen short of initial promises. For that reason, officials have tried not to raise expectations that the latest plan can help more than a small fraction of the millions in danger of foreclosure.
While details remain sketchy, the initiative is expected to change eligibility standards for the three-year-old Home Affordable Refinance Program to encourage new, lower-cost loans to more homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their properties are worth.
Typically, refinancing is unavailable to those who do not have equity in their houses; the Home Affordable Refinance Program sought to encourage refinancing for up to 125 percent of a home's value for mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This month the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Edward J. DeMarco, told lawmakers his agency was considering raising that threshold.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a CNN appearance on Sunday, said the administration would continue to work with federal agencies ''to loosen restrictions on the ability to refinance'' and also press the banks, ''so they can get in the business of actually doing what we think they should have been doing much more of, and that is sitting down and renegotiating with people who are about to go under.''

HEADLINE: No Holiday

 BODY:
Big business has clearly decided that the economic crisis is too important to waste. While Washington debates how to create jobs and cut the budget deficit, major corporations -- read major campaign contributors -- are pushing Congress for an enormous tax cut on corporate profits. Lawmakers seem all too eager to grant their wish.
Specifically, multinational corporations -- including Cisco, Pfizer and Qualcomm -- want a temporary ''tax holiday'' that would allow them to bring foreign-held earnings back to the United States at a vastly reduced tax rate. 
A bill in the House would tax repatriated earnings at 5.25 percent, a fraction of the usual rate of 35 percent; a bill in the Senate would cut the rate to 8.75 percent, or 5.25 percent for companies that added jobs.
The corporations say a tax holiday would help to create jobs, mainly by giving them money to hire and expand. But the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Congressional Research Service, and private researchers concluded that the last tax holiday, enacted in 2004, largely failed to spur investment or job growth. Companies spent most of the repatriated $300 billion on dividends and stock buybacks, enriching executives and shareholders.
These days, corporations are flush with $2 trillion in cash that is not being used for hiring. As long as the economy is weak and consumers aren't spending, tax cuts will add to the cash pile, not create jobs. A tax holiday also would add to the deficit, in part because companies rush to bring money home, rather than repatriating the earnings over time at the usual rate. According to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, another tax holiday at 5.25 percent would increase the deficit by nearly $80 billion over 10 years; a rate of 10.5 percent would cost $42 billion.
A report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations leaves no doubt that tax holidays encourage tax avoidance -- as companies use accounting maneuvers to shift profits offshore and then wait for the next tax holiday before bringing the money back.
The Senate panel said 7 of 19 companies that participated in the first tax holiday repatriated between 90 percent and 100 percent of their profits from offshore tax havens, like Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Panama and Ireland. The subcommittee also found that corporations that repatriated large sums under the first holiday have since built up their offshore funds at a greater rate than before.
Yet, in the warped politics of Washington, a second tax holiday is a distinct possibility. Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat of New York, and other Democratic senators have floated the idea that a tax holiday could be used to establish an infrastructure bank. They are focused on the short-run revenue gain from a tax holiday and playing down the substantial revenue loss over time. Mr. Schumer says he would not support a rate as low as 5.25 percent, but even a higher rate would be a big revenue loser.
Similarly, the bipartisan deficit reduction supercommittee, reportedly hamstrung in its quest for trillion-dollar budget cuts, might also try to use the short-run revenue gain from a tax holiday to mask the depth of spending cuts. Or Congressional Republicans may demand passage of a tax holiday in exchange for extending federal unemployment benefits, which expire at the end of the year.
The White House has rightly opposed another ''one-time'' tax holiday, but politics are pulling in the other direction. Unless President Obama leads the fight, this wrongheaded policy is too likely to become the law of the land. The evidence is there. A corporate tax holiday won't create more jobs. What it will do is raise the deficit.

HIGHLIGHT: On Oct. 24, 1945, the United Nations charter took effect after being ratified by the five permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China) and a majority of the other 46 members. 

 BODY:
On Oct. 24, 1945, the United Nations charter took effect after being ratified by the five permanent members of the Security Council (the United States, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China) and a majority of the other 46 members.

The New York Times reported the following day, "In signing the protocol [U.S. Secretary of State James F.] Byrnes said the Charter was now a 'part of the law of nations' and that it was 'a memorable day for the peace-loving peoples of all nations.' But he warned that peace depended upon the will of the peoples for peace rather than upon documents."
The United Nations was formed in the final days of World War II by 51 countries committed to the Allied forces. The organization succeeded the League of Nations, a similar intergovernmental organization formed after World War I. 
The charter was drafted at a conference in San Francisco in April and signed on June 26, 1945. This document expressed the purposes and principles of the organization, chief among them to "maintain international peace and security" and "achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character." It also established its organization and procedures; every member state would have a seat in the General Assembly, which would elect members to the Security Council and other councils.

HEADLINE: The Purchase by Blood

BYLINE: CAROL BUNDY


HIGHLIGHT: Two Civil War regiments, drawn from Boston's elite, suffered some of the worst casualties of the war. 

 BODY:
Two cousins, on the field at battle's start, catch each other's eye, salute, and then - "when next I looked," Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. writes of his cousin, James Jackson Lowell, "he was gone." At Cedar Mountain, Capt. Henry Sturgis Russell is captured because he has stayed to tend the wounds of his friend, Maj. James Savage. But once in Confederate hands the two are parted: Russell is exchanged while Savage begins the slow decline that will end in his lonely death at the hands of incompetent surgeons in a Confederate hospital. 
At Antietam, Lt. Col. Wilder Dwight, a lawyer in his civilian life, is mortally wounded and trapped between the lines, forced to lie there alone and exposed as the battle rages. Pulling from his pocket the letter he had begun that morning to his mother, Dwight continues to write, and does so until Rupert Sadler, a man whom Dwight had acquitted from a murder charge before the war, finds the courage to run out with water and join Dwight in no man's land. 
Soldiering, particularly in the Civil War, was not a solitary act, but something done in community. Because regiments were raised within very limited geographical areas, men marched off to war surrounded by workmates, childhood friends, relatives - cousins and brothers. This produced great solidarity within the ranks, and the attendant sense of community did much to maintain morale. But such homogeneous regiments also meant that losses in battle were felt disproportionately within the civilian population.
These soldiers - Lowell, Holmes, Russell, Savage and Dwight - were part of the elite community surrounding the 20th Massachusetts and the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, two regiments loaded with the sons of Boston's bluest blood. Like the young British aristocrats who left the playing fields of Eton and Harrow for Ypres and the Somme, the officers of the 20th and 2nd Mass Infantry clung to almost medieval notions of valor and fell in battle in disproportionately high numbers. Of 2,000 Union regiments, the 20th Mass ranks fifth in losses sustained. At the Battle of Ball's Bluff the 20th Massachusetts lost 13 out of 22 officers. Less than a year later, at Cedar Mountain, Va., an equally insignificant location, the 2nd Mass lost 16 out of 23 officers. 
The losses sustained in these two minor engagements brought home the cost of war to the wealthiest and most influential families in Massachusetts. By the end of 1862, these families understood the national anger at the corruption of the war effort, at the incompetence of politically appointed generals, and at the pernicious mix of human weakness, stupidity and bloody-mindedness that had so successfully exacted its pound of flesh. For most, the calculus was made at the ubiquitous funerals. "Are we paying too heavy a price?" asked the Rev. George Putnam, while the Rev. Cyrus Augustus Bartol titled one of his funeral orations "The Purchase by Blood."
If wealth, influence and power did not offer immunity from the fundamental absurdity of war, it did permit a determined effort to try to give meaning to what was senseless slaughter, to purchase something with all that loss. In the case of Ball's Bluff, the death of one of the young officers, Lt. William Lowell Putnam, came to symbolize not only the tragedy of war but, increasingly, the martyrdom necessary to achieve emancipation. Although born into a wealthy Boston family with the strongest interest in the cotton economy, young Putnam belonged to a staunchly abolitionist branch of that family. After his death the family circulated his letters that passionately advocated the need to eradicate the slave culture.
Although in this early period of the war, Union soldiers fought to preserve the Union and the issue of slavery took a backseat, as the war went on and as the death toll mounted, as it became clear that any hope of a mediated settlement was futile, and as Boston prepared itself for the next phase of war - harsher and more punishing - the issue of slavery returned. For the pragmatic, it was a war measure. But it also offered a cause worthy of such deaths. "Not merely for country, not merely for humanity, not only for civilization, but for the religion of our Lord itself," or so insisted Gov. John Albion Andrew in April 1863 at the flag presentation of the 54th Regiment as he offered to its colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, a white silk banner embroidered with a golden star, a golden cross and the inscription IN HOC SIGNO VINCES: "By this sign thou shalt conquer." This had been the vision of Constantine on the Milvian Bridge - the moment of the emperor's conversion to Christianity.
As Governor Andrew admonished the 54th to "follow the splendid example" of Lieutenant Putnam, Colonel Shaw had a vivid memory of the young officer he had found the day after Ball's Bluff when he, along with other officers of the 2nd Mass, arrived at Edward's Ferry to visit the wounded, from whom they heard firsthand accounts of the battle. Putnam's guts had been shot away and nothing could be done but to give him morphine. Shaw's cousin, Lt. Henry Sturgis, had carried Putnam from the battlefield, down the steep bluff to the river's edge. Norwood Penrose Hallowell, a lieutenant colonel in the 54th Mass, had lashed together the raft on which Putnam had been poled across the Potomac. The very youthful Cabot Jackson Russel, now a captain in the 54th, was a younger cousin who, after Putnam's death, had been sent on a western expedition to prevent him from enlisting, only to telegraph his father from Nevada after the death of yet another cousin. "Now I will have to fight," he wrote. And so it went, an endless web of connections.
Governor Andrew's pointed reference to Lieutenant Putnam brought back to the officers of the regiment, and also to the crowd gathered, intensely personal and profound memories. Memories that mixed childhood with war, innocence and the loss of innocence, and came to embrace the experience of loss more generally. Shaw, for example, had been detailed to recover the bodies of the fallen soldiers of the 2nd Mass at Cedar Mountain. His experience traveling over that battlefield, stepping about "among heaps of dead bodies, many of them ... friends and acquaintances," had inured him to any ordinary squeamishness. It was this callousness that led him to write, "I long for the day when we shall attack the rebels with an overwhelming force and annihilate them. May I live long enough to see them running before us hacked to little pieces." 
Of course Shaw did not live that long. Nor did most of his friends among the city elite. And for those who did survive the war, even the heroes among them, victory would always have the inevitable taste of ash. They had all been changed by war, as had their world. Gone was the old idealism, and it its place was a harder, grittier knowledge of life as brutal and indifferent mixed with deep guilt and regret and the sense that nothing so terrible and so utterly transformative would happen again, at least to them. 
Over the 150 years that have passed, their faces stare out at us - at once cavalier, innocent, doubtful but most of all young. We search them for clues: wondering how they found the courage to do what they did, whether it was wisdom or innocence that motivated them, and how to reconcile ourselves to their hard fate.

HEADLINE: Complaint Box | Fleecing at the Flea

BYLINE: GABRIEL MITRE


HIGHLIGHT: In this week's Complaint Box: New York's flea markets reflect the mistaken notion that all items increase in value as they wear, age and decompose. 

 BODY:
Whenever my wife and I visit our local flea market, the ever-more-popular Brooklyn Flea in Fort Greene, I inevitably end up being amazed, then irritated, at what I see. 
Past the first agglomeration of clothing racks on the way to the food stands there invariably lies a prominent section dedicated to the sale of overpriced junk. For a moment, I think I have wandered into some portal that has transported me to the site of an ancient shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean, or that I have been launched forward in time, causing everything around me to age hundreds of years in what I perceive as the blink of an eye. I see heaps of rotting wooden furniture, glass jars with white stains all over them, and a whole lot of rusty brown, green and orange metal thingamajigs in various stages of decomposition.
I have visited other flea markets in the city - Hell's Kitchen; the Antiques Garage; the Williamsburg Flea on the waterfront; Skylight One Hanson - but there's no escaping these motley groups of castaways posing as desirable commodities. I've come across the carcasses of obsolete appliances from the radio age, tattered one-eyed dolls straight out of horror movies and a prehistoric eroded gym locker priced at $375.
I'm all for reusing the usable, and making efforts to overcome the destructive culture of discarding worn yet still serviceable goods, but I am appalled by what sellers intend to charge for most of this junk - and I don't use the word "junk" loosely. "Vintage" or "old fashioned" is one thing; merely browsing through this so-called merchandise can give me a skin rash. Am I the only one who realizes that a brand new throw pillow costs much less than the asking price for that putrid old dust bag?
The overpricing of junk is the worst instance of the increasingly upscale standards adopted by New York City's flea markets. By their very definition, flea markets imply cheap prices for used and unwanted items, as is still the case in most other places. But New Yorkers seem to have redefined the flea market based on the mistaken notion that items increase in value as they wear, age and decompose.
This can only lead to a retroactive celebration of newness. In fact, just the other day my wife and I opted to economize on a shiny coffee table of Swedish design instead of splurging on a rusty slab of submarine hull sitting on three crooked pegs.

HEADLINE: For Quiet Moments Between Protests, a Growing Library

BYLINE: RITCHIE S. KING


HIGHLIGHT: Occupy Wall Street demonstrators may lack many comforts, but one thing they do not lack is reading material. 

 BODY:
As the rain poured down over Lower Manhattan on a recent weeknight, a patchwork of umbrellas and tarps in the northeast corner of Zuccotti Park was preventing something very precious from getting wet: the books of Occupy Wall Street's self-run People's Library.
While the library's most popular titles are progressive tomes on politics and the economy, donated books are never rejected, even if they seem at odds with the ideology behind the protest.
"We've gotten books by Ann Coulter and Milton Friedman," said Zachary Loeb, one of the volunteer librarians. "But my favorite was a how-to magic book, written in French."
The People's Library started a few days after Sept. 17, the day that the Occupy Wall Street protest began. People were leaving books they had finished on one of the benches in the park, and as a pile amassed, organization-minded protesters started putting them in boxes, then arranging them by genre. 
All of the books have all been donated - by individuals, publishers and even authors - simply so that protesters have something to read. Over the past four weeks, the collection has steadily grown to about 3,000.
"When there's nice weather, when people can hang out here, there's a lot of reading going on," said William Scott, an English professor from the University of Pittsburgh and one of the librarians at the People's Library.
As the collection grew, protesters set up tables and began helping people find specific titles among the boxes. Then, with the help of Radical Reference, a volunteer collective of librarians who lend support to activist causes, they built a catalog and started entering the books that were coming in, either by scanning their bar codes with a smartphone or manually typing in their International Standard Book Numbers. While the catalog does not indicate whether a book has been checked out, it does track the titles that are being donated, serving as an "interesting archival document," according to Mr. Loeb.
The library runs on the honor system: anyone can take out a book, and there are no official due dates or library cards. But it is more than just a glorified book swap. About a dozen core librarians take turns fielding inquiries at the reference desk, recommending books when requested titles aren't available, and logging new donations into the library's catalog, which can be searched online at peopleslibrary.wordpress.com/.
In addition, the librarians are trying to set up a Wi-Fi network so that people can use the Internet without charge, just as they can at a public library.
"It goes hand in hand with the movement," Professor Scott said, "which in part, is about expanding access to education."
The library's collection comprises material as varied as philosophy, literature and even a constantly growing archive of poems and plays written by protesters themselves. The librarians have established a noncirculating section to ensure the availability of the most sought-after titles, which include "A People's History of the United States" by Howard Zinn, "The Shock Doctrine" by Naomi Klein, and "Nickel and Dimed" by Barbara Ehrenreich.
Professor Scott and Mr. Loeb said that the publisher Knopf donated 50 books to the People's Library last Wednesday and that they had also received a box of 20 copies of the Scrabble-like word game Bananagrams from an anonymous donor. In the past few weeks, authors like Ms. Klein and Chris Hedges, a former reporter for The New York Times, have donated multiple copies of their own books after coming to speak at Zuccotti Park.
But most of the donations are small and come from individuals, according to Mr. Loeb. On Wednesday night, a young man ducked into the makeshift covering protecting the People's Library and offered three books, including the much coveted "Nickel and Dimed."
According to Mr. Loeb, passers-by are often surprised when they see the library, which is situated at the high-profile corner of Broadway and Liberty Street, and come in to ask questions about it.
"When people think of a library, they think of organization and they think of people saying 'shhh,' " Mr. Loeb said as a small marching band played in another section of the park.
"All these things that people don't think this scrappy encampment would have."

F.B.I. Investigates Olympus Fee | For two decades, a pair of Japanese bankers toiled away in relative anonymity on Wall Street, hopping from firm to firm.
Now the two - Hajime Sagawa and Akio Nakagawa - are at the center of a growing firestorm over a mysterious $687 million payout by the Japanese company Olympus. The F.B.I. is now investigating the payment, according to two people briefed on the case. The focus of the investigation is not yet clear, and a spokesman for the F.B.I. in New York, James M. Margolin, declined to comment.
The money has been described as a fee for advising Olympus on the 2008 takeover of a British company, the Gyrus Group. But the fee amount was more than 30 times the norm on Wall Street. And it went, in part, to a tiny unknown firm run by Mr. Sagawa and Mr. Nakagawa, a review of public records shows.

It's the little moments like this that enrich our lives and make us feel special."
Ways to Deal With Uncertainty. Ndubuisi Ekekwe lists three rules for entrepreneurs. No. 2: "During uncertainty, customers, staff and stakeholders panic. To get the trust of all these people, entrepreneurs must be visible, especially to their major customers. Visibility alleviates fears. Entrepreneurs should also be visible to their staffers - they deserve to know what is happening, if you want them to focus on working rather than polishing their resumes."
Things Not to Tell Customers. Mark Hunter lists four things your customers don't want to hear. No. 2 is, "Your customers don't want to hear bad news about the economy or their industry": "Trust me - they know that already! Would you really like to hear from somebody who only brings bad news? Would you want to get on an airplane and overhear the flight crew talking about a recent plane crash?"

HEADLINE: ING Direct Drops Rate on Its Savings Account

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: ING Direct has dropped the interest paid on its savings account to 0.9 percent A.P.Y. 

 BODY:
The foreseeable future may already be here, it seems.
ING Direct dropped the rate paid on its Orange savings account from 1 percent annual percentage yield to 0.9 percent as of Oct. 21, according to the online bank's Web site.
It's true that interest rates are low, and that the fine print on the Orange savings disclosuredoes say that ING Direct "may change the interest rate for your account at any time."
But it's also true that in response to customer outrageover Capital One's proposed acquisition of ING Direct, a Capital One spokeswoman said in June: "We have no plans to make any significant changes. ING customers should expect the same great customer experience and the `status quo' from ING for the foreseeable future."
Another Capital One spokeswoman said in an e-mail on Monday, "The ING deal has not closed yet you'll have to check in with them on their rate moves." (The acquisition is awaiting approval by the Federal Reserve).
"Our rates remain competitive," said an ING Direct spokeswoman, Cathy MacFarlane. "Although they fluctuate, our commitment to saving our customers time and money does not." She referred questions about the reason for the rate change to ING Direct's Dutch parent, the ING Group. We've asked it for comment and will update the post accordingly once it responds.
The move may not bode well for ING Direct savings account customers. Some of ING Direct's online competitors, like American Express, Sallie Mae and Discover, are still offering savings rates of 1 percent A.P.Y.
Capital One, ING Direct's prospective new parent, is offering 0.85 percenton its savings account, though you can earn bonus interest in each quarter if you maintain a balance of $10,000 or more.
Do you think ING Direct's reduction of its interest rate, which equates to a 10 percent drop, is reasonable?

HEADLINE: Nurturing Start-Ups in Brazil, With a Nod to Silicon Valley

BYLINE: VINOD SREEHARSHA


HIGHLIGHT: A developing relationship between investors and entrepreneurs in Brazil comes as venture capital firms in the United States are starting to take notice. 

 BODY:
CAMPINAS, Brazil - When the investment firm Monashees Capital first called Juliano Ipolito, the co-founder of an online handicrafts marketplace, he assumed that he would have to visit the firm in Sao Paulo.
Brazilian investment firms have traditionally had distant relationships with the companies they finance and are held in low regard by entrepreneurs.
Instead, three Monashees partners, including the co-founders Eric Acher and Fabio Igel, jumped into a car and drove in blistering heat almost 60 miles to Campinas. They spent several hours with Mr. Ipolito and his wife, Monica Ipolito, co-founder of their start-up, Elo7, getting to know them and explaining their role in developing early-stage Internet companies.
 Initially, the Ipolitos "did not want to do a deal," Mr. Igel said, because "they did not need the money and they were happy."
But the visits to Campinas continued and the relationship grew. Recently, more than seven months after that first call, Elo7 secured Series A financing from Monashees and the American venture capital firm Accel Partners.
The deal illustrates the emergence of an Internet start-up community in Brazil. Home-grown Monashees identified the entrepreneurs, developed the relationship and early on brought in a major Silicon Valley player as a partner to make a rare early-stage investment. That change in the investor-entrepreneur relationship here comes as United States venture capital firms are starting to take notice of Brazil.
During Brazil's rise, several economic sectors have attained global prominence, but the Internet has been a notable exception. Nasdaq does not have a single Brazilian Internet company listed, and the country's own exchange has very few.
This is not for a lack of talent. In 2000, Brazilian professors in Minas Gerais created Akwan Information Technologies, which was acquired by Google in 2005 and became the Internet giant's research and development center in Latin America.
But today's entrepreneurs are starting to believe their options are wider, so they are building companies for the long haul that can rival multinationals instead of getting consumed by them. This is changing in part because of firms like Monashees.
According to Claudio Vilar Furtado, an authority on Brazilian venture capital and private equity, and professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Monashees is among a small group of firms introducing "a new paradigm for the type of relationship that nurtures entrepreneurs in a very positive and value-increasing way."
Other investment firms include Astella Investimentos, Ideiasnet and FIR Capital. All are filling the void of private sector financing for start-ups.
According to the New York-based Latin America Venture Capital Association, five of 32 venture capital and private equity deals in Brazil in the first half of 2011 were early stage, seed or incubator investments. In 2010, that ratio was 12 of 28.
Monashees today holds $70 million, up from $30 million in July 2010. Investments range from $500,000 to $5 million for the initial round. The most it has invested in a single company via multiple rounds is $7 million. One of the partners, Mr. Acher, says that the firm typically takes 30 percent ownership in a start-up, with a range of 20 to 40 percent.
In 2010, Mr. Acher said that the firm was likely to make just two to three investments per year, because of the time it took to develop relationships. But this year, Monashees has already made at least nine new investments in nine different Brazil-based start-ups. One these new companies, GetNinjas, an online marketplace for services that was founded by two Brazilians, Eduardo L'Hotellier and Diego Dias, began recently.
The unexpected surge in investment opportunities in Brazil for Monashees is partly because entrepreneurship is becoming more accepted as a viable career.
For example, Mr. L'Hotellier, who previously worked at McKinsey & Company and Bain Capital, had his pick of corporate jobs, but he chose entrepreneurship.
A second reason is that failure is becoming less of a stigma. Mr. Dias, for instance, tried to start a company in the past but says that, "I was with the wrong partners."
Yet, after meeting Mr. L'Hotellier, he was willing to try again.
Young Brazilians are also encouraged by their compatriots returning from the United States, like Julio Vasconcellos, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Business School, who co-founded the country's first daily deal site, Peixe Urbano, in Rio de Janeiro in 2010, backed by Monashees and Benchmark. Its initial angel investor was Chamath Palihapitiya, who says he has participated in every financing round since.
And even as Brazilians are returning, Monashees has invested for the first time in Americans who, in a role reversal, have come to Brazil seeking greener pastures.
Baby.com.br, an e-commerce site for baby products that started this month, was founded by two Americans, Kimball Thomas and Davis Smith. And they chose a Brazilian V.C. firm over a Silicon Valley one.
Mr. Thomas said that from their initial meetings with Monashees, "it became clear that if we work with these guys, they are with us daily."
"We knew that we had a highly interested partner that was on the ground with the type of relationships and contacts we needed," he said. "Otherwise we are just a couple of guys showing up with suitcases of money," with an idea but unsure how to execute it.
Other investors in the Baby.com.br financing round that Monashees led are Ron Conway's SV Angel and Mr. Palihapitiya, who has invested in three companies with Monashees.
After the investment round, which raised $3 million, Tiger Global Management contacted Monashees, expressing interest in the company and subsequently adding $1.5 million in April.
"Tiger would not have been interested in us had we not raised money from Monashees," Mr. Smith said.
Monashees faces numerous challenges, in particular producing its first exit.
"We need to get to liquidity events, and it is going to take some time," Mr. Acher said. "We still have to prove ourselves."
And increased competition means that Monashees is losing out on deals for the first time, although that's an expected result of the sector's evolution.
Whether Monashees and the start-up scene here will succeed will also depend on their American partners and whether they can adapt.
Accel, which has made two investments with Monashees, also played a crucial role in winning over the Ipolitos, including introducing a Flickr co-founder, Stewart Butterfield, who shared his doubts about taking financing in the photo-sharing site's early days.
"How we behave will determine how much they trust us in the future," Kevin Efrusy, an Accel partner, said of this new group of Brazilian entrepreneurs. "If we behave well, we will be able to partner with entrepreneurs there for generations."
But, he said, "if we behave badly, by optimizing short-term gains and trying to take advantage of people, we will wreck the ecosystem."

HEADLINE: New Refi Rules Offer Help to More Underwater Borrowers

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: New rules could make it easier for underwater borrowers to refinance their mortgages. 

 BODY:
The federal government on Monday announced changes that could make it easier for many borrowers who owed more on their home loans than their houses were worth to refinance into lower-cost mortgages.
The changes are aimed at helping homeowners who are current on their loans, but who have been unable to take advantage of historically low interest rates by refinancing because they are "underwater" on their mortgages. Ultimately, the government hopes the move will help stabilize the housing market, which has been stagnant due to falling prices and foreclosures.
Previously, to refinance under the two-year-old Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, borrowers could owe no more than 125 percent of their home's value. But the Federal Housing Finance Agency is eliminating that cap, making the program available to many more underwater homeowners. Other changes include eliminating the need for most appraisals and scrapping many refinance fees.
Lenders are expected to get detailed information on the changes by Nov. 15; some could begin offering refinancing under the new rules as soon as December. Borrowers who owe more than 125 percent of their home's value, however, likely will have to wait until early 2012, according to the housing agency.
As of Aug. 31, about 894,000 borrowers had refinanced under HARP; at least that many are expected to be able to refinance under the updated program, the agency said.
To qualify, your home loan must be owned or guaranteed by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, the quasi-governmental mortgage outfits; you can check this here for Freddie and here for Fannie. I found the Fannie site a bit frustrating to use, so another option is simply to call: 800-7FANNIE , or 800-FREDDIE. (Freddie and Fannie own or guarantee roughly half of all home loans in the United States).
Here's some other details:

        
Your loan must have been sold to Freddie or Fannie before May 31, 2009.

        
You must be up-to-date on your mortgage payments, with no more than one late payment in the prior 12 months.

        
Your current loan-to-value ratio (the amount of your loan, divided by the value of your home) must be greater than 80 percent.
Think the new rules will help you refinance your home? Or is this just the latest federal mortgage effort that will fall short of its goals?

HEADLINE: Mattel to Acquire HIT Entertainment for $680 Million

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Through the deal, Mattel will add Thomas the Tank Engine and Bob the Builder to its already robust stable of toy brands. 

 BODY:
Thomas the Tank Engine is about to make some new friends.
Mattel agreed on Monday to buy HIT Entertainment, owner of popular preschool toy brands like Thomas the Tank Engine and Bob the Builder, for $680 million in cash from a group led by Apax Partners.
The deal is one of Mattel's larger acquisitions, adding another popular stable of children's brands to a portfolio that already includes Barbie and Fisher Price. 
Mattel is paying about 9.5 times HIT's 12-month trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. HIT Entertainment, based in London and New York, reported more than $180 million in annual revenue.
The deal will allow HIT to pay off its large debt load, put in place when the company was acquired by Apax in 2005 for 489.4 million. Last year, HIT reached an accord with its lenders to push out debt maturities to next year, in exchange for higher interest rates.
Mattel already manufactures toys for HIT, selling $150 million worth of Thomas the Tank Engine plastic and die-cast toys last year. The deal will not affect Mattel's earnings next year, but is expected to add to them over time.
"Mattel is the right home for Thomas and Friends," Robert A. Eckert, Mattel's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Mattel was advised by RBC Capital Markets and the law firm Latham & Watkins, while HIT was advised by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges.

HEADLINE: A Challenge to Conventional Wisdom on Small Business and Jobs

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: A former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden says small businesses don't really create most new jobs. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein, who was until May Vice President Joe Biden's top economic adviser, published an article on the Op-Ed page of Monday's Times that challenges much of the orthodoxy about small business in the United States. He argues that small businesses really don't employ the majority of Americans, and that they don't create the majority of new jobs.
For good measure, he accuses the National Federation of Independent Business -- which he calls "the sector's primary lobbying group" -- of being "a purely partisan operation." He notes that the organization "opposed the president's jobs bill, even though independent analysts estimated it would significantly increase economic demand, and the federation's own survey shows that 'poor sales' - a k a weak demand - is a much bigger problem for its members than taxes or regulations." (The beef against the N.F.I.B. is not a new complaint - The Agenda has addressed it before, here and here).
No doubt some conservatives and libertarians will use Mr. Bernstein's essay to buttress their claims that small businesses deserve no special policy considerations from the government. But Mr. Bernstein doesn't agree. Though small companies are not, in his view, key to our economic recovery, they still employ a lot of people, and as Mr. Bernstein notes, have tighter margins, higher costs and less access to capital and export markets. And they are crucial to an understanding of who Americans are - evoking, as Mr. Bernstein says, "Steve Jobs planting a seed in his garage that grew into an amazing Apple orchard."

HEADLINE: New Leader for Liberal Research Group

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations, Neera Tanden, will lead the Center for American Progress, whose progressive viewpoint reflects a disaffected element of President Obama's base. 

 BODY:
A veteran of the Obama and Clinton administrations, Neera Tanden, will be taking over as president of the Center for American Progress, a research organization that represents the views of the president's more liberal, and somewhat disaffected, base.
She will succeed John Podesta, who ran President Obama's transition team and served as White House chief of staff to President Clinton, on Nov. 1. Mr. Podesta will remain at the organization as non-executive chairman of the board.
In an interview on Monday, Ms. Tanden said she hoped "big ideas," both from her organization and other progressives, would help unite the left in the year leading up to the next presidential election. Recent national polls show that Mr. Obama is behind the Republican candidate on a generic ballot.
"There's a lack of faith in our ability to solve large-scale problems together, and that weakens the progressive cause," she said. "There's big hunger for bigger solutions, and some of the reaction we're seeing in this country is a rejection of the current discourse in Washington."
She said she believed that Mr. Obama's recent push for more economic stimulus intended to create jobs may be winning him back more liberal supporters who had felt alienated by his push for austerity measures.
Ms. Tanden is the chief operating officer at the Center for American Progress, and served as senior adviser for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services, where she helped shape the Affordable Care Act. She said that despite continuing criticism of the health care legislation passed last year, she did not anticipate that Congressional Republicans would make a serious attempt to dismantle it before the next election.
"There were two moments where Republicans had had levers over the Senate and the White House to dismantle the Affordable Care Act," she said. "One was the government shutdown, and the other was the debt limit deal. In neither case did they use those levers to destroy the Affordable Care Act."

PERSON: Herbert A. Hauptman 

HEADLINE: Herbert A. Hauptman, 94, Nobel Laureate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Herbert A. Hauptman, a mathematician who shared the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with the chemist Jerome Karle for their development of revolutionary methods for determining the structure of molecules vital to life, died on Sunday in Buffalo. He was 94.
His death was confirmed by Jane F. Griffin, principal research scientist at the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute in Buffalo. 
Dr. Hauptman and Dr. Karle's work had far-reaching impact in the manufacture of drugs for a variety of ailments.
''I don't think there's a single pharmaceutical that's been developed in the last 30 years that hasn't been studied using derivations of what Dr. Hauptman and his colleagues won the Nobel Prize for,'' Eaton Lattman, chief executive of the Hauptman-Woodward institute, told The Associated Press.
Dr. Hauptman began collaborating with Dr. Karle, a classmate from City College, at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington after World War II. They turned their attention to X-ray crystallography, a means of deducing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule by analyzing how a crystal form of the molecule scatters a beam of X-rays aimed at it. The scattering pattern is recorded as points of light on X-ray film.
The method had limitations, however: researchers could do no more than draw inferences of a molecule's structure, to be verified by further investigation.
Dr. Hauptman and Dr. Karle took the guesswork out of the problem. Using probability theory to interpret the light patterns on X-ray film, they calculated the angles at which the X-ray beams were deflected as they passed near the electrons surrounding the nucleus of an atom. They then came up with equations that translated this information into maps that pinpointed the location of individual atoms.
Their main ideas were first published in the early 1950s but were poorly understood and made few converts for at least 15 years. They are now used by crystallographers throughout the world to study thousands of molecules whose structures were previously inaccessible. The methods were particularly useful for researchers working with hormones, antibiotics and vitamins.
With a clear picture of the structure of hormones and other biological molecules, researchers better understood the chemistry of the body and of drugs used to treat various illnesses. For example, once they understood the structure of enkephalins, pain-control substances found naturally in the body, they were able to make progress in developing new pain-killing drugs.
The methods developed by Dr. Hauptman and Dr. Karle had the additional benefit of greatly speeding up the analysis of molecular structures. In the 1960s, it could take two years to work out the structure of a simple antibiotic molecule that had only 15 atoms. After Dr. Hauptman and Dr. Karle's discoveries, it became possible to determine the structure of a 50-atom molecule in two days.
Herbert Aaron Hauptman was born on Feb. 14, 1917, in the Bronx and attended Townsend Harris Hall, an elite school that closed in 1942 and was revived in 1984 as Townsend Harris High School on the campus of Queens College in Flushing. The school also produced the Nobel laureate Kenneth J. Arrow, an economist.
Dr. Hauptman earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from City College in 1937 and a master's degree from Columbia in 1939. After serving in the Navy during in World War II as a weather forecaster in the South Pacific, he joined Dr. Karle as a physicist-mathematician at the Naval Research Lab in 1947. He also enrolled in the University of Maryland, earning a doctorate in mathematics in 1955 for a dissertation based on his work at the lab.
In 1970, unwilling to shift the focus of his naval research to laser-guided missiles, he joined the Medical Foundation of Buffalo (since 1994 the Hauptman-Woodward institute), a small private foundation specializing in endocrine research. He became its research director two years later and its president in 1988. He was also a professor of biophysics at the State University at Buffalo.
He continued to work on problems in crystallography, shifting his attention in the mid-1980s to the analysis of larger molecular structures.
Dr. Hauptman, who lived in Amherst, N.Y., is survived by his wife, the former Edith Citrynell; two daughters, Barbara Hauptman of Buffalo and Carol Fullerton of Bethesda, Md.; and a brother, Robert, of Silver Spring, Md.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Tuesday about the mathematician Herbert A. Hauptman erroneously attributed an honor to Dr. Jonas E. Salk, who like Dr. Hauptman attended the elite high school Townsend Harris Hall. Unlike Dr. Hauptman, Dr. Salk was not a Nobel laureate.

HEADLINE: In Cautious Times, Banks Flooded With Cash

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Bankers have an odd-sounding problem these days: they are awash in cash.
Droves of consumers and businesses unnerved by the lurching markets have been taking their money out of risky investments and socking it away in bank accounts, where it does little to stimulate the economy.
Though financial institutions are not yet turning away customers at the door, they are trying to discourage some depositors from parking that cash with them. With fewer attractive lending and investment options for that money, it is harder for the banks to turn it around for a healthy profit.
In August, Bank of New York Mellon warned that it would impose a 0.13 percentage point fee on the deposits of certain clients who were moving huge piles of cash in and out of their accounts.
Others are finding more subtle ways to stem the flow. Besides paying next to nothing on consumer checking accounts and certificates of deposit, some giants -- like JPMorgan Chase, U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo -- are passing along part of the cost of federal deposit insurance to some of their small-business customers. 
Even some community banks, vaunted for their little-guy orientation, no longer seem to mind if you take your money somewhere else.
''We just don't need it anymore,'' said Don Sturm, the owner of American National Bank and Premier Bank, community lenders with 43 branches in Colorado and three other states. ''If you had more money than you knew what to do with, would you want more?''
Like Mr. Sturm's banks, Hyde Park Savings Bank, a community lender in the Boston suburbs, lowered its C.D. rates this spring to encourage less-profitable customers to move on. As a result, Hyde Park shed about 1,000 of its 35,000 C.D. holders, preferring customers who also had a checking or savings account.
So far, banks have reported a modest increase in lending this year. Critics, however, fault the industry for being too tight-fisted -- no matter how much bankers insist that demand is anemic, especially from the most creditworthy borrowers.
But the banks' swelling coffers are throwing a wrench in efforts to get the economy back on track.
Ordinarily, in a more robust environment, an influx of deposits would be used to finance new businesses, expansion plans and home purchases. But in today's fragile economy, the bulk of the new money is doing little to spur growth. Of the $41.8 billion of deposits that Wells Fargo collected in the third quarter, for example, only about $8.2 billion was earmarked to finance new loans.
Normally, banks earn healthy profits by taking in deposits and then investing them or lending them out at substantially higher interest rates than what they pay savers. But that traditional banking model has broken down.
Today, banks are paying savers almost nothing for their deposits. As it turns out, the banks are not minting money on those piles of cash. Lending levels have not bounced back from only a few years ago and the loans going out are not keeping pace with the deposits rushing in.
What's more, the profitability of each new loan has shrunk. Because the Federal Reserve effectively sets the floor off which banks price their lending rates, its decision to lower interest rates to near zero means the banks earn less money on the deposits they lend out.
The banks are also earning less on the deposits left over to invest. They typically park that money overnight at the Fed for a pittance, or invest it in ultra-safe securities, like bonds backed by the government. But with interest rates so low, the yields on those investments have been crushed.
In other words, what bankers call the spread is being squeezed -- they are making less money on each dollar they hold. ''It's very hard for us to take deposits and make any meaningful spread,'' said William D. Parent, Hyde Park's chief executive.
In fact, the pressure on spreads poses an even greater threat to the banks' earnings than the new financial regulations. Oliver Wyman, a financial services consulting firm, estimates that the industry's deposit revenue will shrink by more than $55 billion from its precrisis levels, dwarfing the roughly $15 billion in lost fee income from debit card and overdraft restrictions.
In the meantime, retail branch economics are being upended, forcing banks to close branches and lay off thousands of employees. ''If you can't put the money to work, what are you going to do with it?'' Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst with Oppenheimer, asked. ''You're sending monthly statements, you've got people at branches. All that stuff costs money.''
Before the financial crisis, banks were desperately scrambling for deposits, offering free iPods and interest rates averaging more than 3 percent. New branches sprouted up to gather that cash.
The banks that survived were flooded with cash as depositors flocked to the relative safety of government-insured accounts. The average one-year C.D. rate today is less than 0.4 percent, according to Bankrate.com.
Even as interest rates have fallen, bank deposits have grown at an impressive clip of almost 5 percent a year, according to Trepp, a financial research firm. This summer, as businesses and consumers withdrew their money from stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds because of fears about the debt crisis in Europe and another downturn in the United States, deposits surged to a record level of more than $8.9 trillion.
Brent Brodeski, an investment adviser in Rockford, Ill., said his clients were leaving more money in cash. ''They're only making a quarter percent, but they figure it's better not to make money than to lose it,'' he said.
Rather than fight this, some bankers insist the avalanche of new money will pay off when the economy improves or if it strengthens customer relationships.
''Having a large number of deposits, and being able to grow them, is a great thing to have,'' said Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer.
Conservative even by banker standards, Mr. Sturm said he had pared his banks' portfolio of loans by more than two-thirds to some $500 million over the last few years because of concerns that the loans could go bad. He scaled back new mortgages to home buyers in Aspen, Telluride and other luxury Colorado ski resort areas. And he said fewer businesses in Denver and Colorado Springs were seeking financing.
Yet, his banks remain flush with over $1.55 billion of deposits. He would like to make more loans so that he could earn more money, he said, but there are too few of what he calls ''quality borrowers,'' whose credit record, income and assets suggest they would reliably pay him back.
His next option is to invest those deposits in low-risk securities, like mortgage bonds backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which in recent years paid as much as 3.75 percent. Today, they are paying, on average, less than 1.15 percent. Deposits parked at the Fed fetch a mere quarter of a percentage point. Federal deposit insurance premiums and other account maintenance costs cut deeply into his returns.
As a result, Mr. Sturm is keeping savings rates below 0.15 percent and setting C.D. rates below those of nearby competitors. ''I don't want to take deposits in and lose money,'' he said.

HEADLINE: IPads Change Economics, And Speed, of Hotel Wi-Fi

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IF, like me, you have been complaining about unusually poor Internet service in hotel rooms lately, the hotels have a good explanation.
Largely because of the broad use of iPads and other mobile tablets, which are heavy users of video streaming, the guest room Wi-Fi networks that most hotels thought they had brought up to standard just a few years ago are now often groaning under user demands.
''The iPad is the fastest-selling device in consumer electronics history, and because of it the demand placed on any public place Wi-Fi system has gone up exponentially in the last year and a half,'' said David W. Garrison, the chief executive of iBAHN, a provider of systems for the hotel and meetings industries. 
This means more hotel customers are unhappy with their Internet connections. Hotel owners, meanwhile, who are digging out from a two-year slump caused by the recession, will probably have to invest more money to provide more bandwidth.
For travelers, it may mean still another fee, since hotels will be paying their own Internet bills. Some hotel Internet service providers are proposing a solution that offers tiered Wi-Fi service. The lowest level, suitable for basic Internet requirements like checking e-mail, would be free, but other levels would be priced depending on bandwidth requirements. According to iBAHN, iPads consume four times more Wi-Fi data per month than the average smartphone.
The iPad represents the ''final nail in the coffin'' for the idea that all Internet is free, Mr. Garrison said.
Amy Cravens, a market analyst with the mobile Internet group of In-Stat, a technology research and consulting company, agreed that tablets ''have had a huge influence on bandwidth consumption.''
Ms. Cravens said hotels had been slow to respond to the idea of a tiered fee system. ''They've been talking about that for a few years, but I haven't really seen it put much into play,'' she said.
Mr. Garrison estimated that 10 to 15 percent of hotels in the United States now offered at least some kind of Wi-Fi service with fees for higher use.
The growth in bandwidth demand is obvious. As we were speaking on Monday, Ms. Cravens received a note from AT&T saying that connection times for its hotel Internet service had more than doubled from the second quarter of this year to the third quarter.
Studies conducted for iBAHN indicate that while free Internet service remains a big factor in choosing a hotel, nearly two-thirds of business travelers say they have encountered slow Internet downloading in the last 12 months. Over two-thirds said they would ''not return to a hotel where they had a poor technology experience,'' iBAHN said.
''The bits used for video streaming and downloading increased thirtyfold on our network in one year,'' Mr. Garrison said.
Hotels, he said, now must choose ''either to not increase the amount of bandwidth, so everybody will get much slower service to the point where you'll think you're on a dial-up connection,'' or upgrade and essentially put in a metered fee-based system.
''It's about managing that bandwidth,'' Mr. Garrison added. ''We're not saying that free Internet as you know it today is dead. We're saying that a hotel owner will have to decide what free should be. I could have a free option, for a limited level of service, but charge for higher levels of demand.''
The research firm the Gartner Group predicts that the number of iPads sold will reach 100 million by the end of 2012.
''People are now carrying multiple devices. We see instances in hotels where people are using their laptop and their iPad at the same time, and maybe even have their smartphone on,'' Mr. Garrison said. ''As a business traveler, you're trying to get work done and you need a guaranteed adequate connection. So don't give me free Wi-Fi if it's not going to work.''
I, too, am about to join the mob and buy my first iPad. As I mentioned here, on a recent stay at a Hyatt Regency hotel in Denver, the Internet connection (at $12.95 a night, no less) was as sluggish as a dial-up. Even if it had been free, it would have remained almost useless to me.
Will you opt to pay an added fee in a hotel room for the extra bandwidth you may require? I hate to say it, but I probably will, if I have a guarantee that it will perform adequately.
I asked the same question of Ms. Cravens, an iPad user herself. Would she pay extra for the bandwidth she needs on the road?
''Absolutely,'' she replied.

HEADLINE: Upset at Cuomo's Property-Tax Cap, Communities Move to Get Around It

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
A much-heralded cap on property taxes championed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is encountering resistance as some communities across New York chafe at what amounts to a restriction on their spending and seek to exempt themselves from the new limits.
The communities, which include affluent New York City suburbs and rural communities near the border with Canada, are declaring that they cannot restrain the growth of property taxes and still comply with a variety of state-mandated programs and provide the services residents expect. And now dozens of town and county boards are overriding, or proposing to override, the cap.
''We should be able to dictate our own financial future,'' said Lee V. A. Roberts, the supervisor in the Westchester County town of Bedford, where the Town Board has already voted to grant itself a waiver from the cap.
The Legislature approved the tax cap in late June, an effort to limit the annual growth of local property taxes to 2 percent or the rate of inflation. After that measure passed, Mr. Cuomo vowed that it would ''provide much-needed relief'' from rising taxes, and he was so proud of the law that he signed it six times, once in his office and five times on the front lawns of houses in high-tax communities. 
It remains too early to determine exactly the impact the cap will have: New York State has more than 10,000 taxing entities, with varied processes and different calendars for determining their tax rates. Most school districts, which are responsible for the largest part of homeowners' tax bills, will not confront the cap issue until the spring.
The law allows taxing jurisdictions to grant themselves waivers with the approval of 60 percent of the members of whatever body approves local spending -- a town board, a county legislature or, in the case of most school districts, the residents themselves. And there are multiple early signs that the cap is not keeping tax increases down for all New Yorkers.
Gregory J. Edwards, the county executive of Chautauqua and the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor last year, wrote in a letter to residents this month that the cap was a ''scam'' pushed by politicians in Albany. He has asked county legislators to approve a tax increase of nearly 13 percent, which he wrote was entirely attributable to increases in state-mandated costs.
''The 2 percent property-tax cap is nothing more than a campaign slogan meant to get them re-elected and give local leaders the pain for their failure to act,'' Mr. Edwards wrote in his letter, referring to Albany lawmakers.
Chautauqua is among several counties considering budgets that call for property-tax increases several times the 2 percent limit, saying the cost of providing services mandated by the state, like Medicaid and welfare programs, is rising faster than that. Albany County, home to the Executive Mansion, has called for a 19 percent tax increase, while Franklin County has asked for a 13 percent increase.
The Association of Towns of the State of New York estimated that, based on historical budgeting data, about a third of New York's 932 towns might also consider overriding the cap. Some towns said they needed faster property-tax increases to pay for important capital projects; others cited a need to finance their share of the rebuilding after Tropical Storms Irene and Lee.
''There is a great deal of frustration,'' said Peter A. Baynes, the executive director of the New York State Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials. ''They want to make it work, but they're struggling to make the numbers add up.''
At a meeting this month of the Board of Supervisors for Ontario County, when one town supervisor asked which of his counterparts was seeking to override the cap, nearly all of them raised their hands.
''I wasn't surprised,'' said Theodore M. Fafinski, the board's chairman and the supervisor in the Town of Farmington. ''My comment to many of the legislators when I talk to them is -- and I pull no punches -- 'What in the world were you thinking when you passed this?' ''
Each passing day seems to bring a new act of legislative rebellion. In just one week this month, on Monday, the Town Board in Hammond, in the Thousand Islands region, voted to override the cap; on Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors in Seneca County introduced a measure to do the same thing; on Wednesday, town officials in Massena, in St. Lawrence County, passed their own override; and on Thursday, the Town Board in Harrietstown, in the Adirondacks, followed suit.
In Bedford, a wealthy town of 17,000 where Mr. Cuomo once owned a home, town officials said a $22 million bond offering for a new water filtration plant forced their hand when it came to overriding the cap. Ms. Roberts, the supervisor, expressed frustration with what she characterized as state officials' butting into municipal business.
''They have no idea about any particular town or city or village's budget or their needs or the sentiment of the local municipality,'' she said.
Of Mr. Cuomo and the cap, she added: ''I know that the average citizen probably welcomes it and thinks it's wonderful and he's done a great service to the community. But I think it's tone-deaf. I think it's disingenuous.''
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat elected last year, has made reining in property taxes a priority. He professes to be unfazed by the response to the cap, saying that local officials are free to do as they want, and that votes to override the cap should not be taken as rebukes to his administration.
''We passed a law that establishes a 2 percent cap -- or whatever the people want,'' the governor said at a news conference this month. ''We have never dictated to anyone what the taxes should be.''
But Mr. Cuomo is now emphasizing the cap's symbolic value, saying ''this mentality of automatic pilot, where the property taxes just keep going up 5, 6, 7 percent every year,'' will no longer be tolerated by New Yorkers. Indeed, in some communities, residents have chastised their local officials for not sufficiently embracing his push to keep taxes down.
''What you're seeing this year, which you didn't see in years past: there is much more attention and discussion about the increases in the property tax,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''That is a great accomplishment and a great positive.''
Supporters of the cap say that making any judgments about it now is premature. Mr. Cuomo's advisers said that they believed only about 20 percent of the budgets proposed so far by local governments would require an override of the cap, and that the bulk of those spending plans called for property-tax increases lower than what had been imposed in recent years.
On an Albany radio program this month, the State Senate majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican, noted that most communities in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were drawing up budgets that complied with the cap. ''It's forcing a discipline that I think has been absolutely necessary,'' Mr. Skelos said.

HEADLINE: Nurturing Start-Ups in Brazil, With a Nod to Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By VINOD SREEHARSHA

 BODY:
CAMPINAS, Brazil - When the investment firm Monashees Capital first called Juliano Ipolito, the co-founder of an online handicrafts marketplace, he assumed that he would have to visit the firm in Sao Paulo.
Brazilian investment firms have traditionally had distant relationships with the companies they finance and are held in low regard by entrepreneurs.
Instead, three Monashees partners, including the co-founders Eric Acher and Fabio Igel, jumped into a car and drove in blistering heat almost 60 miles to Campinas. They spent several hours with Mr. Ipolito and his wife, Monica Ipolito, co-founder of their start-up, Elo7, getting to know them and explaining their role in developing early-stage Internet companies.
Initially, the Ipolitos ''did not want to do a deal,'' Mr. Igel said, because ''they did not need the money and they were happy.'' 
But the visits to Campinas continued and the relationship grew. Recently, more than seven months after that first call, Elo7 secured Series A financing from Monashees and the American venture capital firm Accel Partners.
The deal illustrates the emergence of an Internet start-up community in Brazil. Home-grown Monashees identified the entrepreneurs, developed the relationship and early on brought in a major Silicon Valley player as a partner to make a rare early-stage investment. That change in the investor-entrepreneur relationship here comes as United States venture capital firms are starting to take notice of Brazil.
During Brazil's rise, several economic sectors have attained global prominence, but the Internet has been a notable exception. Nasdaq does not have a single Brazilian Internet company listed, and the country's own exchange has very few.
This is not for a lack of talent. In 2000, Brazilian professors in Minas Gerais created Akwan Information Technologies, which was acquired by Google in 2005 and became the Internet giant's research and development center in Latin America.
But today's entrepreneurs are starting to believe their options are wider, so they are building companies for the long haul that can rival multinationals instead of getting consumed by them. This is changing in part because of firms like Monashees.
According to Claudio Vilar Furtado, an authority on Brazilian venture capital and private equity, and professor at Fundacao Getulio Vargas, Monashees is among a small group of firms introducing ''a new paradigm for the type of relationship that nurtures entrepreneurs in a very positive and value-increasing way.''
Other investment firms include Astella Investimentos, Ideiasnet and FIR Capital. All are filling the void of private sector financing for start-ups.
According to the New York-based Latin America Venture Capital Association, five of 32 venture capital and private equity deals in Brazil in the first half of 2011 were early stage, seed or incubator investments. In 2010, that ratio was 12 of 28.
Monashees today holds $70 million, up from $30 million in July 2010. Investments range from $500,000 to $5 million for the initial round. The most it has invested in a single company via multiple rounds is $7 million. One of the partners, Mr. Acher, says that the firm typically takes 30 percent ownership in a start-up, with a range of 20 to 40 percent.
In 2010, Mr. Acher said that the firm was likely to make just two to three investments per year, because of the time it took to develop relationships. But this year, Monashees has already made at least nine new investments in nine different Brazil-based start-ups. One these new companies, GetNinjas, an online marketplace for services that was founded by two Brazilians, Eduardo L'Hotellier and Diego Dias, began recently.
The unexpected surge in investment opportunities in Brazil for Monashees is partly because entrepreneurship is becoming more accepted as a viable career.
For example, Mr. L'Hotellier, who previously worked at McKinsey & Company and Bain Capital, had his pick of corporate jobs, but he chose entrepreneurship.
A second reason is that failure is becoming less of a stigma. Mr. Dias, for instance, tried to start a company in the past but says that, ''I was with the wrong partners.''
Yet, after meeting Mr. L'Hotellier, he was willing to try again.
Young Brazilians are also encouraged by their compatriots returning from the United States, like Julio Vasconcellos, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Business School, who co-founded the country's first daily deal site, Peixe Urbano, in Rio de Janeiro in 2010, backed by Monashees and Benchmark. Its initial angel investor was Chamath Palihapitiya, who says he has participated in every financing round since.
And even as Brazilians are returning, Monashees has invested for the first time in Americans who, in a role reversal, have come to Brazil seeking greener pastures.
Baby.com.br, an e-commerce site for baby products that started this month, was founded by two Americans, Kimball Thomas and Davis Smith. And they chose a Brazilian V.C. firm over a Silicon Valley one.
Mr. Thomas said that from their initial meetings with Monashees, ''it became clear that if we work with these guys, they are with us daily.''
''We knew that we had a highly interested partner that was on the ground with the type of relationships and contacts we needed,'' he said. ''Otherwise we are just a couple of guys showing up with suitcases of money,'' with an idea but unsure how to execute it.
Other investors in the Baby.com.br financing round that Monashees led are Ron Conway's SV Angel and Mr. Palihapitiya, who has invested in three companies with Monashees.
After the investment round, which raised $3 million, Tiger Global Management contacted Monashees, expressing interest in the company and subsequently adding $1.5 million in April.
''Tiger would not have been interested in us had we not raised money from Monashees,'' Mr. Smith said.
Monashees faces numerous challenges, in particular producing its first exit.
''We need to get to liquidity events, and it is going to take some time,'' Mr. Acher said. ''We still have to prove ourselves.''
And increased competition means that Monashees is losing out on deals for the first time, although that's an expected result of the sector's evolution.
Whether Monashees and the start-up scene here will succeed will also depend on their American partners and whether they can adapt.
Accel, which has made two investments with Monashees, also played a crucial role in winning over the Ipolitos, including introducing a Flickr co-founder, Stewart Butterfield, who shared his doubts about taking financing in the photo-sharing site's early days.
''How we behave will determine how much they trust us in the future,'' Kevin Efrusy, an Accel partner, said of this new group of Brazilian entrepreneurs. ''If we behave well, we will be able to partner with entrepreneurs there for generations.''
But, he said, ''if we behave badly, by optimizing short-term gains and trying to take advantage of people, we will wreck the ecosystem.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Drilling in Fast-Growing Areas Ushers In New Era of Tension

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- The pattern is clear in the oil and gas business: drilling fields are going into new places. North Dakota, better known for growing wheat, is now booming with rigs. Fort Worth has upward of 2,000 gas wells right in the city itself, with most of that growth within just the last five years. Pittsburgh, facing the prospect of urban drilling, forbade it last year by a vote of the City Council.
But few areas are facing the prospect of drilling's new frontier more vividly than eastern Colorado, where 80 percent of this state's population of five million people cluster in a line of cities and suburbs stretching out from Denver, Colorado's capital and largest city.
A 90 million-year-old oil bed called the Niobrara -- estimated to contain two billion barrels, locked in shale that in past drilling eras was considered too costly to extract -- laces down from southeast Wyoming and Nebraska. And like a cowboy with Saturday-night pay in his pocket, ready to spend big and have a good time, the energy industry is riding into town to drill for it. 
Drilling permits in suburbs, parks and even in lakes have made the local news. Using hydrofracturing technologies -- breaking the shale with water, sand and chemicals to release the oil -- and horizontal, spiderlike tentacle borers that can spin out beneath communities, the still-emerging boom is bringing energy exploration to some of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, and to places with no experience whatsoever in dealing with it.
''It's completely surrounding the metro area,'' said Thom Kerr, the permit and technical services manager at the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, which regulates the industry.
The story here is not just about oil, however, but about life in a moment of profound economic and social uncertainty in post-recession America, residents, politicians and industry experts say. Drillers are going into some areas that were once, in rosier times, earmarked for housing or other uses, and elsewhere companies are creating jobs and taxes in communities that have been gasping for air, and ways to make ends meet.
The geography looks like this:
A half-hour north of downtown Denver, Weld County stretches toward Wyoming with more active oil and gas wells -- 17,388 as of this month according to state figures -- than almost any other county in the United States.
An hour south, the state's second-largest city, Colorado Springs, is scrambling to write its first drilling regulations, with the prospect of wells within city limits as early as next year. An 18,000-acre former ranch -- zoned for housing that mostly never materialized -- was bought this month on the city's east side for $20 million by a Canadian company, Ultra Petroleum, which has also bought more than 100,000 acres of mineral rights farther east in El Paso County in recent months. The county, officials say, has never had a producing oil or gas well in historical memory.
To the west, in the high-country playlands of the Rocky Mountains, the story is the same: drilling, and tensions over drilling, in places where that generally has not happened before. In Routt County, west of Rocky Mountain National Park, energy companies are exploring extensions of the Niobrara. In affluent Aspen, county commissioners have passed regulations, now being fought by the industry, that would all but halt exploration.
Colorado as a whole is certainly no stranger to the energy business. Some of the nation's first wells, in the 1800s, were sunk here, and in Weld County, some older fields have been pumping since the 1940s or earlier. The state's western half is a huge producer of natural gas. And Denver's office towers have long housed engineers and managers overseeing oil country in Wyoming, Montana and elsewhere.
But for many newer residents in the Denver area, who came for jobs in aerospace, financial services or software, oil is a remote idea or something from the city's past -- a trajectory epitomized by the career of Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a Democrat who was laid off as a young geologist in the 1980s energy bust, founded a beer hall and then went into politics.
The Denver metropolitan area, with more than 2.5 million people, is the nation's 21st largest, according to the Census.
''We were blissfully ignorant,'' said Mark Lowderman, the assessor in El Paso County, where the County Commission -- all five members are Republicans -- passed a four-month emergency timeout last month on any drilling to get ready to write regulations. ''We're trying to learn as fast as we can,'' Mr. Lowderman said.
Rick Davis is among those caught in the middle. His roots run deep in what was once wind-dusted agricultural country outside Colorado Springs. His father, Joe, growing up in the Great Depression, long talked about the day a geologist came through the area and said he thought there might be oil under the ranch. The story became family legend -- if you sell the land, Mr. Davis preached to his children, keep the rights to the minerals beneath.
They listened. And when the landmen, as oil-lease buyers are called, contacted Rick Davis's 88-year-old mother, Ruth, this year, he advised her to follow Joe's dream and take the money.
Other people, like Gene Fatton, are fighting back. Mr. Fatton, an engineer in the suburbs of Fort Collins, an hour north of Denver, has peppered state regulators ever since a drilling platform was built about a hundred yards behind his house last winter -- on top of a former landfill that he knew in his engineer's heart was a very bad place to base heavy machinery.
''They're trying to do the right thing,'' Mr. Fatton said of the environmental regulators who finally came and looked at the site, and scratched their heads at the garbage beneath the concrete drill pad. ''They're just understaffed in dealing with this.''
But in many places where housing construction in boom times led to congestion, traffic and air quality concerns, the debate over oil is tangled with questions over what the land should be.
Mr. Davis, a senior appraiser at the El Paso County assessor's office, said he thinks that drilling, in an odd way, could protect the countryside he loves from housing sprawl. Where there are wells, he said, houses might not go, leaving the wide open spaces still wide open.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 26, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the debate surrounding oil and gas drilling near metropolitan areas misidentified one of the earlier jobs held by Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, where the demand for drilling in the more populous eastern part of the state has increased. He was a geologist, not a petroleum engineer.

HEADLINE: Adoption Is Not a Laughing Matter for Anyone

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Mea (Totally Sincere, if Overdue) Culpa,'' by James Collins (Op-Ed, Oct. 17), while tongue in cheek, was still so offensive that I hardly know where to begin. 
As an adult adoptee, I have listened to all the reporting about Steve Jobs's death with weariness. We adoptees are by turns curiosities, objects of derision and seemingly another species that some people just do not comprehend.
I've heard other adult adoptees describe us as ''the last bastion of legal discrimination'' for the lack of rights we have (in most states) to our own histories. Who would make such derogatory jokes about any ethnic group, physically or mentally disabled group or economically disadvantaged group?
It is not funny when a child, for whatever reason, cannot be reared by the people who created him. It is a tragedy for that family, yet one that turns into joy for another family. This conundrum is difficult to reconcile, and we adoptees often have to do it internally and alone. There is nothing to laugh about.
Adoptees have two sets of ''real'' parents, the ones who created us and relinquished their parental legal rights, for whatever reason, in the best interest of the child; and the parents who chose to raise us, who stayed up when we were sick, who helped us with our homework and who gave us a family tree (because most of us weren't allowed to know our biological families).
This article has no redeeming value, and surely mine is not the only day that was saddened because of it. Mr. Collins owes Mark Zuckerberg, his parents, Mr. Jobs's biological parents (his adoptive parents are deceased) and me an apology.

 BODY:
NEW STATION FOR THOMAS Mattel agreed on Monday to buy Hit Entertainment, owner of popular preschool toy brands like Thomas the Tank Engine, below, and Bob the Builder, for $680 million in cash from a group led by Apax Partners. 
The deal is one of Mattel's larger acquisitions, adding another popular stable of children's brands to a portfolio that already includes Barbie and Fisher Price. The deal will allow Hit to pay off its large debt load, put in place when the company was acquired by Apax in 2005 for $:489.4 million. Last year, Hit reached an accord with its lenders to push debt maturities to next year, in exchange for higher interest rates. MICHAEL J. de la MERCED
SHEDDING AN ASSET Morgan Stanley has sold its mortgage servicing company, a deal that will net the Wall Street firm $59.3 million in cash.
The Ocwen Financial Corporation, which bought the unit, Saxon Mortgage Services, has also agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $1.4 billion for servicing outstanding receivables. Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006 for more than $700 million when the mortgage boom was in the full force. This market has all but dried up, and Morgan Stanley and other firms have been selling these divisions in recent years.
CUTTING A PLEA DEAL The recent guilty plea by Drew K. Brownstein to an insider trading charge illustrates how a potential sentence can be reduced by leaving out transactions that lower the gain from the illegal trading, according to White Collar Watch.
In securities fraud charge filed on Friday, Mr. Brownstein pleaded guilty to making $2.5 million. In parallel civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Mr. Brownstein, however, he is accused of realizing $5 million from his insider trading. PETER J. HENNING
HOSTILE TAKEOVER BID Plains All-American Pipeline, a large energy company, is taking its unsolicited offer to buy a rival, SemGroup, for $1 billion in cash directly to SemGroup's shareholders, the company announced in a letter to the company made public on Monday.
The bid of $24 a share for SemGroup, which was made on Oct. 6 and rejected by the company's board shortly thereafter, is the second time Plains has tried to buy SemGroup, which is based in Oklahoma. In March 2010, Plains made an unsuccessful bid of $17 a share. Its latest proposal valued SemGroup at an enterprise value of $1.24 billion. KEVIN ROOSE

HEADLINE: Are Law Schools and Bar Exams Necessary?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD WINSTON. 
Clifford Winston, an economist and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the co-author of ''First Thing We Do, Let's Deregulate All the Lawyers.''

 BODY:
Washington
FOR decades the legal industry has operated as a monopoly, which has been made possible by its self-imposed rules and state licensing restrictions -- namely, the requirements that lawyers must graduate from an American Bar Association-accredited law school and pass a state bar examination. The industry claims these requirements are essential quality-control measures because consumers do not have sufficient information to judge in advance whether a lawyer is competent and honest. In reality, though, occupational licensure has been costly and ineffective; it misleads consumers about the quality of licensed lawyers and the potential for non-lawyers to provide able assistance.
Rather than improving quality, the barriers to entry exist simply to protect lawyers from competition with non-lawyers and firms that are not lawyer-owned -- competition that could reduce legal costs and give the public greater access to legal assistance. 
In fact, the existing legal licensing system doesn't even do a great job at protecting clients from exploitation. In 2009, the state disciplinary agencies that cover the roughly one million lawyers practicing in the United States received more than 125,000 complaints, according to an A.B.A. survey. But only 800 of those complaints -- a mere 0.6 percent -- resulted in disbarment.
What if the barriers to entry were simply done away with?
Legal costs would be reduced because non-lawyers, who have not had to make a costly investment in a three-year legal education, would compete with lawyers, who in many states are the only options for basic services like drafting wills. Because they will have incurred much lower costs to enter the field -- like taking an online course or attending a vocational school -- and can operate as solo practitioners with minimal overhead, these non-lawyers would force prices to fall. The poor would benefit from the lower prices for non-criminal matters, and poor litigants, who might be unrepresented in criminal matters like hearings because they could not afford a lawyer and because of dwindling state legal aid, would be better off.
At the same time, if corporations -- and not just law firms, now structured as partnerships -- could provide legal representation, their technological sophistication and economies of scale could offer much more affordable services than established law firms do. These firms, in turn, would have to reduce prices to compete.
Of course, lower legal prices would cause new law school graduates to be paid less, but more jobs would be available for such graduates because the demand for lawyers would increase. And new graduates would begin their careers with less law-school debt, because alternative providers of legal education would force law schools to reduce tuition.
Leaving aside the matter of letting non-lawyers and non-lawyer-owned firms do legal work, more could be done to enhance consumer choice and attorney accountability. One practical measure for more effectively regulating the field and lowering costs would be for third parties to compete to provide accurate and useful information about the quality of lawyers. Third-party providers of legal services information could do a service similar to that provided by Consumer Reports and Zagat Survey and effectively regulate the legal profession by monitoring the law firms' performance and effectiveness.
Consumers would be in a position to demand credible and complete information about a practitioner. Incompetent and dishonest lawyers would face immediate exposure over social and legal networks, thereby alerting other consumers of potential problems with their services. By sharing their experiences, consumers would understand more fully which credentials and evaluations are the most accurate and useful signals of competence and value.
Thanks to resistance from lawyers themselves, strong competition has not developed in the market for information. The efforts of a leading legal-information provider, Avvo, have been the target of a class-action suit filed by lawyers who disapprove of the firm's ratings system. By threatening lawsuits and not cooperating with Avvo's requests for information about attorneys' licensing and disciplinary records, several states have impeded Avvo's ability to provide information. But in the absence of an open, competitive approach to information about the quality of legal services, the existing licensing and discipline system creates a false sense of security.
To protect clients from bad lawyers, current barriers to entry try to separate the wheat from the chaff among potential legal practitioners. A market for information, though, would let consumers identify the chaff more precisely, saving more of the wheat. It is worth recalling that two of the finest lawyers and civil rights advocates our country has ever produced, Abraham Lincoln and Clarence Darrow, would not be allowed to practice law today under current rules. (Lincoln was self-taught; Darrow attended the University of Michigan Law School but did not graduate.) Eliminating entry barriers and allowing non-lawyers to perform legal services would, among many other gains, ensure that such talents have a place within our legal system.

HEADLINE: U.S. Pivots Eastward To Address Uneasy Allies

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Michael Wines contributed reporting from Beijing.

 BODY:
YOKOTA AIR BASE, Japan -- China was never mentioned, but when a sailor in the Japanese Navy asked Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta here on Monday whether the United States planned to cut back its forces in Asia, Mr. Panetta knew exactly what he meant.
''I want to make very clear that the United States is going to remain a presence in the Pacific for a long time,'' Mr. Panetta responded. ''That means, just so you understand, that we are not anticipating any cutbacks in this region. If anything, we're going to strengthen our presence in the Pacific.''
Mr. Panetta's message, delivered the day before in Indonesia as well and certain to be repeated later this week when he travels to South Korea, is the new call of the Obama administration as it winds down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and scrambles to project its power in Asia. But this eastward pivot, meant to shore up Asian alliances and send a clear signal that the United States opposes China's claims to island territories far beyond its shores, comes at a difficult time. 
Like everyone else, Asian allies see an ailing American economy and coming Pentagon budget cuts -- at least $450 billion over the next decade -- and a growing isolationism among Republicans eager for the White House. Just last week, Mitt Romney suggested at a debate that the United States should, in effect, outsource some of its foreign aid to China. ''It doesn't make a lot of sense for us to borrow money from the Chinese to go give to another country for humanitarian aid,'' he said. ''We ought to get the Chinese to take care of the people.''
Pentagon officials say there are no plans to reduce the 85,000 American service members in the Pacific or to cut back the 7 of 11 aircraft carriers based in the region. But they are concerned that a Congressional deficit reduction panel may fail in its mission to find additional budget cuts next month, setting off automatic across-the-board reductions of another $600 billion from the Pentagon. Defense officials say that it would be catastrophic and that it could force troop reductions in the Pacific. They argue that even a small drawdown of, say, 5,000 troops would be seen in the region as a symbolic retreat even as China rapidly expands its military capabilities.
In China, analysts say a military modernization program for the People's Liberation Army is a delayed and essential upgrading after decades when the Communist Party subordinated military needs to civilian ones. In the Chinese military's view, the buildup is needed to defend against what it sees as a growing and potentially unfriendly American presence in the Pacific.
''It's a serious threat and a potential threat,'' Sun Zhe, the director of Tsinghua University's Center on United States-China relations, said in an interview late last year, citing the seven American aircraft carriers and 18 American nuclear submarines in the region. ''If you say they are only targeting North Korea, nobody will believe it.''
In the United States, there are concerns that the Pentagon is using China's military buildup to justify expensive new weapons systems and that it is overlooking the larger economic, diplomatic and trading challenges posed by Beijing. ''We trivialize that challenge if we focus exclusively on the military modernization program,'' said Roy D. Kamphausen, a China expert at the National Bureau of Asian Research and a former China specialist at the Pentagon. ''Our Navy and Air Force need to modernize for their own reasons and not just on the basis of a nascent Chinese threat,'' he said in an interview on Monday.
Mr. Panetta, who is on his first trip to Asia as defense secretary, is setting the stage for President Obama, who next month will host a summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Hawaii and will attend a regional conference in Indonesia. Mr. Obama's voice will be the loudest in the administration's message that over the next 10 years in the region, the United States needs ''a substantially increased investment -- diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise,'' as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton put it in an essay this month on ''America's Pacific Century'' in Foreign Policy.
Militarily, China is not equipped to mount a frontal challenge to the United States. China's total military budget last year was an estimated $160 billion -- roughly a tripling since the 1990s. By comparison, the Pentagon spent more than $500 billion in 2010, or closer to $700 billion if the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are included. Although the P.L.A.'s estimated 1.25 million ground troops makes it the largest in the world (there are about 750,000 active-duty United States Army soldiers and Marines), American defense officials say there is a vast difference in training and ability.
But nearly all of China's military spending is Asia-focused, while only a portion of American spending is. And in lessons learned from the Soviet Union during the cold war, American defense officials say the Chinese are not trying to compete comprehensively with the United States, but ''asymmetrically'' in the place where they have the advantage. As a result, they say, the Chinese are developing antiship ballistic missiles, potentially capable of attacking American aircraft carriers in the Pacific, and are in sea trials with their own aircraft carrier, a refitted Soviet era-carrier from Ukraine.
The Chinese are also developing a new-generation stealth jet fighter, the J-20, which they conspicuously sent on its first test flight this year during a high-profile visit by Robert M. Gates to Beijing while he was still defense secretary. Not least, a recent Pentagon report on the Chinese military said that numerous intrusions into computer systems around the world last year appeared to have originated in China, and that developing capabilities for cyberwarfare ''is consistent'' with authoritative Chinese military writings.
In response, the Pentagon has stepped up investments in a range of weapons, jet fighters and technology, including in a new long-range nuclear-capable bomber aircraft, which the Pentagon had stopped developing in 2009, as well as a new generation of electronic jammers for the Navy that are designed to prevent a missile from finding and hitting a target. The Pentagon has bolstered its cyberwarfare capabilities and is developing a highly classified war strategy for Asia, called AirSea Battle Concept, aimed at coordinating naval and air forces in the Pacific.
Mr. Panetta is adding his own voice. ''China is rapidly modernizing its military,'' he wrote in an opinion article published on Monday in the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, ''but with a troubling lack of transparency, coupled with increasingly assertive activity in the East and South China Seas.''

HEADLINE: Yes, Those Are Tom, Becky and Huck Leaping

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- On Thursday I was exploring America's oldest grand opera house still used for its original purpose, the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Over the weekend I was discovering its newest auditorium for opera and ballet, the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts here in Kansas City.
The Muriel Kauffman Theater, like the Academy, has three tiers (with side boxes) above orchestra-mezzanine level; it seats 1,800. The shape is horseshoe; acoustics and sightlines on first view seem excellent, no seat remote. The main color is white, with red velvet seats, a purple curtain and unifying Harlequin-colored patterns visible through Venetian blinds behind the boxes on either side. At both performances I attended there was considerable audience excitement about both the theater and the center.
The center, already a landmark, opened in September. The exterior is a bold white array of patterned curves, with a line of wires like flying buttresses at the front, all above extensive parking space. It also houses a concert hall, and the all-white foyers provide ample space to audiences of both halls. By evening, these foyers are glamorous and spectacular; the all-glass facade gives a spacious view over the city. At a sunny matinee, however, the glass and all that white make the foyers inconveniently bright: as you leave the auditorium, you want to put on sunglasses. 
My visit was to see the first new production there by the 54-year-old Kansas City Ballet: a new three-act ''Tom Sawyer'' (adapted from Mark Twain's 1876 classic Missouri novel), to a new score by Maury Yeston, and with choreography by the company's artistic director, William Whitener. It's quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet: it is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company.
After beginning the project many years ago, Mr. Yeston completed it in collaboration with Mr. Whitener. As a result, music and stage action complement each other all the way. The ballet is most remarkable in places where I would have least predicted.
The familiar story has been harmlessly, often shrewdly rejiggered to give the ballet just enough plot. The return of Tom and Huckleberry Finn from their pirate expedition in time to interrupt their own funeral is the climax of Act I, the nocturnal graveyard killing of the Doctor that of Act II. Act III brings the trial of Muff Potter for murder, with Tom's testimony to save Potter; Tom and Becky Thatcher's getting lost in the cave; and -- after the recovery of Injun Joe's loot -- a happy ending.
Before arrival, I kept wondering, what does Twain's story have to do with dance, let alone ballet? The ballet's authors, however, had plainly asked the same question, since much of the restructuring's effect is to supply enough dances. Yet the two scenes that come nearest to triteness are its two chunks of standard ballet formula: an extended dance suite for fireflies and supernatural beings (goblins, ghosts, sprites) in Act II and a pas de deux for hero and heroine (Tom and Becky in the cave) in Act III -- though the fireflies have some poetry and virtuosity; the spooks have some comedy and bravura; and the love duet is tender, plot-led and unshowy.
By contrast, the ballet is finest and most original in several places where the plot has challenged Mr. Yeston and Mr. Whitener to find a dance equivalent. Act I starts with the famous fence-painting scene, an engaging male pas de trois for Tom's friends (successfully individualized). Town, schoolroom, church are all clearly delineated (helped by Walt Spangler's economical but evocative decor, with the barest wooden framework for each building descending on cue, and Holly Hynes's costumes). The Act III courtroom scene, which should be so dance-hostile, is made vivid by effects of grouping and gesture. Not all narrative moments are made clear onstage (how does Tom persuade his pals to paint the fence?), but there's no serious confusion.
Both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naive (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain. Mr. Yeston's tuneful music (though no one melody lodges firmly in the head) has been orchestrated by Brad Dechter (with assistance from Peter Boyer, Andrew Kinney and Hummie -- what a name for a composer! -- Mann), with sonorities and harmonies that recall Copland, Barber and Prokofiev (''Romeo and Juliet''). It ranges easily from comic to sinister, from Muff Potter's drunkenness to a rich celebration of the Mississippi River.
In Mr. Whitener's staging each character is distinctive -- none becoming one-dimensional -- but all can be part of an affecting small-town ensemble. All these folk, as in Twain, have at least a streak of cartoon vitality.
Tom, marvelously danced by the young redhead Alexander Peters, is life-enhancing, with a new set of steps in every scene. For his second entry in Act I, he comes on in a cartwheel, only to arrive in a fluent, hopping, revolving arabesque (a horizontal one) -- an effect so fresh it lights up the stage. Sometimes just tiny strokes -- the way one of Tom's friends enters with a high-sailing jump; the slow, juicy way Becky rises onto point -- are so timed that they become piercing.
The Kansas City dancers are delights in their jumps; footwork; full-bodied, three-dimensional shapes; and lively characterization. At the end Mr. Whitener gives the townspeople a heart-catchingly sweeping adagio group dance. As it keeps changing in pattern and direction, the dancers seem to become both the Mississippi itself and the whole spirit of community and history. Other ensembles are scarcely less poetic: The human waves in which Tom and his classmates twice cross the stage are the kind of interlude that makes theater thrilling.
Kansas City Ballet has also gained another new home: the Todd Bolender Center, an old power plant beautifully converted (after 50 years of neglect) into a home for rehearsals, classes and administration for both the company and its school, some 600 people in all. As many New Yorkers know, Bolender, who died in 2006, was an important Balanchine dancer for many years; his work as artistic director of Kansas City Ballet did much to give it its current prominence. Mr. Whitener, who succeeded him in 1996 and maintains Bolender ballets in repertory, enriches the company further with this ''Tom Sawyer.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Begin Groundwork for Talks

BYLINE: By NICK CUMMING-BRUCE and CHOE SANG-HUN; Nick Cumming-Bruce reported from Geneva, and Choe Sang-Hun from Seoul, South Korea.

 BODY:
GENEVA -- The United States and North Korea began two days of talks here on Monday that American officials have said will test the ground for a possible resumption of wider discussions on North Korea's nuclear program.
A convoy of vehicles brought Kim Kye-gwan, North Korea's first vice foreign minister, to the United States mission in Geneva exactly on schedule at 10 a.m. for the first round of talks with a team of American negotiators led by President Obama's special envoy for North Korea policy, Stephen W. Bosworth. 
In a statement at the end of the first day of talks, Mr. Bosworth said: ''I think we are moving in a positive direction. We have narrowed some differences, but we still have differences that we have to resolve.''
His comments came after a working dinner with the North Korean delegation that he described as ''very positive.'' He added: ''I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but as I said, we have made some progress. But we have issues still to resolve, and we will work hard to do that.''
American officials said last week that the discussions were intended to determine whether North Korea was ''serious about engaging in talks and fulfilling its commitments under the 2005 joint statement of the six-party talks and its nuclear, international obligations, as well as take concrete steps toward denuclearization.''
North Korea agreed in September 2005 to abandon its nuclear programs in exchange for economic assistance and diplomatic incentives from other parties to the six-party talks, which include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea, in addition to North Korea and the United States.
But the agreement collapsed in a dispute over how thoroughly North Korea should reveal its nuclear activities and subject its nuclear facilities to outside inspections. North Korea's continuing nuclear activities, its testing of missiles and the lethal shelling of a South Korean island -- as well as the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, which the South said was attacked by the North -- all added to the chill in relations.
The Geneva meetings nonetheless follow hints of a thaw, including talks in New York in July between American and North Korean officials. And on Friday, the Pentagon announced that officials had reached agreement on a resumption of the search for the remains of Americans killed in the Korean War of 1950-53.
Also on Monday, China urged North Korea, an ally, to improve its strained ties with the United States and South Korea, state media reported Monday.
The prospect of talks came amid a background of criticism that both the United States and South Korea were withholding aid for political reasons, tying it to progress in negotiations.
North Koreans, especially children, urgently need outside aid to fight ''terrible levels of malnutrition,'' the top United Nations humanitarian official said Monday.
''Six million North Koreans urgently need food aid, but the outside world is not giving enough,'' the official, Valerie Amos, said in a news conference after a fact-finding trip to North Korea last week. ''We need to remember the most vulnerable people in North Korea are victims of a situation over which they have no control. They are suffering from no fault of their own.''
Nearly half of North Korean children were chronically malnourished and the situation has been ''getting worse,'' she said, with North Korea running a shortage of one million tons of food a year. Food aid was especially needed after summer flooding.
In the past several months, Washington has asked nongovernmental agencies -- and sent its own team in May -- to assess the humanitarian situation. But it has yet to announce a decision on aid, months after five American relief agencies recommended urgent shipments.
''The United States, along with other nations, has made a modest contribution to flood assistance,'' a senior State Department official said on the condition of anonymity in mid-September, after Washington's decision to grant $900,000 in flood relief for the North.
''And I think it would be fair to say that we are still awaiting a clear signal'' from the North, the official said, ''about what their response is to our overall proposals.''
Officially, the United States and South Korea say they do not link humanitarian aid to political issues. In Seoul, officials noted pockets of malnutrition in North Korea, but doubted that there was a nationwide food crisis of the kind that killed many thousands in the mid-1990s.
But David Austin, the North Korea program director for the relief group Mercy Corps, said his team had found those pockets ''throughout the country'' on recent trips, adding that people there ''are starving to death.''
''It's all wrapped in a political process,'' he said of food aid.
In April, the United Nations appealed for $218 million in emergency aid. Only one-third of that amount has been pledged, amid tension over North Korea's provocative behavior and questions about whether North Korea diverts food aid to its military and governing elite.
Online Correction: October 24, 2011, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Clifford Hart. He is the American special envoy to the wider six-nation talks on North Korea. It had been posted with him as envoy simply for ''the talks,'' implying these two-party talks.

HEADLINE: Disorder in the N.F.L.

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Just when you think you might have figured out some order amid the sports chaos, weekends like this one come along and it turns out chaos was just sitting back, waiting for another chance to turn all of your expectations into punch lines. It's kind of like that annoying uncle who finds just the right opening to mess up your hair at family gatherings.
The N.F.L. took particular delight in throwing its story lines into the blender and hitting puree. Take the Detroit Lions, who were feeling so King of the Forest at 5-0 and now find themselves being booed at Ford Field, after a humbling loss to the once-lost Falcons. The Jets, in contrast, went from asphyxiating themselves with their own hot air to playing the role of comeback kids led by the suddenly reliable Plaxico Burress, a switch that Filip Bondy of The Daily News marvels at. And those resurgent, win-one-for-Al-Davis Raiders, who swung a huge trade for Carson Palmer because their season had so much promise? They've gambled their way toward oblivion, writes Billy Witz on Foxsports.com, and are searching for two-for-one psychiatry sessions for Palmer and Kyle Boller, writes Scott Ostler in The San Francisco Chronicle. 
Most remarkable of all was the case of Denver and Tim Tebow. For those who expected Tebow to shine in his first start and prove why Broncos fans have decided he can fix everything, including the world's economic woes, they watched him lead the kind of rousing comeback victory over Miami of which legends are made and felt vindicated -- until they stopped to consider the comeback was necessary because he played so spectacularly bad for three quarters against one of the league's most horrendous teams. And those who expected he would show himself utterly overmatched as an N.F.L. quarterback found themselves vindicated but also forced to consider that Tebow does have a knack for winning and any victory in the N.F.L. is a good victory.
So ESPN.com's James Walker explains how Tebow can both fulfill his own mythical qualities while confirming every doubt about him, and Don Banks of SI.com takes time to consider what the Broncos do from here. Mark Kiszla of The Denver Post prefers to appreciate that it's John Elway who is left to evaluate how Elway-like Tebow is going to be.
For now, it seems the only sure thing in the N.F.L. is that Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers can do no wrong.
Those looking for sure things need to steer completely clear of the World Series, where expectations are rewritten by the inning. The chaos machine has taken particular delight in messing with Albert Pujols, who swings from baseball's Superman to a guy who cannot get the ball out of the infield, writes Scott Miller on CBSSports.com. But, as Bernie Miklasz writes in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Pujols was not the only Cardinal to lose discipline at the plate in the Rangers' 4-0 victory, and they all made Texas starter Derek Holland look like a genius. So, Holland became one of the Series' more unlikely saviors, writes Ben Reiter on SI.com, mostly because he looks 15. Steve Hanson writes on Yahoo.com that it seemed we watched him grow up, all in one game. Foxsports.com's Mark Kriegel does offer proper credit to Rangers catcher Mike Napoli, while ESPN.com's Gene Wojciechowski tries to figure out a series with a multiple personality disorder.
If you were looking for order in college football, you got very little this weekend thanks to Michigan State's wild victory over Wisconsin, Bruce Feldman writes on CBSSports.com. Now, it's all veering toward the big showdown between Louisiana State and Alabama, writes Mark Schlabach on ESPN.com, although Oklahoma State might be feeling pretty good perched at No. 3.
No one is feeling good these days at Manchester United, where the expectations Tilt-a-Whirl might have hit hardest this weekend. Sir Alex Ferguson called the 6-1 drubbing by Manchester City his worst day ever.
You can excuse his overstatement. He is not the only one feeling a bit disoriented after this weekend. There was a lot of that going around.

HEADLINE: Summer Doldrums Continue to Fade

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States closed higher Monday, extending the trend in global markets on the announcement of some strong corporate results, mergers and hope for an agreement on resolving Europe's debt problems.
Wall Street started the trading week fresh from a rally on Friday that had pulled the Dow Jones industrial average out of negative territory and sent it 2 percent higher for the year. The Nasdaq composite index joined the Dow in positive territory on Monday, up 1.7 percent for the year to date, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which measures the broader market, rose 1.2 percent.
At the close, the Dow was up 0.89 percent, 104.83 points, at 11,913.62 and the S.& P. 500 was up 1.29 percent at 1,254.19. The Nasdaq gained 2.35 percent to 2,699.44. 
The financial sector, materials and information technology were each about 2 percent higher in trading on Monday.
Analysts said that the markets had come out of the slump of the summer months to post solid gains since early October on the back of relatively encouraging news. They pointed to good third-quarter results in several bellwether companies, economic data that showed slow growth rather than none and glimmers of movement in Europe toward addressing its sovereign debt crisis.
''We have had a very substantial rally,'' said Paul Zemsky, the chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at ING Investment Management. ''Stocks were looking cheap from a valuation perspective.''
Strong manufacturing data from China on Monday helped drive a rally in Asian markets that carried through to other regions, said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ''It is definitely a risk-on day,'' he said.
Among the other drivers of the solid market performance Monday, analysts said, were mergers and corporate earnings.
A $3.8 billion acquisition of HealthSpring by the Cigna Corporation, which is seeking to expand in Medicare and senior care coverage, pushed Cigna shares up 1.4 percent at $45.34. HealthSpring's shares jumped 34 percent to close at $53.71.
In another deal in the sector, Cubist Pharmaceuticals announced that it would acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Adolor Corporation, another drug company, for $4.25 a share in cash, a deal worth about $190 million. Adolor shares more than doubled, to $4.67, while Cubist shed 1.9 percent at $39.60.
The technology sector was helped by a 19 percent climb in RightNow Technologies shares to $42.94. Oracle said on Monday that it had entered into an agreement to acquire the company, which is a leading provider of cloud-based customer service, for $43 a share, or approximately $1.5 billion, net of RightNow's cash and debt.
Sentiment was also helped, according to Eric Viloria, senior strategist at Forex.com, by remarks from William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who said that it was possible the Fed could do a new round of stimulus. Caterpillar, which analysts called a bellwether, helped to drive the industrials sector higher after the company reported third-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts' forecasts. Its shares rose more than 5 percent to $91.77.
Mr. Viloria also said in a note that the markets showed ''cautious optimism'' regarding the European Union meetings.
The markets in the United States opened to news that Europe's leaders had made some progress on a package of measures aimed at addressing their financial and economic problems.
A big issue that is still looming before a European summit meeting Wednesday is how to make a stability fund of 440 billion euros ($611 billion) sufficient to cover Spain and Italy, if necessary, in addition to Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
''Even if euro zone policy makers do manage to take a major step forward on Wednesday, this is only really the application of a much stronger bandage over the euro zone's sovereign debt problems, rather than dealing with the root cause,'' Howard Archer, an economist for IHS Global Insight, said in a research note.
The United States 10-year Treasury bond fell to 99 2/32, from 99 7/32 Friday. The yield was 2.23 percent.

HEADLINE: Vatican Calls for Oversight Of the World's Finances

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO; Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican called on Monday for an overhaul of the world's financial systems, and again proposed establishment of a supranational authority to oversee the global economy, calling it necessary to bring more democratic and ethical principles to a marketplace run amok.
In a report issued by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Vatican argued that ''politics -- which is responsible for the common good'' must be given primacy over the economy and finance, and that existing institutions like the International Monetary Fund had not been responding adequately to global economic problems. 
The document grows out of the Roman Catholic Church's concerns about economic instability and widening inequality of income and wealth around the world, issues that transcend the power of national governments to address on their own.
''The time has come to conceive of institutions with universal competence, now that vital goods shared by the entire human family are at stake, goods which the individual states cannot promote and protect by themselves,'' Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, the president of the pontifical council, said as he presented the report on Monday. ''That is what pushed us.''
The language in the document, which the Vatican refers to as a note, is distinctively strong. ''We should not be afraid to propose new ideas, even if they might destabilize pre-existing balances of power that prevail over the weakest,'' the document states.
The message prompted comparisons with the rallying cries of protest movements that have been challenging the financial world order, like the indignados in Madrid and the Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York City. Still, Vatican officials said the document was not a manifesto for disaffected dissidents.
''The document proposes ideas that seem to be in line with those proposed by the indignados, but really we are in line with the Magisterium of the church,'' said Bishop Mario Toso, secretary to the pontifical council, referring to the church's teaching authority. ''It is a coincidence that we share some views. But after all, these are proposals that are based on reasonableness.''
The document is a reminder that the Catholic Church, without getting involved in policymaking, still seeks to shape its principles. ''To function correctly the economy needs ethics; and not just of any kind, but one that is people-centered,'' the document states, paraphrasing an encyclical that Pope Benedict XVI issued in 2009 calling for greater social responsibility in the economy.
In the United States, the report was embraced by politically liberal Catholics who are concerned about the widening gap between rich and poor. Vincent J. Miller, a professor of Catholic theology and culture at the University of Dayton, wrote, ''It's clear the Vatican stands with the Occupy Wall Street protesters and others struggling to return ethics and good governance to a financial sector grown out of control after 30 years of deregulation.''
John Gehring of Faith in Public Life, a liberal advocacy group in Washington, said, ''In the next Republican presidential debate, someone should ask Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, both proudly Catholic, whether they support the Vatican's call for more robust financial reform.''
Politically conservative Catholics, meanwhile, hastened to assure their camp that the document does not carry the full force of church teaching, since it was produced by a Vatican office, not by the pope himself. And some dismissed the report as nothing new, or simply misinformed.
Writing in the National Review, Samuel Gregg of the Acton Institute, which promotes free-market economic policies, said of the document: ''It reflects rather conventional contemporary economic thinking. Unfortunately, given the uselessness of much present-day economics, that's not likely to make it especially helpful.''

HEADLINE: Expansion of Mortgage Refinancing Program Is Limited in Scope

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Las Vegas, and Trip Gabriel from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government's expansion of a mortgage refinancing program could reduce the monthly payments of up to one million homeowners, but analysts said the modest scope of the plan meant it would probably do little to heal the housing market or help the broader economy.
The effort, built on sweeping voluntary agreements with the mortgage industry to let people refinance even if their homes have declined in value, reflects a new White House emphasis on economic measures that do not require Congress to overcome its bitter partisan divisions. 
It also maintains a choice President Obama made in the early days of his administration to focus on reducing monthly payments rather than on the amounts that borrowers owe, the latter being what a growing number of liberal and conservative economists consider necessary to resolve the problem.
Republicans, including the presidential candidates, generally oppose federal aid for distressed homeowners as a bailout for people who made bad choices. The new program, and the emphasis on unilateral action, seem likely to inflame that opposition.
The plan's modesty, meanwhile, may not assuage Democrats' anger at the administration for doing too little to help homeowners repair their shattered finances, particularly in the face of evidence that the housing crisis is a major impediment to renewed economic growth.
Speaking in Las Vegas on Monday -- in the center of the housing crisis and in a presidential battleground state -- Mr. Obama addressed both groups of critics. The problems required government action, he said, and while the new changes were not by themselves sufficient, ''that is no excuse for inaction.''
''I'm here to say that we can't wait for an increasingly dysfunctional Congress to do its job,'' he said. ''Where they won't act, I will.'' He added, however, that Congress should pass the measures he proposed in September to stimulate growth, create jobs and help the housing market.
Most of the Republican presidential candidates argue that the government should focus on repairing the economy, which will help the housing market. In the meantime, they have said, offering relief to homeowners threatened with foreclosure would be an intrusion into the free market.
''The right course is to let markets work,'' Mitt Romney said at a debate in Las Vegas last week. Rick Santorum concurred. Herman Cain said, ''We need to get government out of the way.''
Monday's announcement is an effort to revive a program that has fallen well short of expectations since it was announced in 2009. Under the program, the government-owned mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have financed new loans for almost one million borrowers who could not qualify for traditional loans because of declines in their homes' values.
The expansion, announced by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, aims to double that number -- although that would still be a small share of the more than 10 million homeowners with loan balances larger than the values of their homes.
''We have far too many Americans who have paid their bills and done everything right on their mortgages and yet they're still stuck with interest rates of 6 or 7 percent,'' said Shaun Donovan, secretary of housing and urban development.
The changes, which will take effect over several months, will let people qualify for new loans no matter how far the values of their homes have fallen, so long as they have made at least six consecutive monthly payments. The plan also will reduce borrowers' fees, for example, by dispensing with the need for an appraisal in many cases and by automatically transferring mortgage insurance to the new loan.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generally require refinancing lenders to assume responsibility for any problems with the original loan because in making the new loan they are relying in part on that original documentation. That has made lenders reluctant to refinance loans for which they are not already responsible. That provision will now be waived, in exchange for a fee.
But the program still applies only to loans that Fannie and Freddie acquired before May 31, 2009. It does not reduce the amount that borrowers owe. And only borrowers with less than 20 percent equity in their homes are eligible; those with more equity must seek a refinancing through the standard and more expensive channels, although the government is considering making some of the same changes, like reducing fees, for those borrowers.
Administration officials said Monday that refinancing could reduce the average borrower's annual payments by about $2,500, multiplied by up to one million households -- about $2.5 billion available for spending on other things.
But the actual impact will be smaller, even if the program achieves its goals, because households are not likely to spend all of their savings, and because some of the money will come from other households that held the loans as investments.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described the plan as ''a step in the right direction,'' but said it would not help enough.
''Problems in the housing market are a serious impediment to a stronger economic recovery,'' he said. ''This calls for a comprehensive approach to housing policy, starting with an urgent effort to remove the obstacles that make it difficult for all borrowers to refinance at today's low mortgage rates.''
The flaws in the original program were obvious from the outset, but the administration was unable to wring the necessary concessions from the mortgage industry or even from Edward J. DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has resisted various proposals as inconsistent with his primary responsibility to limit the losses of Fannie and Freddie.
A few months ago, Mr. DeMarco agreed under prodding from the administration to convene a meeting with industry representatives to review the shortcomings of the program and the continuing problems in the housing market. It quickly became clear that the experience of the last few years had engendered a much greater willingness to make the necessary compromises. For example, borrowers who took out two mortgage loans, and cannot afford to repay the second loan, cannot refinance the first loan without the permission of the second lender. The government has now negotiated a blanket grant of permission from many large lenders.
Mr. DeMarco said Monday that the agency had concluded that the expanded program would save money by reducing defaults.
Gene Sperling, director of the president's National Economic Council, said, ''What has changed and made this more viable and led the president to push all of us even harder was that there was a growing awareness among all the stakeholders'' that this problem needed to be addressed.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. Owners' Mutual Dependence Outweighs Divisions

BYLINE: By HOWARD BECK and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Paul Allen strode into the N.B.A.'s labor talks last week as a $13.2 billion curiosity and an embodiment of an apparent contradiction that typifies the league's owners.
Allen, who owns the Portland Trail Blazers, advocates slashing player salaries to help small-market franchises like his compete with those in New York, Los Angeles and Boston. He supports the owners' recent ultimatum to players: a 50-50 split of league revenue, and no more.
But he is also the 23rd-wealthiest person in America, according to Forbes, and the N.B.A.'s second-richest owner. Allen could single-handedly bankroll the league three times over, yet he stands with the most strident hard-liners pushing for the greatest possible concessions from the players, a fact acknowledged by officials on both sides.
His stance is not as odd as it may seem. For all of their disparate interests and competitive impulses, the N.B.A. owners are bound by mutual interests (like reducing expenses) and a mutual dependence. The Celtics and the Lakers may enjoy feasting on the Cavaliers and Timberwolves, but their owners recognize that the league needs as many healthy franchises as possible. The N.B.A. is not 30 independent businesses, but a 30-way partnership. 
The owners remain unified for now in seeking big givebacks from the players -- even at the cost of canceling games. But their views cannot be easily categorized by market size, revenue, personal wealth or championship aspirations. In a Venn diagram, the owners would show overlap in their core objectives, but different preferences for achieving them and different thresholds for how many games they are willing to lose.
''Externally, they have uniformity, but internally, there is a debate and different interests by different teams,'' said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp, a sports consulting firm. ''There is uniformity on meaningfully changing the system. But what that means can mean different things to different people.''
Consider the two men whose teams competed for the title in June:
Micky Arison, whose Miami Heat play in the N.B.A.'s 14th-largest market, is among the owners most eager to settle, according to people close to the talks. Mark Cuban, whose Dallas Mavericks play in the league's fifth-largest market and have one of its highest payrolls, is one of the most intractable. Both rank in the top 200 on Forbes's billionaire listings.
In an interview last week, Commissioner David Stern warned against painting with too broad a brush when characterizing the owners. He pointed to the membership of the league's labor committee, which includes big- and small-market teams, fabulously wealthy owners and less so, and owners of teams that have won titles and some who rarely make the playoffs.
''The reality is that all of our teams are united in the system changes for competitive reasons,'' he said. ''The teams have come to understand that having a strong, competitive, profitable 30-team league is the goal. There are different methodologies for getting there.''
Defining owners as hawks or doves is simplistic, but it is possible to put them under several umbrellas, Ganis and other sport industry executives said. The largest group, they said, includes owners who are pushing for meaningful changes to the system, whether through a greater share of the league's revenue, a more restrictive salary cap or other mechanisms.
Most of these teams are losing a lot of money and see little chance of overtaking the league's most powerful clubs, even if they spend more on players. This group includes the Blazers, the Cavaliers, the Grizzlies, the Jazz, the Nuggets, the Pacers and the Rockets.
A subset of this group includes owners who bought teams recently or are trying to sell them, and who see the labor talks as the best chance to fix a broken system or to help drive up the price of their franchises. Though these owners are eager to play, they are willing to endure the loss of games to rebalance the league's long-term economics in their favor. This group includes the Bobcats, the Hawks, the Pistons, the Raptors, the 76ers and the Wizards.
Several owners are likely to back Stern regardless of their internal preferences because they are long-term allies or because they are beholden to the league for other reasons. A Celtics co-owner, Wyc Grousbeck, is a confidant of Stern's, according to several people in basketball. Peter Holt, who is the chairman of the league's labor committee and owns the Spurs, is another Stern ally, as is Glen Taylor, the owner of the Timberwolves.
The Maloof brothers, who own the Kings, will side with the commissioner because they need the league's backing to get a new arena in Sacramento. The Hornets are owned by the league.
Then there are the owners who are willing to tolerate more modest modifications to the collective bargaining agreement. People close to the talks say that group includes the Lakers, the league's most profitable franchise; the Knicks, who make money, recently signed two elite players and are renovating their arena; and the Heat, who spent heavily on free agents last season and made it to the N.B.A. finals.
''The guys who want to make a deal are the ones who are fearful of the consequences of not playing,'' one former N.B.A. executive said.
Approval of a new labor deal requires a simple majority, or 16 votes. (The Hornets' vote will be cast by Jac Sperling, who was appointed as the team chairman by the N.B.A.) But Stern would be better served politically by gathering as broad a majority in favor of the deal as he can so he does not have to deal with disaffection later.
Union officials commonly, maybe erroneously, refer to the owners in absolutist terms -- big markets versus small, high revenue versus low. Indeed, when talks broke down last week, the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, named Arison, Cuban and the Lakers' Jerry Buss as owners ready to cut a deal.
''They were open to all kind of proposals or suggestions, anything that could move the ball,'' Hunter said, referring to those three. ''But I think there's a group of owners, the small markets in particular, that were dug in, and I think they're carrying the day.''
Yet Cuban is just as determined to change the N.B.A. economy as some small-market owners, according to a number of people who are informed of his position. Buss's stance is more complex than generally assumed.
The Lakers are wildly profitable and their franchise player, Kobe Bryant, is entering his twilight, which gives Buss every reason to want to cut a deal. But he has maintained a solidarity with the low-revenue teams out of a concern for the league's long-term health. James L. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, has reluctantly taken the same approach.

HEADLINE: Outside Cleveland, Snapshots of Poverty's Surge in the Suburbs

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
PARMA HEIGHTS, Ohio -- The poor population in America's suburbs -- long a symbol of a stable and prosperous American middle class -- rose by more than half after 2000, forcing suburban communities across the country to re-evaluate their identities and how they serve their populations.
The increase in the suburbs was 53 percent, compared with 26 percent in cities. The recession accelerated the pace: two-thirds of the new suburban poor were added from 2007 to 2010.
''The growth has been stunning,'' said Elizabeth Kneebone, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution, who conducted the analysis of census data. ''For the first time, more than half of the metropolitan poor live in suburban areas.'' 
As a result, suburban municipalities -- once concerned with policing, putting out fires and repairing roads -- are confronting a new set of issues, namely how to help poor residents without the array of social programs that cities have, and how to get those residents to services without public transportation. Many suburbs are facing these challenges with the tightest budgets in years.
''The whole political class is just getting the memo that Ozzie and Harriet don't live here anymore,'' said Edward Hill, dean of the Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University.
This shift has helped redefine the image of the suburbs. ''The suburbs were always a place of opportunity -- a better school, a bigger house, a better job,'' said Scott Allard, an associate professor at the University of Chicago who focuses on social welfare policy and poverty. ''Today, that's not as true as the popular mythology would have us believe.''
Since 2000, the poverty roll has increased by five million in the suburbs, with large rises in metropolitan areas as different as Colorado Springs and Greensboro, N.C. Over the decade, Midwestern suburbs ranked high; recently, the rise has been sharpest in communities the housing collapse hit the hardest, like Cape Coral, Fla., and Riverside, Calif., according to the Brookings analysis.
Nearly 60 percent of Cleveland's poor, once concentrated in its urban core, now live in its suburbs, up from 46 percent in 2000. Nationwide, 55 percent of the poor population in metropolitan areas is now in the suburbs, up from 49 percent.
Poverty is new in Parma Heights, a quiet suburb of cul-de-sacs and clipped lawns, and asking for help can be hard. The Parma Heights Food Pantry, which began serving several dozen families a month in 2006, and now helps 260, draws a stream of casualties from the moribund economy. Many never needed food relief before.
Like Mary W., 59, who has worked all her life, most recently at a tire company in Cleveland, and was always the one to remind colleagues to donate to charity. Now she is the one who receives it.
When she first came to the pantry, ''I cried my eyes out,'' said Mary, who asked that her last name not be used because she did not want her children to know about her financial troubles.
At Vineyard Community Church in Wickliffe, another Cleveland suburb, Brent Paulson, the pastor, said he had to post an employee in the driveway the day the church's food bank was open to coax people inside, they were so ashamed to ask for help.
In a sign of just how far the economic distress had spread, one volunteer saw his former boss come to the pantry, Mr. Paulson said.
The Cleveland Food Bank, which serves six counties, doubled its distribution between 2005 and 2010. ''There's this sense of surprise,'' said Anne Goodman, the director, ''this feeling that this has got to be a mistake. It has got to be a bad dream.''
Calls to the United Way social services hot line from suburban areas in northeast Ohio more than doubled from 2005 to 2010, outstripping the increase in cities. ''We are seeing a rise in need in places we never expected it,'' said Stephen Wertheim, director of the hotline, First Call for Help.
Poverty has been growing in the suburbs for years -- along with the population. But the 53 percent increase in poverty far outstripped the 14 percent population increase in the past decade, speeding the change in their status as upper-middle-class enclaves. They have been attracting immigrants following construction jobs and families from cities seeking inexpensive housing as suburbs aged.
Federal vouchers to get poor people into private housing also contributed, Ms. Kneebone said. Cleveland was No. 15 among the country's top 100 metropolitan areas for increase in suburban share of vouchers.
Urban problems have appeared. In Penn Hills, a suburb of Pittsburgh where people have always driven, poor residents walking near yards and bus stops have created trouble with litter, said Alexandra Murphy, a Princeton doctoral student studying suburban poverty.
Warrensville Heights, a suburb southeast of Cleveland, was pristine when Fran Matthews moved there in 1987, with good schools, manicured lawns and middle-class neighbors, she said. Now for-sale signs dot overgrown yards. Break-ins are on the rise, though crime is still far lower than in the city. Over all, the suburban poverty rate -- 11.4 percent in 2010 -- is still far below the city rate of 20.9 percent, according to Ms. Kneebone.
''Now when you come home, you have to look around before you get out of the car,'' Ms. Matthews said.
The changes have affected the school system, she said, and her grandson now attends a charter school in Cleveland.
The double punch of the recession and the foreclosure crisis -- which hit Cleveland and its suburbs particularly hard -- has dragged middle-class people down the income ladder. As defined by the Census Bureau, the poverty line for a family of four was $22,314 last year.
''This community is middle class, but right on the line,'' said Brad Sellers, a retired professional basketball player who grew up in Warrensville Heights and is running for mayor. ''Any dramatic downturn can send you over the edge.''
The unemployment rate among black Americans was 16 percent in September, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- nearly double the national rate, a painful statistic in a suburb that is majority black.
''Where's that 9 percent?'' Mr. Sellers asked. ''Not here.''
Some communities resist the idea that poverty exists. When Ann George, who runs the Parma Heights pantry with stalwart volunteers, speaks at churches and community gatherings, ''I see the skepticism on people's faces,'' she said. ''They say, 'This is Parma Heights, not Cleveland.' ''
Other suburbs are adapting. In Maple Heights, Mayor Jeffrey Lansky embraced the idea of a food bank, setting aside a space for it in 2008 and having the Fire Department help renovate it. The Cuyahoga County Public Library now runs after-school homework centers with snacks from the food bank, aimed at the growing population of poor children.
Edward FitzGerald, the executive of Cuyahoga County, argued that the increase in the suburban poor population could help lead to a fundamental change in local government. For years Cleveland had most of the population -- and resources -- but policy should reflect the flip in favor of the county, he said.
And with the state slashing funds, counties and the suburbs they contain will have to ramp up social services and economic development on their own, many for the first time.
''You're talking about governing systems that have never really done this before,'' Mr. FitzGerald said.

HEADLINE: From Brooklyn Office, Mixing Clout and Charity

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS and ALISON LEIGH COWAN; Jo Craven McGinty contributed research.

 BODY:
When one of the biggest real estate developments in Brooklyn was stalled two years ago, its owner turned to the city government for help, seeking $20 million in financing. Nearly 50 projects were applying for a small number of aid packages at the time, but this one, City Point, had a prominent supporter.
''The future of Downtown Brooklyn depends on it,'' Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, declared.
City Point received the financing, and around the same time, the lead developer on the project, Acadia Realty, gave $50,000 to a charity run by Mr. Markowitz. The donation was one of a series that Acadia has made to Mr. Markowitz's charities since 2005, totaling more than $300,000, city records and interviews show. 
New York City has adopted some of the strictest rules in the nation to curb the influence of money in politics. Donors with business before it are all but barred from contributing to officials in the city's campaign finance system.
Yet in recent years, Mr. Markowitz has found another way to tap into those donors. He has established a network of four charities that has reaped at least $20 million since 2003, and probably more, according to interviews and an analysis of city records.
That amount -- remarkable for any local politician, let alone one who does not hold citywide office -- is a testament to Mr. Markowitz's stature as a Brooklyn power broker and to his intense focus on building these nonprofit groups. They have in turn played an important role in burnishing his public profile.
When the charities hold public events, Mr. Markowitz, who has been borough president since 2002, is typically in the spotlight. His free summer concerts, during which he is master of ceremonies, offer a chance to ''Party With Marty,'' as the slogan goes.
The donors to the nonprofit groups range from huge corporations like Wal-Mart and TD Bank to local entrepreneurs, but they usually have one thing in common: They have a stake in city legislation, real estate projects, zoning disputes and other Brooklyn issues.
Mr. Markowitz has often personally cajoled wealthy executives to give tens of thousands of dollars at a time to his nonprofit groups. Some recalled that he was relentless, seemingly unable to take no for an answer.
His nonprofit network is so intertwined with his office that anyone who wants to hold events in Brooklyn Borough Hall, a stately Greek Revival building on Joralemon Street, pays a fee to one of the charities, Best of Brooklyn, not to the city. Those fees in recent years have totaled nearly $200,000, records show.
Mr. Markowitz, 66, a Democrat, is considering running for mayor in 2013. He is known as a tireless Brooklyn booster who, with the help of two city-paid drivers, keeps a busy public schedule, including appearances on behalf of the charities.
As borough president, Mr. Markowitz has limited power. Many decisions on local issues are made by the mayor and the City Council. But Mr. Markowitz can make recommendations on zoning and on capital spending, and he appoints members to community boards.
More important, Mr. Markowitz has made himself a key player in Brooklyn by forming alliances and excelling at public relations. Businesses, if not seeking official approval from him, rely on him to cut through the city bureaucracy to help make projects happen or make problems disappear. With his outsize presence in the news media, real estate developers prefer to have him on their side.
Mr. Markowitz has recently run into ethics troubles over the boundaries between his personal interests and his official duties. He was fined $20,000 in July by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board for accepting free foreign travel for his wife, Jamie. Earlier in the year, the board fined him $2,000 for using his chief of staff, Carlo A. Scissura, as his lawyer at a real estate closing.
But Mr. Markowitz's role in fund-raising for his nonprofit groups has gone virtually unquestioned.
In an interview, Mr. Markowitz said his groups, especially the primary one, Best of Brooklyn, help make up for shortfalls in city financing. He said they were doing commendable work, including sending children to camp, running the borough's restaurant week and promoting tourism. He brushed aside questions about whether donors might feel compelled to give because of his political influence.
''I know the difference between right and wrong, and ethical and nonethical,'' Mr. Markowitz said. ''I am not pitching them to give me money, and me in turn give them anything.''
In interviews, several donors said they contributed to the Markowitz groups because they wanted to support a borough where they do business, not because of political pressure.
Members of Congress and high-level state officials around the country have increasingly created such affiliated charities, which allow businesses to show loyalty to politicians without the legal restrictions on campaign contributions. The politicians in turn gain favorable publicity from having their names linked to charitable activities.
Besides Mr. Markowitz, however, few other elected officials in New York City have established such charities to the same degree, according to city records. (Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has his own charity that does extensive work in the city, but it is largely self-financed.)
Besides Best of Brooklyn, the Markowitz groups are Camp Brooklyn, the Martin Luther King Jr. Concert Series and the Seaside Summer Concert Series. The charities do not pay Mr. Markowitz a salary, but all four have close ties to the borough president's office, functioning almost as quasi-governmental units, the interviews and city records show.
Two of Mr. Markowitz's aides work both in the borough president's office and at the charities.
But the charities are subject to little if any outside scrutiny, and do not disclose comprehensive information about their spending.
The New York Times located some information about the donors in paper records at the Conflicts of Interest Board. Under the law, officials who raise money on behalf of charities are required to disclose to the board some information about donors. The Brooklyn borough president's office has done that, but some of its reports are incomplete.
In addition, the law allows the charities to specify only a range for each donation, not the exact amount. As a result, the total revenues for the four groups since 2003 could be anywhere from $20 million to $45 million.
Mr. Markowitz would not release a detailed list of the donors and the amounts they had given.
While Mr. Markowitz denied that there was any connection between donations and his role as borough president, he acknowledged that businesses often seek his backing.
''Most major entities who are thinking of coming to Brooklyn, sometimes as a courtesy, they come in and meet with me,'' he said. ''They know I don't hold their future in their hands, nor are they depending on me or expecting anything of me financially, but they come in because they want the good wishes or whatever.''
Among the largest donors to the charities are developers, who are often highly dependent on official action for their projects to proceed.
They include Acadia, the company building City Point, a 1.5-million-square-foot residential and commercial center in Downtown Brooklyn.
In 2009, Acadia sought and won city approval for $20 million in financing to help revive the commercial project. The application process was overseen by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is controlled by the mayor, but Mr. Markowitz weighed in on behalf of Acadia's bid.
The development corporation said that of the 46 projects in the city applying for aid packages, it selected 11 to take part in the program. City Point eventually received one-sixth of all the financing in the program.
An Acadia executive, Jon Grisham, said in an interview that Acadia's partner on City Point, PA Associates, had advised Acadia to send money to a Markowitz group, the Seaside concerts. Acadia began donating when it worked with PA Associates on earlier Brooklyn projects.
''The conversations were between Marty and PA Associates,'' Mr. Grisham said.
A principal of PA Associates, Aaron Malinsky, was indicted in March on charges of paying roughly $500,000 in bribes to State Senator Carl Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat, who was also indicted. Mr. Markowitz had no involvement in that case.
Since then, Mr. Grisham said Acadia had severed ties with PA Associates and stopped donating to Mr. Markowitz's charity.
Mr. Markowitz said there was no relationship between the Acadia donations and his lobbying for City Point.
''Why don't you look at where the money was used, what the purpose of the funds were for?'' Mr. Markowitz said. ''How many people benefited? There was no quid pro quo here.''
Through his lawyer, Scott E. Mollen, Mr. Malinsky said he had advised making the donations because he wanted to help Brooklynites.
Mr. Markowitz was once an outspoken critic of Wal-Mart's effort to open in the city, contending that the company treated its workers poorly and would harm local businesses.
In 2008, Mr. Markowitz recommended approval of the zoning resolution for a retailer in East New York, Brooklyn, preferably a supermarket, but only on the condition that Wal-Mart could not be the retailer unless it changed its employment practices. He even demanded that the developer promise in writing to prohibit Wal-Mart.
Last spring, Wal-Mart executives donated $150,000 to the Martin Luther King Jr. concerts, a Markowitz group, and met with Mr. Markowitz.
Soon after, Mr. Markowitz softened his criticism of Wal-Mart, saying its executives convinced him that the company had improved its labor practices. He added that shoppers were now going to Wal-Mart on Long Island. ''It doesn't make sense to me how we keep Wal-Mart out of Brooklyn,'' he said
Both Wal-Mart and Mr. Markowitz said the donations were unrelated to Mr. Markowitz's views on Wal-Mart's expansion to Brooklyn.
Union leaders, who have long opposed Wal-Mart in New York and elsewhere, disagreed.
''When somebody changes their mind after a corporation has come in and given a large donation, it is seen as an example of everything that people are disgusted with in politics,'' said Patrick Purcell, the assistant to the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500.
The charities have also reaped significant donations from local businesses. Cumberland Packing, which has received state-issued tax subsidies to keep producing Sweet'N Low at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, is a donor, as is the local franchisee for the Applebee's restaurant chain, Zane Tankel.
''He took my arm and twisted it off -- yeah, he more than asked me, he kept coming at me, until finally I said yes,'' said Mr. Tankel, adding that he was an admirer of Mr. Markowitz.
Mr. Tankel, his company and his family have given at least $135,000 to the charities.
Mr. Tankel has a restaurant in Bedford-Stuyvesant at a mall called Restoration Plaza, which has benefited from $2.5 million in city subsidies, including $900,000 at the direction of Mr. Markowitz's office. But Mr. Tankel said he did not feel that the pressure from Mr. Markowitz was unseemly. ''I have never gotten a favor from Marty,'' Mr. Tankel said.
Forest City Ratner Companies, which is building the Atlantic Yards complex, has long relied on Mr. Markowitz's backing for the huge project in the face of neighborhood opposition. Forest City is one of the biggest contributors to Mr. Markowitz's charities, having given approximately $1.7 million.
''Sometimes, the borough president in his advocacy has blurred the lines between the role of private industry and government,'' Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn, an opponent of the project, said. ''He is taking advantage of a loophole in the law.''
Mr. Markowitz, who has not yet decided whether to retire from politics or to run for mayor in 2013, called such criticism absurd.
''I have everything that I could have,'' he said during an interview. ''I don't need anything. I don't need any of you! I have done this. I loved it. You could raise all the issues you want -- the people in Brooklyn know me. You don't understand that. They know me.''

HEADLINE: On the Road to Relief

 BODY:
At long last, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-run mortgage companies, have issued new rules to allow millions of underwater borrowers, who are current on their payments, to refinance their high-rate mortgages into lower-rate loans. President Obama, who pushed for the changes, rightly emphasized the benefits in a speech on Monday in Las Vegas, a city ravaged by foreclosures. Refinancings will lower monthly payments, reduce the likelihood of default and boost consumer spending. 
What the president did not mention is that previous efforts to provide mortgage debt relief -- by his administration and his predecessor's -- have all come up short. The new plan will require constant monitoring by the administration and midcourse corrections if, say, the rules for homeowners turn out to be overly restrictive or the banks lard up the new loans with excessive fees.
Still, the new rules are welcome because borrowers, the housing market and the broader economy need all the help they can get. An estimated six million Americans have already lost their homes in the bust, in many cases, because of a combination of joblessness and falling home prices that made it impossible to keep up with payments, or to sell at a profit or refinance to better terms.
Under the plan, borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, or who have only a small amount of home equity, will be able to refinance, as long as their loans are owned or backed by Fannie or Freddie, and as long as they have not missed a payment in the last six months and haven't had more than one late payment in the past year.
Until now, Fannie and Freddie, which were taken over by the government early in the financial crisis, have balked at refinancings for any underwater borrowers, insisting that it was their duty to taxpayers to collect every possible penny of interest from borrowers.
It is their duty to shield taxpayers from losses. But they had missed the big picture. Defaults and foreclosures ultimately cost more than a refinanced loan in good standing and impose huge costs on the broader economy because they push down home values for everyone.
The new refinancing plan is still only a modest fix. Currently, some 14.5 million borrowers are underwater, on average, by $50,000. Of them, private analysts estimate that between 1.5 million and 2 million will qualify to refinance under the new standards.
Real recovery, in the housing market and in the economy, will require reducing the principal balance on many underwater loans. That would help to stanch defaults and foreclosures by restoring equity to borrowers as well as lowering their payments.
Fewer foreclosures would help to halt the decline in home values, replenishing battered property tax coffers. Restoring home equity is also crucial to getting consumers to spend again. But banks have balked at reducing principal because they don't want to face up to the losses.
For too long, President Obama has relied on the banks to do what's right. That hasn't worked. Strong political pressure and likely legislation may be the only way to get the banks to accept write downs of principal.
Mr. Obama needs to start pushing now. He needs to explain that until many more Americans get out from under excessive debt, the rest of the economy won't recover.

HEADLINE: Lectern Gone, Romney Finds More Success

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
When Mitt Romney crammed for the Republican presidential debates four years ago, he went all out: The campaign built a stage with four lecterns and used senior staff as stand-ins for his rivals, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani. A room packed with highly paid media consultants and senior officials barked suggestions as they flipped through a white binder filled with policy positions. Over time, one aide said, the binder grew to resemble the Manhattan White Pages.
This month, when Mr. Romney prepared for his seventh debate of the 2012 campaign, at Dartmouth College, there were no lecterns. No one playing Rick Perry or Herman Cain. And no overstuffed policy binders. Mr. Romney and a few aides simply sat around a small table at the Hanover Inn in New Hampshire and batted around topics in the news.
The result was markedly different. Four years ago, Mr. Romney responded to a debate question about the Iraq war by lapsing into consultant-speak. ''The question is kind of a non sequitur, if you will, and what I mean by that -- or a null set,'' he said. 
At a recent debate, he gave short snappy answers -- ''nice try!'' -- as he delivered another in a string of largely successful debate performances.
While some candidates suffer from a lack of preparation for the national stage, Mr. Romney and his aides concluded that in his first go-round, he was hampered by an overbearing campaign apparatus.
This time, he has shed much of the operational and psychological baggage that weighed down, and ultimately doomed, his maiden campaign. Gone are the extensive debate rehearsals, the bickering consultants, the corporate dress code and the urge to explain everything. That may explain why, for all his ups and downs, Mr. Romney's public presentation and debate appearances have been far more consistent this time.
Now the question is whether Mr. Romney can build on the progress he has made in becoming a looser, more confident candidate, and forge the kind of emotional bond with the electorate that can make the difference in a presidential campaign.
He can still be awkward and occasionally wooden, especially in face-to-face moments with voters that mean so much in Iowa and New Hampshire. But the mannequin-like grin is less frequent and his speech is more direct, less jargon-ridden. He even dresses differently; jeans are more common and neckties rarely make an appearance anymore.
In interviews over the last several weeks, more than a dozen of Mr. Romney's top aides insisted that the former Massachusetts governor did not spend the last several years rewatching videos of his performances at town halls or debates.
The difference, they say, has more do with experience, knowing what to expect, clarifying ideas in a book, and feeling less pressure about the possibility of losing.
One longtime aide recalls Mr. Romney, a few weeks after conceding to Senator McCain in 2008, saying ''Ahhhh, feels like I finally managed to loosen the laces on my shoes.''
A few weeks after President Obama was elected, about a dozen of Mr. Romney's top advisers -- dressed informally, for once -- gathered at his Belmont, Mass., home, for a holiday party. Over coffee, sandwiches and doughnuts, Mr. Romney talked reflectively about the campaign. He had known why he was running, he told them. But he did not get that message across effectively; certainly, not in the way Mr. Obama had managed to embody hope and change. If he ran again, he said, he would do it very differently.
Afterward, he dispatched Bob White, a longtime friend and fellow partner at Bain Capital, to talk to other strategists, fund-raisers and staff members to determine where he had faltered.
And in Washington, Mr. Romney's closest aides started meeting, sometimes at the Madison Hotel, to map out a second candidacy. Led by Stuart Stevens, who became Mr. Romney's top strategist this year, the aides decided the campaign would have a different ''culture'' and ''feel,'' starting with the candidate.
Mr. Stevens and his advisers concluded that Mr. Romney had tried too hard to be everything to everyone. Four years ago, his speeches were highly tailored to his audiences, which resulted in a lack of authenticity. He needed to deliver one consistent message.
''He would try to talk social issues with a church hall crowd, he would talk foreign policy issues with a think tank crowd, and he would talk business with a chamber of commerce crowd,'' said Kevin Madden, Mr. Romney's press secretary in 2008 who is now an informal adviser. ''Now the crowds and the public are simpatico. They all have the same anxiety and concerns, and that's the economy.''
Mr. Romney also retreated to his beach house in La Jolla, Calif. At his kitchen table, he wrote ''No Apology,'' in which he offers a searing critique of Mr. Obama and makes the case for his kind of management expertise.
By 2010, he had returned to the campaign trail, on behalf of House and Senate candidates. The appearances at public events and private fund-raisers gave him a low-pressure opportunity to begin ''working out the kinks'' in his message, as one aide put it.
Sleeves rolled up, tie gone, Mr. Romney stood next to the Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio last October at a restaurant in Land O'Lakes, Fla. ''Who would have thought we'd look back on the Carter years as the good old days?'' he joked.
A year later, Mr. Romney now leads most polls in the Republican presidential contest and his experience shows next to his rivals, who are almost all new to presidential politics. In debates and town halls, Mr. Romney opts for shorter answers, focusing on his ideals and principles rather than cerebral, technical details. He seems more comfortable answering questions about social issues that once tied him in knots.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney faced students at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire who grilled him on gay marriage.
''I've never been an advocate of gay marriage; I've opposed gay marriage and civil unions,'' Mr. Romney said during a long soliloquy. ''Now, at the same time,'' he continued, ''I'm against discrimination.''
The audience burst into laughter at the seemingly irreconcilable positions, which prompted another circuitous explanation from Mr. Romney.
This month, he faced similarly combative questions about gay marriage from college students at a town hall meeting in Hopkinton, N.H. After saying that he supported traditional marriage, Mr. Romney turned to another young questioner: ''If it's the same question, I don't have a new answer. I've answered that question.'' He quickly moved on.
That Mr. Romney still gets such questions is proof that he remains vulnerable to the charge that he is too willing to change his core beliefs -- presenting a continuing problem among many conservative and religious voters. But four years ago Mr. Romney's broader struggle was in connecting with voters.
In 2007, a waitress at the Red Arrow Diner in Manchester, N.H., angrily complained about the high cost of health care.
Many candidates would have crossed the tiny room to engage her directly, acknowledging her plight. Instead, Mr. Romney went on autopilot, dryly reciting the advantages of his Massachusetts health care plan, waved and ducked out of the restaurant.
Now, he's trying to channel Bill Clinton and his gift of political empathy. The effort, if not the full effect, is there. At a recent town hall at St. Anselm College, in New Hampshire, a woman talked about taking care of her husband, who had died of Alzheimer's disease.
It was a moment, and Mr. Romney managed to catch it.
''First of all, congratulations to you for honoring your husband's request and caring for him for those four years,'' he said. ''My sympathy and condolences to you for the loss of a great man.''
And yet, some things don't change all that much.
Gone is Mr. Romney's canned line about how he asked his wife, Ann, whether, in her wildest dreams, she thought he would run for president. ''Mitt,'' he would quote her as saying, ''you weren't in my wildest dreams.''
But the awkward jokes are not completely missing. At a stop in Milford, N.H., recently, Ms. Romney said she was eager to show voters ''the other side of Mitt.''
He suddenly turned around to show his backside, prompting laughter from the crowd and from his wife, ''Oh, dear.''

HEADLINE: The Fighter Fallacy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The elemental question in American politics is: Do voters trust their government? During the middle of the 20th century, more than 70 percent of Americans said that they trusted government to do the right thing most of the time.
During the 1970s, that fell. By the Iraq war, only 25 percent trusted government. Now, amid the economic slowdown, public trust has hit an all-time low. According to a CNN/ORC International poll, only 15 percent of Americans asked said that they trust the federal government to do the right thing most of the time. 
This is a problem for Democrats. But Democrats can win elections in this climate if they defuse the Big Government/Small Government ideological debate. With his Third Way approach, Bill Clinton established that he was not a Big Government liberal. Once he crossed that threshold, he could get voters to think about his individual policies, which were actually quite popular. Clinton made a national election feel like a state election (state and local governments are still trusted and voters are less ideological when voting for those offices).
Barack Obama also crossed the ideological threshold in 2008, running as a postpartisan unifier. But the government activism of his first two years reawakened the Big Government/Small Government frame. Independents and moderate conservatives recoiled.
The Pew Research Center asks voters to place themselves and the two parties on a left-right ideological continuum. In 2006, independent voters said they felt they were twice as close to the Democrats as they were to the too-conservative Republicans. Today, they say they feel twice as close to the Republicans.
On issue after issue, the electorate has shifted rightward as independents have moved closer to the G.O.P. According to a Gallup poll, 64 percent of Americans who were asked said they primarily blamed government for the economic slowdown, whereas only 30 percent said they blamed the financial institutions. According to a Congressional Connections poll, 55 percent of adults said they believed government regulation has been a ''major factor'' in the current economic slowdown.
The Occupy Wall Street placards advocate income redistribution, but data from the General Social Survey shows that support for redistribution has plummeted during the recession, with the sharpest declines coming among people earning between $7 and $9 an hour.
After the shellacking in the 2010 midterms, President Obama tried to cut deals and win back independent voters. But Republicans weren't willing to meet him halfway -- or even 10 percent of the way. Liberals scalded Obama for being spineless, while the sour stagnation locked everything in place. Obama's latest job approval rating among independents is only 36 percent, according to Gallup.
So Obama faced a choice. Double down on conciliator mode or become a fighter. Think of the latter as the Bibi Netanyahu strategy: since I have no negotiating partner I'm going to come out swinging in a way that pleases my base.
If Obama were a Republican, he could win with this sort of strategy: Repeat your party's most orthodox positions and then rip your opponent to shreds. Republicans can win a contest between an orthodox Republican and an orthodox Democrat because they have the trust in government issue on their side.
Democrats do not have that luxury. The party of government cannot win an orthodox vs. orthodox campaign when 15 percent of Americans trust government. It certainly can't do it presiding over 9 percent unemployment. It's suicide.
Yet this is the course the Obama campaign has chosen. He's campaigning these days as the populist fighter, the scourge of the privileged class.
Obama, who sounded so fresh in 2008, now sometimes sounds a bit like Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi. Obama, who inspired the country, now threatens to run a campaign that is viciously negative. Obama, who is still widely admired because he is reasonable and calm, is in danger of squandering his best asset by pretending to be someone he is not. Obama, a natural unifier and conciliator, seems on the verge of running as a divisive populist while accusing Mitt Romney, his possible opponent, of being inauthentic.
It's misguided. It raises the ideological temperature and arouses the Big Government/Small Government debate. It repels independents, who don't like the finance majors who went to Wall Street but trust the history majors who went to Washington even less.
Obama would be wiser to champion a Grand Bargain strategy. Use the Congressional deficit supercommittee to embrace the sort of new social contract we've been circling around for the past few years: simpler taxes, reformed entitlements, more money for human capital, growth and innovation.
Don't just whisper Grand Bargain in back rooms with John Boehner. Make it explicit. Take it to the country. Lower the ideological atmosphere and get everybody thinking concretely about the real choices facing the nation.
If you don't trust voters to be serious, they won't trust you.

HIGHLIGHT: Slash spending now, or we may be forced into austerity! 

 BODY:
Digby finds Paul Ryan, winner of an award for fiscal responsibility, saying, well, something:
RYAN: Let's review for a moment the path we are on, where we stand right now. It pains me to say this, but it's become clear that the president has committed us to the current path: higher taxes, more dependency, more bureaucratic control, inaction on the drivers of our debt - just not even dealing with it - and painful austerity, the kind you see in Europe.
So unless Obama agrees to sharp spending cuts, we'll be forced into austerity? What?
Wait, it's worse: just the other day, Ryan and colleagues were European-style austerity; they bought into the "expansionary austerity" thesis just as it was collapsing intellectually. 
On a somewhat related note, John Quiggin reads the original Alesina/Ardagna paper on expansionary austerity, and finds that they got all the facts about Australia wrong. Most notably, they depict a decline in spending on unemployment benefits that was the result of an economic expansion as an expansionary spending cut. Geez.

HEADLINE: Credit, Blame and a Heaping Cup of Coincidence

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: The stock market is on a winning streak; there has also been a surge of violence. How logical is it to cite Occupy Wall Street as a factor in either case? Also, what City Room is reading in other newspapers and blogs. 

 BODY:
 As an old Roman might have said, post hoc ergo propter hoc.
 The Latin phrase came to mind while contemplating an intriguing confluence of events in the protest movement based downtown in Zuccotti Park. Right after Occupy Wall Street started to soar, so did Wall Street.
 On Saturday, Oct. 1, more than 700 people were arrested during a march across the Brooklyn Bridge, the largest police roundup in the demonstrations that had begun two weeks earlier. Combined with an infamous police pepper spraying on Sept. 24, the mass arrests propelled Occupy Wall Street into the big time.
 On Monday, Oct. 3, stock market trading resumed, and the Dow Jones industrial average slumped, to 10,655.30. But it then went on a tear, its fortunes rising in tandem with those of the Zuccotti Park crowd. By the final bell on Monday, the Dow hadjumped nearly 12 percent since Oct. 3, closing at 11,913.62. 
 So it would seem that the protests have done Wall Street a great deal of good.
 Ah, but there's that pesky Latin. Post hoc ergo propter hoc. It means: After this, therefore because of this. Event A happened, and event B followed; thus, A caused B. It is a basic fallacy in logic, sometimes referred to as correlation not causation.
 Just ask financial experts. Could Occupy Wall Street actually be what's giving Wall Street its lift?
 "Not one iota," said Peter Cardillo, the chief market economist for Rockwell Global Capital. Philip J. Orlando, the chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, agreed. "I think it's more coincidence than anything else," he said.
 Both men cited other factors, like company earnings reports - "they've been coming in much stronger than anticipated," Mr. Cardillo said - and signs that European leaders, as Mr. Orlando put it, "seem to be finding religion on their sovereign debt issues."
 "And the U.S. economy, contrary to what the protesters believe, is actually demonstrating some statistical strength over the last month or so," Mr. Orlando said.
 Still, it is no less logical to give credit to the "occupy" movement than it is to blame it, as some apparently do, for a recent surge of violence in New York.
 On Sunday, The New York Post reported that the number of people shot in the city rose sharply in the past month, by 28 percent. During one seven-day stretch, the increase was 155 percent above what it was in the same period a year earlier.
 What's the explanation? The Post quoted high-ranking police officers as blaming the Zuccotti Park occupiers, because "their rallies pull special crime-fighting units away from the hot zones where they're needed." Thousands of officers are summoned to duty when Occupy Wall Street is on the march.
 One could ask if so many officers are truly needed. Certainly no massing of police on such a huge scale is required when the protesters are camped in the park, and not much in the way of criminal activity is afoot.
 More to the point, are we really to believe that the anti-Wall Street troops bear a wisp of responsibility for someone like the depraved snake who opened fire on Friday in Brownsville, Brooklyn, killing Zurana Horton, 34, as she picked up her child at a school? If so, then we might as well give them credit for the stock market's surge. It makes about as much sense.
 Not that many in Occupy Wall Street would want that pat on the back, said Nicholas Colas, the chief market strategist for the ConvergEx Group. "Look," Mr. Colas said, "if you could prove causation, you'd empty that park in about 14 seconds."
 But why mess with a winning streak? "I think we ought to keep them out there until we get to 1,400 on the S.& P.," Mr. Orlando said, tongue planted somewhere in cheek. At Monday's close, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index stood at 1,254.19.
 "If this is just a coincidental relationship, it's sort of like changing your lucky socks," he said. "Let's keep them right where they are."

HEADLINE: Yet Another Attempt to Waylay the Enterprise

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Washington State raises complaints about plans to exhibit a space shuttle in Manhattan. 

 BODY:
The governor of Washington has joined the ranks of elected officials trying to steer a space shuttle away from New York City - if only temporarily.
Gov. Christine O. Gregoire wrote a letter on Friday to Maj. Gen. Charles F. Bolden Jr., the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, asking that he reward Seattle for being better prepared to display a space shuttle than either New York or Los Angeles. When NASA decided in April what to do with its three used shuttles and one prototype, the Museum of Flight in Seattle was denied any of them, even though it had already built a structure to house one.
Instead, NASA awarded the retired orbiters to the California Science Center, the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. The Smithsonian, in turn, agreed to send the prototype it had been displaying, known as Enterprise, to the Intrepid Sea Air and Space Museum in Manhattan. 
But neither the Intrepid nor the science center in Los Angeles will be ready to display a shuttle until 2014 at the earliest. Officials of the Intrepid museum are still trying to draw up plans for a building that would house the Enterprise across the West Side Highway from the decommissioned aircraft carrier that is home to the museum.
After The New York Times reportedthat the Intrepid did not own that site or have the money it would need to build there, elected officials in Texas and Ohio called on Mr. Bolden to reconsider giving the Enterprise to the Intrepid. Space Center Houston and the National Museum of the Air Force near Dayton, Ohio, had unsuccessfully pitched for one of the shuttles. On Monday, a petition posted on the Web site of the White House that asks President Obama to revisit the decision received the 5,000 signature that it needed to be considered. 
According to the rules posted on the Web site, the decision will be reviewed by the administration and an official response will be issued. 
"Neither California nor New York have permanent structures in place to house the shuttles, and both face fund-raising and logistical challenges that pose a serious risk to the successful transfer of the orbiters by the end of 2012," Ms. Gregoire wrote. She said that the Museum of Flight was willing to display either the Enterprise or the Endeavour, a retired orbiter that is bound for Los Angeles, until the end of 2012.
So far, Mr. Bolden has stood by his decision.

HEADLINE: Quaintness Tucked Between Brooklyn Housing Projects

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: This week, the Appraisal takes stock of a Brooklyn street where town houses are bookended by public housing projects in a neighborhood where property values have risen sharply over the years. 

 BODY:
New York is famously a city of contrasts: old frame houses butt up against new construction, ethnicities commingle on the subway, the moneyed live in view of the poor. This week the Appraisal takes stock of a Brooklyn street where this is particularly true: Warren between Nevins and Bond in Boerum Hill, where town houses are bookended by two public housing projects in a neighborhood where property values have risen sharply over the years.
Time was when buyers of means would be scared off by the proximity of public housing, but that appears to be a dwindling phenomenon, with people paying a premium to live in neighborhoods like Boerum Hill, Chelsea, the Lower East Side and Red Hook. Which leads us to wonder how home buyers' perceptions of public housing are changing - and how residents of public housing are feeling about their market-rate neighbors these days. 
Please share your thoughts and experiences.

HEADLINE: The Grand Concourse Gets Its Due

BYLINE: PATRICK WALL


HIGHLIGHT: A stretch of the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, an artists' colony in the far West Village and the Paul Robeson Theater were awarded landmark protection on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
The city gave an Art Deco-filled stretch of the Grand Concourse in the Bronx - along with an artists' housing complex in the West Village, a church-turned-synagogue-turned-theater in Brooklyn and a Staten Island cottage - landmark protection on Tuesday.
The Grand Concourse Historic District includes 78 buildings along a one-mile stretch of the storied thoroughfare, often described as the Champs-Elysees of the Bronx. The new individual landmarks include Westbeth Artists' Housing, the Union League Club on East 37th Street and the Paul Robeson Theater in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.
"All of the buildings that were designated today reflect nearly a century's worth of architectural, demographic and economic shifts throughout New York City," said Robert B. Tierney, chairman of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
The Bronx district extends from 153rd Street to 167th Street along and off the Grand Concourse, which celebrated its centennial in 2009.
Half of the district's apartment buildings date from the 1920s and feature a variety of architectural styles, including Colonial and Tudor- revivalist. The other half, constructed in the 1930s and 40s, constitute part of a collection of Art Deco and Art Moderne buildings surrounding the Grand Concourse, whose only national Art Deco rival is Miami Beach.
The Concourse Plaza Hotel falls within the district, as does the so-called Fish building. The 11-story, Colonial Revival-style hotel opened in 1923 -- the same year as the original Yankee Stadium -- and hosted visitors such as Babe Ruth and John F. Kennedy, before it became a home for the elderly in the 1980s. The Fish Building is an Art Deco classic nicknamed for a tile mosaic on its facade, and features murals in its lobby consisting of "weirdly elongated maidens who strike languorous poses in a landscape populated by frogs and swans," as Constance Rosenblum wrote in The Times in 2009.
Westbeth, in the far West Village, which fills a full block and includes five protected buildings, is the former home of Bell Telephone Laboratories. It provides affordable housing for artists and is home to the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation and the New School for Drama.
The other Manhattan site is the Union League Club, a nine-story brick clubhouse built in 1931 that is the fourth residence of the private group, which formed in 1863 to support the Union cause in the Civil War.
The Paul Robeson Theater in Brooklyn began life in 1864 as a Unitarian Universalist church, was bought by a Reform congregation and converted to a synagogue, then became a Roman Catholic Church before it was finally transformed into a theater in 1980.
On Staten Island, a two-story cottage in Port Richmond, which housed a blacksmith, a boatman, a mill worker and a shipbuilder in the years since it was erected in 1848, is that borough's newest protected property.

HEADLINE: U.S. Expected to Charge Executive Tied to Galleon Case

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED, PETER LATTMAN and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs and the most prominent executive ensnared in an aggressive insider trading investigation, is expected to surrender to authorities. 

 BODY:
9:02 p.m. | Updated 
Federal prosecutors are expected to file criminal charges on Wednesday against Rajat K. Gupta, the most prominent business executive ensnared in an aggressive insider trading investigation, according to people briefed on the case.
The case against Mr. Gupta, 62, who is expected to surrender to F.B.I. agents on Wednesday, would extend the reach of the government's inquiry into America's most prestigious corporate boardrooms. Most of the defendants charged with insider trading over the last two years have plied their trade exclusively on Wall Street.
The charges would also mean a stunning fall from grace of a trusted adviser to political leaders and chief executives of the world's most celebrated companies.
A former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble and the longtime head of McKinsey & Company, the elite consulting firm, Mr. Gupta has been under investigation over whether he leaked corporate secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager who was sentenced this month to 11 years in prison for trading on illegal stock tips.
While there has been no indication yet that Mr. Gupta profited directly from the information he passed to Mr. Rajaratnam, securities laws prohibit company insiders from divulging corporate secrets to those who then profit from them.
 The case against Mr. Gupta, who lives in Westport, Conn., would tie up a major loose end in the long-running investigation of Mr. Rajaratnam's hedge fund, the Galleon Group. Yet federal authorities continue their campaign to ferret out insider trading on multiple fronts. This month, for example, a Denver-based hedge fund manager and a chemist at the Food and Drug Administration pleaded guilty to such charges.
 A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment.
Gary P. Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, said in a statement: "The facts demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is an innocent man and that he acted with honesty and integrity."
 Mr. Gupta, in his role at the helm of McKinsey, was a trusted adviser to business leaders including Jeffrey R. Immelt, of General Electric, and Henry R. Kravis, of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. A native of Kolkata, India, and a graduate of the Harvard Business School, Mr. Gupta has also been a philanthropist, serving as a senior adviser to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Mr. Gupta also served as a special adviser to the United Nations.
 His name emerged just a week before Mr. Rajaratnam's trial in March, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an administrative proceeding against him. The agency accused Mr. Gupta of passing confidential information about Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble to Mr. Rajaratnam, who then traded on the news.
 The details were explosive. Authorities said Mr. Gupta gave Mr. Rajaratnam advanced word of Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs during the darkest days of the financial crisis in addition to other sensitive information affecting the company's share price.
 At the time, federal prosecutors named Mr. Gupta a co-conspirator of Mr. Rajaratnam, but they never charged him. Still, his presence loomed large at Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman, testified about Mr. Gupta's role on the board and the secrets he was privy to, including earnings details and the bank's strategic deliberations.
The legal odyssey leading to charges against Mr. Gupta could serve as a case study in law school criminal procedure class. He fought the S.E.C.'s civil action, which would have been heard before an administrative judge. Mr. Gupta argued that the proceeding denied him of his constitutional right to a jury trial and treated him differently than the other Mr. Rajaratnam-related defendants, all of whom the agency sued in federal court.
Mr. Gupta prevailed, and the S.E.C. dropped its case in August, but it maintained the right to bring an action in federal court. The agency is expected to file a new, parallel civil case against Mr. Gupta as well. It is unclear what has changed since the S.E.C. dropped its case in August.
An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
The case could be a challenge for the government. Many of the defendants convicted of insider trading, including Mr. Rajaratnam, have been caught on wiretaps swapping secret information.
At Mr. Rajaratnam's trial, the government played a recorded conversation between Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam in July 2008. On that call, Mr. Gupta divulged that Goldman was considering a purchase of either Wachovia or American International Group.
 Evidence that Mr. Rajaratnam traded on this information was never presented, however.
 Two of the most incriminating calls played in court pertained to tips that the government said had come from Mr. Gupta. But those calls were conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and his employees, which could make them inadmissible in a trial of Mr. Gupta.
 In one call played for the jury, Mr. Rajaratnam told a colleague, "I heard yesterday from somebody who's on the board of Goldman Sachs that they are going to lose $2 per share." In the other, Mr. Rajaratnam said to his trader, "I got a call saying something good is going to happen to Goldman."
The S.E.C.'s original case also outlined evidence that could potentially be used at trial. That includes Mr. Gupta's phone records of on Sept. 23, 2008. That day, the Goldman board met via telephone to consider Mr. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman.
"Immediately after disconnecting from the board call, Gupta called Rajaratnam from the same line," the S.E.C. filing says. A minute later, Galleon funds bought more than 175,000 shares of Goldman just before the market closed, the agency says, and later netted a $900,000 profit when the deal was announced.
Though he had an enviable resume and earned millions of dollars a year at McKinsey, Mr. Gupta became fixated on the extraordinary wealth showered on hedge fund managers and private equity chiefs, according to trial testimony. Consultants are well paid, but the compensation pales in comparison to those Wall Street titans.
Around the time of his retirement in 2007, he and Mr. Rajaratnam helped start New Silk Route, a private equity firm focused on investments in India. Though Mr. Rajaratnam never had an active role in the firm, he and Mr. Gupta were good friends, having met through their philanthropic interests.
Mr. Gupta periodically visited Mr. Rajaratnam's hedge fund, Galleon, on Madison Avenue and 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The two would order Indian or Chinese takeout and kibitz in Mr. Rajaratnam's office. Mr. Gupta became an investor in Galleon's hedge funds.
As part of his foray into Wall Street, Mr. Gupta took a senior adviser post at K.K.R., the firm co-founded by his friend Mr. Kravis. During Mr. Rajaratnam's trial, prosecutors played a tape of the hedge fund manager gossiping with a friend about Mr. Gupta's ambitions.
"My analysis of the situation is he's enamored with Kravis, and I think he wants to be in that circle," Mr. Rajaratnam said. "That's a billionaire circle, right?"

HEADLINE: The Republican Idea of Tax Reform

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans talk of tax reform only when they can't get their way with straightforward tax cuts, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Back in 1995, flush from taking control of both the House and Senate for the first time since 1954, Republicans made tax reform one of their first priorities. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole asked Jack Kemp, the former congressman and secretary of housing and urban development, to lead a commission that would report back with recommendations for fundamental tax reform.
Among the members of the Kemp commission, formally the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, was Herman Cain, then the chief executive of Godfather's Pizza. I assisted the commission in a voluntary capacity, along with a number of other Republican tax policy wonks. I still have a copy of the commission report, issued in January 1996, that Mr. Cain and the other commission members signed.
I don't have much recollection of Mr. Cain's contribution to the commission's work, but I don't have much recollection of mine, either. I remember him as being very friendly and easy to work with.
In the end, the Kemp commission didn't come up with a specific tax reform plan. Its report set forth only a set of general principles that didn't add much to what everyone already knew about the Republican tax philosophy. It didn't matter very much; it quickly became clear that Congressional Republicans were losing interest in tax reform, which implies revenue-neutrality, in favor of tax cuts.

Tax cuts had effectively been off the table since 1981, as budget deficits made them politically impossible. Republicans today prefer to forget that Ronald Reagan signed into law 11 major tax increases, including the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the largest peacetime tax increase in American history.
Of course, there was still a net tax cut during the Reagan administration. The same source of the table above, the federal budget for fiscal year 1990, shows that revenue was $264.4 billion lower in 1988 than it would have been without the 1981 tax cut. But Reagan effectively took back half of it by his last year in office.
It was their inability to simply cut taxes that really made Republicans interested in tax reform, which had historically been of more interest to Democrats. It was only by pairing tax increases with tax cuts that Republicans could keep alive their goal of reducing statutory tax rates. Their ultimate goal has long been to abolish progressivity by having a single tax rate that applies to everyone. 
In the 1980s, Republicans settled for incremental progress toward this goal, which explains their support for the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
But in their hearts, Republicans don't ever want to raise taxes; they only want to cut them. Consequently, tax reform has always taken a back seat to tax cuts whenever political and economic conditions permitted them. Those conditions began to emerge just as the Kemp commission finished its work.
Bill Clinton, in his budget for fiscal year 1997, which was released in early 1996, projected a federal budget surplus by 2001. It turned out that the tax increases initiated by George H.W. Bush in 1990 and by Mr. Clinton in 1993, which were strenuously opposed by virtually all Republicans, did exactly what they were supposed to do and sharply reduced federal budget deficits.
Nevertheless, Republican dogma insists that tax increases just fuel spending and never reduce the deficit. As the Republican tax guru Grover Norquist put it last week, when taxes are on the table there are no spending cuts. "When taxes are off the table, you get spending cuts," he said.
My friend Grover is factually wrong. Spending as a share of the gross domestic product fell after both the 1990 and 1993 budget deals, in large part because of tough budget controls that Republicans abandoned in 2002 so that they could cut taxes without restraint. And contrary to Mr. Norquist's theory, the tax cuts of the George W. Bush years did not constrain spending, which rose as a share of the G.D.P. almost every year of his administration (as the raw data confirms).
The point is that once deficits started to disappear, Republicans lost interest in tax reform and turned their attention instead to tax cuts. In 1997, they were successful, joining with Democrats to cut the capital gains rate and create tax credits for children and education, among other things. Of course, in the 2000s, Republicans cut taxes heavily without regard to the budget deficit.
It is only because they have invested so much effort in attacking President Obama for budget deficits that actually arose in large part from Republican policies, like the Medicare Part D program and two unfunded wars, that Republicans are somewhat inhibited from offering more tax cuts today. 
This is what has turned their attention back toward tax reform, like Mr. Cain's 9-9-9 plan, which apparently has evolved into a 9-0-9 plan, and the flat tax, which Gov. Rick Perry of Texas now champions.
While tax reform is a worthy goal -- and long overdue -- the recent interest by Republicans in the subject should not be taken too seriously. They are only biding their time until political conditions allow them to once again cut taxes.

HEADLINE: Occupy Wall Street Meets Tahrir Square

BYLINE: ANNE BARNARD


HIGHLIGHT: Near Wall Street and across the country, protestors have embraced a movement springing from the Arab world as a model of democracy. Still, the parallel has its limits. 

 BODY:
Occupy Wall Street has been good business for Ehab Sami, who dishes up crisp falafel topped with tender fried eggplant from his cart outside Zuccotti Park. 
But he's grown a little weary of his unsolicited rock-star status. Mr. Sami is from Egypt, where an 18-day occupation of Cairo's Tahrir -- or Liberation -- Square toppled the 30-year dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak and inspired revolts and protests on several continents.
When the Wall Street protesters find out, they invariably congratulate Mr. Sami on Egypt's revolution. And then they want to know what he thinks of theirs.
He's taken to fluttering his hand - the international sign for "so-so" - and pretending not to speak English.
At the risk of being obvious, let us list the ways that Occupy Wall Street is not like Tahrir Square: no protesters have been killed, there have been no demands for the president to step down and no crowds swelling above six figures. The protesters are in far less danger, and seem to pose far less danger to the powerful, than in Egypt.
But it's worth pausing for a moment on this point: Here in Lower Manhattan, and around the country, protesters have embraced a movement springing from the Arab world as a model of freedom, democracy and nonviolence. 
"Are you ready for a Tahrir moment?" an initial call to action demanded. Now, newcomers to Zuccotti Park are given leaflets explicitly connecting the movements: "We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring occupation tactics to achieve our ends and we encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants." 
Other public statements have cited Egypt and Tunisia as models - though not Libya, where revolution turned to civil war. 
And Monday afternoon, some of Egypt's leading young revolutionaries held a "teach-in" at Zuccotti Park -- then led protesters on an impromptu march down Wall Street.
Two blocks from ground zero - the same distance, though in a different direction, as the proposed Muslim community center and mosque that raised a ruckus last year - a subtle change in the Arab world's image, wrought by the events of recent months, is on display. 
In a place so sensitized, the big news, perhaps, is that the Tahrir references are taken almost for granted. A movement born in a Muslim country is seen neither as threatening nor as exotic but simply as universal. 
"I think Tahrir is an Arabic word, but that doesn't make it a particularly Arab or Muslim thing," said Daniel Kurfirst, a musician, after Muslims held Friday prayers in the park for the first time last week.
Another protester, Lin Wefel, carried a sign reading "We are all Khaled Said," referring to the Egyptian activist whose death at the hands of the police helped sparked the Egyptian revolt.
 "This is a continuation of all the revolutions in human history," she said, "from the French to the Russian to the hippies, whatever."
To be sure, the Zuccotti Park protesters are largely of a different political bent than the right-wing activists who shaped protests against the mosque. Pamela Geller, one of the leaders of the anti-mosque movement, has already tried to connect last week's Muslim prayers to the anti-Semitic signs carried by a few protesters and disavowed by others, and called the sermon, by Imam Ayub Abdul Baki, anti-American. 
Mr. Abdul-Baqi criticized American foreign policy in his sermon. But he focused more on Muslims' centrality to America from the time Muslims were brought here as slaves, Muslims' religious obligation to fight for social justice, and the Constitution's protection of freedom of religion even at a time when he said Muslims were facing discrimination.
"We need affordable housing. We need affordable education and free health care," he said afterward, as Muslim volunteers handed out lunch to all comers. 
The economy is the main problem for all Americans, he said. "Islam bashing is trying to use Muslims as a scapegoat," he added, "but hating me is not going to solve the problem."
The prayers drew about 75 people - dwarfed by the other activities in the park and by the much larger crowds who recently observed Jewish holidays - including African-Americans, immigrants from South Asian and Arab countries, first-generation Americans and converts. 
Afterward, Ayman el-Sawa, an Egyptian American who has been a fixture in the park, wearing a scarf striped with the red, black and white of the Egyptian flag, led a chant, "Free, Free U.S.A.!" 
On Monday, Asmaa Mahfouz, a Tahrir activist, presented protesters with an Egyptian flag inscribed, "From Tahrir to Wall Street." But at times the encounter underscored the differences between the movements. 
"Where are the organizers?" she asked, and was greeted by quizzical stares. Occupy protesters asked how they could broaden their movement's appeal; Ms. Mahfouz advised them to sharpen their message. When they asked how the Egyptians got labor on their side, the answer was that Tahrir's activists had been building coalitions with unions for years before this year's protests began. And when she led the protesters down Wall Street, she was the one who boldly stepped off the route the police prescribed.
Progressive Muslim activists, many of them born in New York, have been coming to the park from the beginning. They said they hoped the prayers, organized by the Muslim Leadership Council of New York, would get more Muslims interested in the movement. 
But they face ambivalence from their parents' generation, from immigrants like Mr. Sami, the falafel chef. 
It's good to see Americans recognize that poverty is a problem, he said. But while Tahrir could be summed up in a few words - "Mubarak, leave!" - he found Occupy's diffuse causes "confusing." His coworker, who did not want to give his name, said the protesters were "not serious."
"Dancing, singing," he said, shaking his head. 
To be fair, there was a good amount of singing and dancing in Tahrir Square, too. 
But for Mr. Sami the problems here just aren't as dire.
"This is America," he says. "People will do anything to come here."
Even for the most committed Occupy Wall Street protesters, it's hard to forget that, as Ms. Wefel put it, "It sure is a lot safer to speak our minds here than in Tahrir Square."

HEADLINE: Amazon, Hot and Cold

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: Amazon reveals more problems with a warehouse as it prepares to announce its third-quarter earnings. 

 BODY:
After the close of the stock market Tuesday, Amazon.com will announce its third-quarter results. Analysts are predicting yet another revenue blowout, up 44 percent compared with last year. Amazon's torrid growth more than 15 years after its founding makes it an object of envy and fear across the retail world. It is now a $100 billion company, about 12 times the value of Sears.
Viewed from a public relations point of view, however, the quarter was pretty much a disaster, at least until the announcement of the Kindle tablet on Sept. 28. First came the lengthy fight with the state of California over whether Amazon would collect sales tax. Even more damaging was a long article in The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa. It revealed that workers in Amazon's local warehouse were collapsing from heat stress as they struggled to ship copies of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" or "Pirates of the Caribbean" so quickly that the customers would never even consider going to a land-based store.
It was a striking snapshot of the underbelly of the Internet economy: Amazon arranged with the local ambulance service to have vehicles stationed outside the warehouse on peak heat days. As workers fell down on the job, they were whisked away to the hospital, the newspaper said.
Cetronia Ambulance Corps confirmed the Call's reporting and then stopped talking. Amazon declined to answer questions. But it garnered some ill will. American Rights at Work, a pro-union organization, said its "activists" had sent 23,000 letters to Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos.
Earlier this week, Amazonposted a note on its site revealing that there were "multiple" temperature problems at the warehouse -- "low temperature events" as well as "high temperature events."
The note was not completely clear, but it seems that workers in wintertime left the building during fire alarms and then were not immediately let back in. I asked Amazon why they were having so many fire alarms but got no immediate answer.
The retailer said in its note that it had "a new set of procedures" for the winter and had installed air conditioning for the summer. "It's safer to work in the Amazon fulfillment network than in a department store," it said, citing government survey data on nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses.
Amazon's relentlessness has made it a great company. But some in the tech world are beginning to wonder if there is a point at which you can become too driven, even if it is supposedly in the service of your customers. As Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land wrote in an open letter to Mr. Bezos at the height of the tax controversy: "Don't make me hate you."
Paul Saffo, an expert on Silicon Valley culture, says that traditional companies are owned by their shareholders but digital companies are in effect owned by their customers. Apple is the most celebrated example of this passion, but Amazon also evokes strong feelings. People shop there because they like what it stands for, or what they think it stands for.
"Amazon is not just a place you buy stuff," Mr. Saffo said. "You have an emotional attachment to it. So if Amazon thinks things like collecting taxes and how it treats its warehouse workers are not an issue for their customers, they're in for a surprise."

HEADLINE: 2 European Banks Post Mixed Results

BYLINE: JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Deutsche Bank reported a profit of $1.1 billion, a big rebound from a $1.6 billion loss a year earlier. UBS, which was hurt by a trading scandal that cost it $2.3 billion, saw its earnings fall 39 percent. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - As European officials struggle to find a solution to the sovereign debt crisis, two of the region's largest financial firms continue to deal with the fallout from the market turmoil.
On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank exceeded quarterly profit expectations, but Germany's largest lender warned of jobs cuts in the investment bank, following a drop in trading revenue stemming from the market mess. Under similar pressure, the Swiss bank UBS, which also was hurt by a trading scandal that cost it $2.3 billion, reported that earnings fell 39 percent in the third quarter, from a year earlier.
Profits at banks around the world have plunged, particularly in investment banking. Fearing that another financial crisis is brewing, regulators and shareholders are pushing financial firms to temper risk - all of which is weighing on operations.
Deutsche Bank reported profit of 777 million euros, or $1.1 billion, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 1.2 billion euros a year earlier. But pretax profit in the corporate banking and securities division, which includes the investment bank, plunged to 70 million euros in the quarter from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. Owing to the poor performance, Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, said further job cuts were possible, on top of the 10 percent reduction already under way.
Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said the climate for banking was "more difficult than at any time since the end of 2008" because of a deteriorating economy and financial market turbulence. "Our performance was, inevitably, impacted by this environment," Mr. Ackermann said in a statement.
At UBS, profit fell to 1.02 billion Swiss francs, or $1.15 billion, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 1.66 billion francs in the period a year earlier. The pretax loss at the investment banking unit widened to 650 million francs from 406 million francs because of the trading loss, while earnings at the wealth management unit rose.
Sergio P. Ermotti - the interim chief executive who took over after the resignation of Oswald J. Grubel in the wake of trading scandal - is now scaling back the struggling investment banking operation, to free up capital to invest in wealth management. UBS is expected to present its new strategy for the unit to investors in New York on Nov. 17.
"Current market conditions and trading activity are unlikely to improve materially, potentially creating headwinds for growth in revenues and net new money," UBS wrote in a letter to shareholders. But it added that a plan to reduce costs and scale back its investment banking operation meant "we have every reason to remain confident about our future."
The sovereign crisis may have additional short-term implications for Deutsche Bank. Political leaders are pushing banks under their purview to increase their reserves so they can withstand a default by Greece on its government bonds, a possibility that seems increasingly likely.
Deutsche Bank, which reported a loss of 185 million euros related to holdings of Greek bonds in the quarter, is among institutions that may need to raise more capital.
European regulators are expected to push banks to raise their Tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of reserves on hand, to 9 percent by June at the latest. While Deutsche Bank exceeds that standard now, regulators will probably impose tougher criteria that take into account possible damage caused by the sovereign debt crisis or a slumping economy. In that case, Deutsche Bank's reserves might sink below the minimum.
Mr. Krause said the bank would be able to increase its capital without resorting to government aid, by retaining future profits rather than paying them out to shareholders, for example.

HEADLINE: Help Wanted? Debating Unemployment Legislation

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Exploring reasons for and against President Obama's jobs bill. 

 BODY:
Overview | How is unemployment affecting the United States? What can be done to address the high rate of joblessness? Which steps should the federal government take, and which should it avoid? In this lesson, students explore arguments for and against the enactment of proposed legislation and hold a debate. 
Materials | At least one computer with Internet access and a projector, access to New York Times articles and other materials about the American Jobs Act.
Warm-Up | Show the class the graphic "Nation's Unemployment Landscape." Guide them through the three maps, focusing on the changes in the unemployment rate from 2007 through 2011 across the country; you may also want to focus on your state or region.
For context, as students look at the map share with them the following quotes from the article that accompanied the graphic, "Deep Recession Sharply Altered U.S. Jobless Map":
"The once-booming South, which entered the recession with the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, is now struggling with some of the highest rates."
"Unemployment remains high across much of the country - the national rate is 9.1 percent."
"The West has the highest unemployment in the nation. The collapse of the housing bubble left Nevada with the highest jobless rate, 13.4 percent, followed by California with 12.1 percent. Michigan has the third-highest rate, 11.2 percent, as a result of the longstanding woes of the American auto industry. "
Next, ask: What do you think the federal and state governments can do to address the unemployment problem and help create jobs? Lead a brainstorm and write student ideas on the board.
Explain that in September, President Obama proposed a bill called the American Jobs Act in a speech to Congress. Review with the class some of the main provisions of the bill and the main reasons Republican leaders like House Speaker John A. Boehner oppose it.
Tell the class that they will now find out more about the status of the bill in preparation to debate Democratic and Republican proposals and policies with respect to unemployment.
Related | In the article "President's Jobs Measure Is Turned Back in Key Senate Test," Robert Pear reports on the Senate's response to the president's proposed bill:
In a major setback for President Obama, the Senate on Tuesday blocked consideration of his $447 billion jobs bill, forcing the White House and Congressional Democrats to scramble to salvage parts of the plan, the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's push to revive a listless economy.
Read the entire article with the class, focusing on the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Why did both the House and Senate vote not to consider the jobs act as a whole?
        
What did Republican and Democratic leaders have to say about one another's stances?
        
According to the article, what are some of the key provisions of the president's plan?
        
What are some of the Republicans' specific arguments against the bill's provisions?
        
Which of the provisions do you think has potential for bipartisan support, and why?
Activity | Inform the class that they will be engaging in a "structured academic controversy," a kind of debate, about the president's jobs bill, to delve more deeply into the arguments on both sides.
Put students in pairs, and assign half of the pairs the pro-jobs bill position and half the anti-jobs bill position. Let students know that once they have researched their position, they will be presenting their argument to another pair that is assigned to the opposing side.
Give each pair the Debatable Issues handout (PDF) to track facts and arguments, and then lead them through the six steps of structured academic controversy.

To begin, each pair should gather news coverage and analysis. Good starting points are the Times Topics pages on Unemployment and Economic Stimulus.

When each pair has gathered ample background information, facts and quotes to develop their arguments, have each pair join another pair that was assigned an opposing position. Give each side five minutes to present their best arguments to the opposing side.
While one group is presenting, the job of the other group is to listen carefully and take notes in the other column of the Debatable Issues handout because they will need to be able to repeat the arguments that they hear to the other pair.

Once both pairs have presented their arguments, they must both repeat to their opponents the argument that they heard from them. If the opposing pair thinks their counterparts missed anything or got anything wrong, they should interject and correct the other pair.

In their groups of four, students take off the personae they were assigned and begin speaking as themselves again, sharing personal impressions and opinions about whether or not they think that President Obama's jobs bill is the right approach to address America's high unemployment rates. Remind them that they should pay attention to the arguments that they just presented and heard when formulating their own opinion on the issue.
Inform each group that they will need to come to either a consensus or a compromise or to be able to clearly explain why they could not reach one on the issue because they will need to present their group's conclusion about the issue to the class.

All small groups report back to the class about the consensus, compromise or stalemate that they reached when discussing their personal opinions about whether or not Congress should pass the American Jobs Act or enact similar legislation.

As a large group, ask students if this exercise helped them clarify their position on the issue? If so, how? Did they learn anything about the issue that they had not previously known? If so, what? Did anybody change their position during this exercise? Why or why not?
Going Further | Individually, students write letters to their Congressional representative and/or United States senator explaining their views about what portions of proposed unemployment legislation should or should not be passed. They should include specific bits of information gleaned from the debate activity. If desired, students can actually send their letters.

HEADLINE: How Rick Perry's Tax Plan Would Affect You

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A tax expert calculates how filers at different income levels and in different household situations would be affected by a flat-tax option. 

 BODY:
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, today released some details on his flat tax proposal. The plan would give Americans the option of determining their taxes based on an alternate system that has one tax rate and fewer deductions.
We asked the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, to help calculate how Mr. Perry's proposal might affect different kinds of American families. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow there, kindly crunched some numbers using what's known about the new proposal.
The chart below shows a few different types of families -- single, married with children, head of household with children, and retired -- and what kind of tax liabilities they would face under current law and under Mr. Perry's alternative system:
For each family structure, there are examples of households of different income classes, representing roughly the 20th percentile, median percentile, 80th percentile and 99th percentile income for each type of family. The sources of income and deductible expenses that Mr. Williams used to make these calculations are also representative of families at those income levels, he said. (For example, upper-income households are more likely to receive more income from capital gains.)
The lower tax option for each type of family is highlighted in blue.

As you can see, the highest-income households (at the 99th percentile) in every structure of family analyzed always benefit from opting into the Perry plan.
The poorest households, on the other hand, do not. That's primarily because the Perry plan, at least as currently described, does not seem to have refundable tax credits. The lowest tax liability a family can have under the family plan is $0, whereas under current law families that are poor enough can actually have a negative tax liability: in other words, on net poorer families government money instead of paying income taxes under the current system.
Middle-income and higher-income households (those at the median and 80th percentiles), sometimes benefit and sometimes don't in the Perry plan, depending on their family structure. In these income groups, single people and heads of households with children are better off under the old system, whereas married couples with children and retired couples should opt for the new system.

HEADLINE: House Writes a Bill to Excuse U.S. Carriers

BYLINE: ELISABETH ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: A bill tells American airline carriers that it is illegal for them to participate in the European Union's cap and trade system, which charges companies for producing emissions beyond their allotted limits. 

 BODY:
One of the more stranger bills to be considered by Congress recently passed by a voice vote on Monday evening. Officially named the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011, it essentially tells American airline carriers that it is illegal for them to participate in the European Union's cap and trade system, which charges companies for producing emissions beyond their allotted limit.
Beginning Jan. 1, all flights landing at European Union airports will in theory incur a penalty if they produce excessive emissions. American carriers, airlines, with a good measure of support from the Obama administration, have been campaigning to be exempted from the rules. House Bill 2594, sponsored by Representative John Mica, Republican of Florida, is another salvo in that effort.
The European Commission will go forward with its plan to include all airlines, said Isaac Valero-Ladron, the European Union's spokesman for climate action. "'We are confident that the U.S. will respect European law, as E.U. always respects U.S. law," Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's commissioner for climate action, tweeted just after the vote.
A large number of industries already take part in the European Union's six-year-old Emissions Trading Scheme, from cement factories to power plants. The European Commission argues that it would be unfair to give the airline industry a pass when everyone else is reducing their carbon dioxide emissions.
Air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases. Ms. Hedegaard has noted that airlines that substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions and exceed their reduction targets will pay no extra charge.
American airlines filed a suit in the European Court of Justice to win exemption from the requirement. They argue that Europe has no right to regulate emissions on flights between the United States and Europe since most of the carbon dioxide is released in international airspace.The Obama administration has supported their cause in international negotiations.
In a preliminary judgment this month, the European court's advocate general found against the carriers. After all, it noted, countries and cities worldwide impose a variety of landing fees, and airlines that want to land at their airports have to pay them.
Estimates of how much the new program will add to a trans-Atlantic ticket price vary widely, from a few dollars to around $60, in part because the cost depends on how well a particular airline improves its environmental performance. 
Jake Schmidt, international climate policy director at the National Resources Defense Council, pointed out that the extra charge is similar to what American passengers pay for checking baggage on domestic flights. 
"The E.U. program will provide an incentive for airlines to find the best way to reduce their fuel use and encourage them to purchase the most efficient aircraft that are already rolling off the production line," he said. "These are investments that will spur savings to American consumers as U.S.-based carriers improve the efficiency of their aged fleet."
It is unclear how House lawmakers think that mandate could be enforced. The bill reads, "The secretary of transportation shall prohibit an operator of civil aircraft of the United States from participating in any emissions trading scheme unilaterally established by the European Union."
Despite their protests, United States airlines have been making preparations to comply with the European system, calculating flight emissions to establish a baseline, for example. Can or would the secretary of transportation, Ray LaHood, prevent airlines from flying to Europe or require them to defy a European law? 
The bill is only the latest in a string of measures emanating from the House of Representatives that attempt to rebuff or negate environmental legislation. 
Another bill, the Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act, introduced by Representative Michele Bachmann, the Republican presidential candidate, seeks to undo energy efficiency standards for light bulbs.

HEADLINE: Obama Attacks Perry on Flat Tax

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A New memo argues that Rick Perry's tax plan "radically restructures the tax system and shifts a greater tax burden onto the middle class." 

 BODY:
Rick Perry's decision to embrace a flat tax as a central part of his economic plan, as several other Republican candidates have, is providing an opportunity for President Obama's campaign.
The president's advisers are eager to characterize the advocates of a flat tax as shills for the wealthy in the United States - part of Mr. Obama's overall message that the Republican Party is out of step with the interests of the middle class.
That's just what his campaign argued in a new memorandum issued Tuesday morning by Mr. Obama's policy director, James Kvaal. In the memo, Mr. Kvaal argues that Mr. Perry's tax plan "radically restructures the tax system and shifts a greater tax burden onto the middle class."
Under a flat tax, Mr. Kvaal says, the progressive nature of the current tax code would be lost, with everyone paying the same rate. That would lead to drastically lower tax rates for the wealthy, he says, and higher taxes for the middle class, which might lose deductions for their homes or child care.
"Many flat tax proposals also eliminate all taxation on capital gains and other investment income so that the wealthiest, who generate much of their income from investments, rather than work, see huge gains," the memorandum argues.
Details of Mr. Perry's tax proposal were only beginning to leak out Monday night, so the criticism from Mr. Obama's advisers was a bit premature. But the president's campaign was less interested in the details than in establishing the anti-middle-class argument.
In the memo, Mr. Kvaal also criticizes Mr. Perry's chief rival, Mitt Romney, who has not embraced a flat tax but has said he would seek to make the tax code simpler -- and flatter -- than it currently is.
"While the economic plan he unveiled almost two months ago did not propose a flat tax, it is also likely to shift the tax burden onto the middle class," Mr. Kvaal said.
The memo concludes that the tax plans of both of the Republican candidates would lead to the same results: lower taxes for the wealthy and higher taxes for middle class Americans.
Both Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney will argue the opposite, saying that their economic plans -- and the tax cuts embedded in them -- will spur economic growth and create new wealth available to everyone, including the middle class.
Mr. Perry is set to announce his tax plan on Tuesday morning in South Carolina.
The argument is likely to be at the core of the general election campaign once the Republican Party picks a nominee.
If Mr. Perry wins the nomination, the fight with Mr. Obama is likely to include a clash over whether a flat tax would be good for the country. If Mr. Romney is the nominee, the fight will shift some to a dispute about the effect of the various tax cuts that the former Massachusetts governor has proposed.
But either way, the Obama campaign is sounding eager to have that fight.
"Both plans are likely to be costly, driving up the deficit at a time of historic fiscal challenges," Mr. Kvaal writes. "And under both plans, the most fortunate Americans would pay less while the middle class would pay a higher share."

HEADLINE: Why It's Good for Romney to Be at 21 Percent

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: There is another way to look at Mitt Romney's consistently low poll numbers among Republicans, which is that he is exactly where he wants to be. 

 BODY:
He's the establishment favorite, the guy who's run before, the clear winner in most debates. He seems eminently electable. So why can't Mitt Romney close the deal with Republican voters?
That's the question underscored by the New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday, in which Mr. Romney is stuck at 21 percent, effectively running alongside Herman Cain (who actually came in at 25 percent, a statistical tie with Mr. Romney). While national polls aren't terribly meaningful at this stage of a race (just ask President Giuliani), Republican pollsters will tell you that a presumed nominee should be polling in the mid- to high-30s. Instead, something like three quarters of the party's primary electorate continues to search for a Romney alternative.
All of this could suggest that Mr. Romney is this year's Hillary Rodham Clinton - an institutional party favorite on his way to losing the nomination. But there's another way to look at the data, which is that Mr. Romney is actually exactly where he wants to be.
Here's why: as a presumptive front-runner who is also a Massachusetts Republican (and the author of an Obama-style health care law), Mr. Romney was always going to face a dilemma on his way to the nomination. On one hand, he could work to win over conservatives during the primaries, in which case he would then have to spend a lot of next year reassuring independent voters that he was neither shrilly partisan nor willing to say just about anything to get elected. Or he could effectively run a general election strategy right from the start, in which case he would have to work hard to keep his party unified after the convention.
If you're Mr. Romney, you would certainly prefer to follow the second path. After all, no matter how ambivalent conservative voters may feel about their nominee, they're not at all ambivalent about President Obama, and you would have to assume that most of them can be persuaded to vote against him next year, no matter whom they have to pull the lever for. Mr. Romney can probably count on solid support among conservatives if he's nominated - assuming, of course, that there isn't a Sarah Palin or some other renegade conservative willing to jump in as an independent candidate next fall.
Independent voters, on the other hand, are increasingly hostile to anything that feels like blindly partisan politics, and their views of the Tea Party insurgency have grown decidedly more negative in recent months. Independents voted heavily for Mr. Obama in 2008, and it's not unthinkable that some sizable segment of them will do so again, even in a cratering economy, if the Republican alternative seems too extreme or unprincipled.
If Republican voters appeared at this point to be coalescing around a more conservative challenger - if, say, Rick Perry were emerging as the clear anti-Romney in the race - then the current poll numbers would, in fact, represent a serious problem for Mr. Romney. They would mean that he almost certainly had to lurch more rightward, taking steps to shore up his support among the Bob Jones University crowd and so forth.
But in fact, that conservative vote remains, at this point, divided among the rest of the field, with Mr. Cain the main beneficiary. And let's be real about this: the odds of Mr. Cain winning the Republican nomination would seem to be only slightly better than the odds of Mr. Perry discovering the unified string theory. This means that, for the moment anyway, Mr. Romney can probably afford to continue running against Mr. Obama, rather than against his Republican rivals - no matter how unimpressive his poll numbers may be.
In some ways, then, Mr. Romney's situation is less reminiscent of Mrs. Clinton's than it is of her husband's. When Bill Clinton first ran for president in 1992, a field of underwhelming candidates was vying to unseat George H.W. Bush during a time of similar economic angst. Mr. Clinton seemed, during that primary campaign, to be a flawed candidate - too little known, too conservative for his party's activists, too flawed in his personal life. Democrats searched long and hard for a better alternative, most notably Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who was that year's version of Chris Christie or Mitch Daniels. 
In the end, though, the Democratic base came around to the idea that Mr. Clinton, while no one's idea of a solid liberal, was its best available nominee. And Mr. Clinton emerged from the primaries ideally situated to attract the moderate and independent voters he needed to win in November.
If Mr. Romney performs well in Iowa and goes on to win in New Hampshire, you can bet that his national poll numbers will soar, as more Republican voters at last embrace his candidacy. For now, though, the lack of enthusiasm among some Republican voters may simply be the price he has to pay for speaking to the broad center of the American electorate, as long as there isn't any one, credible candidate poised to consolidate conservative opposition.
Perhaps the right question to ask isn't, "Why can't Mr. Romney close with Republican voters?" But rather, "Does he really have to?"

HEADLINE: Romney Taps a Virginia Suburb for Cash

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney finds some support in Virginia in a wealthy corner of the state. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is coming to Virginia on Wednesday for a pep talk at the Northern Virginia Republican headquarters.
But tonight, he'll gather with 394 people -- including the state's governor, Bob McDonnell -- for a fundraiser at the home of the technology executive Bobbie Kilberg that is expected to collect $322,000 for his presidential campaign.
On the menu: grilled filet, ham with Nieman Marcus dip, salmon, mini-Peking Duck, shrimp and parmesan puffs.
Mr. McDonnell, the chairman of the Republican Governor's Association, is not endorsing Mr. Romney. But his appearance at the event is sure to raise eyebrows about who Mr. McDonnell might eventually back.
"The Governor thinks very highly of Mitt Romney and his record in both the private and public sectors," his spokesman, Tucker Martin, said. "He believes he is running a positive, optimistic campaign for President."
Ms. Kilberg, who serves as the president of the Northern Virginia Technology Council, has been active in Republican fundraising for
years. In a brief interview Tuesday, she said she had initially decided to back Haley Barbour, the governor of Mississippi, if he ran
for president.
The afternoon that Mr. Haley announced that he would not run, Ms. Kilberg received a call two hours later -- from Mr. Romney.
"I have a lot of respect for him as a person, for his competence, forhis understanding of the economy," Ms. Kilberg said, in-between
dealing with outdoor heaters for the event and an ink-jet printer that had run out of ink.
"He is somebody who is much more comfortable with himself than I sensed he was in 2008," she said.
Tonight's fundraiser at Mr. Kilberg's home in the upscale McLean suburb is being attended by many of the region's wealthy technology and business executives. Ms. Kilberg said that in recent weeks, raising money from them for Mr. Romney has gotten easier.
"The most typical response you get is, 'I think he's going to get the nomination and its time to get on board,'" Ms. Kilberg said. "Rick
Perry's a friend of mine. But people have really come to the conclusion that Mitt will win the nomination."

HEADLINE: Zaarly Reels In $14 Million and Meg Whitman

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Zaarly, a new online marketplace, is hoping it will be the next eBay or Craigslist and is adding former eBay chief executive, Meg Whitman, to its board. 

 BODY:
EBay transformed the way people sold vintage trinkets online. Craigslist changed the way people bought new sofas and hunted for apartments in their towns. A new start-up called Zaarly hopes to alter the way people outsource simple errands and tasks.
On Tuesday, the company announced that it raised $14.1 million in financing from Kleiner Perkins and Sands Capital Ventures, among others. Previously, the company raised a seed round of $1 million from a notable list of investors, including Ashton Kutcher, Ron Conway, Paul Buchheit and Lightbank, among others,. The company says it will use the fresh money to invest in its operations and technical development, as well as to hire employees to zero in on connecting buyers and sellers in each specific market.
But Bo Fishback, the chief executive and founder of the company, said the most exciting piece of the news was that the company was also gaining Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the former chief executive of eBay, as a board member.
"She joined eBay when it was almost the exact same size Zaarly was, 30 people," he said. "In the world of building marketplaces, build trust and engage in the community, there's no one better than her."
Zaarly, which was beta-tested in Austin, Tex., during South by Southwest last March, was introduced nationally in early May. Since then, the company says the service has attracted more than 100,000 users, with more than $6 million in transactions posted to the site. The site works by letting people post requests for an item or service, and then lets other people, businesses and companies bid to fulfill those needs. Once an agreement is met, Zaarly connects the two parties so they can complete the deal. People can either pay in cash, or through Zaarly's payment system.
Mr. Fishback said Ms. Whitman's expertise would come in handy as the company began building momentum in major cities, each which have their own particular quirks and demands. In Los Angeles, for example, the market for second-hand cars is denser than in New York, where Zaarly users are much more interested in hiring people to help them out with service and errand-oriented tasks.
"Until now, our main goal was to get it up and running," he said. "Now, we have to figure out how to really nail a hyperlocal technology company."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Falls As Some Home Prices Rise

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Home prices rose in August in half of the large cities measured by a private survey, a sign that prices are stabilizing in some hard-hit parts of the country. Separately, consumer confidence fell in October to the lowest level since March 2009. 
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index showed Tuesday that home prices increased in August from July in 10 of the 20 cities tracked. That was the fifth consecutive month that at least half of the cities in the survey showed monthly gains.
The biggest price increases were in Washington, Chicago and Detroit. The greatest declines were in Atlanta and Los Angeles.
The August figures provide a ''modest glimmer of hope'' that some areas may have bottomed out and could be turning around, said David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.'s index committee.
He noted that cities in the Midwest -- Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis -- had shown some strength since May.
In Detroit, the recovering auto industry has helped lead a small rebound in the housing market. Home prices have risen 2.7 percent since August 2010, making it and Washington the only two cities to post a year-over-year gain in that time.
Detroit was one of the cities hit hardest after the housing bubble burst more than four years ago. Home prices there are coming off 1995 levels. So the gains are relatively small compared with how far prices had fallen.
In Minneapolis and Chicago, fewer homes are being put on sale, leading to higher prices and better sales figures. That is probably because of fewer foreclosures in those cities. September's drop in homes for sale in the Twin Cities was the largest in more than seven years, according to the Minneapolis Area Association of Realtors.
Still, Robert J. Shiller, the co-founder of the index and an economics professor at Yale, told CNBC that overall home prices were ''flat'' and a recovery in the housing market was not on the horizon.
The index, which covers half of all homes in the United States, measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The August figures are the latest available.
Prices are certain to fall again once banks resume millions of foreclosures. They have been delayed because of a yearlong government investigation of mortgage lending practices.
A second private group reported on Tuesday that Americans say they feel worse about the economy than they have since the depths of the great recession. Consumer confidence fell in October to the lowest level since March 2009, reflecting the big hit the stock market took this summer and frustration with an recovery that does not feel like one.
The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer sentiment came in at 39.8, down about six points from September and seven points lower than economists were expecting.
The reading is still well above the 26.9 recorded two and a half years ago. But it is not even within shouting distance of 90, which is what it takes to signal that the economy is on solid footing.
Economists watch consumer confidence closely because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. The index measures how shoppers feel about business conditions, the job market and the next six months.

HEADLINE: Stocks Close Sharply Lower on News From Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks in the United States and Europe sank Tuesday as the markets got another jolt from the European Union -- this time the abrupt cancellation of a meeting of finance ministers that was meant to precede a leaders' summit meeting on Wednesday.
The sovereign debt problems in European nations that share the euro have loomed over the markets for more than a year, with investors able to price in some of the twists and turns in the efforts to resolve them. But on Tuesday, stocks that had opened lower dipped further on concern about what the cancellation of the meeting might portend. 
Financial stocks in particular declined steeply, more than 3 percent. Europe's leaders said they had made some progress over the weekend on measures aimed at addressing their financial and economic problems, but a big issue that analysts had expected to be tackled on Wednesday was how to expand the stability fund of 440 billion euros, or $611 billion, so that it would cover Spain and Italy, if necessary.
''Investors have been overly optimistic on the progress made by European leaders and yes, I think there is good news from Europe, but there seems to be the presumption that because they are meeting everything would work out smoothly,'' said Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones. ''It is never quite as much or as fast as anyone would like.''
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down by 207 points, or 1.74 percent, at 11,706.62, and the Nasdaq composite index slid 2.3 percent, to 2,638.42. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which measures the broader market, fell by 2 percent, to 1,229.05.
The Euro Stoxx index closed down 1.06 percent, and markets in Paris and Germany were also lower.
The new lows on Tuesday derailed some of the gains made in recent days that had sent the Dow and the Nasdaq higher for the year. The Nasdaq returned to the red for the year, and the S.& P. was down more than 2 percent in the year to date.
Materials, industrials, energy and consumer discretionary sectors each fell by 2 percent or more. The consumer index was pulled down by a sharp drop in Netflix shares, which were down more than 34 percent at $77.37. Netflix had reported that it expected lower revenue and profits in the fourth quarter because of recent changes in pricing.
Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial, said that the markets had started the day slightly lower because of some earnings reports.
United Parcel Service, for example, said earnings per share rose 14 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same period in 2010. But it said total domestic volume growth was flat ''as a result of the slow U.S. economy.''
On Monday, Caterpillar helped to lift trading with strong results, but on Tuesday, 3M, another bellwether company, missed earnings forecasts and lowered its guidance.
3M stock was down by 6.25 percent, at $77.04, and U.P.S. was down by about 2 percent at $69.35. ''We all know that Europe is on the verge of a mild recession but hearing that from a company that typically manages through these situations quite well means it may be more significant,'' Ms. Warne said, referring to 3M. ''It suggests it may also be a problem for other companies.''
DuPont, the chemical manufacturer, posted quarterly results that exceeded forecasts, with net income up 23 percent, or 48 cents per share. The company said that it was raising its expectations for full-year earnings, but also that it expected slower global growth in the fourth quarter of the year. Its shares were lower by about 2.5 percent, at $44.94.
Analysts said outlooks were mixed and economic data relatively weaker, pointing to slow growth. ''That was another dampener, if you will, on sentiment,'' said Wasif Latif, vice president for equity investments at the USAA Investment Management Company.
But, he added that the market's main driver was Europe. ''So today is: let's take some money off the table,'' he said.
Gold was up more than 2 percent at just over $1,700 an ounce. Safer assets became more attractive ahead of the summit meeting on Wednesday, said Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist at Forex.com.
In economic news, home prices showed a modest rise in 10 of 20 cities surveyed in the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index. But consumer confidence fell, as reflected in a decline in the Conference Board's index to 39.8 points in October after a reading of 46.4 in September.
Financial market turmoil has weighed heavily on consumer confidence, along with the ailing jobs market, Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, wrote in a research note.
The United States 10-year Treasury bond rose to 100 3/32, from 99 2/32 on Monday. The yield was 2.11 percent.

HEADLINE: It's Official: The Rich Get Richer

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The top 1 percent of earners more than doubled their share of the nation's income over the last three decades, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday, in a new report likely to figure prominently in the escalating political fight over how to revive the economy, create jobs and lower the federal debt.
In addition, the report said, government policy has become less redistributive since the late 1970s, doing less to reduce the concentration of income. 
''The equalizing effect of federal taxes was smaller'' in 2007 than in 1979, as ''the composition of federal revenues shifted away from progressive income taxes to less-progressive payroll taxes,'' the budget office said.
Also, it said, federal benefit payments are doing less to even out the distribution of income, as a growing share of benefits, like Social Security, goes to older Americans, regardless of their income.
The report, requested several years ago, was issued as lawmakers tussle over how to reduce unemployment, a joint committee of Congress weighs changes in the tax code and protesters around the country rail against disparities in income between rich and poor.
In its report, the budget office found that from 1979 to 2007, average inflation-adjusted after-tax income grew by 275 percent for the 1 percent of the population with the highest income. For others in the top 20 percent of the population, average real after-tax household income grew by 65 percent.
By contrast, the budget office said, for the poorest fifth of the population, average real after-tax household income rose 18 percent.
And for the three-fifths of people in the middle of the income scale, the growth in such household income was just under 40 percent.
The findings, based on a rigorous analysis of data from the Internal Revenue Service and the Census Bureau, are generally consistent with studies by some private researchers and academic economists. But because they carry the imprimatur of the nonpartisan budget office, they are likely to have a major impact on the debate in Congress over the fairness of federal tax and spending policies.
Also cited as factors contributing to the rapid growth of income at the top were the structure of executive compensation; high salaries for some ''superstars'' in sports and the arts; the increasing size of the financial services industry; and the growing role of capital gains, which go disproportionately to higher-income households.
The report found that higher-income households got a larger share of the pie, while other households got smaller shares.
Specifically the report made these points:
The share of after-tax household income for the top 1 percent of the population more than doubled, climbing to 17 percent in 2007 from nearly 8 percent in 1979.
The most affluent fifth of the population received 53 percent of after-tax household income in 2007, up from 43 percent in 1979. In other words, the after-tax income of the most affluent fifth exceeded the income of the other four-fifths of the population.
People in the lowest fifth of the population received about 5 percent of after-tax household income in 2007, down from 7 percent in 1979.
People in the middle three-fifths of the population saw their shares of after-tax income decline by 2 to 3 percentage points from 1979 to 2007.
The study was requested by Senators Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, when he was the senior Republican on the panel.
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the report was ''the latest evidence of the alarming rise in income inequality.''
House Republicans pushed back Tuesday against President Obama's complaint that they were blocking bills to create jobs. Speaker John A. Boehner said he agreed with Mr. Obama's new slogan, ''we can't wait,'' and he said that 15 House-passed bills were ''sitting over in the Senate, waiting for action.''
On Tuesday, the White House endorsed another bill, which is likely to be passed by the House this week with bipartisan support. The bill would repeal a requirement for federal, state and local government agencies to withhold 3 percent of certain payments to suppliers of goods and services and to deposit the money with the Internal Revenue Service.
This requirement was originally adopted as a tax-compliance measure, and the Congressional Budget Office said its repeal would reduce federal revenues by $11 billion over 10 years.
House Republicans would offset the cost with a bill that reduces federal spending on Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. The White House said it supported the bill, intended to fix an apparent error in the law, under which hundreds of thousands of middle-income early retirees can get Medicaid coverage meant for the poor.
The joint Congressional committee on deficit reduction is considering changes in a wide range of benefit programs.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Tuesday that he was hopeful but not entirely confident that the panel would succeed in reaching a bipartisan agreement to reduce federal deficits by $1.2 trillion over 10 years.
''Hopeful is not confident,'' Mr. Hoyer said.

 BODY:
Rising energy demand in emerging economies, like China and India, is a driving force in the natural gas and oil industry and is helping to push prices higher. At the same time, technological advances are making the recovery of more conventional and unconventional resources feasible, reshaping the energy landscape around the world. 
PROVEN RESERVES, 2011 ESTIMATES
AMERICAS Tar sands in Canada, shale gas and ''tight'' oil in the United States, the deepwater ''pre-salt'' oil fields in Brazil and expanded reserves of extra-heavy oil in Venezuela all provide huge opportunity for the energy industry, but bring technical and economic challenges.
AFRICA The development of resources in Libya and Nigeria hasbeen hampered by conflict there. In Libya there are unknowns associated with a new government, and in Nigeria there is continuing debate in Parliament over new legislation regulating the energy sector. The resources are there, however, should solutions be found.
MIDDLE EAST Qatar, only recently the world's largest liquefied natural gasexporter, has capped new production while it reviews its reserves. In Iraq, new production has been limited by poor infrastructure and personnel, and political uncertainties. But there, as in Iran, the resources are vast.
RUSSIA AND CENTRAL ASIAOILIN BILLIONS OF BARRELS12.915TH175.23RD20.713THRussia is developing more challenging fieldsas output from some existing ones declines. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have discovered or are developing new oil and gas resources. There are plans to expand the 1,400- mile Kazakhstan-China pipeline.
ASIAChinese demand has driven a rapid increase in gas exploration and production. There may also be huge shale gas opportunities in China. Australia is developing unconventional gas for exports through L.N.G. projects and large offshore fields like the Greater Gorgon. Indonesia also aims to reach the Chinese market through L.N.G.
Note: The U.S. Energy Information Administration defines proven reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that have been shown with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Countries may use somewhat different standards when reporting their figures.

HEADLINE: Arctic Village Is Torn by Plan For Oil Drilling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and ERIK OLSEN

 BODY:
POINT HOPE, Alaska -- He once hurled harpoons at whales, but on this platinum afternoon beside the Arctic Ocean he swung a 5-iron at a frustrating little ball.
''I think that one would have hit the green,'' said Sayers Tuzroyluk, 65, finally striking a clean, straight drive, ''if there was a green.''
No, there is not yet a golf course here, 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, just a daunting expanse of rough and the world's most challenging water hazard -- an ocean that holds one of the largest remaining oil reserves in the United States but buries it in ice and darkness for much of the year.
''One of these days we're going to get a course here,'' Mr. Tuzroyluk said. ''We've just got to get enough guys interested. What do they say, 'If you make it, they will come'?'' 
Sure enough, many things that once seemed improbable in this place so far away and unforgiving have now become central to its existence, including the smooth commercial landing strip built beside the collapsing sod houses some elders here were born in, and the satellite dishes looming over polar bear skins drying on front porches. Now, however, the striking blend of old and new, and the relative ease with which people here navigate it, are being tested by the strongest push yet to drill for oil offshore.
Perhaps more than any other village in the Arctic, Point Hope has a history of uniting against outside forces and, if not prevailing over them, at least outlasting them. Now it is divided. Mr. Tuzroyluk is chairman of the $30 million Tikigaq Corporation here, one of more than 200 native corporations in Alaska authorized by Congress. The corporation, whose shareholders are mostly village residents, supports drilling. Yet the Native Village of Point Hope, whose council is elected by village residents, officially opposed drilling.
''Our town,'' Mr. Tuzroyluk said, ''we're kind of torn apart between development and sustaining our lifestyle.''
With the Obama administration having lifted a moratorium on offshore drilling in the Arctic and elsewhere, Shell Oil has received preliminary permits to drill exploratory wells off the coast of Alaska as soon as next summer. The government says that as many as 27 billion barrels of oil could be produced, more than has been produced by Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil fields since they were discovered in 1968. The State of Alaska projects that as many as 50,000 jobs could be created in the region in the coming decades. Fewer than 10,000 people live in the coastal regions of Arctic Alaska.
Yet Shell's rigs would work in the same sea where people here have hunted migrating endangered bowhead whales for thousands of years and still do, trekking from this thin spit in the Chukchi Sea across the frozen ocean each spring and slipping into the water in sealskin boats, deliberately doing things traditionally even as they have embraced change in other ways. The whale was why people were able to survive here, and it is still the emotional anchor of the culture. People worry intensely that offshore drilling would hurt the bowhead population -- and that a spill could destroy it.
''That's our garden out there,'' Susie Frankson, 65, said. ''Don't mess with our garden.''
The most vocal people here are those who oppose drilling. They worry over how much more pressure their ancient, already compromised culture can take. But plenty also think their continued survival will depend on trying to profit from oil.
Few people publicly say they support it, but many say it is inevitable. The region has yet to find a viable economic alternative to oil.
North Slope Borough, the local government based in Barrow that presides over Point Hope and other Arctic villages, depends on onshore production from the aging Prudhoe Bay fields for more than 95 percent of its revenues. But onshore production is declining, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is operating at a third of its capacity.
''Our Inupiat people acknowledge and recognize that, and it's a very tough, tough call to make,'' said Mayor Edward S. Itta of North Slope Borough, whose term ends next month.
Mr. Itta said that the borough had pressed Shell to improve its spill-response capabilities, to shut down its operations during the fall whale hunt, not to discharge drilling waste into the ocean and to hire local residents.
''All I've ever tried to do is strike a balance so that mitigation measures are put in to protect our way of life,'' the mayor said.
In the 1840s, commercial whalers from New England and elsewhere came here and started a brutal industry from the bowheads. But when the outsiders sought to establish a station to process whale oil for use as fuel, Point Hope forced them to do so five miles away, at a place that came to be called Jabbertown for all the languages spoken by the immigrant workers there.
''The hunger for oil,'' said Steven Oomittuk, the mayor of Point Hope, ''our ancestors went through it before.''
A century after commercial whaling began, the physicist Edward Teller, a proponent of nuclear weapons, aggressively pursued in the late 1950s what now seems like a farfetched scheme: Mr. Teller wanted to detonate a series of nuclear bombs in the coastline at Cape Thompson, about 20 miles south of Point Hope, with the goal of carving out a grand Arctic port.
Supported by college professors and others who determined that Point Hope could be devastated by nuclear fallout, the village became a cause for a national environmental movement. The eventual rejection of Mr. Teller's plan, known as Project Chariot, is described in the book ''The Firecracker Boys,'' by the historian Dan O'Neill.
Residents here are acutely aware of their history of resistance, and it is common to hear people say they will also fight off Shell. Once again, national environmental groups have highlighted their cause, and lawsuits are pending. But a vocal village opponent of drilling, Carolyn Cannon, lost her seat on the Village Council in elections this month, and she was also defeated in a bid for a seat on the broader North Slope Borough Assembly.
Several people said Ms. Cannon's management style, not her message of opposition, had been responsible for her loss. She did not respond to several requests for an interview.
Lily Tuzroyluk, who is executive director of the Native Village (and a distant relative of Mr. Tuzroyluk of the village corporation), said the council was encouraging the village corporation to support alternative energy, not fossil fuels. The Tikigaq Corporation, which uses Point Hope's original Inupiat name, already has a small contract with Shell to monitor vessel traffic and subsistence hunting in the Arctic and hopes for more work.
Corporation leaders say oil and other resource development are the best ways, at least for now, to continue providing dividends to residents, which sometimes amount to several thousand dollars per person per year.
''We do love our whale, but it's such a small percentage of what we live on now,'' Sayers Tuzroyluk said. ''If I had a choice to go back to the way things used to be, I probably would go back. But we can never go back.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, 2 Big Banks Are Warning Of Cutbacks

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and JULIA WERDIGIER; Julia Werdigier reported from London.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - As European officials struggle to find a solution to the sovereign debt crisis, two of the region's largest financial firms continue to deal with the fallout from the market turmoil.
On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank exceeded quarterly profit expectations, but Germany's largest lender warned of jobs cuts in the investment bank, following a drop in trading revenue stemming from the market mess. Under similar pressure, the Swiss bank UBS, which also was hurt by a trading scandal that cost it $2.3 billion, reported that earnings fell 39 percent in the third quarter, from a year earlier.
Profits at banks around the world have plunged, particularly in investment banking. Fearing that another financial crisis is brewing, regulators and shareholders are pushing financial firms to temper risk - all of which is weighing on operations. 
Deutsche Bank reported profit of 777 million euros, or $1.1 billion, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 1.2 billion euros a year earlier. But pretax profit in the corporate banking and securities division, which includes the investment bank, plunged to 70 million euros in the quarter from 1.1 billion euros a year earlier. Owing to the poor performance, Stefan Krause, the bank's chief financial officer, said further job cuts were possible, on top of the 10 percent reduction already under way.
Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said the climate for banking was ''more difficult than at any time since the end of 2008'' because of a deteriorating economy and financial market turbulence. ''Our performance was, inevitably, impacted by this environment,'' Mr. Ackermann said in a statement.
At UBS, profit fell to 1.02 billion Swiss francs, or $1.15 billion, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from 1.66 billion francs in the period a year earlier. The pretax loss at the investment banking unit widened to 650 million francs from 406 million francs because of the trading loss, while earnings at the wealth management unit rose.
Sergio P. Ermotti - the interim chief executive who took over after the resignation of Oswald J. Grubel in the wake of trading scandal - is now scaling back the struggling investment banking operation, to free up capital to invest in wealth management. UBS is expected to present its new strategy for the unit to investors in New York on Nov. 17.
''Current market conditions and trading activity are unlikely to improve materially, potentially creating headwinds for growth in revenues and net new money,'' UBS wrote in a letter to shareholders. But it added that a plan to reduce costs and scale back its investment banking operation meant ''we have every reason to remain confident about our future.''
The sovereign crisis may have additional short-term implications for Deutsche Bank. Political leaders are pushing banks under their purview to increase their reserves so they can withstand a default by Greece on its government bonds, a possibility that seems increasingly likely.
Deutsche Bank, which reported a loss of 185 million euros related to holdings of Greek bonds in the quarter, is among institutions that may need to raise more capital.
European regulators are expected to push banks to raise their Tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of reserves on hand, to 9 percent by June at the latest. While Deutsche Bank exceeds that standard now, regulators will probably impose tougher criteria that take into account possible damage caused by the sovereign debt crisis or a slumping economy. In that case, Deutsche Bank's reserves might sink below the minimum.
Mr. Krause said the bank would be able to increase its capital without resorting to government aid, by retaining future profits rather than paying them out to shareholders, for example.
Julia Werdigier reported from London.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Real Scare Is Not Being Scary

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Chainsaws? Yawn. Bathtub electrocutions? Done them. Demented, blood-thirsty clowns? So 2001.
For Universal Orlando, the big theme park here that counts on Halloween as a crucial profit center, the art of the scare sure isn't as easy as it used to be.
The challenge is not size or money. Universal spends millions to stage and market its Halloween Horror Nights, which this year include eight haunted houses and multiple ''scare zone'' street parties on 25 nights. No, the scarce resource is ideas: coming up with new ways to entertain a ''been-there, screamed-at-that'' customer base raised on torture movies like ''Saw'' and bloody video games.
''These people are paying to get the bejesus scared out of them, and every year it gets harder,'' said Patrick Braillard, a show director for the park. ''We look at each other and say, 'What's left to do?' '' 
It's no small worry. This movie-centered theme park, owned by Comcast's NBC Universal, would not provide Halloween-related financial details, but the revenue appears to be considerable. Entry to Horror Nights starts at $42 (although discounts are available), and analysts estimate that as many as 500,000 a year have attended. Add in sales of beer, food and merchandise, and substantial profits are at stake.
Desperate to increase their off-season business, theme parks started circling Oct. 31 on their calendars in the late 1990s, led by Universal on the East Coast and Knott's Berry Farm in California. It was a smart call: America's obsession with Halloween as a cultural event was just starting to spike, and even in a stagnant economy, the growth shows few signs of slowing. The National Retail Federation estimates that total Halloween spending in the United States this year will total $6.8 billion, up from $3.3 billion in 2005.
Along the way, theme parks have played a major role in globalizing the holiday. Universal Studios Singapore is holding its first Horror Nights this year, for instance, while Disney now mounts Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween events at its parks in Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo, as well as the United States.
Here in central Florida, the haunted house scene has become rather, well, cutthroat. In 1990, when Universal first staged a horror event, it didn't take much more than a couple of boos and a bowl of spaghetti guts to spook visitors. Since then, Disney's Magic Kingdom, Sea World and Busch Gardens have steadily increased their own Halloween offerings.
To keep their footing on this shifting terrain -- that is, to keep scaring people and making money from it -- Universal's fright makers have turned to an intense, year-round planning and construction regimen. ''A fright factory,'' said Mike Aiello, another show director with the park's creative team.
Preparation starts in early October for the following year's Horror Nights, Mr. Aiello said. The creative team starts by spewing out ideas and listing them on a white board, then spending several weeks culling and refining concepts and sometimes combining them. Over the years the park has burned through existing Halloween characters -- Freddy Krueger, Jason and his hockey mask -- so the goal is to invent new horror stories.
This year, for instance, a haunted house called ''Nightingales: Blood Prey'' is a mash-up of two concepts thrown on that board: terror in a World War I trench and demonic nurses that feast on the weak and dying.
The park sometimes gets help from its corporate cousin Universal Pictures. This year both Universal in Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood, near Los Angeles, constructed haunted houses around ''The Thing,'' a remake of John Carpenter's 1982 horror classic. Universal Pictures released that film on Oct. 14 to bleak results; ticket sales total about $15 million.
Once the park planners select general concepts, the next step involves using graph paper to plot the maze interiors of the houses, each of which has about 10 rooms or scenes. A good scare is usually about the unknown for the visitor, but it's all about control for the park, explained Jim Timon, Universal Orlando's senior vice president for entertainment. Planners have to think about things like capacity and the flow of visitors, along with local safety ordinances.
In a way, haunted houses are more difficult to pull off than more elaborate theme park rides that involve cars on tracks. A vehicle allows Universal to control the experience -- riders face in one direction -- but haunted houses, where people are on foot, must scare in 360 degrees. To terrify an increasingly desensitized customer, Universal relies on lighting, fog machines, room temperature, water sprays, music cues, smells, video projection, wind and even fake snow. A recent addition to the fright toolbox has been actors flying with the help of wires.
Once the architecture of the rooms is planned, stories for each must be plotted. Universal keeps a type of research library stocked with pertinent books for inspiration (''A Pictorial History of the American Carnival,'' ''The Pop-Up Book of Phobias'') and urges its creative personnel to roam Florida in search of ideas. Old Spanish forts in the region helped inform the design for one of this year's houses.
By late January, Universal technicians are building 3-D computer models that allow Mr. Timon's team to take virtual tours through each maze. ''We're looking for ways to increase the startle,'' Mr. Timon said. ''Move a wall, change an angle.''
A crew of five artists and designers then compiles detailed design books for each house. These books, about 80 to 110 pages each, include colored sketches for set decorations and costumes that will be worn by actors hired to jump out of various nooks and crannies. Audio and lighting design takes up most of March and April, while construction starts in May and lasts through August, Mr. Timon said.
Universal hires the actors in July casting sessions. In total, the park hires about 1,000 temporary workers for Horror Nights, judging their abilities partly by orchestrating scream tests. ''You want to make sure they have the lungs to keep going all night,'' Mr. Aiello said.
Horror Nights, which Universal markets as ''not recommended'' for children under 13, started this year on Sept. 23. The park closes for each Horror Night at 5 p.m. and reopens as a haunted version at 6:30.
On a Thursday night this month, the scene before reopening was frantic, as dozens of actors arrived, changed into their costumes and stopped by one of 28 makeup stations to be painted with bullet holes, rotting flesh and blood. Appendages were arranged on tables. ''Kristen S. : Retrieve your prosthetic arm!'' a cranky-sounding prop manager yelled.
As guests flooded into the park, Mr. Aiello looked around with pride. Has Universal pulled it off for another year? ''I have personally seen people exit these houses on their hands and knees,'' he said.
A customer, Angela Gutierrez, offered more of a mixed critique. ''I was hanging onto my boyfriend for dear life,'' said Ms. Gutierrez, a 24-year-old restaurant worker, after emerging from a house called ''The In-Between,'' which uses 3-D effects.
But she was blase about the woman encased in a glass coffin with live rats. Her assessment: ''They did that last year too.''

HEADLINE: DuPont Earnings Continue to Surpass Analysts' Expectations

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The DuPont Company, the top United States chemical maker, reported third-quarter profit and sales on Tuesday that beat analyst estimates, and then it raised its full-year forecast. 
Net income for DuPont climbed 23 percent, to $452 million, or 48 cents a share, from $367 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier.
Profit excluding costs related to the acquisition of Danisco, a seed license payment, and tree damage caused by the Imprelis herbicide was 69 cents a share. That surpassed the 56-cent average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 32 percent, to $9.24 billion, beating the $8.88 billion average estimate.
Full-year earnings excluding some costs will be $3.97 to $4.05 a share, compared with a July prediction of $3.90 to $4.05, DuPont said.
DuPont has surpassed expectations in each of the 11 quarters that Ellen J. Kullman has been chief executive. Profit more than doubled in the performance-chemicals unit, the world's biggest maker of titanium dioxide, which is also known by its chemical formula TiO2. Prices for the white pigment used to add opacity to paints and plastic have climbed 38 percent in a year amid globally tight supplies, according to data from ICIS.
''TiO2 did really well,'' said Mark Gulley, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in New York. ''It exceeded my expectations.''
DuPont shares fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday, to $44.94. The company's stock has dropped 9.9 percent this year, giving the company a market capitalization of $41.9 billion.
Global economic growth will slow in the fourth quarter and customers will use up some of their inventories, DuPont said. DuPont raised third-quarter product prices an average of 15 percent, the biggest increase in at least a decade, the company reported. Sales volumes increased 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Sports Rally Around Green Projects

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
AMERICAN sports are often an exercise in excess: fans consume large quantities of beer and hot dogs, stadiums with giant scoreboards and retractable roofs are surrounded by parking lots filled with thousands of cars. In many ways, they represent the broadest cross-section of consumer culture and America's wasteful ways.
But the sports industry -- from teams to leagues to stadium and track operators -- is becoming more environmentally friendly. In just the last few years, several new arenas have been certified by the United States Green Building Council, and nearly a dozen other facilities have added solar panels. Teams like Seattle and St. Louis have ambitious energy-saving programs at their parks, and the United States Open tennis tournament composts a majority of its waste. Even Nascar, a sport built on gas-guzzling racecars, has introduced a program that includes the recycling of used tires, oily rags and more.
Like many businesses, team owners and event organizers realize that going green can save thousands and even millions of dollars a year, a priority in these recession-stretched times. But many of them are also generating new income from their cost-cutting measures by getting corporate partners, eager to align themselves with hometown teams going green, to sponsor projects like solar installations and recycling bins. 
In the process, teams and event organizers are learning that environmental efforts are winning fans not just in the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest, but in less obvious states.
''You would expect it out of a California team, but not an Arizona team,'' said Derrick Hall, the chief executive of the Arizona Diamondbacks, which has worked with Arizona Public Service, the local utility, to build a 17,000-square-foot solar canopy at Chase Field, the baseball team's stadium in Phoenix. ''It's important to a number of companies. They want to know what steps we are taking, and they like to be associated with us and an environmentally conscious team.''
Even though the team is not required to recycle, the Diamondbacks have added 150 new bins for plastic and aluminum bottles in Chase Field and compost all the food and paper waste, helping keep 95 tons of material out of the garbage dump in the first nine months of the year. In 2008, the team added flushless urinals and hand dryers in the bathrooms, and vendors at the stadium now wear shirts made from recycled plastic bottles. To trim its electricity bill, which is several million dollars a year, the team closes its retractable roof earlier in the day to avoid having to turn up the stadium's air-conditioners.
Like many teams, the Diamondbacks have received no public subsidies for their initiatives. Some measures, like distributing media guides on digital thumb drives, saved thousands of dollars in printing costs. Others, including asking employees to take public transit to work, were part of broader efforts to be greener organizations.
Either way, the initiatives were done voluntarily, not because of mandates from the commissioner's office. Major League Baseball and other leagues, though, have been sharing best practices among teams and collecting statistics on energy and water use and recycling rates to create benchmarks. The National Hockey League also helps teams send unused food at arenas to local soup kitchens, an effort that that provided 165,000 meals last season and kept 105 tons of food out of landfills. The league has also started buying credits that restore wetlands for every goal scored during the season.
Skeptics say these efforts are a bandage. Stadiums produce tons of waste and use large amounts of energy, teams crisscross the nation on chartered jets and millions of fans drive to games in millions of cars. League officials acknowledge this but say it is all the more reason to promote environmental initiatives.
''You can't duck it or deny it,'' said John McHale Jr., an executive vice president at M.L.B. ''But just because you can't do everything doesn't mean you can't do something.''
Environmental activists applaud this marriage of bottom-line vigilance and civic-mindedness, not just because huge amounts of energy, food and other products are consumed at sporting events, but because teams and athletes are so influential in their communities that fans and companies may be more inclined to follow their lead.
''When you get teams looking for efficiency, it gets noticed more than when environmental advocates do it,'' said Allen Hershkowitz, the director of the Sports Greening Initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which advises leagues and teams. ''People expect it from us, but when it's the Cardinals, it's the heartland. It's nonpolitical.''
The recent rush of projects was led off by the Boston Red Sox, which installed 28 solar panels on a roof above the first-base line in 2008. The project was modest: the panels replace about 37 percent of the natural gas needed to heat the water used at Fenway Park. Other teams took notice, though, because the Red Sox not only saved money, but relied on National Grid, the utility, for technical expertise and financing.
Suddenly, teams everywhere were unveiling green initiatives, or publicizing efforts that until then had been ad hoc and out of view. In 2008, at the depths of the financial crisis, Nascar appointed Michael Lynch as head of green innovation. In cooperation with racetrack operators and racing teams, he introduced a host of measures, including using hybrid vehicles as pace cars and the planting of 10 mature trees after every race. This year, Nascar switched to a 15 percent ethanol blend, which has attracted sponsors as well as critics who doubt its environmental benefits.
''It's like a small-sized Midwestern town that comes together 36 times a year,'' Mr. Lynch said of Nascar races. ''If you want to show that something works, plug it in here.''
Race teams and track owners looking to lower their costs took the cue. Last year, the Pocono Raceway installed 40,000 solar panels on 25 acres, enough to power the entire facility. Brandon Igdalsky, the racetrack's president, said the $15 million cost was paid without government subsidies. The track's annual energy bill has been cut by $500,000, so Mr. Igdalsky expects to recover the cost of the panels in eight to 10 years.
''We don't even get a bill anymore,'' he said.
Many projects, though, are far smaller and less visible. When the owners of the New Jersey Devils built the Prudential Center in Newark, they spent an extra $1.5 million on a state-of-the-art dehumidifying system that let them keep the air in the arena dry and cool enough to meet the N.H.L.'s strict guidelines for maintaining the ice.
The system automated a process that has long relied on guesswork. To keep the humidity at about 30 percent for hockey, arena operators consider the temperature and moisture outside, the number of fans expected to attend and what time the game begins. They also factor in whether a basketball court or other flooring must be removed.
Teams without dehumidifiers typically run their air-conditioners early in the day at high levels to bring the temperature in the arena down to the low 60s. This offsets the heat from fans and the lights. But by turning their air-conditioners on full blast, they raise their electricity costs, because the rate that utilities charge their big commercial customers is based on the period of highest demand.
At the Prudential Center, hundreds of sensors in and outside of the arena help the Devils adjust dehumidifiers all day, eliminating the need to turn the air-conditioners on all at once.
''That's where the energy savings come in,'' said Jim Cima, the senior vice president of arena operations. Buildings without dehumidifiers, he said, ''demand a lot of human judgment. They have to start their air-conditioners very early in the day and pray once the game starts that they are able to hold that temperature.''
The center's system, Mr. Cima said, had reduced energy use by 22 percent, which in turn had reduced the payback time for the equipment to less than five years. But retrofitting arenas with dehumidifiers has proven to be costly, even in cities where lawmakers and the home team support environmental initiatives, so teams are finding other ways to cut costs.
''The one caveat is it has to make money,'' said David Kells, the director of marketing at Bridgestone Arena, home of the Nashville Predators, which instead spent about $100,000 on fast-opening loading doors to cut the amount of cool air leaving the building.
The improvisation is a reminder that when it comes to green measures, one size does not fit all teams. And because sports are so widely watched, fans are likely to take note for some time to come.
''The challenges that the leagues and sports organizations face are not unique; they're the same ones that we face at home,'' said Martin Tull, the executive director of the Green Sports Alliance. ''It's easy to point the finger at the large aggregators of people. But the challenge is the use of resources in general.''

HEADLINE: Profit Beats Forecasts For U.P.S.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service reported a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as increased pricing, cost cutting and technology improvements helped compensate for flat domestic shipping volume. The company affirmed its outlook for record 2011 results. 
Its shares slid nearly 2 percent with the pace of consumer holiday demand still in question.
The company said third-quarter net income rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a share, compared with $991 million, or 99 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting $1.05 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue rose 18 percent, to $13.17 billion, matching analysts' forecasts.
The United States economy appears to have stabilized and is growing slowly after concern about a possible double-dip recession stifled consumer demand earlier this year, U.P.S. said.
''Their tone was clearly more positive than it was last quarter, but make no bones about it, there's still some uncertainty,'' said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond, Va.
The company is well positioned to handle a run-up in volume from customers with lean inventories ahead of the peak holiday season, analysts said.
The final two weeks before Christmas could have a meaningful effect on fourth-quarter results if consumer demand picks up and retailers low on inventory need fast shipment of goods, the company's chief executive, Scott Davis, told analysts on a conference call.
''Over the last month or so, we are starting to see, I could say, better economic numbers, so there is more optimism out there, and that could turn things around,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We are still expecting a slow-growth economy, but I don't think it is as negative as people were thinking two and three months ago.''
The company's shares fell 2 percent, to $69.35.
U.P.S. has forecast record earnings of $4.15 to $4.40 a share this year as it cut costs and raised shipping rates.
U.P.S. and FedEx are considered economic bellwethers because of the enormous volume of packages they handle. The value of packages handled by U.P.S.'s trucks and planes each year is equivalent to about 6 percent of United States gross domestic product and 2 percent of global G.D.P.
Domestic shipping volume averaged 12.74 million packages a day, little changed from 12.73 million a year ago.

HEADLINE: Report Lays Out State's Great Gains and Losses From Globalization

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
As international trade has accelerated in the last four decades, no state has lost more of its ability to make things or gained more through exporting ideas and professional services than New York has, according to a report to be released on Wednesday.
But the costs and benefits of globalization have spread unevenly across the state, with New York City and its suburbs reaping most of the rewards and some regions of the state failing to adapt to the onslaught of competition, according to the report, from the SUNY Levin Institute in Manhattan. Even within the city, though, most workers have fallen behind as the wages of low-skilled jobs have not kept pace with the cost of living. 
''Arguably, New York has benefited more and suffered more from globalization than any other state in the nation,'' Garrick Utley, the president of the institute and a former television journalist, said. ''New York is sort of a macro-microcosm of the nation, facing the challenges of the global economy.''
The state has lost more manufacturing jobs in the last 40 years than any other big state, including Michigan, though Michigan has suffered more since 2000, the report found. Within New York State, manufacturing has disappeared fastest in New York City, leaving few options for the rising tide of immigrants needing to support their families.
One effect on the relative affluence of residents of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx has been stark: the report says that the median income for individuals in each borough, as a percentage of the nation's median income, fell significantly from 1970 to 2008. In Queens, for example, the median personal income was 34 percent higher than the nation's in 1970, but by 2008, it was 94 percent of the national median.
The institute commissioned the report, ''New York in the World,'' from the Center for an Urban Future, a public policy organization focused on improving New York City. It was paid for with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Mr. Utley said.
Mr. Utley said he hoped the report would be used by policy makers in deciding what actions to take to help the state compete for jobs. He acknowledged, though, that there was no ''silver bullet'' or ''magic wand'' that would bring down the state's unemployment rate, 7.8 percent, anytime soon.
Jonathan Bowles, an author of the report, said that in interviews with dozens of business owners and executives, the most common concerns revolved around attracting and retaining talent and nurturing innovation. The report recommends that the state place greater emphasis on teaching science and math, and that it coordinate more partnerships between the state's universities and the private sector.
The report also emphasized that the state government should do more to encourage small and midsize businesses to export their products and services. It shows how many of the more successful big companies based in New York have increased their foreign sales. Just in the last decade, it says, Avon Products raised the share of its sales overseas to 80 percent, from 62 percent, and Liz Claiborne's nearly doubled, to 33 percent.
''A company doesn't have to be a global powerhouse to participate in the global economy,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''A lot of smaller firms are able to position themselves globally and go after global business. I'd love to see the governor really challenge more business to export. This is the Empire State, after all.''

HEADLINE: The Energy Picture, Redrawn

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
GOLDA MEIR, the former prime minister of Israel, used to tell a joke about how Moses must have made a wrong turn in the desert: ''He dragged us 40 years through the desert to bring us to the one place in the Middle East where there was no oil.' ''
As it turns out, Moses may have had it right all along. In the last couple of years, vast amounts of natural gas have been found deep under Israel's Mediterranean waters, and studies have begun to test the feasibility of extracting synthetic oil from a large kerogen-rich rock field southwest of Jerusalem.
Israel's swing of fate is just one of many big energy surprises developing as a new generation of unconventional fossil fuels take hold. From the high Arctic waters north of Norway to a shale field in Argentine Patagonia, from the oil sands of western Canada to deepwater oil prospects off the shores of Angola, giant new oil and gas fields are being mined, steamed and drilled with new technologies. Some of the reserves have been known to exist for decades but were inaccessible either economically or technologically. 
Put together, these fuels should bring hundreds of billions of barrels of recoverable reserves to market in coming decades and shift geopolitical and economic calculations around the world. The new drilling boom is expected to diversify global sources away from the Middle East, just as the growth in consumption of fuels shifts from the United States and Europe to China, India and the rest of the developing world.
''Use whatever hackneyed phrase you want, like tectonic shift or game-changer,'' said Edward L. Morse, global head of commodity research at Citigroup. ''These sources will dramatically change the energy supply outlook, and there is little debate about that.''
This striking shift in energy started in the 1990s with the first deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, but it has taken off in the last decade as a result of declining conventional fields, climbing energy prices and swift technological change.
The United States may now have the means to reduce its half century of dependence on the Middle East. China and India may have the means to fuel the development of their growing middle classes. Japan and much of Europe may have the chance to reduce dependence on nuclear power. And, at least theoretically, poor African countries might be able to lift themselves out of poverty.
For consumers around the world, the new fuels should moderate future price increases.
But giving new life to fossil fuels is a devil's bargain, probably making solutions to climate change, and the development of renewable energy, even more difficult. ''Not only are you extending the fossil fuels era,'' said Daniel Lashof, director of the climate program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, ''but you are moving into fossil fuels that are dirtier and release more carbon pollution in the process of extracting and using them.''
James Burkhard, a managing director of the energy consulting firm IHS Cera, said that competition between fossil fuels and renewable energy development was driven by the price of oil and gas as well as by government policy.
''The unconventional boom will guarantee that the competition is strong for years to come,'' Mr. Burkhard said. ''If oil costs $200 a barrel, that would provide more headroom for electric vehicles. But if oil is at $90, alternative, renewable energy will need to compete better on an economic basis.''
The Deepwater Reserves
The future is now when it comes to deepwater offshore drilling, which has already measurably increased oil and gas supplies around the world.
In 2000, fewer than 20 vessels in the world could drill deepwater wells. Now there are nearly 200, and more almost every month. Global deepwater oil production leapt to roughly seven million barrels a day in the last 11 years, up from 1.5 million barrels, and now provides about 8 percent of the world's oil supply. That production could double by 2020, according to experts.
Most of the drilling is in the Gulf of Mexico, off Brazil, Australia and India, and along the west coast of Africa. But only about 10 percent of the world's deepwater oil and gas fields have been extensively explored and drilled.
In recent years, advances in computer processing power have allowed geologists to make sense of seismic data 15,000 feet or more below the ocean floor. Three-dimensional imaging and seismic mapping are now possible even below thick layers of salt, which used to blur views of untapped reservoirs. Superstrong alloys allow drill bits to go into hot, high-pressure fields.
Even with the advances, risks remain, as the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster last year demonstrated. Regulations became somewhat tougher worldwide, yet they caused little more than a pause in drilling. Even in the United States, drilling was almost back to pre-Horizon levels a year after the accident.
Cuba is planning to start drilling exploratory wells offshore at the end of the year, and Mexico is slowly moving toward deepwater drilling to revive its flagging oil industry. Drilling has begun in the deep waters off Ghana, and experts say they believe fertile fields exist all the way down the west coast of Africa to Namibia. The potential for new wealth could give Africa a better chance for development, although the history of Nigerian oil development is a cautionary tale of corruption, environmental degradation and strife.
Geologists say they believe the fields of West Africa fit like jigsaw puzzle pieces with prospective fields in South America, because the two continents were connected hundreds of millions of years ago. Total and Royal Dutch Shell recently made a major discovery along the coast of French Guiana, and neighboring Suriname is likely to become an important producer, too. Some analysts say they think more offshore fields may be discovered along the Brazilian coast and south to Argentina.
The coasts of East Africa are rich in gas, and China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia and the Philippines also have significant deepwater potential. And India's deepwater prospects could provide much of its gas needs as its economy grows.
''We are just at the beginning of this story,'' said William Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president for strategic planning. ''It's only likely we will find more deepwater resources.''
Oil Sands
Oil sands have already transformed Canada into an energy superpower, and they have shifted American dependency from the nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to a friendlier and more stable source. Oil sands have been around for decades, but they were too expensive to produce at large scale. Then rising oil prices altered the economics in their favor -- attracting multibillion-dollar investments from international oil companies, including those in China.
Since 2000, production has expanded to more than 1.5 million barrels a day of synthetic oil from 600,000, making Canada's oil sands the most important source of oil imported to the United States. (Canada also exports considerable conventional oil to the United States.)
''It's one thing to find oil, and another thing to find oil in a very safe, secure place like Canada,'' said Mr. Colton of Exxon Mobil. ''From a U.S. energy security standpoint, it's a very attractive proposition to U.S. consumers that we have this friend next door who has all these oil resources.''
Canadian oil sands production is expected to increase by as much as 200,000 barrels a day every year for the next two decades. Current estimates of how much is there already top Iraq's total reserves, guaranteeing Canada's place as a premier oil producer for many decades. IHS Cera projects $100 billion in investments in the oil sands over the next decade.
The only thing holding back production of Canada's oil sands are environmental concerns. Much of the oil sands come from carving mining sites out of large sections of the boreal forest, an important depository for containing carbon and a breeding ground for many bird species. Refining of the oil sands, which requires the burning of natural gas, is more carbon-intensive than refining of most other crude oils, despite a 40 percent reduction since 1990 in carbon emissions for each barrel produced.
Technological improvements in recent years have streamlined the burdensome refining process for bitumen, the feedstock in synthetic oil production. Recovering reserves from deeper underground using steam injection, rather than mining, has reduced the footprint of operations and some environmental damage to the forests.
But opposition remains strong among American and Canadian environmentalists, who are fighting to stop pipelines to the United States and western Canadian ports. Without those pipelines, oil sands production capacity would most likely struggle to grow. That resistance has forced the oil companies to invest heavily in research to reduce the footprint of extraction and carbon emissions.
The Obama administration has been considering a proposed 1,711-mile, $7 billion pipeline to connect Canada's oil sands production to terminals in Oklahoma and refineries on the Gulf Coast. The State Department recently gave the project a passing grade in an environmental impact statement, increasing the likelihood of approval. With the pipeline, Canada would move an additional 700,000 barrels a day.
The synthetic fuels now go almost entirely to the American and Canadian markets, but China and other Asian countries are increasingly interested in the oil sands. Chinese companies have invested more than $15 billion in Canadian oil sands projects over the last two years, even though there is not yet a way to get the fuel to China.
The Canadian company Enbridge is proposing a pipeline from Alberta to Kitimat, British Columbia, near the coast, where tankers could load for trips to Asia. Sinopec of China is helping to finance the $5.5 billion project. The pipeline could be completed by 2017 but faces various regulatory hurdles and opposition from Native Canadian groups.
China wants to obtain 15 billion to 20 billion additional barrels of foreign oil reserves over the next few years, so it also has its eyes on an enormous heavy oil field in the Orinoco Belt, in the northeast part of Venezuela. Production started in recent years, and several projects that have been announced could produce up to two million barrels a day by 2020.
Shale
The biggest wild card for the future of oil and gas may be shale and other tight rocks. Finding and producing hydrocarbons from these rocks has taken off in the United States with such velocity that it has already significantly altered government and corporate energy expectations. At the beginning of the last decade, the United States was believed to be burning quickly through its gas resources, and a flurry of construction began to build liquefied natural gas import terminals.
But a surge in production in shale fields across Pennsylvania, Texas, Louisiana and several other states over the last five years has produced such a glut that the price of natural gas has plummeted, and energy companies are proposing to convert their empty import terminals into export facilities.
The new drilling was made possible by a mixture of new and old technologies. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking -- the shooting of water, sand and chemicals at high pressures to fracture hard rock -- has been done for decades. Now, combining that practice with horizontal drilling -- directionally guiding a drill bit through a shale reservoir, as opposed to conventional vertical drilling -- has taken advantage of fields that were practically useless in the past.
Shale gas production in the United States is more than five times as great now as in 2006, and the country surpassed Russia as the world's leading gas producer in 2009.
A variety of environmental groups oppose the surge, saying the chemicals in fracking fluids can pollute water supplies. Temporary or permanent fracking bans have been put in place in New York, New Jersey and Maryland. Other states are toughening drilling regulations, and the industry is responding with tighter wastewater management, while the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to complete a study on fracking next year. Nevertheless, gas shale drilling appears likely to continue at a fast pace in the most important gas-producing states.
The rest of the world is watching. Moratoriums have been put in place in parts of France, Germany, South Africa and the Canadian province of Quebec; Britain, Ukraine and other countries are moving cautiously forward. Still, the Energy Department projects that gas from shale could account for 14 percent of global supplies by 2030, with as many as 32 countries having production potential.
Poland is likely to be the next big shale player, with the government eager to lessen its gas dependence on Russia, which provides half of Poland's energy. Already more than eight million acres have been leased by Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and other large international companies. Drilling success in Poland could lead to more drilling in shale fields in Germany, Norway, Sweden, France and Ukraine.
Europe imports about 60 percent of its gas, roughly half of that from Russia. With many Europeans wanting to reduce their energy dependence on coal-fired generation and nuclear power, there should be a strong impetus to increase domestic production, at least in some countries.
China is also moving fast. With a goal of satisfying 10 percent of its gas demand from shale by 2020, it held its first shale gas auction in June. China has a big incentive to develop shale gas, because it is poised to become the world's largest importer of natural gas and it wants to reduce its dependence on coal to clean up the air of its cities.
In the last five years, as engineers advanced their techniques, shales have begun to produce oil as well. The Bakken field in North Dakota and Montana now produces 400,000 barrels a day, up from a trickle in 2007, and oil executives predict production could soar to a million barrels a day by 2015. The first well was drilled in the Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas three years ago; the field now produces more than 100,000 barrels a day, with 420,000 expected by 2015.
There are 20 other shale and similar tight rock fields across the United States that could make states like Ohio and Michigan major producers.
Exploration of such fields outside the United States and Canada is barely in its infancy, although there are major shale fields across Europe, China, Australia, Africa and South America. ''It could change production forecasts around the world,'' said Bobby Ryan, Chevron's vice president for global exploration. ''But we are still at the point of the spear. We have to shoot the seismic first to find out.''
Chinese, Norwegian and other foreign companies have already entered into joint ventures in shale oil and gas exploration in the United States to learn fracking techniques. China is moving fast to study its shales, although so far there seems to be more gas than oil. Argentina also looks promising for oil and gas, with American companies including Apache, Exxon Mobil and EOG Resources making large investments in shale in the Argentine province of Neuquen.
But there are constraints, including political opposition. Geological analysis of shales globally has barely started, and there are limits to the equipment and skilled manpower available for drilling. This has delayed fracturing jobs and raised costs in developed fields. Africa and the Middle East appear to have promising reserves, and Saudi Arabia has begun studying its shale fields, but the water requirements for fracking will be a high hurdle absent a technological breakthrough.
High Arctic
The last frontier, at least for the foreseeable future, is the high Arctic, most of which is still unexplored by oil companies. High winds, months of darkness and icebergs have long stymied dreams of finding vast quantities of oil and gas in the northern reaches of the globe.
A 2008 assessment by the United States Geological Survey estimated that a quarter of the world's remaining undiscovered conventional oil and gas is in the Arctic, more than 80 percent of it in forbidding offshore areas. Again the United States is the big potential winner, with an estimated one-third of the total undiscovered oil, according to the survey.
Large oil and gas discoveries began in Russia and Alaska in the 1960s, and more than 40 fields are now in production across Alaska, Russia, Norway and Canada. Shell has been trying for five years to drill in Alaska's Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and has invested about $4 billion on 10-year leases. But regulatory agencies or courts have delayed its efforts, because of concerns that Arctic waters are vital breeding grounds for many aquatic species that are endangered or at risk and that a well blowout could cause a huge leak that would be difficult or impossible to fix.
A paper released by the national commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon spill warned that a serious leak in the high Arctic would be extremely difficult to clean up. That is partly because skimmers can become clogged in ice and spilled oil is unlikely to degrade in frigid temperatures.
But in August, Shell received conditional approval from the Interior Department to begin drilling exploratory wells next summer. The company estimates that 25 billion barrels of oil are in the Alaskan Arctic, mostly in the Chukchi Sea.
''We're hopeful,'' said Pete Slaiby, Shell's vice president for Alaska, although the company still faces several regulatory hurdles and perhaps some legal ones, too. As for the rest of the Arctic, Mr. Slaiby acknowledged that drilling would require strong regulatory regimes and large companies with the experience and resources to drill in the most challenging environments.
''I'm confident, but it will require high bars, financial acumen and operational acumen,'' he said. ''You want companies that have financial resources and operational skills to develop the Arctic responsibly. It will be expensive.''
Other companies are moving forward in other Arctic countries.
Chevron is doing seismic work in Canada's Arctic waters. Cairn Energy, a British company, has drilled several exploratory wells off Greenland in recent months, so far with little success. Exxon Mobil and Rosneft, a company controlled by the Russian government, have agreed to invest $3.2 billion in exploration in the ice-clogged Kara Sea.
Statoil of Norway and ENI of Italy are furthest along in the far northern waters of Norway, which has the advantage of being ice-free because of warm Gulf Stream waters. Statoil already operates a gas field, called Snow White, 340 miles north of the Arctic Circle in the Barents Sea, and several companies are drilling oil wells in the sea now. The operations accelerated after the discovery of an estimated 250 million barrels of retrievable reserves of high-quality sweet crude oil in the Skrugard field in April, the seventh-largest oil or gas find in the world this year.
''This is the premier next frontier,'' said Tim Dodson, Statoil's executive vice president for exploration.
Power Balances
While many countries stand to benefit from the new energy resources, the United States may have the most to gain.
Before the 1960s, American companies dominated Persian Gulf and North Africa oil resources and made lasting alliances with autocratic governments. By the 1970s, as the United States' oil production peaked and OPEC and national oil companies took command of the world's oil, the United States had to accept almost hostage status. Now the tables are turning.
''There is the potential to really rebalance strategic power in the world,'' said David L. Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. ''If we are able to manage significant incremental supply from Canada, from onshore U.S., from Brazil and friendly countries in West Africa, then we can significantly ameliorate the risk of a supply disruption in the Middle East or from other countries that might use oil as a weapon.''
While more energy sources could be a stabilizing factor, competition over the new fields could produce tensions. Already, in the South China Sea, China has warned India's state oil company not to drill in waters it claims. Turkey recently warned Cyprus against drilling for natural gas without reaching an agreement with Turkish Cypriots over royalties. The political twists and turns are bound to be many. The devil's bargain looks like a necessity for the United States, China and many other countries, as the continued extraction and use of fossil fuels will come with some environmental degradation. According to the most recent estimates of the Energy Department, world energy demand is going to increase by 50 percent by 2035, largely because of increased consumption in China, India and the rest of the developing world.
Renewable energy will rise as a percentage of energy used, to 15 percent from 10 percent, but that will not provide for the growing demand.
''The fossil fuel age will be extended for decades,'' said Ivan Sandrea, president of the Energy Intelligence Group, a research publisher. ''Unconventional oil and gas are at the beginning of a technological cycle that can last 60 years. They are really in their infancy.''

HEADLINE: On the Front Lines of the Power Grid

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
QUICK! You are on duty in a secret control room in a nondescript, windowless building. The sign out front is so small that people driving by cannot read it, and it may give no clue what goes on inside, anyway. But your task is crucial: you are matching the ever-changing power needs of tens of millions of electricity customers with supply coming from hundreds of electricity generators, deciding which units will run and which ones will be idle, and making quick adjustments for the generators you can't schedule, like the wind machines and solar panels.
Hardly anybody will ever know you are here, unless you mess up.
All is going smoothly until you get a message from a neighboring electrical entity requesting emergency assistance. A quick glance at your computer screen tells you that you have sufficient spare capacity to help. 
Should you:
A. Call your contracts department and ask what price you will charge?
B. Go ahead and raise the generation in your area by the required amount?
C. Review the computer system used by all the generators to see what transmission is available?
D. Set up an emergency schedule with your neighbor?
If you answered D, and you also gave the correct answers to several much more complicated questions, you are on your way to a job in an increasingly tough and essential field: managing the North American power grid.
''The bar is being raised,'' said Lourdes Estrada-Salinero, the director of operations compliance and control at the California Independent System Operator, one of the more than 100 ''balancing authorities'' that are responsible for coordinating supply with demand in some portion of the North American grid. About 40 percent of all the energy used in the United States -- all the oil, gas and coal, uranium, wind and falling water -- is turned into electricity before it is consumed, and that fraction seems destined to rise, as more air-conditioners, electric cars and yet-to-be invented hand-held gizmos are added to customers' inventory. But the tolerance for failure is getting lower, and the power mix is getting more complicated. States, led by California, are demanding that an increasing fraction of the electricity come from sources that can turn themselves on or off with very little warning, as the weather changes and the wind and sunlight vary.
Utility companies used to hire and train their own people to operate their systems. As the grid became more interconnected, some utilities organized themselves into power pools, with one control room handling the supply for multiple utilities. The earliest was the entity now known as PJM, which used to stand for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland but now stretches into all or part of Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois and scattered parts of other states. New York had a power pool and so did the six New England states.
The job got exponentially more complicated when the federal government pressed the pools to convert into power markets, where the utilities would sell off their generating stations and third parties would be allowed to build generators. The hour-by-hour decisions about who would generate to serve what load were made mostly by an auction process and turned the pools into ''independent system operators.''
The human operator's job, though, was mostly still unregulated until August 2003, when a series of errors in a control room in Carmel, Ind., at the Midwest Independent System Operator, created the biggest blackout in history. (For future reference, when disabling vital computer systems to install upgrades, kindly do not neglect to warn the system operators and do not leave the systems shut off when you go to lunch.) The lights went out as far away as New York.
After that blackout, a utility that operates in the central United States hired Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor and ''human factors'' specialist at the University of Southern California, to review operations in some of its control centers. (Dr. Meshkati asked that the utility not be named because it did not make the report public.) The report stressed that operators needed ''total systems comprehension'' to understand what was happening on the grid. But sometimes the job is set up in a way that will overload the operator, he found. And the operations centers can have an ''unspoken 'macho' culture'' in which operators think that asking for help will jeopardize their job performance rating, he discovered.
To improve operations in the control centers and reduce the frequency of blackouts, Congress gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to enforce detailed new rules. But that government agency lacked the expertise to write them; for that, it turned to a voluntary organization, now called the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which it designated as a standards-setting and enforcement agency. It is still setting rules, almost a decade after the blackout, and it is requiring licenses for people who hold various jobs in the control centers.
Holding such a certification is a key part of the resume for a class of workers who are neither white-collar nor blue-collar. They might be called plastic collar, the people whose necks may or may not be girded in a necktie, but are sure to have a lanyard for an ID card that incorporates a computer chip that will get them into the windowless, label-less control rooms. They sit through an exam of approximately three hours, sometimes after sessions on online schools that have sprung up to help applicants cram. They end up with a certificate to frame on the wall.
There are about 6,000 such professionals, although some are management employees and do not work regular shifts. And some staff duplicate control rooms, located miles from the main control room, ready to take over if there is a fire or mechanical failure, or if the villains decipher the sign out front.
They get 200 hours of training every three years, and their continuing education resembles what the airlines give their pilots: extended sessions in full-scale simulators, with a computer playing the role of real hardware so the trainers can set up dire problems and see if the trainees can diagnose the situation and respond fast enough to prevent catastrophe.
The increased training did not come without difficulty. Daniel E. Frank, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in utility issues, said, ''It takes time to do it and nobody has a lot of time. The utility industry is no different from anybody else.''
''Any time you have to go in to training means somebody is away from the actual control room operations,'' he said. Some centers maintain six teams to keep operations going around the clock; at any given time, one team is in training. On the job, the operators typically work four 12-hour days a week, alternating between days and nights.
And they are paid well. With overtime, they commonly earn six-figure salaries, and they work in rural, low-cost areas.
Recruiting is a challenge, though. Grid entities look for candidates with some background in engineering, but they also need certain personality traits, like the ability to work collaboratively but not to debate endlessly. People with military backgrounds are favored, because they often have appropriate organizational and technical skills.
One aspect that makes the job complicated is that on the grid these days, there is a market not just for electricity, but also for ''ancillary services.'' These include the ability to ramp up and down quickly, which will be required as the wind and sun vary in intensity; the ability to add or subtract very large amounts of power in tiny fractions of a second, to keep the alternating current system working as closely as possible to 60 alternations per second; the ability to step in to control voltage; the ability to stand by for hours or days at a time, poised to start up if something goes wrong; and the ability, if everything goes wrong, to begin generating with no outside power to help.
Operations are also governed by rules about how much air pollution a generating station is allowed to emit; how much it is permitted to raise the temperature of the lake or river it uses for cooling water; and how much power must be generated within a geographic area, regardless of capacity elsewhere, to ensure reliability. Some of that is built into computer programming, and some of it is drilled into the operators' heads.
John T. McCain is a former captain in the Marines who recently completed his training at the California I.S.O. as a ''real-time scheduler,'' coordinating what generation will run from hour to hour. ''It reminds me of training that I've had in the military,'' he said. ''It's fast-paced, and there's a lot to learn.'' In some respects, it is more difficult than military training, he said.
His boss, Stephen Berberich, the president and chief executive of the I.S.O., said, ''It's an interesting mix between physics and policy and economics.''

HEADLINE: It's Still a Renter's Market, Office Landlords Learn

BYLINE: By TOM ACITELLI

 BODY:
Last February, Bloomberg L.P. signed a 400,000-square-foot lease at 120 Park Avenue. Wells Fargo had originally scouted the space, but Bloomberg offered a higher rent, making one of this year's biggest office deals. It was a sign, commercial real estate brokers said, that the Manhattan office market was tilting in landlords' favor again.
With tenants competing for space, it would not be too long before rents, tempered by the recession, would rise and incentives for tenants, a staple of the office market since the credit crisis of 2007, would recede significantly.
But that conventional wisdom has largely proved wrong. While Manhattan office rents have indeed risen since the recession and leasing activity has picked up, tenants can still command several months of free rent and allowances of many dollars a square foot in improvements to their space. 
That is because, given the economic uncertainty at home and abroad, brokers say more tenants are deciding to sit tight rather than expand or move their offices.
Where tenants might have gotten perhaps 10 to 12 months of free rent upfront in 2009, they are now getting six to eight, commercial brokers said. Where landlords might have put up $65 to $70 a square foot in allowances for tenants to improve their spaces, they are now offering $55 to $60.
''It started to look like the tables were going to turn,'' said Michael Cohen, the president for the tristate region for the real estate broker Colliers International and an owner of Class A and B office space in Manhattan. ''What actually happened was we hit this newfound financial crisis. Instead of the tables turning, they hovered.''
For much of the last decade, Manhattan office rents seemed to only ascend, reaching well over $100 a square foot in some trophy properties, like the Bank of America Tower at 1 Bryant Park and the Seagram Building at 375 Park Avenue. Hefty incentives were largely unheard-of, as companies buoyed by the growing economy were expanding their offices or upgrading, and willing to pay top dollar to do so.
The average net effective rent -- taking into consideration the tenant incentives that in varying degrees have long been part of the office market -- was $69.48 a square foot in the first few months of 2008, according to research from the brokerage firm Cushman & Wakefield. By the end of that year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it was $58.97. At the start of 2010, the net effective rent for Manhattan office space was $40.54, a drop of more than 42 percent from two years before. By the middle of 2011, it had edged up only about $7 a square foot.
And some tenants, suffering financially but still bound to a lease, put up space for sublease, further depressing rents. By early 2009, sublease space accounted for more than 27 percent of available office space in Manhattan.
''At the same time, we also had very large blocks of space, 100,000 square feet or greater,'' said Mitchell Konsker, a vice chairman of the broker Jones Lang LaSalle. ''Between both the softness in the sublease market during the recession and the large blocks of space, that put a lot of pressure on landlords to lower rents to be competitive.''
The economic tumult also meant more renewals and fewer new leases. Cushman & Wakefield's research shows that 8.6 million of the 34.9 million square feet leased in 2010 came from renewals, the highest amount since at least 2004 (in 2005, for instance, renewals accounted for barely three million square feet of office leases).
''In the depths of the recession, what most tenants did was hide,'' said Howard Fiddle, a vice chairman at CBRE Group Inc., ''and there were very few relocations because tenants didn't want to spend any capital at all and they didn't want to make any long-term commitments.''
When leasing activity did pick up this year, it smacked into a fresh crop of bad economic news, including financial services layoffs in Manhattan and the debt crisis in Europe, not to mention ongoing high-stakes budget talks in Washington.
Landlords, according to brokers, will have to keep offering incentives to skittish tenants, however incrementally less generous than before. (Several prominent Manhattan office landlords declined to comment for this article, though they did not dispute that they were offering incentives greater than those offered before the recession.)
Brokers said recent deals with substantial incentives included the following:
The Man Group, an investment management house, is taking a lease for 48,709 square feet for 10 years at 452 Fifth Avenue, set to close in the fourth quarter of 2011, at rents of $82 to $88 a square foot. But with at least 10 months of free rent and $75 a square foot for work on the space, the effective rent drops to $64.52.
The banking giant UBS Financial Services leased 44,612 square feet for 10 years and eight months in 200 Park Avenue, in a deal that will also close in the fourth quarter. The rents there ranged from $70 to $75 a square foot. UBS received nine months of free rent and $60 a square foot for work on the space, clipping its effective rent to $56.99.
The financial holding company Nomura Securities received $70 a square foot for work and 18 months' free rent for its 897,000-square-foot, 20-year lease at Worldwide Plaza at 825 Eighth Avenue. Nomura's rent effectively dropped to $38.42 to $42.69, from $46 to $63 a square foot.
Those incentives will continue, brokers said, until the Manhattan office vacancy rate reaches ''equilibrium''-- about 7 to 8 percent. Right now, the vacancy rate is around 9 percent, much higher than the 6 to 7 percent before the recession.
While New York's commercial real estate market in the past might have lagged the overall economy by months, brokers said, the market now tends to react much more immediately, slowing or growing in a globalized environment. A debt crisis in Greece or a political debate in Florida can rattle an already jittery set of landlords and tenants dealing in the nation's most expensive commercial real estate.
One potential stumbling block for New York is the possibility that financial services firms, now undergoing a rash of layoffs, will spill more sublease space onto the market. That could drive rents lower and incentives higher, as landlords of directly available space compete with the cheaper sublease space that is often already built out.
''I'm going to stick my neck out and say that I believe the current market conditions will persist for at least six months, and maybe as long as a year,'' Mr. Cohen of Colliers International said. ''But, as sure as the sun will rise, we will see tenant incentives return to shrinking -- as I would have thought they'd be doing already.''

HEADLINE: Future of Solar and Wind Power May Hinge on Federal Aid

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
IN recent years, wind and solar power have been among the fastest-growing sources of energy in the country.
But questions loom over their future: Will federal incentives that are important to their growth continue? And what happens if those incentives expire?
For wind power, the situation is especially precarious, energy specialists say. The federal production tax credit, which has provided incentives for wind farm operators to produce power since 1992, expires at the end of 2012. Congress has extended it in the past, most recently in 2009 as part of the federal stimulus package. But this time, some in the industry fear that the mood for limited government in Washington could imperil an extension. 
If Congress does not extend the credit, ''I believe 2013 would have minimal if not close to zero wind built in the United States,'' said Michael O'Sullivan, the senior vice president for development at NextEra Energy Resources, a huge clean energy developer in Juno Beach, Fla.
The solar business faces the expiration of an important grant program at the end of this year. The grants were created as part of the stimulus package, and the industry is lobbying for a one-year extension.
The expiration of the program would have a ''really significant compressing effect on the amount of renewable energy that gets financed,'' said Edward Fenster, the chief executive of SunRun, a San Francisco-based company that leases solar installations to homeowners. An extension would allow SunRun's business to grow 50 percent faster, though the company would grow even without it, he said.
Even if the grants expire, the solar industry can still use a 30 percent federal investment tax credit in place through 2016. Some other technologies, like fuel cells and small wind turbines, have access to similar tax credits through 2016.
The solar industry argues that the grant program is far more effective than the tax credit because it provides incentives for a broader range of private investors to help finance projects, as opposed to merely those with high tax obligations (the credit helps offset these).
The grant program also applies to wind power, though wind developers say the tax credit is more important for their industry.
Another major federal program, the provision of loan guarantees to aid large renewable energy projects, ended last month. That program became controversial after Solyndra, the first solar recipient, filed for bankruptcy, leaving taxpayers potentially liable for more than $500 million.
Rhone Resch, president and chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said that while the loan guarantee program helped finance emerging technologies that were ''higher-risk projects by definition,'' the grant program aided ''extremely low-risk projects where you're using off-the-shelf technology.''
In arguing for the continuation of federal incentives, advocates of renewable energy often point out that all forms of energy -- including fossil fuels -- rely on a complex web of state and federal credits and aid. Mr. Resch argues that more established technologies including oil and gas, coal and nuclear power are still taking advantage of incentives that were established in the 20th century.
''In the same way we've invested in oil and gas, it's time to invest in renewables,'' he said.
For younger technologies trying to establish themselves and reduce their costs, government incentives may be a make-or-break situation.
''Unlike oil and gas, where those companies could still make money doing their operating if they didn't have some of the credits they currently have, I'm not sure that would be true for the wind industry,'' said Amy Jaffe, director of the Energy Forum at Baker Institute at Rice University.
Solar and wind companies also argue that the perpetual threat that their incentives will expire makes long-term planning difficult.
''Our biggest issues is, we don't have certainty,'' said Danny Kennedy, founder of Sungevity, a residential solar installer in Oakland, Calif., who said he hoped that the federal grant program would be renewed but planned for its expiration. Fossil fuel companies, Mr. Kennedy said, ''assume tax credits and subsidies as permanent and given.''
One important federal incentive for oil and gas drilling, for example, has been in place since 1910s, though the Obama administration has proposed repealing it.
For renewable energy developers, the threatened expiration of incentives may have a few benefits. Mr. O'Sullivan, of NextEra Energy Resources, said that the wind deadline at the end of 2012 is ''causing customers to accelerate decisions, which is good.''
For that reason, many specialists expect 2012 to be a banner year for wind.
''At this point 2012 is poised to be one of the largest years, if not the largest year in the U.S. wind market, in terms of installation,'' said Alex Klein, research director for Renewable Power at IHS Energy Research, whose clients include renewable energy companies. ''But the downside is, there's a strong likelihood of a pretty dramatic fall-off in 2013.''
Greg Efthimiou, a spokesman for Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., said that although Duke built renewable energy projects to meet customer demands as opposed to the tax credit deadline explicitly, the federal incentives did help -- and Duke planned to build five large wind farms next year, including two in Texas and two in Kansas.
If Congress renews the production tax credit for four years, wind power will probably reach 4 to 5 percent of the country's electricity supply by 2016, Mr. O'Sullivan said, up from 3 percent year to date.
And if it does not? ''We call it the P.T.C. cliff,'' he said of the production tax credit. ''Everyone's making preparations,'' he said. The severe halt in 2013 would occur, he said, as companies waited to see if Congress would renew the credit even after it expired. If Congress did not, work may resume but would be significantly eroded, he said.
The costs of solar and wind have dropped substantially in recent years, although when, and if, the technologies will become competitive with fossil fuels without tax credits or grants is anyone's guess. (It bears noting that the technologies are cleaner than fossil fuels, and therefore create fewer pollution costs for society, many of which are not counted in the price of electricity.)
However, low natural gas prices have made it tough for wind to compete, especially if the production tax credit ends.
Meanwhile, uncertainty reigns.
''We're entering another boom-and-bust cycle for the wind industry that it hasn't had to face for several years,'' Mr. Klein said.

HEADLINE: Solar Power Industry Falls Short of Hopes in Job Creation

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
GOVERNMENT help for solar power was supposed to be a triple play: jobs at a time of dire short-term need; incubation of an American industry sure to be important on a global scale in the next few years; and a long-term reduction in climate-changing pollution.
But at the same time that the Obama administration was pushing loan guarantees out the door -- the one to Solyndra evidently too quickly -- SolarWorld, the largest producer of solar cells in the Americas, was proudly asserting to its investors that labor expenses were less than 10 percent of its costs.
Solyndra, which took $528 million in government loans before it declared bankruptcy, had a novel design, using cylinders instead of panels, and it was promising 1,000 or more jobs in the factory. But solar power, which makes extensive use of robots in fabricating the cells, and has no moving parts to service once it is up and running, may be an odd choice for job creation. 
''It's just not that labor-intensive,'' said Howard Axelrod, an engineer and economist. And as for the jobs it creates, there may be a price elsewhere, Dr. Axelrod said. He described the energy world as being like a child's squeeze toy: ''You squeeze it and the eyes pop out. If you push in one area, something else is going to happen.''
Another economist, Seth Blumsack, an assistant professor of economics and energy at Pennsylvania State University, asked about making jobs, creating an industry and cleaning the environment simultaneously, replied, ''It's probably difficult to argue we are doing all three of those things successfully right now.''
That is not to say that the energy business does not produce jobs in his state. He said that ''in the areas with the highest levels of natural gas drilling, the unemployment rate is basically about as close to zero as it could get.''
But the energy industries eat one another's lunch. Jay Apt, executive director of the Energy Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said it was possible to calculate the amount of electricity produced at a coal plant per person who works there. The number he cited per worker was about the same as would be produced over the course of a year by 20 megawatts of solar panels. Build enough solar plants and some coal plants will shut down; that would amount to firing Peter to hire Paul.
But despite all the emphasis on jobs, this relationship is largely unexamined. John Felmy, the chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute, pointed out that there were lots of good-paying jobs in the natural gas fracturing, or fracking, boom, but that implied fewer jobs in the coal sector, as natural gas displaced coal for electricity production.
But the analyses ''tend to look at the individual industries,'' he said, and do not go to the next step: ''You've got these gas jobs so you don't have these coal jobs.''
His group, a petroleum industry trade association, makes a different point, that drilling in the United States means jobs here instead of jobs elsewhere -- in Canada, if the drilling is for natural gas, and all over the world if the drilling is for oil. But petroleum jobs are not politically favored.
Something else not favored, at least not by American policy makers, is jobs in China. But Chinese solar panels are flooding the American market, so much so that SolarWorld (which is a German company) filed a dumping case against China with the American authorities on Oct. 19.
Nailing solar panels to a roof cannot be outsourced, but to some extent their manufacture already has been. According to a recent report by the Solar Foundation, an advocacy group, only about 24,000 people work in solar manufacturing in this country, compared with 52,500 in installation, out of a total of about 100,000. That is a hefty number, and up 6.8 percent in the last year. But the definition is a bit slippery. It applies to workers who spend at least half their time on solar work.
Outsourcing to China is one end of the spectrum; there is a flip side. Some coal jobs exist here because coal is exported. The nuclear industry employs thousands of workers who provide components and services for reactors abroad. Solar panel fabrication was intended as an export industry, but whether the country will continue as a net exporter is not certain.
And if the electricity from the solar installation is more expensive than the energy it replaced, then everybody who uses electricity will spend a little more for it, and everybody who pays taxes will contribute to the government subsidies for solar. Thus there will be a little less money to spend on other activities that could also generate employment.
But this, too, is little examined. The Energy Department said it did not have any studies on that. Damien LaVera, a spokesman, said that even if the manufacture of solar cells were not labor-intensive, construction of the Solyndra factory provided jobs. ''Hiring a thousand construction workers for a year or two years is short-term stimulus,'' he said. ''They created 3,000 construction jobs in the worst construction downturn in the State of California's recent history.''
Solyndra shut down operations at the end of August.
At a recent hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose Republican majority has latched on to Solyndra with a vengeance, Scott DesJarlais, Republican of Tennessee, compared the benefits of solar power to the Tennessee farmer who drives into Alabama to buy watermelons for a dollar each and resells them at home for 75 cents.
''He does this a few times, and clearly he isn't making a profit,'' Mr. DesJarlais said. ''And he comes to the conclusion that he needs a bigger truck.''
This may prove unfair in the long run. If fossil fuel prices rise high enough or governments begin to collect big charges for carbon dioxide releases, solar power could turn into an unsubsidized success. Renewable energy is recognized as representing a hedge against future shifts in the prices of fuels and the strictness of pollution regulations.
But the effect on jobs is murkier. ''Net jobs'' is seldom mentioned. The object now is to put more man-hours into each megawatt-hour, after years of trying to slim down the system and minimize labor input.
And, economists point out, some of the work that renewable energy creates goes to people who already have jobs -- roofers who install the panels or truck drivers who move them around, or steel workers who make towers for new wind machines.
Some of the jobs could eventually go elsewhere. Two years ago, Evergreen Solar, which got $58 million in aid from Massachusetts for a factory in Devens, said it would shift production to China instead. Such a move would offer only a small advantage in labor costs -- because those are small to begin with -- but American experts say the Chinese offer more lavish subsidies.
The debate is part of a larger discussion of what constitutes a ''green'' job. In October 2009, Congress gave the Bureau of Labor Statistics a special appropriation to count them.
The first problem was to define the term. The bureau, an independent statistical agency within the Labor Department, established two definitions: jobs in business that ''produce goods or provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources,'' and ''jobs in which the work performed makes the production processes of business establishments more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources.''
The bureau's first report is due early next year. The problem is that lots of jobs are partly green and partly not. At a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Sept. 22, members got into an extended argument with an Obama administration witness about whether the driver of a hybrid bus, with its lower pollution and lower fuel consumption, had a green job.
''Driving a bus is driving a bus, right?'' said Connie Mack, Republican of Florida. Hilda Solis, the secretary of labor, said they were ''green buses.'' But aides later clarified that the bureau counted any bus driving job as green because it preserved natural resources.
None of this suggests that green is bad, just that it is not particularly job-heavy. In December 2010, Susan Combs, the comptroller of Texas, reported that school districts in her state were giving tax abatements to lure new jobs, but had to give $1.6 million for every wind energy job. Manufacturing jobs could be created for $166,000 each.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about jobs in the solar power industry misidentified the source of some employment statistics. The figures of 24,000 people working in solar manufacturing and 52,500 working in solar installation came from a report by the Solar Foundation, not from Environment America. (A news release by Environment America provided a Web link to the Solar Foundation report.)

PERSON: John McCarthy 

HEADLINE: John McCarthy, 84, Dies; Computer Design Pioneer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
John McCarthy, a computer scientist who helped design the foundation of today's Internet-based computing and who is widely credited with coining the term for a frontier of research he helped pioneer, Artificial Intelligence, or A.I., died on Monday at his home in Stanford, Calif. He was 84.
The cause was complications of heart disease, his daughter Sarah McCarthy said.
Dr. McCarthy's career followed the arc of modern computing. Trained as a mathematician, he was responsible for seminal advances in the field and was often called the father of computer time-sharing, a major development of the 1960s that enabled many people and organizations to draw simultaneously from a single computer source, like a mainframe, without having to own one. 
By lowering costs, it allowed more people to use computers and laid the groundwork for the interactive computing of today.
Though he did not foresee the rise of the personal computer, Dr. McCarthy was prophetic in describing the implications of other technological advances decades before they gained currency.
''In the early 1970s, he presented a paper in France on buying and selling by computer, what is now called electronic commerce,'' said Whitfield Diffie, an Internet security expert who worked as a researcher for Dr. McCarthy at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
And in the study of artificial intelligence, ''no one is more influential than John,'' Mr. Diffie said.
While teaching mathematics at Dartmouth in 1956, Dr. McCarthy was the principal organizer of the first Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
The idea of simulating human intelligence had been discussed for decades, but the term ''artificial intelligence'' -- originally used to help raise funds to support the conference -- stuck.
In 1958, Dr. McCarthy moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where, with Marvin Minsky, he founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was at M.I.T. that he began working on what he called List Processing Language, or Lisp, a computer language that became the standard tool for artificial intelligence research and design.
Around the same time he came up with a technique called garbage collection, in which pieces of computer code that are not needed by a running computation are automatically removed from the computer's random access memory.
He developed the technique in 1959 and added it to Lisp. That technique is now routinely used in Java and other programming languages.
His M.I.T. work also led to fundamental advances in software and operating systems. In one, he was instrumental in developing the first time-sharing system for mainframe computers.
The power of that invention would come to shape Dr. McCarthy's worldview to such an extent that when the first personal computers emerged with local computing and storage in the 1970s, he belittled them as toys.
Rather, he predicted, wrongly, that in the future everyone would have a relatively simple and inexpensive computer terminal in the home linked to a shared, centralized mainframe and use it as an electronic portal to the worlds of commerce and news and entertainment media.
Dr. McCarthy, who taught briefly at Stanford in the early 1950s, returned there in 1962 and in 1964 became the founding directorof the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, or SAIL. Its optimistic, space-age goal, with financial backing from the Pentagon, was to create a working artificial intelligence system within a decade.
Years later he developed a healthy respect for the challenge, saying that creating a ''thinking machine'' would require ''1.8 Einsteins and one-tenth the resources of the Manhattan Project.''
Artificial intelligence is still thought to be far in the future, though tremendous progress has been made in systems that mimic many human skills, including vision, listening, reasoning and, in robotics, the movements of limbs. From the mid-'60s to the mid-'70s, the Stanford lab played a vital role in creating some of these technologies, including robotics and machine-vision natural language.
In 1972, the laboratory drew national attention when Stewart Brand, the founder of The Whole Earth Catalog, wrote about it in Rolling Stone magazine under the headline ''SPACEWAR: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums.'' The article evoked the esprit de corps of a group of researchers who had been freed to create their own virtual worlds, foreshadowing the emergence of cyberspace. ''Ready or not, computers are coming to the people,'' Mr. Brand wrote.
Dr. McCarthy had begun inviting the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley hobbyist group,to meet at the Stanford lab. Among its growing membership were Steven P. Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, who would go on to found Apple. Mr. Wozniak designed his first personal computer prototype, the Apple 1, to share with his Homebrew friends.
But Dr. McCarthy still cast a jaundiced eye on personal computing. In the second Homebrew newsletter, he suggested the formation of a ''Bay Area Home Terminal Club,'' to provide computer access on a shared Digital Equipment computer. He thought a user fee of $75 a month would be reasonable.
Though Dr. McCarthy would initially miss the significance of the PC, his early thinking on electronic commerce would influence Mr. Diffie at the Stanford lab. Drawing on those ideas, Mr. Diffie began thinking about what would replace the paper personal check in an all-electronic world.
He and two other researchers went on to develop the basic idea of public key cryptography, which is now the basis of all modern electronic banking and commerce, providing secure interaction between a consumer and a business.
A chess enthusiast, Dr. McCarthy had begun working on chess-playing computer programs in the 1950s at Dartmouth. Shortly after joining the Stanford lab, he engaged a group of Soviet computer scientists in an intercontinental chess match after he discovered they had a chess-playing computer. Played by telegraph, the match consisted of four games and lasted almost a year. The Soviet scientists won.
John McCarthy was born on Sept. 4, 1927, into a politically engaged family in Boston. His father, John Patrick McCarthy, was an Irish immigrant and a labor organizer.
His mother, the former Ida Glatt, a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant, was active in the suffrage movement. Both parents were members of the Communist Party. The family later moved to Los Angeles in part because of John's respiratory problems.
He entered the California Institute of Technology in 1944 and went on to graduate studies at Princeton, where he was a colleague of John Forbes Nash Jr., the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and subject of Sylvia Nasar's book ''A Beautiful Mind,'' which was adapted into a movie.
At Princeton, in 1949, he briefly joined the local Communist Party cell, which had two other members: a cleaning woman and a gardener, he told an interviewer. But he quit the party shortly afterward.
In the '60s, as the Vietnam War escalated, his politics took a conservative turn as he grew disenchanted with leftist politics.
In 1971 Dr. McCarthy received the Turing Award, the most prestigious given by the Association of Computing Machinery, for his work in artificial intelligence. He was awarded the Kyoto Prize in 1988, the National Medal of Science in 1991 and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 2003.
Dr. McCarthy was married three times. His second wife, Vera Watson, a member of the American Women's Himalayan Expedition, died in a climbing accident on Annapurna in 1978.
Besides his daughter Sarah, of Nevada City, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Carolyn Talcott, of Stanford; another daughter, Susan McCarthy, of San Francisco; and a son, Timothy, of Stanford.
He remained an independent thinker throughout his life. Some years ago, one of his daughters presented him with a license plate bearing one of his favorite aphorisms: ''Do the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: It also misspelled the given name of one founder of Apple, who had been a member of the Homebrew Computer Club, a hobbyist group that Dr. McCarthy invited to meet at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is Stephen Wozniak, not Steven.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Wednesday about the computer scientist John McCarthy referred imprecisely to John Forbes Nash Jr., who was a colleague of his at Princeton. While Mr. Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1994, he is a mathematician, not an economist. (The imprecise reference also appeared in articles in 2009 and 2008, as well as in several other articles dating to 2000.)

HEADLINE: As the Data Show, There's a Reason the Protesters Chose New York

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
When the federal income tax was first imposed in 1913, the richest 0.1 percent of households reaped 8.6 percent of the nation's income. In 2007, as the recession began, the share going to that sliver of megarich Americans was 12.3 percent.
And an even more exclusive club -- the top 0.01 percent of households -- is collecting a greater share of total income than ever before recorded. 
Those numbers suggest that the Occupy Wall Street protesters can make a compelling case when they complain that the economic scales are unfairly tilted toward the wealthy. The megarich hold more of the nation's wealth and collect more of the overall income today than at any time since right before the Great Depression.
Certainly, the protesters picked the right city in which to start their campaign. Among the 1 percent of American households with the highest income, a significant portion, 13 percent, live in the New York metropolitan area, with 4.4 percent living in Manhattan, according to an analysis by Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College. In three Manhattan neighborhoods, the Upper East and Upper West Sides and Greenwich Village, more than 11 percent of the households make enough to qualify for the top 1 percent.
Making precise comparisons to earlier periods can be difficult: Some income and wealth numbers are estimates, and income is only one way of measuring wealth. Still, there are some notable ways to measure gilded ages.
In the late 1890s, when the average American worker's weekly wage was less than $10, John D. Rockefeller was earning about $192,000 a week. When he died in 1937, the estimated annual investment return on his $1.4 billion wealth produced an income equal to that of about 116,000 American workers, according to Branko Milanovic, lead economist for the World Bank research group and the author of ''The Haves and the Have-Nots.'' Today, Bill Gates's annual income equals that of about 75,000 workers.
''If you compare Rockefeller's income and the average income in the United States, then the gap was even greater in those days,'' Dr. Milanovic said. ''In the 1920s, though, the overall distribution of income is about the same as now in terms of inequality -- very high.''
J. Bradford DeLong, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, largely agreed. ''Because the economy was smaller back then, fewer people -- John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan -- were more powerful in the country,'' he said.
But comparisons of disparity are not just about income or even only about money.
''Right-wingers will say that even though the relative income and wealth gaps are about the same, that the lifestyle gap between rich and poor is much less than it was back then,'' Professor DeLong said. ''Nearly everybody today can afford to overeat to their heart's content and watch 'Hamlet' when they choose, while a century ago only the rich could afford to overeat or watch 'Hamlet.' ''
Another economist, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said that income inequality may have risen during the recession, but that generally, when dual-earner couples and government benefits and taxes were figured in, the overall increase in disparity was obscured.
Jacob S. Hacker, a political science professor at Yale and co-author of ''Winner-Take-All Politics,'' said measuring wealth gaps missed changes in sources of income over time. ''The super-rich today are not rentiers living off their accumulated wealth, as was frequently true in early part of the last century,'' he said. ''The majority are financial and corporate executives.''
The wealthiest of the wealthy control more of the country's treasure than at any other time for which data are available. In 1913, the share of national income going to the top 0.01 percent of households was 2.8 percent, Professor Hacker said. In 2007, that same percentage of households earned 6 percent of national income.
''In 1917, average income -- including capital gains -- among the top 0.1 percent was 127 times the average income of the bottom 90 percent,'' Professor Hacker said. ''Average income among the top 0.01 percent was 509 times as great. In 2007, average income among the top 0.1 percent was 220 times average income among the bottom 90 percent. Average income among the top 0.01 percent was 1,080 times as great.''
Over the past century, according to a study by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at Berkeley, the share of income collected by the top 1 percent of Americans peaked at 24 percent in 1928 -- a high that was not matched until 2007.
While there are more very rich Americans today, the richest are very different from their predecessors. For starters, by most measures they are not as rich. By some counts, John D. Rockefeller was worth more than Bill Gates or Michael R. Bloomberg.
When Rockefeller died in 1937, his $1.4 billion fortune constituted one sixty-fifth of the gross national product, according to an analysis in 1996 by Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther in their book ''The Wealthy 100.'' That placed Rockefeller first in their compilation. Bill Gates ranked 31st, with his $15 billion net worth at the time then comprising one four hundred twenty-fifth of G.N.P.
Now, Mr. Gates's net worth of $59 billion, according to the latest Forbes magazine ranking, is about one two hundred thirty-seventh of G.N.P., and would place him 12th on the 1996 list, after Henry Ford. Mr. Bloomberg, with about $19 billion, would be 58th, behind Julius Rosenwald, the early-20th-century president of Sears, Roebuck.
Mr. Gates, like Ford, Rosenwald and Mr. Bloomberg, also gives a lot of his money away (last year, he and Mr. Bloomberg were among 40 of the wealthiest Americans who pledged to give away at least half of their fortunes). Ron Chernow's biography of Rockefeller recalls that his philanthropy was inspired, in part, by Andrew Carnegie, who wrote in 1889 that the gulf between rich and poor threatened the very survival of capitalism.
''The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced,'' Carnegie said, which is another version of Mr. Bloomberg's vow to bounce his check to the undertaker.

HEADLINE: Steel Makers Expect Losses On Earnings

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Two major steel makers issued gloomy forecasts for the rest of the year on Tuesday, citing weak economies in Europe and North America, depressed steel prices and higher raw materials. 
John P. Surma, the chief of United States Steel, predicted lower fourth-quarter results, saying that demand for steel was ''just O.K.'' with some strength in the auto industry.
AK Steel, whose third-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates, declined to provide a fourth-quarter forecast. However, James L. Wainscott, the chairman and chief, later told analysts the company expected an operating loss in the quarter.
AK Steel shares dropped 13.6 percent, to $7.47, and United States Steel shares fell 9.6 percent at $22.40.
United States Steel reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit Tuesday, but warned that fourth-quarter profit would weaken because of the soft economies in Europe and North America.
Last week, the Nucor Corporation, the largest steel maker in the United States, forecast market deterioration for the rest of this year as demand was weak in some sectors and imports were driving down steel prices.
Although United States Steel turned a profit after a net loss in the year-ago quarter, overall results were down sharply from the second quarter of this year, with steel prices decreasing. Net income in the third quarter was $22 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $51 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 72 cents a share. Sales rose 13 percent, to $5.08 billion.
AK Steel posted a third-quarter net loss of $3.5 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a loss of $59.2 million or 54 cents a share, for the 2010 quarter. But excluding expenses of about $6.2 million, or 5 cents a share, for repairs to an electric steel-making furnace at its Butler Works, AK Steel reported an adjusted profit of 2 cents a share.
Third-quarter sales were $1.585 billion, compared with $1.575 billion for the year-ago quarter.

HEADLINE: President to Ease Student Loan Burden for Low-Income Graduates

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
President Obama will announce new programs Wednesday to lower monthly loan payments for some students graduating next year and thereafter and to let borrowers who have a mix of direct federal loans and loans under the old Federal Family Education Loan Program consolidate them at a slightly lower interest rate.
At a press briefing Tuesday afternoon, Melody Barnes, director of the Domestic Policy Council, said the president would use his executive authority to expand the existing income-based repayment program with a ''Pay as You Earn'' option that would allow graduates to pay 10 percent of their discretionary income for 20 years and have the rest of their federal student loan debt forgiven. That plan would start next year. 
Most of the 450,000 low-income student-loan borrowers currently enrolled in income-based payment must pay 15 percent of their discretionary income for 25 years before having their debt forgiven, although terms are easier for those in public service.
The lower caps of the new program were scheduled to go into effect for new borrowers in 2014, but, Ms. Barnes said, ''because we know the frustration of crushing loan burdens, we have to act now.''
Ms. Barnes noted that over the last month, more than 30,000 people had signed a petition on the We the People platform at whitehouse.gov, asking for relief on student debt.
''It's a message heard loud and clear,'' she said.
The high cost of college and the growing debt burden of student loans have become increasingly potent political issues in recent years, high on the agenda of Occupy Wall Street and related protests across the country.
And the annual College Board reports on college prices and student aid, to be released Wednesday, make it clear that with the weak economy, the college affordability problem is getting worse.
At public universities and community colleges, costs for the current academic year increased more than 8 percent, lifted in part by steep tuition increases in California, according to the ''Trends in College Pricing 2011'' report.
While California's whopping increases -- 21 percent at the four-year universities and 37 percent at the community colleges -- were extreme, declining state support for higher education has brought hefty tuition increases at many public universities nationwide. Arizona and Washington, for example, increased their in-state tuition and fees by 17 percent and 16 percent.
This is the fifth consecutive year in which the public universities that serve most students raised their tuition at a faster rate than the far more expensive private universities. And over the last three decades, the report found, the average tuition at four-year state universities almost quadrupled.
''It is not surprising, but we do have issues we have to face,'' said Sandy Baum, the economist who is co-author of the report. ''Families are struggling because their incomes are not increasing, but states are struggling too.''
Adjusted for inflation, state appropriations per full-time student are about 23 percent lower than they were a decade ago.
''Families and students are paying more but they're getting less,'' said Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Cost Project, ''because what we're willing to invest in this generation is less than what we were willing to invest in my generation.''
At Tuesday's press briefing, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan estimated that the debt-consolidation program could help 6 million borrowers who carry both direct federal loans and loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan program, which ended last year. Under that program, private lenders received federal subsidies to make federally guaranteed loans to students; despite lobbying by the banking industry, the Obama Administration killed the program, redirecting billions of dollars of subsidies into expanded Pell grants for low-income students.
Between January and June, Mr. Duncan said, borrowers making payments on both kinds of loans can consolidate them and get a half-percent interest-rate cut. The savings to pay for the lower loan rate, he said, would come from the lower cost of administering the combined loan.
Further information on the new programs will be available at 1-800-4fedaid (1-800-433-3243) or studentaid.ed.gov.
The Obama administration has taken other steps toward college affordability. The American Opportunity Tax Credit, introduced in 2009, expanded the tax benefits for college costs. According to the College Board's new ''Trends in Student Aid 2011,'' report, higher education tax credits and deductions grew to $14.7 billion in 2009, from $6.6 billion in 2008. People with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 to $180,000 got 26 percent of those tax savings, compared with 18 percent a year earlier. At the other end of the spectrum, the credits are available even to those who owe no taxes.
According to the College Board, average in-state tuition at public universities this year is $8,244, up from $7,613 last year; with room and board, the average total charge is $17,131, up from $16,162 last year. But the averages mask enormous variation from state to state: the University of New Hampshire's tuition is more than $13,500, compared with $2,600 in Puerto Rico and $4,100 in Wyoming.
At private nonprofit four-year colleges, the average tuition is $28,500 this year, a 4.5 percent increase on last year's $27,265. With room and board, the average total charges are $38,589, up from $36,971 last year. And at community colleges, the average tuition and fees are $2,963, up 8.7 percent from last year's $2,727.
Only about a third of full-time students pay for college without some grant aid, whether in the form of a federal Pell grant, a state scholarship or aid from the college itself.
Net tuition --the amount a student actually pays, after grants and tax savings-- is often sharply lower than the published price. In fact, the College Board report said, net tuition at community colleges was low enough that, when grants and tax savings are taken into account, the average student can pay nothing out of pocket and have $810 left over for books and living expenses.
This year, the report said, full-time students at state universities receive an average of about $5,750 in grants and tax benefits, while students at private nonprofit colleges get about $15,530 and those at community colleges about $3,770.
