HEADLINE: Justices Face Issue of How to Resolve Juror Bias Claims in the Internet Age

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Enron collapsed in 2001, thousands of employees at its Houston headquarters lost their jobs and savings, and the city's economy reeled. Much of the public's anger was directed at Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's former chief executive.
 A Houston Chronicle column about his trial on fraud charges was headlined ''Your Tar and Feathers Ready? Mine Are.'' A rap song appeared called ''Drop the S Off Skilling.'' And potential jurors in Mr. Skilling's trial told the court that he was ''a high-class crook'' who ''should be reduced to having to beg on the corner and live under a bridge.''
 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday on whether Mr. Skilling's conviction should be overturned because the prejudice against him in Houston was so strong and pervasive that he could not receive a fair trial.
 It has been two decades since the Supreme Court has considered a major change of venue case, and its jurisprudence is still rooted in decisions based on small communities dominated by a single local newspaper and perhaps a few local television news outlets. The law has been slow to adapt to a more general, more intense and yet more atomized media environment. 
 How potential jurors become informed in the Internet era, experts in jury behavior said, cuts in two directions. It may now be harder than ever for defendants to find wholly untainted jurors in their own communities. At the same time, a change of venue in a truly high-profile case is less likely than ever to solve the problem.
 In a brief to the Supreme Court in the Skilling case, the federal government urged the court not to adopt an approach prompted by the proliferation of new media that would mean ''no trial will be possible in the most nationally significant cases.''
 To a far greater extent than in recent history, Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the court, ''publicity of noteworthy events and prosecutions is nationwide in scope.''
 ''By its nature,'' Ms. Kagan continued, ''media coverage carried on national networks, cable stations and the Internet is not confined to the venue in which the crime is committed.''
 Some legal experts said that little could be done to control the intensity of news coverage in highly publicized cases. ''In national cases, pretrial publicity effects may not be remedied in any imaginable way,'' said Steven D. Penrod, a professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, ''because there are not venues in which there is no prejudice.''
 The court's decision about how trial courts should respond to claims of prejudicial pretrial publicity may have a lasting and widespread impact.
 ''They don't address this a lot,'' Laurie L. Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said of the justices. ''What does change of venue mean in the age of the Internet?'' 
 The proposed trial of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in Manhattan presented perhaps the most extreme example of this conundrum. Had the trial proceeded there, a change of venue motion based on local news coverage and community outrage was almost inevitable, given Mr. Mohammed's confession to planning the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But would that intensity of feeling be any less anywhere else in the United States? 
 The trial of Timothy J. McVeigh for his role in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, was moved from Oklahoma City to Denver. (Mr. McVeigh was convicted and later executed.) 
 The judge in the case, Richard P. Matsch, explained why he had granted a change of venue motion: ''The entire state had become a unified community, sharing the emotional trauma of those who had been directly victimized.''
 Shari Seidman Diamond of Northwestern University, an authority on jury behavior, saw a parallel to Enron's collapse.
 ''Houston was really hurt,'' she said. ''It was an assault on the community. The Enron-Houston link was palpably present in the same way that there was an intensity of feeling in Oklahoma City in the McVeigh case.''
 Mr. Skilling's Supreme Court case has received more attention for a second issue it presents, that of whether the law under which he was convicted is unconstitutionally vague. His is the third Supreme Court case this term considering the law, which makes it a crime to deprive another person of honest services.
 The touchstone case on the change of venue issue is a decision from almost 50 years ago in which the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of Wilbert Rideau for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in Lake Charles, La. The local television station broadcast Mr. Rideau's 20-minute filmed interrogation three times over two days, reaching an estimated 20,000 to 53,000 people each time. Lake Charles's population was about 150,000.
 ''Any subsequent court proceedings in a community so pervasively exposed to such a spectacle could be but a hollow formality,'' Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority in the 7-to-2 decision.
 Mr. Rideau, who went on to be an acclaimed prison journalist, was released after a fourth trial in 2005.
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, was equivocal last year in affirming the trial judge's decision to keep the Skilling trial in Houston.
 There was, a three-judge panel of the court said, a ''pervasive community bias against those who oversaw Enron's collapse.'' There was also, the panel said, ''an extreme situation of inflammatory pretrial prejudice that literally saturated the community.'' But it found that the prejudice had been overcome through a careful selection of jurors. 
 In its brief to the court, the federal government also said that any threat of bias had been countered by meticulous care in jury selection. More than a dozen news organizations, including The New York Times Company, filed a brief siding with the government. The brief argued that decisions on whether to move trials should not be based solely on the volume and tenor of news coverage. It added that a decision in Mr. Skilling's favor might prompt trial judges to cut back on public access to the courts. 
 Mr. Skilling contends that the judge's oral questioning of jurors in his case, lasting five hours, was too brief. Questioning of jurors for the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who was later convicted of conspiracy in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, took two weeks. Questioning in the McVeigh trial took 18 days -- after it was moved from Oklahoma City to Denver.
 Some social science research indicates that jurors can be unaware of biases prompted by public controversy, and are reluctant to admit to them in any event. But many judges and experts in jury behavior say it is not particularly difficult to find unbiased -- indeed, profoundly uninformed -- jurors.
 ''This may come as a surprise to lawyers and judges,'' the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit wrote in an unsigned decision affirming the convictions of top aides of President Richard M. Nixon in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, ''but it is simply a fact of life that matters which interest them may be less fascinating to the public generally.''

HEADLINE: Union College Finally Admits Where It Is

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
SCHENECTADY, N.Y. -- For many years, Union College tried to conceal this crippled manufacturing city -- for better or worse, its college town -- from high school seniors. 
 The strangely candid Encyclopedia of Union College History, published in 2003, confessed that ''even today, the College directs prospective students and their parents'' along an ''an indirect, scenic route that avoids the quicker but meaner streets of the aging industrial center.'' 
 Still, there was no hiding the obvious. In a recent survey that Union College conducted of high school applicants who were admitted but chose to go elsewhere, the No. 1 reason they cited was Schenectady. But now the college is trying a new pitch, which is, in short: Come See Schenectady. 
 Officials are trying to capitalize on the fact that downtown Schenectady, which had become a symbol of urban decay, has managed a marked turnaround in the past five years, with the $40 million renovation of its historic Proctors Theater and the opening of a six-screen movie theater, a handful of restaurants and a Hampton Inn. In addition, General Electric has brought hundreds of additional employees to Schenectady for its new renewable-energy headquarters. 
 Union, a liberal arts college that enrolls about 2,100 students, has also nudged the revitalization along by buying and restoring more than two dozen ramshackle houses across from its campus. It purchased a struggling Ramada Inn, turning it into a new dorm, and transformed a polluted site into new athletic fields. 
 Unlike Yale University, whose size and global reputation make its lackluster New Haven address almost beside the point, Union and similarly situated colleges know that their locales can undermine their courtship of top students. Schenectady is still a long way from archetypal college towns like Chapel Hill, N.C., or Madison, Wis. And the college still does not provide visitors with the most direct route to campus. 
 But the college's Web site now leads parents and their children through some of those formerly mean streets so they can see firsthand the signs of renewal.
 ''It's by design,'' Matt Malatesta, the college's vice president for admissions, financial aid and enrollment, said of the somewhat circuitous directions. ''The fact is that most students are running late to appointments at Skidmore or Colgate or R.P.I., and they come on campus, they take the tour and get back in their car. They think they know Schenectady, so they don't give it the time.'' 
 Changing perceptions is slow work. In a survey by The Princeton Review, Union College placed second in the nation for ''strained town-gown relations.'' But during freshman orientation last fall, the college offered its first urban experience as an alternative to the usual camping retreat, and 35 students signed up to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity and the Boys and Girls Club. 
 A group of 16 students who are part of an independent study project led by an economics professor, Harold Fried, plan to open a combined boutique and coffeehouse downtown this year. A student group called the Union-Schenectady Alliance is planning its third annual ''Show Me Schenectady'' day, which in the past has successfully enticed students off campus with $5 worth of coupons redeemable at downtown businesses. 
 ''It succeeded in chipping away at some of the misconceptions,'' said Steve Walker, a student at the University of Wisconsin Law School who helped found the alliance before graduating from Union in 2008. ''Students saw that there weren't boarded-up windows over the businesses and a bunch of drug dealers on street corners. 
 ''Some people had literally never gone off campus,'' he said.
 Matt Baumgartner, a 1995 graduate, was coaxed back here when he was looking to match the success of a burrito restaurant he owns in Albany. Last year he bought a vacant three-story building and opened Bombers Burrito Bar on State Street, the main artery downtown. 
 ''Forty percent of our customers are Union College students,'' he said. ''It's night and day from the 1990s, when I was there.''
 While the college and wider community now seem to be working in concert, their relations had been laughably prickly since Union's founding in 1795. In 1832, a student named Jonathan Pearson wrote in his diary that the city was ''only fit for hogs and Dutchmen'' and complained: ''Why are the ways and walks never cleaned? Why never repaired? Oh, what a world of filth.''
 Apparently, the animosity was mutual: in 1824, after a scuffle broke out between students and local residents in -- of all places -- a Methodist church, an angry mob threatened to burn down the college. And in 1910, the college began erecting the tall, ornamental iron fence around campus that became a symbol of its aloof posture toward the city. 
 Early in the last decade, Schenectady, once known as the city that lights the world, had lost a third of its population -- primarily the result of General Electric's moving tens of thousands of jobs elsewhere. Moody's Investors Service had downgraded the city's bond rating to Ba3, the lowest in the state and one of the lowest in the country. (It has since rebounded to Baa1.) Some 80 percent of the storefronts along State Street stood empty. 
 As Schenectady's fortunes slid, Union responded by beefing up activities on campus. The latest edition of The Best 371 Colleges by The Princeton Review ranks Union first in the category More to Do on Campus, which sounds appealing but also suggests that students are not enamored of their college towns. 
 Around 2003, the city and Schenectady County began a commitment to rebuild the commercial base and improve facades along State Street and Broadway. In addition to G.E.'s renewable-energy headquarters, Schenectady attracted the Golub Corporation, the parent of the Price Chopper supermarket chain, which has just opened a new headquarters near campus with 800 employees. G.E. also plans to open a $100 million battery plant next year in a restored manufacturing building, with 350 positions. 
 Dave Brown, a senior from Southington, Conn., and a co-chairman of the Union-Schenectady Alliance, said he took a look at downtown when he visited Union, but he conceded that the college ''could be in the Arctic and I'd probably still come.''
 His involvement with the alliance was motivated, he said, by a desire to ''correct an incorrect perception, which is that Schenectady is bad.'' He added, ''Even in the time I've been here it's improved fourfold.''

HEADLINE: Unknotting Father's Reins In Hope of 'Reinventing' Libya

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, Libya -- Prying open a closed economy is no easy job, especially if the country in question is Libya -- a nation that has spent more than two decades with its back turned to the world. It becomes all the more challenging when doing so means taking on the legacy of your father and fighting an entrenched bureaucracy with little interest in serious change.
 Yet that is the goal of Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the son and possible successor to Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, as he sets out to dismantle a legacy of Socialism and authoritarianism introduced by his father 40 years ago.
 ''It is hard work reinventing a country,'' he said in an interview last month, as he slouched on a sofa in his villa in the hills above Tripoli, picking at a tray of fruit including fresh dates brought to him by a black-suited waiter. ''But that is what we are doing. We will have a new constitution, new laws, a commercial and business code and now a flat tax of 15 percent.'' 
 In the last few years, Mr. Qaddafi, 37, who has a doctorate from the London School of Economics, flawless English and a bold independent streak, has emerged as the Western-friendly face of Libya and symbol of its hopes for reform and openness. When he was nominated last year to lead a powerful government body overseeing tribal leaders, analysts saw it as a sign of his father's endorsement.
 But in Libya's opaque politics, little is seldom as it appears. And it is far from clear to what extent the younger Mr. Qaddafi's vision is official policy or wishful dreaming.
 Despite his broad international appeal and evidence of popular support at home, analysts say that resistance to his pell-mell approach to modernization appears to be building.
 Recently the government curtailed the operations of two crusading newspapers he backed. His entreaties for Western investment were undercut last month when the government imposed a visa ban on more than 20 European countries hoping to do business here. And the old, bellicose Libya seemed to hold sway last week when Colonel Qaddafi escalated a running feud with Switzerland by declaring a ''jihad'' against it.
 The developments have bolstered the view that the hard-line faction championed by Seif Qaddafi's equally ambitious older brother, Mutassim, the country's national security adviser, was gaining ground.
 ''A lot of people have jumped on Seif's bandwagon as if he were the future of Libya,'' said Dana Moss, a Libya expert and the author of a forthcoming monograph on United States-Libya relations. ''But that is not clear yet. In a future Libyan system both Seif and Mutassim will have a say, but the question is who will have more of a say.''
 Since Libya agreed to renounce its nuclear weapons, an initiative led by Seif Qaddafi, and began to mend ties with the West in the last decade, experts predicted that the opening of the economy would soon follow, spurred by privatization and an influx of foreign investment beyond the presence of international oil companies.
 Those expectations were buoyed last October when Seif Qaddafi was proposed to lead the umbrella grouping of local leaders, a position that would give him, like his brother, a voice in the government and an official platform to further his reform agenda.
 But months later, he has yet to accept the job. In his first public comments on the subject in London in January, Seif Qaddafi said that until Libya adopted democratic institutions he would stay on the political sideline. 
 ''I will not accept any position unless there is a new constitution, new laws and transparent elections,'' he said. ''Everyone should have access to public office. We should not have a monopoly on power.'' 
 Instead, he has continued his high-wire act, using his status to occasionally challenge his father's ways -- pushing for openness, opposing the ubiquitous revolutionary committees, allowing human rights critics into the country -- while trying to retain his viability as his father's successor.
 Some analysts see his reluctance to enter government as a calculated strategy to retain the aura of an outsider, to rise above the political infighting just as his father did in 1972 when he removed himself from government and adopted the title Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution.
 Free of bureaucratic restraints, Seif Qaddafi has been able to propose far-reaching ideas: tax-free investment zones, a tax haven for foreigners, the abolition of visa requirements and the development of luxury hotels.
 ''We can be the Dubai of North Africa,'' he said, citing Libya's proximity to Europe (the flight from London to Tripoli is under three hours), its abundant energy reserves and 1,200 miles of mostly unspoiled Mediterranean coastline. In the den of his villa, where a stuffed white tiger lay in watchful repose, a fountain gurgled peaceably nearby and the air was thick with incense, the idea seemed plausible. Libya is wealthier than debt-ridden, oil-poor Dubai. Its $15,000 gross domestic product per person ranks it above Poland, Mexico and Chile, according to the World Bank. The government's sovereign fund, a reserve of oil revenues, boasts $65 billion. And the government has announced plans to invest $130 billion over the next three years to improve infrastructure.
 But a descent into the center of Tripoli offers a bracing dose of reality. The streets are strewn with garbage, there are gaping holes in the sidewalks, tourist-friendly hotels and restaurants are few and far between. And while a number of seaside hotels are being built, the city largely ignores its most spectacular asset, the Mediterranean.
 Unemployment is estimated as high as 30 percent and much of the potential work force is insufficiently trained. 
 ''The whole country looks like a construction site,'' said Mustafa Fetouri, a political analyst based in Tripoli. ''But it is developing and growing Libya's people, that is the real problem. We are not Dubai.''
 Libya's market economy remains more aspirational than real. On a recent weekday morning at the nascent Tripoli stock exchange, 10 or so brokers sat looking blankly at their screens while a handful of customers waited languorously nearby. Ten companies trade on the exchange, which says it does $400,000 worth of business on an average day.
 ''The cost of running the stock market is more than the daily trading volume,'' said Shokri M. Ghanem, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation, the state oil company.
 That scene is unlikely to change until the government releases its tight grip on the economy. But Mr. Ghanem, a former prime minister who supports efforts to open the economy, said the political resistance was formidable and has been bolstered by the world financial crisis. The same oil wealth that would finance Seif Qaddafi's vision has propped up an entrenched elite vigorously opposed to reform.
 ''There are certain people high up in the government that are against privatization, even though a majority of Libyans wish to go for a market economy,'' Mr. Ghanem said.
 That majority includes people like Muhammad Younes, 35, a mechanical engineer in Tripoli who has not had a steady job for years. Libya may be wealthy, but he has nothing to show for it, despite his fluent English and a university education.
 ''No work, no chances, no job,'' he said with a fatalistic shrug. ''Yet we have so much money. Something must be wrong.''

HEADLINE: Using Diplomatic Touch, an Outsider Challenges the Grip of Egypt's Ruling Party

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Mona El-Naggar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Since arriving to a hero's welcome just days ago, the former chief international nuclear watchdog and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mohamed ElBaradei has taken on the country's leadership in the way you might expect of a career diplomat: using delicate language and a nonconfrontational approach.
 But for all the gentle words, Dr. ElBaradei's whirlwind interviews made it clear that he had come home to shake up the leadership's long monopoly on power, even as he continued to dance around the question of whether he would run for president. 
 His message as he dominated the media landscape was a call for the people of Egypt to press their government for more political freedoms, a provocation in a nation where dissent is hardly tolerated and where a viable political opposition has not been allowed to grow. His point was this: Without amending the Constitution to allow fully free elections, Egypt could not improve any of the deep social and economic problems that had been allowed to fester under the governing party.
 ''My goal is that there wouldn't be one savior for Egypt,'' Dr. ElBaradei said in a three-hour television interview shortly after he arrived. ''My goal is for Egypt to save itself. Help me in order to help you. If you want this country to change, then every one of you must participate to show his desire.''
 It is hard to say where Dr. ElBaradei's head-first plunge into Egyptian politics will lead. He has given voice to the frustration with Egypt's political, social and economic stagnation in a way that had not been seen since a brief, measured political thaw in 2005. But his early support appears to be primarily among intellectuals and young people, and analysts have questioned whether he will be able to broaden that appeal.
 If anything concrete has so far emerged from his challenge, political analysts said, it appears that the governing party may be shaken enough that President Hosni Mubarak will consider running for president again when his term expires in 2011. 
 There had been widespread speculation that Mr. Mubarak, who is 81 and has governed for nearly 29 years, was grooming his younger son, Gamal, to be the candidate of the governing National Democratic Party. But the thinking now is that the younger Mr. Mubarak's credentials could not match Dr. ElBaradei's.
 The signs that the elder Mr. Mubarak might be changing his mind: he has visited regions around the country recently and the state-run media have begun referencing his electoral platform.
 ''ElBaradei constitutes a real challenge,'' said Mustapha Kamel El Sayed, a political science professor at American University in Cairo, ''not necessarily in terms of his capacity to win an election against the candidate of the National Democratic Party, but in terms of the superiority of his prestige and the respect he has domestically and internationally.''
 In 2005, under pressure from Washington, the Egyptian government made some effort to improve political freedoms, and the next year it allow challengers to run against the president in his bid for re-election. Previously the president had run in single candidate ''referendums.'' 
 But soon after, the political opening evaporated, and in 2007 the state pushed through amendments to the Constitution that effectively made it harder for independents to run for office.
 Dr. ElBaradei has called on the state to change the Constitution again, a pragmatic first step since under existing law he is unlikely to qualify to run -- a fact that he has used, subtly, to embarrass the state.
 His decision to plunge into politics presents the government with a unique challenge. He is a former insider, a diplomat who once worked for the foreign service and who hails from the cadre of political elite now in charge.
 ''He is not a radical, and he is not going to change the country's direction 180 degrees,'' said Amr El-Shobaki, a political analyst at The Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ''At the same time, he reveals their mismanagement, the absence of democracy, the arbitrariness of the regime.''
 Dr. ElBaradei, 67, left his post in December as director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Along with the nuclear agency, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. In December, as speculation about Dr. ElBaradei's possible candidacy surfaced, the state news media began to attack him. But in the past two weeks, they have largely ignored him, even as he has received tremendous attention from independent news organizations. 
 If there was any indication of how the governing party might challenge Dr. ElBaradei, it was in a front-page opinion piece written by Abdel Moneim Said, chairman of Al Ahram, which publishes the state-owned and widely circulated newspaper of the same name. His article effectively said that while Dr. ElBaradei called for change, his ideas were not new, and that many of his facts about the challenges Egypt faces were wrong. 
 Few expect that to be where the effort to block Dr. ElBaradei ends.
 ''The regime that controls this country is very smart and cunning and sly, and he who thinks otherwise is under an illusion and naive, or it wouldn't have preserved such a large nation in the refrigerator of stillness and subservience for 30 years,'' wrote Magdy el Gallad in the Feb. 23 issue of the independent daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm. ''As such, it knows how to deal with each opponent or competitor or opposition in a special and different way.''
 The only remaining question, according to Mr. Gallad: ''How then will the ruling regime burn Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei?''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 1 about attempts by Mohamed ElBaradei, the Egyptian diplomat and former director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to press Egypt's leadership for more political freedoms after returning to his country misstated the year that the government first allowed challengers to run against President Hosni Mubarak, who has ruled for nearly 29 years. It was 2005, not 2006.

HEADLINE: Soured Over Policy, Leaders Await Sessions With Clinton

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Ginger Thompson reported from Washington, and Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's five-nation Latin American tour, which begins Monday and is meant in part to address regional tensions, is instead likely to be overshadowed by the response to Chile's earthquake and efforts to line up support for the American campaign to isolate Iran.
 Mrs. Clinton is expected to stop in Santiago, Chile, on Tuesday to meet with President Michelle Bachelet and President-elect Sebastian Pinera, the first conservative politician to rise to power there since the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. 
 State Department officials said Chile, which has its own sophisticated emergency response agency, was not likely to need anywhere near the level of assistance being provided to Haiti. But they said they expected Chile to request United States support for a field hospital and satellite communications equipment. 
 Mrs. Clinton also plans stops in Uruguay, Brazil, Costa Rica and Guatemala to meet an array of newly elected leaders who embody the region's diverse political currents. But whether meeting with presidents on the left or right, she is expected to face growing disappointment with what they see as the Obama administration's lack of resolve and initiative on a variety of issues, including climate change, trade, relations with Cuba and last year's coup in Honduras.
 For the United States, one of the most critical meetings will be in Brazil, where Mrs. Clinton will press President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to vote for stiffer sanctions against Iran at the United Nations Security Council. The sanctions are meant to pressure Iran into ending its nuclear program, which the United States says it believes is intended to produce weapons.
 Brazil, which holds a rotating seat on the Security Council, has said it opposes further sanctions. It recently moved to expand its ties with the Islamic government in Tehran and has been a vocal advocate for engagement over isolation. 
 ''What we want to try to tell the Brazilians is, yes, if you have engagement with Iran, we'd really urge you to use that engagement in a way that you can push the Iranians to meet their fundamental international obligations,'' said Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela. ''If you don't do that, then we'll be disappointed.''
 Few foreign policy experts expect Mrs. Clinton to persuade Mr. da Silva, who they said views Iran as a small but significant factor in Brazil's rising prominence on the world stage, and for whom staring down the United States curries favor with his leftist base during an election year. 
 ''Brazil is striking out on its own with Iran,'' said Christopher Sabatini, senior director for policy at the Council of the Americas in New York. ''It's made clear it won't do the bidding of the United States.''
 Mr. Sabatini said that disagreement was likely to remain ''a major irritant'' in Brazil's relationship with the United States. 
 Although hardly as pressing as the threat of nuclear proliferation, there is also a strong sense of exasperation among Latin American leaders with the United States. Just last week, those leaders agreed to form a new political group that, unlike the Organization of American States, includes Cuba and excludes the United States and Canada. 
 The new coalition is meant to rival the O.A.S., which some countries consider a tool of American dominance in the hemisphere.
 Riordan Roett, a Latin America expert at Johns Hopkins University, said that the organization was only one more example of the diminished standing of the United States in Latin America. China, he said, has replaced the United States as the main trading partner of Brazil and Chile, both growing economies. And while the Obama administration's leading Latin America appointments were delayed by Washington power struggles, Europe's political influence has filled the void.
 A visit from Mrs. Clinton, he said, is not likely to be enough to repair the damage.
 ''I don't get the sense that there's a game plan for Latin America,'' Mr. Roett said. ''And Latin Americans don't get that sense either.''
 In a meeting with reporters on Friday, Assistant Secretary Valenzuela rejected assertions that the United States had lost influence in Latin America.
 There is little surprise that Mrs. Clinton will not make stops in Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, whose leaders have been strident opponents of the United States. But there has been heated speculation about why Argentina, South America's second power, was left off the itinerary, although Mrs. Clinton will meet the president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, in Uruguay.
 Argentina is currently embroiled in a dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic. The two countries fought a brief war over the islands in 1982, and now Britain, which won the war, has angered Argentina by authorizing British companies to begin exploratory drilling in nearby waters.
 To Argentina's chagrin, the United States has taken no position on the dispute.

HEADLINE: Arthur Hayes Jr., 76; Led F.D.A. in Tylenol Case

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Arthur Hayes Jr., who while leading the Food and Drug Administration during the Reagan administration helped calm consumer fears after a Tylenol poisoning case and, amid some controversy, approved the use of the artificial sweetener found in Equal and Nutrasweet, died Feb. 11 in Danbury, Conn. He was 76 and lived in Oxford, Conn. 
 The cause was leukemia, his son, Arthur III, said.
 Dr. Hayes, a pharmacological researcher, was appointed commissioner of the F.D.A. by President Ronald Reagan in April 1981. He served until August 1983.
 The biggest crisis faced by the agency under Dr. Hayes was a nationwide alarm in 1982 caused by the deaths of seven people in the Chicago area who had taken Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide. The case remains unsolved. Under Dr. Hayes's leadership, the government and the drug industry responded by developing the first federal regulations requiring tamper-resistant packaging for all over-the-counter drugs. 
 In 1981, Dr. Hayes granted approval for the use of the sugar substitute aspartame in dry foods and as a tabletop sweetener. Research had found that aspartame was associated with high rates of cancers in rats that had been given large doses, starting at what would be the equivalent of four to five 20-ounce bottles of diet soda a day for a 150-pound person.
 Dr. Hayes insisted that there was no need for people to avoid the sweetener. 
 Marketed as NutraSweet (when used as a food additive) and Equal (the tabletop version), aspartame is now also used in products like soft drinks, breakfast cereals, pudding mixes and gum. Research done after Dr. Hayes's time as commissioner indicated that aspartame can sometimes cause incapacitating headaches and even seizures. 
 Arthur Hull Hayes Jr. was born in Highland Park, Mich., on July 18, 1933, one of four children of Arthur and Florence Gruber Hayes. His father was president of CBS Radio.
 Dr. Hayes received his bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1955 from Santa Clara University and then went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, earning a degree in philosophy, politics and economics in 1957. He returned to the United States to study medicine and graduated from Cornell University Medical School in 1964. He served in the Army Medical Corps from 1965 to 1967.
 From 1967 to 1981, Dr. Hayes was an assistant professor of medicine and pharmacology at Cornell. He later became director of clinical pharmacology at the Pennsylvania State University medical school. After leaving the F.D.A., he was dean of New York Medical College and, in 1986, was named president of E. M. Pharmaceuticals.
 Besides his son, Arthur, he is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Barbara Anne Carey; two daughters, Lisa Hayes and Kathy Saracino; two sisters, Mary Ann Kelley and Florence Hayes; his brother, Joseph; and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Financial Reform Endgame

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
So here's the situation. We've been through the second-worst financial crisis in the history of the world, and we've barely begun to recover: 29 million Americans either can't find jobs or can't find full-time work. Yet all momentum for serious banking reform has been lost. The question now seems to be whether we'll get a watered-down bill or no bill at all. And I hate to say this, but the second option is starting to look preferable.
 The problem, not too surprisingly, lies in the Senate, and mainly, though not entirely, with Republicans. The House has already passed a fairly strong reform bill, more or less along the lines proposed by the Obama administration, and the Senate could probably do the same if it operated on the principle of majority rule. But it doesn't -- and when you combine near-universal Republican opposition to serious reform with the wavering of some Democrats, prospects look bleak. 
 How did we get to this point? And should reform advocates accept the compromises that might yet produce some kind of bill?
 Many opponents of the House version of banking reform present their position as one of principle. House Republicans, offering their alternative proposal, claimed that they would end banking excesses by introducing ''market discipline'' -- basically, by promising not to rescue banks in the future.
 But that's a fantasy. For one thing, governments always, when push comes to shove, end up rescuing key financial institutions in a crisis. And more broadly, relying on the magic of the market to keep banks safe has always been a path to disaster. Even Adam Smith knew that: he may have been the father of free-market economics, but he argued that bank regulation was as necessary as fire codes on urban buildings, and called for a ban on high-risk, high-interest lending, the 18th-century version of subprime. And the lesson has been confirmed again and again, from the Panic of 1873 to Iceland today. 
 I suspect that even Republicans, in their hearts, understand the need for real reform. But their strategy of opposing anything the Obama administration proposes, coupled with the lure of financial-industry dollars -- back in December top Republican leaders huddled with bank lobbyists to coordinate their campaigns against reform -- has trumped all other considerations.
 That said, some Republicans might, just possibly, be persuaded to sign on to a much-weakened version of reform -- in particular, one that eliminates a key plank of the Obama administration's proposals, the creation of a strong, independent agency protecting consumers. Should Democrats accept such a watered-down reform?
 I say no.
 There are times when even a highly imperfect reform is much better than nothing; this is very much the case for health care. But financial reform is different. An imperfect health care bill can be revised in the light of experience, and if Democrats pass the current plan there will be steady pressure to make it better. A weak financial reform, by contrast, wouldn't be tested until the next big crisis. All it would do is create a false sense of security and a fig leaf for politicians opposed to any serious action -- then fail in the clinch.
 Better, then, to take a stand, and put the enemies of reform on the spot. And by all means let's highlight the dispute over a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency.
 There's no question that consumers need much better protection. The late Edward Gramlich -- a Federal Reserve official who tried in vain to get Alan Greenspan to act against predatory lending -- summarized the case perfectly back in 2007: ''Why are the most risky loan products sold to the least sophisticated borrowers? The question answers itself -- the least sophisticated borrowers are probably duped into taking these products.''
 Is it important that this protection be provided by an independent agency? It must be, or lobbyists wouldn't be campaigning so hard to prevent that agency's creation. 
 And it's not hard to see why. Some have argued that the job of protecting consumers can and should be done either by the Fed or -- as in one compromise that at this point seems unlikely -- by a unit within the Treasury Department. But remember, not that long ago Mr. Greenspan was Fed chairman and John Snow was Treasury secretary. Case closed. The only way consumers will be protected under future antiregulation administrations -- and believe me, given the power of the financial lobby, there will be such administrations -- is if there's an agency whose whole reason for being is to police bank abuses. 
 In summary, then, it's time to draw a line in the sand. No reform, coupled with a campaign to name and shame the people responsible, is better than a cosmetic reform that just covers up failure to act.

HEADLINE: Pelosi Says She'll Get Votes Needed for Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she is confident she will be able to get the votes needed to pass sweeping health care legislation in the House, even if it threatens the political careers of some members of her party.
 In an interview carried Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' Ms. Pelosi said she was working on changes to a Senate-passed bill that would make it acceptable to the House. 
 Ms. Pelosi was asked what she would say to House Democrats who were ''in real fear of losing their seats in November if they support you now.''
 ''Our members, every one of them, wants health care,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''They know that this will take courage. It took courage to pass Social Security. It took courage to pass Medicare. And many of the same forces that were at work decades ago are at work again against this bill.''
 ''But,'' Ms. Pelosi continued, ''the American people need it. Why are we here? We're not here just to self-perpetuate our service in Congress. We're here to do the job for the American people, to get them results that give them not only health security, but economic security.''
 On CNN's ''State of the Union,'' Ms. Pelosi was asked about opinion polls showing opposition to the Democrats' health care bills.
 ''The point is that we have a responsibility here,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''The Republicans have had a field day going out there and misrepresenting what is in the bill, but that's what they do.''
 The House passed a bill to remake the health care system in early November. But on Sunday, Ms. Pelosi said, ''There isn't a bill.'' 
 The speaker said she would have another version, incorporating compromises between the House and the Senate, ''in a matter of days.'' When the new package is ready, Ms. Pelosi said, she will sell it to the public.
 ''Our bill, the House and the Senate bill, had some major differences, which we're hoping now to reconcile,'' Ms. Pelosi said. ''Then when we have a bill -- as I say, you can bake the pie, you can sell the pie, but you have to have a pie to sell. And when we do, we will take it out there.''
 Republicans said Ms. Pelosi and President Obama were pursuing a high-risk strategy.
 Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said, ''It would be a political kamikaze mission for the Democratic Party if they jam this through after the American people have been saying, look, we're trying to tell you in every way we know how, in elections, in surveys, in town hall meetings, we don't want this bill.''
 Democratic leaders hope to orchestrate passage of health legislation in a three-step process intended to avoid the threat of a filibuster by Senate Republicans. Under this plan, the House would pass the health bill approved in December by the Senate, and both chambers would approve a separate package of changes using a parliamentary device known as budget reconciliation.
 But on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, the House Republican whip, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, said: ''I'll tell you one thing: If Speaker Pelosi rams this bill through the House using a reconciliation process, they will lose their majority in Congress in November.''

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Unit Said to Be Near Sale to a British Company

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Prudential P.L.C., the British financial services company, was nearing a deal on Sunday to acquire the American International Group's big life insurance business in Asia for about $35.5 billion in a move that would help repay taxpayer bailout money, people briefed on the matter said.
 An announcement about the acquisition of the unit, American International Assurance, could be made as soon as Monday, these people said, cautioning that the deal was not yet final and that talks could still fall apart. 
 Still, A.I.G.'s board voted over the weekend to approve the transaction, the people said, and on Sunday night A.I.G.'s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, was headed to Hong Kong to brief regulators about the transaction. It was unclear whether the transaction would be approved immediately, and other bidders -- including rival insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds -- might still try to top Prudential's bid, one of these people said.
 A sale of the business, which is based in Hong Kong and is commonly known as A.I.A., would lead to the biggest repayment yet toward the more than $180 billion that the government has invested in A.I.G. as part of its huge bailout. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which holds preferred shares in A.I.A., would receive the first $16 billion in proceeds from the sale.
 Before the financial crisis of 2008, A.I.G. was the world's largest insurer, owning a diverse array of services across the globe assembled largely by its longtime chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg. Since its rescue by the federal government, however, the company has sought to sell off businesses to help repay its bailout funds.
 Mr. Benmosche has outlined a future for the company in which it focuses on selling property and casualty insurance worldwide, under a unit rebranded Chartis, and life insurance only in the United States. 
 Soon after arriving at A.I.G. in August, Mr. Benmosche slowed the company's sales campaigns, instead seeking to fetch higher prices for the businesses.
 Beyond the sale of A.I.A., the insurer is also trying to sell another life insurance unit, the American Life Insurance Company, to MetLife for about $15 billion, according to people briefed on the matter. 
 Those negotiations have been stymied over a tax issue that requires resolution from the Internal Revenue Service, these people said, though they still expect to reach a deal.
 It is also seeking to sell other units, including an aircraft-leasing business. 
 A.I.A., founded in 1919 and one of A.I.G.'s oldest divisions, is widely considered one of the top businesses within A.I.G.: the division has about 20 million policy holders throughout Asia. 
 A.I.G. had been preparing an initial public offering of the division, lining up banks to oversee what would have been among the largest listings this year. But a sale to Prudential would have more certainty than a huge offering, which helped draw the support of government officials for a deal.
 Under the terms of the expected deal, Prudential will pay about $25 billion in cash and about $10.5 billion in a combination of stock, preferred shares and convertible preferred shares, the people said. The British company, whose market value was about $23.3 billion as of Friday, is expected to sell a large new batch of shares to help finance the deal.
 Representatives for Prudential and A.I.G. declined to comment.
 In taking over A.I.A., Prudential would become the indisputable leader in the Asian life insurance sector. 
 A 162-year-old company -- which is not related to Prudential Financial in the United States -- Prudential P.L.C. already draws a majority of its revenue from Asia, with more than 11 million policy holders in 13 markets there.
 The acquisition would accelerate a strategy outlined by Prudential's chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, to drastically increase the firm's revenue in Asia, one of the fastest-growing markets for life insurance.
 Prudential first approached A.I.G. last year, but it was rebuffed because its offer was too low, according to people briefed on the matter.

HEADLINE: As Foreclosures Continue ...

 BODY:
President Obama went to Henderson, Nev., the other day to show Americans that he was responding to the cries for help from struggling homeowners (and maybe give a boost to Senator Harry Reid's re-election). He announced a $1.5 billion effort to prevent foreclosures in five states hard-hit by the housing bust -- Nevada, Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan -- by feeding money into programs that would be developed and carried out by the housing agencies in the targeted states. 
 The audience in Henderson applauded the announcement, and understandably so. In Nevada, unemployment is 13 percent and 70 percent of homeowners with mortgages owe more on their homes than they are worth; in industry parlance, they are ''underwater.'' Since a combination of joblessness and underwater loans is the main driver of foreclosure, Nevadans are clearly at high risk of losing their homes, as are homeowners in the other four states.
 So it was good to see Mr. Obama focusing aid where it is needed most. But two big concerns remain. First, the new plan must be implemented quickly and efficiently for it to be more than a public relations ploy, and as yet there is no timetable. More broadly, it is still not clear whether the administration realizes that the importance of the plan lies not just in what it might do for a handful of states but in the direction it should set nationally.
 The administration's $75 billion antiforeclosure program, which subsidizes lenders to rework bad loans, has been a big disappointment. One reason is that its usual method of modifying loans -- lowering the monthly payment by reducing the interest rate -- does not work well for jobless and underwater borrowers. Unemployed homeowners often cannot make even reduced payments and underwater borrowers need principal reductions to succeed over the long run, not lower rates.
 And yet, the administration has resisted calls to revamp its program, citing cost and complexity. Another obstacle is that banks are generally loath to modify loans by reducing principal, which would require them to take big upfront losses that they would prefer to postpone. 
 In at least a tacit acknowledgment of those issues, Mr. Obama specifically said that the five-state effort is intended to aid homeowners who are out of work and underwater. To help jobless owners, states could use the money for loans to cover mortgage payments, an approach used successfully in Pennsylvania. With unemployment expected to remain high for a long time, Mr. Obama should consider a national program of that kind.
 It is less clear how the new fund would help underwater borrowers. Why would states be successful in negotiating principal reductions when the administration has not been able to persuade or compel the banks to do them? Still, now that Mr. Obama has set the aim of helping underwater borrowers, it is up to the administration -- by working with states or by revamping its own efforts -- to make it happen. The banks won't like it. But the alternative is more foreclosures, further price declines and -- as the housing market continues to wobble -- an endangered economic recovery. 
 By itself, Mr. Obama's new plan for Nevada and the other states is too small to make a meaningful dent in foreclosures. But by aiming to help unemployed and underwater borrowers, it is headed in the right direction, if the administration is willing to set a new course.

HEADLINE: 2009 Profit At HSBC Falls Short Of Estimates

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
HSBC on Monday reported earnings for last year that fell short of expectations and said that it had set aside more money for bad loans.
 HSBC shares closed down 4.4 percent in London. 
 The bank also reported a big drop in profit in the Asia-Pacific region, which it attributed to economic weakness early in 2009. 
 In his first official news conference since moving to Hong Kong in January, HBSC's chief executive, Michael F. Geoghegan, reaffirmed the bank's belief that Asian growth would outpace that in the rest of the world. 
 ''Asia will lead the way, and take an increasingly influential role on the global stage,'' he said, while the developed economies are ''stuck in first gear and still in danger of stalling.''
 HSBC already generates the bulk of its earnings from Asia, but shrinking economies in Europe and an unsuccessful expansion into the United States subprime mortgage market some years ago have led the bank to focus even more on the region.
 Mark Phin, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, called the earnings report ''over all, a slightly weaker set of numbers than we had hoped.''
 The bank said its profit for 2009 rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier, to $5.8 billion. Operating income fell 11 percent, to $78.6 billion.
 HSBC also said it had set aside $26.5 billion for bad loans and other credit risks last year, up 9 percent from the year before. Much of that resulted from assets held by the investment banking unit as well as loans to companies in Spain and the Middle East, it said.
 The increase in impairment charges was a contrast to some of its rivals, which had reported falling charges for 2009. HSBC said, however, that it expected those charges to fall this year.
 HSBC's investment banking unit tripled its pretax profit to $10.5 billion in 2009. It was the bank's only business to report higher earnings before taxes.
 For 2009, it reported that pretax profit in Hong Kong declined to $5 billion, from $5.46 billion, and fell almost 11 percent in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, to $4.2 billion.
 Before the earnings report, Mr. Geoghegan issued a statement saying he had decided to accept a bonus this year, after having turned one down a year earlier, because ''this year the performance of HSBC is significantly stronger.'' He said the bonus -- $:4 million ($6 million) -- would be paid in deferred stock, releasable over three years and subject to certain conditions. He also said he would donate the bonus to charity.
 Stephen K. Green, the HSBC chairman, said that the board, under pressure from large shareholders, had abandoned its plan to increase Mr. Geoghegan's base pay, currently $:1.07 million, but said it would be raised over the next 12 months. ''I believe Mike to be underpaid,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq and S.&P. Positive For the Day and the Year

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street reached a milestone on Monday that had eluded it for some time: two major stock indexes crossed into positive territory for the year.
 After spending weeks in a seesaw pattern, the Nasdaq composite index and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the day slightly above their Dec. 31 levels. That gave hope to investors seeking to re-establish an upward momentum for the markets. 
 The indexes had spent much of 2010 searching for direction. At the start of the new year, the energy of last year's rally seemed poised to endure. Then came a debt crisis in Greece, resurrecting concerns about the global recovery. Soon, the market was rubbing against its lowest levels in months. 
 On Monday, hints that France and Germany would play a central role in a bailout for Greece helped push the two indexes over the flat line for the year, as investors became more confident that a crisis would be averted. 
 The S.& P. 500 climbed 11.22 points, or 1.02 percent, to 1,115.71 -- 0.05 percent higher for the year. The Nasdaq surged 35.31 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,273.57 -- 0.19 percent higher for 2010.
 The burst of enthusiasm was not enough, however, to lead the Dow Jones industrial average above its Dec. 31 close. Though it rose 78.53 points, or 0.76 percent, it ended at 10,403.79 -- about 25 points shy of the break-even threshold for the year.
 Investors seemed reassured by reports that the more affluent members of the European Union would offer loan guarantees on Greek debt as the country prepared for a bond sale to finance its ballooning debt. Adding to the optimism, a report showed that Americans opened their pocketbooks a little wider in January.
 The dollar rose, closing at $1.3574 to the euro, breaking its pattern of weakening in the face of a growing appetite for risk.
 Brewing debt woes abroad helped bolster the dollar's appeal. Investors worry that looming elections in several countries, including Japan and Britain, could derail efforts to trim deficits. The British pound touched its lowest level since May on Monday after a poll showed no party was on track to gain a majority of seats in Parliament, stoking fears of inaction. 
 ''If these countries don't get their fiscal houses in order soon, investors will continue to be nervous,'' said Rebecca Patterson, who specializes in foreign exchange markets for JPMorgan Private Bank. 
 On Wall Street, reassurances of a rescue plan helped quell fears that a debt crisis across Europe would slow a global recovery.
 David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff & Associates, said investors were momentarily encouraged by a sense that European governments would not be allowed to default. But he said the underlying concerns about swelling deficits remained.
 ''This a reminder that all these debt concerns left over from the bubble have not been fully resolved. There will be other flare-ups, '' Mr. Rosenberg said.
 Signs that Americans were spending again helped draw some attention away from debt worries. Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in January, more than analysts had forecast, though incomes rose just 0.1 percent.
 There were hopes that the private sector would benefit from merger deals. Prudential of Britain said Monday that it had agreed to buyAmerican International Group's life insurance business in Asia for $35.5 billion. Shares of A.I.G. rose 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Army Ebbs, And Power Realigns In Turkey

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- The detention of top military officers in Turkey last week was nothing less than a quiet piece of history. The military, long considered untouchable in Turkey, was pushed from its political pedestal with startling finality.
 The moment, years in the making, was more whimper than bang. But it still raises an existential question for this NATO member: What sort of country will Turkey be?
 The question goes to the very heart of modern Turkey, a Muslim democracy whose military was a potent force in the country's political life for most of its 86-year history. Its strictly secular ideology permeated all aspects of public life, including the education system, the judiciary and the bureaucracy. The military, long considered the ultimate guardian of that secularism, has overthrown elected governments to protect it.
 Not only has the military been politically defanged, but it has also proved unable or unwilling to fight back. Dozens of officers were detained last week, and several senior ones were arrested. Top military leaders met and managed to produce only a brief statement, never mind a coup. 
 ''What came out of that?'' said Baskin Oran, a professor of international relations at Ankara University. ''A big nothing. This is finished. Turkey has crossed the border.''
 Now the country is shedding its skin, sloughing off an outdated doctrine, but nervous about what will take its place. 
 ''The old ideology is bankrupt, that much we know,'' said Soli Ozel, a professor of political science at Bilgi University. ''But what are we going to be putting in its stead? How will we filter the world around us? How will we see ourselves?''
 Turkey is moving into uncharted territory, causing deep anxiety among millions of secular Turks who fear that the country's domineering prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- a former Islamist who won 47 percent of the vote in the last election and now controls many of the country's institutions -- will trample their rights.
 That worry deepened Monday, when the Turkish authorities made two more controversial arrests -- of an active duty general and a state prosecutor who had investigated Islamic networks, Turkey's Anatolian News Agency reported.
 How Turkey resolves this identity crisis will reverberate well beyond its borders. The country has the second largest army in NATO after the United States. It is strategically placed, with the former Soviet Union to the north and the Middle East to the south. It is a candidate for membership in the European Union. Decades of growth have made it the seventh largest economy in Europe.
 Last week's detentions and arrests capped a month of high political drama that began in January, when a small independent newspaper, Taraf, published what it said were military documents from a 2003 meeting describing preparations for a coup.
 The documents were brought in a suitcase, Taraf's editors said, and included diagrams of two Istanbul mosques that were to have been bombed, creating an emergency that would justify a military takeover.
 The military acknowledged that a meeting had taken place, but said that it was focused only on external threats. The army chief vehemently denied plans for bombings or a coup. 
 Even so, on Monday of last week, the Turkish authorities began detaining military officers and by the end of the week had more than 60 in custody, including two top retired generals.
 ''Now the army is completely pacified, eliminated as a power from the political scene,'' said E. Haldun Solmazturk, a retired general. ''Now the military is touchable.''
 That is a profound historical change. Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 by an army general, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who imposed radical changes in language and habits on a largely illiterate, agrarian society. The military, together with the judiciary and state bureaucracy, wielded immense power, guarding Turkish democracy ''as if the country was a perpetually immature child,'' said Halil Berktay, a history professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul.
 ''The military came to acquire a sense of, 'this is our land, this is our Republic,' '' he said. It deposed elected governments four times, most recently in 1997.
 That role began to change with the rise of Mr. Erdogan, a tough-talking Istanbul mayor representing a rising underclass of religious Turks. He was a confounding mix, from a background of political Islam, but with an agenda of bringing Turkey into the European Union, where his supporters did most of their business.
 Although he was despised by the secular establishment, his party, Justice and Development, won a national election in a landslide in 2007. 
 The election vastly diminished the military's role in politics, but that was changing anyway. None of the alleged coup plots cited by prosecutors ever came to pass because the top leadership stopped them. 
 And the fact that the military has not responded to the arrests -- which include a sprawling legal proceeding against 200 people that began in 2007 -- reflects a leadership that is opposed to intervention. The current chief of the army, Gen. Ilker Basbug, has spoken out against military meddling and is believed to have had good relations with Mr. Erdogan.
 But to Mr. Erdogan's critics, the arrests look suspiciously like raw efforts to silence the opposition. And now that he has control over most of the levers of power -- the presidency, the government bureaucracy and Parliament -- they worry that his impulses will be unchecked.
 Many believe that the police and prosecutors have been hijacked by an Islamic network led by Fetullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who lives in the United States. Nedim Sener, a journalist who has written a book on the network, said the involvement of Mr. Gulen's followers was an ''open secret.''
 A looming fear is that the last remaining institution with any power to oppose him, the judiciary, will soon fall to his Islamic supporters, who are unlikely to be less ideological than their rigidly secular predecessors. 
 Even those who are happy to see Mr. Erdogan prevail say he is a flawed leader with autocratic tendencies. His biggest critic, Aydin Dogan, a businessman and publisher, was slapped with a giant fine last year, and journalists who work for his newspapers say spunky criticism is dead.
 Mr. Ozel, the political scientist, described Mr. Erdogan's party as ''a democratizing force, but not necessarily a democratic one.'' 
 Yildiray Ogur, an editor at Taraf who worked on the expose that led to last week's arrests, defended the legal cases, saying today's Turkey was a slow-motion version of the Soviet Union in 1991, when idols fell and people came out of the woodwork confessing secrets.
 For better or worse, Mr. Ozel says, former Islamists like Mr. Erdogan are the only ones engaged in the project of creating a new Turkey, with the secularist party ''either incapable or unwilling to be part of the process,'' routinely blocking legislation required for European Union membership.
 But Mr. Sener fears this new Turkey will exclude people like him. ''They say this is about democracy, but it ends up increasing their hold on power,'' he said.
 Mr. Oran of Ankara University dismisses those fears. Borrowing a thought from Marx, he noted that Mr. Erdogan's supporters, once Islamist and working class, had grown comfortable, sowing the seeds of the party's transformation. ''It has become bourgeois,'' Mr. Oran said. ''They will always be Muslims, but they won't be Islamists.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 19, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on March 2 about an inquiry into a possible military coup attempt in Turkey that has highlighted the divide between the Islamic-inspired government and the country's secular elite misspelled the given name of a Turkish preacher who leads an Islamic network that some critics say has undue influence on Turkish law-enforcement. He is Fethullah Gulen, not Fetullah.

HEADLINE: Striving to Map the Shape-Shifting Net

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- In a dimly lit chamber festooned with wires and hidden in one of California's largest data centers, Tim Pozar is changing the shape of the Internet.
 He is using what Internet engineers refer to as a ''meet-me room.'' The room itself is enclosed in a building full of computers and routers. What Mr. Pozar does there is to informally wire together the networks of different businesses that want to freely share their Internet traffic.
 The practice is known as peering, and it goes back to the earliest days of the Internet, when organizations would directly connect their networks instead of paying yet another company to route data traffic. Originally, the companies that owned the backbone of the Internet shared traffic. In recent years, however, the practice has increased to the point where some researchers who study the way global networks are put together believe that peering is changing the fundamental shape of the Internet, with serious consequences for its stability and security. Others see the vast increase in traffic staying within a structure that has remained essentially the same. 
 What is clear is that today a significant portion of Internet traffic does not flow through the backbone networks of giant Internet companies like AT&T and Level 3. Instead, it has begun to cascade in torrents of data on the edges of the network, as if a river in flood were carving new channels.
 Some of this traffic coursing through new channels passes through public peering points like Mr. Pozar's. And some flows through so-called dark networks, private channels created to move information more cheaply and efficiently within a business or any kind of organization. For instance, Google has privately built such a network so that video and search data need not pass through so many points to get to customers.
 By its very nature, Internet networking technology is intended to support anarchic growth. Unlike earlier communication networks, the Internet is not controlled from the top down. This stems from an innovation at the heart of the Internet -- packet switching. From the start, the information moving around the Internet was broken up into so-called packets that could be sent on different paths to one destination where the original message -- whether it was e-mail, an image or sound file or instructions to another computer -- would be put back together in its original form. This packet-switching technology was conceived in the 1960s in England and the United States. It made delivery of a message through a network possible even if one or many of the nodes of the network failed. Indeed, this resistance to failure or attack was at the very core of the Internet, part of the essential nature of an organic, interconnected communications web with no single control point.
 During the 1970s, a method emerged to create a network of networks. The connections depended on a communication protocol, or set of rules, known as TCP/IP, a series of letters familiar to anyone who has tried to set up their own wireless network at home. The global network of networks, the Internet, transformed the world, and continues to grow without central planning, extending itself into every area of life, from Facebook to cyberwar. 
 Everyone agrees that the shape of the network is changing rapidly, driven by a variety of factors, including content delivery networks that have pushed both data and applications to the edge of the network; the growing popularity of smartphones leading to the emergence of the wireless Internet; and the explosion of streaming video as the Internet's predominant data type.
 ''When we started releasing data publicly, we measured it in petabytes of traffic,'' said Doug Webster, a Cisco Systems market executive who is responsible for an annual report by the firm that charts changes in the Internet. ''Then a couple of years ago we had to start measuring them in zettabytes, and now we're measuring them in what we call yottabytes.'' One petabyte is equivalent to one million gigabytes. A zettabyte is a million petabytes. And a yottabyte is a thousand zettabytes. The company estimates that video will account for 90 percent of all Internet traffic by 2013.
 The staggering growth of video is figuring prominently in political and business debates like the one over the principle of network neutrality -- that all data types, sites and platforms attached to the network should be treated equally. But networks increasingly treat data types differently. Priority is often given to video or voice traffic. 
 A study presented last year by Arbor Networks suggesting that traffic flows were moving away from the core of the network touched off a spirited controversy. The study was based on an analysis of two years of Internet traffic data collected by 110 large and geographically diverse cable operators, international transit backbones, regional networks and content providers.
 Arbor's Internet Observatory Report concluded that today the majority of Internet traffic by volume flows directly between large content providers like Google and consumer networks like Comcast. It also described what it referred to as the rise of so-called hyper giants -- monstrous portals that have become the focal point for much of the network's traffic: ''Out of the 40,000 routed end sites in the Internet, 30 large companies -- 'hyper giants' like Limelight, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and YouTube -- now generate and consume a disproportionate 30 percent of all Internet traffic,'' the researchers noted.
 The changes are not happening just because of the growth of the hyper giants.
 At the San Francisco data center 365 Main, Mr. Pozar's SFMIX peering location, or fabric, as it is called, now connects just 13 networks and content providers. But elsewhere in the world, huge peering fabrics are beginning to emerge. As a result, the ''edge'' of the Internet is thickening, and that may be adding resilience to the network. 
 In Europe in particular, such connection points now route a significant part of the total traffic. AMS-IX is based in Amsterdam, where it is also run as a nonprofit neutral organization composed of 344 members exchanging 775 gigabits of traffic per second.
 ''The rise of these highly connected data centers around the world is changing our model of the Internet,'' said Jon M. Kleinberg, a computer scientist and network theorist at Cornell University. However, he added that the rise of giant distributed data centers built by Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and others as part of the development of cloud computing services is increasing the part of the network that constitutes a so-called dark Internet, making it harder for researchers to build a complete model.
 All of these changes have sparked a debate about the big picture. What does the Internet look like now? And is it stronger or weaker in terms of its resistance to failure because of random problems or actual attack.
 Researchers have come up with a dizzying array of models to explain the consequences of the changing shape of the Internet. Some describe the interconnections of the underlying physical wires. Others analyze patterns of data flow. And still others look at abstract connections like Web page links that Google and other search engine companies analyze as part of the search process. Such models are of great interest to social scientists, who can watch how people connect with each other, and entrepreneurs, who can find new ways to profit from the Internet. They are also of increasing interest to government and law enforcement organizations trying to secure the Net and use it as a surveillance tool. 
 One of the first and most successful attempts to understand the overall shape of the Internet occurred a decade ago, when Albert-Laszlo Barabasi and colleagues at the University of Notre Dame mapped part of the Internet and discovered what they called a scale-free network: connections were not random; instead, a small number of nodes had far more links than most.
 They asserted that, in essence, the rich get richer. The more connected a node in a network is, the more likely it is to get new connections.
 The consequences of such a model are that although the Internet is resistant to random failure because of its many connections and control points, it could be vulnerable to cyberwarfare or terrorism, because important points -- where the connections are richest -- could be successfully targeted.
 Dr. Barabasi said the evolution of the Internet has only strengthened his original scale-free model. ''The Internet as we know it is pretty much vanishing, in the sense that much of the traffic is being routed through lots of new layers and applications, much of it wireless,'' said Dr. Barabasi, a physicist who is now the director of Northeastern University's Center for Network Science. ''Much of the traffic is shifting to providers who have large amounts of traffic, and that is exactly the characteristic of a scale-free distribution.''
 In other words, the more the Internet changes, the more it stays the same, in terms of its overall shape, strengths and vulnerabilities. 
 Other researchers say changes in the Internet have been more fundamental. In 2005, and again last year, Walter Willinger, a mathematician at AT&T Labs, David Alderson, an operations research scientist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif., and John C. Doyle, an electrical engineer at California Institute of Technology, criticized the scale-free model as an overly narrow interpretation of the nature of modern computer networks.
 They argued that the mathematical description of a network as a graph of lines and nodes vastly oversimplifies the reality of the Internet. The real-world Internet, they said, is not a simple scale-free model. Instead, they offered an alternate description that they described as an H.O.T. network, or Highly optimized/Organized tolerance/Trade-offs. The Internet is an example of what they called ''organized complexity.'' Their model is meant to represent the trade-offs made by engineers who design networks by connecting computer routers. In such systems, both economic and technological trade-offs play an important role. The result is a ''robust yet fragile'' network that they said was far more resilient than the network described by Dr. Barabasi and colleagues. 
 For example, they noted that Google has in recent years built its own global cloud of computers that is highly redundant and distributed around the world. This degree of separation means that Google is insulated to some extent from problems of the broader Internet. Dr. Alderson and Dr. Doyle said that another consequence of this private cloud was that even if Google were to fail, it would have little impact on the overall Internet. So, as the data flood has carved many new channels, the Internet has become stronger and more resistant to random failure and attack.
 The scale-free theorists, Dr. Alderson said, are just not describing the real Internet. ''What they're measuring is not the physical network, its some virtual abstraction that's on top of it,'' he said. ''What does the virtual connectivity tell you about the underlying physical vulnerability? My argument would be that it doesn't tell you anything.''

HEADLINE: Brecht's Test of Devotion, Set Amid Modern Warfare

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Bertolt Brecht, that famous game changer of the 20th-century theater, often seems to be more honored in theory than in practice, at least in America. This German playwright, poet and thinker fills a fat chapter in any academic history of drama, and his staging innovations have influenced writers and directors too numerous to mention. Certainly no one would dispute his right to his own adjective. 
 But first-tier productions of his plays don't come along often. Their complexity of tone and structure ideally requires both serious resources and sophisticated artistry. Under its artistic director, Carey Perloff, the American Conservatory Theater here has been active in keeping Brecht's work before the public.
This new production of ''The Caucasian Chalk Circle,'' Brecht's play about corruption, compassion and survival amid the chaos of war, is the company's third Brecht staging in fewer than a dozen years, following ''The Threepenny Opera'' and ''Happy End.'' To design and direct the production, Ms. Perloff has enlisted the talented John Doyle, the Tony-winning British director known for his stark productions of Stephen Sondheim musicals. 
 Mr. Doyle's minimalist reinterpretations of ''Sweeney Todd'' and ''Company,'' which infused theatrical economy with a ferocious vitality, were often described as Brechtian. Employing actors who doubled as the orchestra, so that we remained aware of them as fully engaged creators of the show, not just interpreters of character, he heightened the theatricality of Mr. Sondheim's musicals without diminishing their potency. 
 Mr. Doyle's impressive if problematic ''Caucasian Chalk Circle'' almost out-Brechts Brecht in its accentuation of the play as dramatic artifact, and the actor as a creative worker more than a representative of character. Just nine actors portray the dozens of roles in this play, which is performed in a crisp, colloquial new translation by Domenique Lozano, and features haunting original music by a local composer, Nathaniel Stookey. Here, too, the actors make the music, with the terrific Manoel Felciano leading the charge as the Singer who narrates and annotates the story, often accompanying himself on a bruised-looking guitar, or plucking at the strings of a violin. 
 Eliminating the prologue, a Soviet-set discussion of the ethics of land use that is often excised, Mr. Doyle places Brecht's dovetailing stories of endurance in an unspecified contemporary context. The governor's wife, a grasping materialist who inadvertently leaves behind her baby boy when civil unrest breaks out, is portrayed (deliciously) by Rene Augesen as a nouveau riche vulgarian, or one of the ''Real Housewives of New York City.'' But some of the men's costuming strongly suggests the Arab world, the current locus of much global conflict. In the second act the oily, cynical Azdak (Jack Willis) makes a sour reference to ''change we can believe in.'' 
 Omoze Idehenre portrays the servant Grusha, the central character in the play's first half, whose caring for the abandoned child represents humanity's dormant but inextinguishable compassion, which often must be coaxed out by the force of circumstance -- the same power that more often encourages brutality and selfishness. (''Terrible is the temptation to be good,'' the Singer wryly comments.) 
 In the second half the focus moves to the wily survivor Azdak, played by Mr. Willis as a carnival barker or talk show host. He sometimes roams the aisles with a microphone, as Azdak recounts and re-enacts his experience during the civil unrest. His compassion made an unexpected appearance when sheer orneriness inspired him to hide from the new authorities a man who later turns out to be a grand duke. This dearly regretted act paradoxically secures his role as the judge presiding over a trial to decide whether Grusha or the governor's wife is the ''true'' mother of the child. (The play, inspired by an ancient Chinese drama, turns on the same kind of test that figures in the biblical tale of King Solomon.) 
 Mr. Doyle's cast excels at underlining the mordant comic aspects of Brecht's play, creating sharp, detailed portraits that sometimes edge toward the cartoonish. But as the story grows more diffuse and complicated in the second act, Mr. Doyle's presentational approach -- much of the dialogue is directed at the audience, often with the actors ranged across the front of the stage -- begins to drain the play of theatrical energy and sometimes obscures the narrative too.
 Mr. Doyle's stark, grungy design uses just a few props -- trunks, paint-splattered linen curtains -- for myriad settings, but too many scenes are merely indicated or suggested, not fully staged. As a result, they rarely evoke a palpable reality. (The all-over-the-place costumes don't help.) Brecht's theater was a reaction against naturalism, but his plays have no force if they do not bring us into a confrontation with the brute truths of human behavior. We need to witness them -- with intellectual distance, yes -- not simply attend a dramatized lecture.
 ''The Caucasian Chalk Circle,'' written during Brecht's last major phase, when he was in California in the 1940s, is in some ways among his more accessible works, turning as it does on the emotionally powerful story of an imperiled child and a woman who sacrifices her happiness to safeguard his. (Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' is a more scabrously dark story of maternal devotion.) In what strikes me as a crucial miscalculation, a pillow is used to symbolize the baby whose fate is at stake. 
 Brecht espoused the use of well-worn, specific props -- a knife is a knife, a table a table, a chair a chair. There is something arbitrary, lightweight and almost comic about employing a pillow to represent a child. In the climactic scene, in which the governor's wife and Grusha are told to each take one of the child's arms and yank him from the circle, they look a little ridiculous. We are not just kept at an appraising distance from this grippingly theatrical, powerfully emotional moment, but thrown outside of it entirely.

HEADLINE: State Proposes Closing 55 Parks and Historic Sites

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Facing historic financial pressures, New York State has identified 41 state parks that it plans to close, along with 14 historic sites, and late last week it began notifying people who had secured campsites in 12 of the parks that their reservations were being canceled. 
 The move to refund campers' reservation fees was perhaps the strongest sign that the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation was not engaging in budgetary brinksmanship in announcing last month that it would shutter nearly a quarter of the state parks and almost half of its historic sites. The agency's proposed closings, along with a spate of service reductions, followed Gov. David A. Paterson's $20 million cut to the parks budget.
 ''It's the first time ever that parks will have closed in New York State due to budget constraints,'' said Robin Dropkin, executive director of Parks and Trails New York, an advocacy group based in Albany. ''Even during the Great Depression parks remained open. They're sending back reservation money, so that's a pretty good sign that they're not crying wolf.''
 The proposed closings are spread around the state, from Long Island, where six parks, including Orient Beach and Cold Spring Harbor State Park, are on the target list, to the Thousand Islands region, where another six are identified. In addition, there are numerous planned service cuts: At Riverbank State Park in Manhattan, operating hours would be reduced and one of two pools would not open this summer. Among the historic sites slated to close is Philipse Manor Hall, a Revolution-era site in Yonkers.
 It was unclear whether the public would still have access to some of the parks if they closed. Eileen Larrabee, a spokeswoman for the parks agency, said closing parks meant that the state would simply stop spending on them, for upkeep, security and the like. Safety concerns could prompt officials to close gates or post ''keep out'' signs.
 ''We're in the process of going to each of our facilities and determining what a park closure is going to mean,'' she said.
 The agency has already absorbed significant cuts in the last three years and during the peak summer months has a skeletal staff in place inside the state parks. ''It's not an agency that's been dripping with dollars,'' Ms. Dropkin said. ''They were pretty lean to begin with. They do their best, but the infrastructure is really crumbling. They keep the bathroom doors together with duct tape.''
 Ms. Larrabee said the selection of parks to be closed was based on revenue, operating costs and number of visitors. The dozen parks for which camping reservation fees are being refunded by the parks department offer a total of 450 campsites. By contrast, the entire system has 8,355 campsites. But interest in camping usually rises during economic recessions, as families look for cheaper vacation alternatives.
 ''I'm disappointed to see that they are taking steps so final as to cancel campsite reservations,'' said Gary S. DeYoung, director of tourism at the 1000 Islands International Tourism Council. ''I thought it was like anything else in the budget right now -- that it was the governor's proposal and until the Legislature weighed in, it wasn't final.''

HEADLINE: Charges Upon Charges

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
A recent search for a flight from New York to London turned up an eye-catching fare: $229 each way on several airlines. But nine government taxes and fees added $162 -- more than a quarter of the total ticket price.
 Baggage fees may be the cause of more grumbling among passengers, but airlines are trying to draw attention to other charges lurking in the fine print: all the taxes and fees that go toward airport projects, air traffic control, airport security, customs inspections and, in some cases, projects that have nothing to do with flying -- like a French ''solidarity tax'' on departing passengers that is meant to subsidize purchases of drugs to fight diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries. 
 Most of these taxes are small individually, but they can add up to a significant share of the price of a ticket, particularly for international flights. While there is some debate about precisely how much ticket taxes have risen in recent years, airline representatives say that governments are increasingly turning to travelers to raise revenue in lean times, and that there is little oversight over how the money is spent. 
 ''We are taxed entirely too much,'' said David A. Castelveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group that has been battling efforts to add or increase air travel taxes. ''We can't have outside organizations reaching out for more when the airline industry is losing billions of dollars. There just has to be some other way to fund these programs people want to introduce.''
 For travel within the United States, there are four basic taxes on airfares: a passenger ticket tax (7.5 percent of the base fare); a flight segment tax ($3.70 a flight); a passenger facility charge (up to $4.50 a segment); and a federal security fee, also called the Sept. 11 fee ($2.50 a segment). The first two taxes go to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which finances the Federal Aviation Administration; passenger facility charges are passed on to airports; and security fees finance the Transportation Security Administration.
 Carriers have been lobbying against proposals to increase these fees. One proposal would raise the maximum passenger facility charge that airports can collect to $7 from the current $4.50 per flight segment (still on the table). Another would increase the $2.50 federal security fee (budgeted to go up by $1 a flight in 2012). And a third would raise by 50 cents the $5 animal and plant health inspection fee paid by passengers arriving in the United States (an idea withdrawn last year). Although some of these taxes have risen in the last decade, it is tough to calculate precisely how much the overall tax burden has changed. Airline representatives say taxes and fees account for 25 percent of a domestic ticket price, but according to two professors who have examined millions of ticket records from 1993 to 2008, the effective tax rate has increased only 11 percent to 16 percent of the average domestic fare in that time.
 ''What's happened is airfares have become cheaper, so proportionately taxes have gone up,'' said Joakim Karlsson, a professor of aviation policy at Daniel Webster College, who heads the project with Amedeo R. Odoni, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In fact, their analysis found that the total tax on a domestic ticket has been relatively constant since 1993: about $52, adjusted for inflation. 
 But averages can be misleading because some taxes are a percentage of the base fare, which varies widely, and some are based on the number of flight segments, so passengers with connections pay more than those who fly nonstop. 
 International travelers are even more likely to feel the tax collectors' pinch, as governments around the world have increased passenger fees to pay for security, airport improvements, customs inspections, tourism promotions and environmental concerns -- though critics say many of these taxes end up in general treasury accounts.
 Exhibit A in that regard is Britain's Air Passenger Duty, which went up last year and is scheduled to increase again this fall. This fee varies based on the passenger's class of service and destination; from London to New York, it is $:45 in economy class and $:60 in premium cabins, and will rise to $:90 ($137) and $:120 ($183), respectively, on Nov. 1. 
 ''The Air Passenger Duty is supposedly an environmental tax, but all these taxes go into the treasury,'' said Brian Pearce, chief economist for the International Air Transport Association, adding that France's solidarity tax -- 1 euro to 40 euros a passenger -- meets a similarly murky end.
 ''We fear there are going to be more taxes coming down the road as governments look to reduce budget deficits,'' he said. ''It's contagious.''
 The United States is not immune to the bug. Congress just passed legislation that will charge foreigners, from about three dozen countries, who do not need visas $10 to enter the United States. The money will be used to promote travel to America, an idea that has been criticized abroad.
 Kenneth J. Button, a professor of transportation policy at George Mason University, said airlines are vulnerable conduits for these types of taxes because air travel was once considered a luxury, creating the perception that passengers have deep pockets. And putting the fees on airline tickets, he said, makes them easier to collect.
 Professor Button, who has done consulting work for the Air Transport Association, said the problem with many of these taxes is that there is little accountability on how the money is used, with airports, the T.S.A. and the F.A.A. all subject to criticism over wasteful or ineffective spending.
 ''I would argue these taxes are too high simply because there's no incentive for providers to keep their costs low,'' Professor Button said.
 But airport representatives counter that the $4.50 limit on the passenger facility charge has not increased since 2001 and that the money is used to build new runways, improve terminals, reduce noise and other projects -- all of which go through a review process that includes the airlines.
 ''Ninety-five percent of the requests that go to the F.A.A. are done with the approval of the airlines,'' said Jane Calderwood, vice president for government and political affairs at the Airports Council International-North America, which supports increasing the cap on the facility charge to $7.50 and indexing it for inflation.
 Another objection to the current tax structure, raised by the National Business Travel Association, is that taxes and fees paid on nonrefundable tickets are not always refunded if a ticket is not used.
 The group has asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate this issue, arguing that the government and airport authorities should refund the fees if a trip is canceled. 
 ''Who's responsible for getting those taxes back?'' said Shane Downey, the business travel association's director for public policy. ''There's talk that there's quite a lot of money being lost.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2010

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on the Itineraries pages on Tuesday about the increase in the price of airline tickets because of government fees and taxes misstated the increase in the effective tax rate from 1993 to 2008. A study showed that it increased to 16 percent of the average fare in 2008, from 11 percent in 1993; it did not increase by 11 percent. The article also misstated some figures on the Air Passenger Duty in Britain and the increase to take effect on Nov. 1. The current duty is $:45 in economy class, which will rise to $:60, not $:90, on Nov. 1. The current duty in premium cabins is $:90, not $:60, and that fee will rise to $:120 on Nov. 1.

HEADLINE: Modest Gains Reported In Income and Spending

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Paychecks are scarcer, consumer confidence is weak and the amount of household debt continues to grow. But even in the face of those pressures, spending by consumers rose modestly in January, the government said on Monday, as Americans reduced their savings rate.
 While January was the fourth consecutive month that consumer spending increased, so far the growth has been far short of the surge needed to lead the economy out of its downturn. 
 Instead, economists are looking for momentum from sectors like manufacturing, which continued to expand in February, according to a report released on Monday by a private group. The report indicated that the fast-paced recovery for manufacturing slowed slightly in February amid fewer orders, though hiring reached its highest level in five years. 
 With the government set to release its monthly employment snapshot on Friday, the jump in hiring raised hopes for the labor market, where the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent.
 Crucial sectors like construction continue to shed jobs. In January, the outlook for builders remained grim: construction spending fell 0.6 percent from December, according to a separate government report on Monday, though home construction gained 1.1 percent, also from December.
 Much of the drop came after a pullback in nonresidential building, which fell 1.4 percent as the commercial real estate market faced loan defaults, a dearth of eager financiers and rising vacancy rates. 
 Once unemployment eases, economists believe that consumer spending will come out of the doldrums. Until then, gains in spending will be muted, they predict.
 In January, spending rose 0.5 percent, the Commerce Department said, while incomes rose less than expected, by 0.1 percent. That led to a savings rate of 3.3 percent in January, the lowest since 2008.
 At the height of the economic crisis, the savings rate climbed as Americans became nervous about debt and employment prospects. That was a sharp departure from the carefree spending that for decades kept the savings rate low. The rate has since retreated, but economists believe it may rise yet again.
 ''This, of course, is unsustainable in a world with less debt and fewer jobs,'' Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, wrote in a research note.
 Paul Ashworth, senior economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, said the data indicated a ''solid, if not spectacular'' start to the first quarter of 2010, but he said economists remain concerned about the tepid growth in wages.
 ''Income needs to be rising faster,'' Mr. Ashworth said. ''This points to fairly lackluster prospects for spending.''
 A closely watched consumer price index remained flat in January, though it rose 1.4 percent compared with January 2009, the report said. That increase was largely in line with expectations and did not appear to stoke fears about inflation. Other barometers of inflation in recent weeks have been similarly tame. 
 Manufacturing expanded for a seventh month in February, coming in at 56.5 on the Institute for Supply Management's monthly barometer. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. 
 Growth in the sector slowed modestly in February, falling from a five-year high of 58.4 in January. Both production and new orders declined, with demand still weak. Unusually bad weather also played a role, economists said. 
 Employment, however, showed new momentum, reaching the highest level in five years.
 ''Manufacturers are seemingly willing to hire where they have orders to support higher employment,'' the report said.
 Eleven industries reported growth, from computer makers to manufacturers of machinery. Five industries reported contraction, including wood producers and chemical makers. 
 As foreign businesses expand, manufacturing will most likely benefit from a surge in exports, said Edward F. McKelvey, senior economist for Goldman Sachs.
 ''We're not talking about industrial output falling, we're just talking about a slowdown,'' Mr. McKelvey said. 
 ''The prospects for manufacturing are still pretty good.''

HEADLINE: Selling an Olympian Takes More Than Gold

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
For Lindsey Vonn, Apolo Ohno and Shaun White, winning medals at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver is their ticket to future endorsements. Their success, good looks and compelling stories should help them add to their growing stable of sponsorship deals with a variety of companies, marketing experts say.
 But the vast majority of Olympic athletes -- even those who won medals -- will have a harder time cashing in on their appearances at the Games. Winter sports like speedskating and bobsledding will all but disappear from the airwaves and, for many Americans, interest in them will not grow again until the next Winter Olympics in 2014. 
 Olympic athletes also have to compete with well-established superstars in more popular sports like Derek Jeter, LeBron James and Peyton Manning. Companies also tend to favor athletes who win gold medals over those who win silver and bronze medals, regardless of the athlete's back story.
 Critically, the scandals involving Tiger Woods and Michael Phelps have made companies skittish about endorsing individual athletes, even successful Olympians. Some companies are sponsoring teams or leagues instead, while others are spending less on sports altogether. Everyone is thinking twice before signing deals, especially in this weak economy.
 ''After Tiger Woods, there's been a lot of restraint right now among marketers,'' said Bill Duffy, the chairman of BDA Sports Management, which represents professional basketball players like Steve Nash and Yao Ming. ''Honestly, many winter Olympians are not prominent enough to go mainstream.''
 Still, landing a multiyear deal from a national brand is not the only way for an athlete to cash in on his or her fame. Some athletes give motivational speeches and write books. Others endorse less visible products like vitamins, sports equipment or medical causes. Athletes in events like the snowboarding halfpipe may win deals from video-game makers.
 Here is a partial list of the athletes who marketing experts say could win endorsement deals and who may resurface before 2014.
 Steven Holcomb: The pilot of USA-1's four-man bobsled crew who helped the United States win a gold medal in the event for the first time in 62 years. Burly and affable, Holcomb looks as if he has spent some time on a barstool, which makes him a strong candidate for a beer commercial, marketers say. He has an inspiring story, having nearly gone blind after battling keratoconus, a degenerative eye disease. The downside, marketers say, is that he was part of a four-man team and bobsledding is an obscure sport.
 Evan Lysacek: The first American male figure skater to win a gold medal since Brian Boitano in 1988. Lysacek, 24, edged out Russia's Yevgeny Plushenko, the defending Olympic champion, who later took shots at Lysacek, a story line that marketers could mine. He also has sex appeal, said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director at Baker Street Advertising, which makes him a candidate for advertisements including colognes, shampoos and ''any product served over ice.''
 Julia Mancuso: She won two silver medals in Alpine skiing, yet lived in the shadow of Vonn. She created a stir when she said the intense interest in Vonn was hurting the team. The drama that followed -- Is Julia friends with Lindsey? -- thrust her into the spotlight and, marketers say, could help her land a deal with a national brand.
 J.R. Celski: He surprised many observers by winning a bronze medal in short-track speedskating after slicing open his leg late last year. Celski had the advantage of racing alongside Ohno in several events, increasing his exposure. Alas, with speedskaters, ''it's Apolo all the time,'' said Matt Delzell, a group account director at Davie Brown Entertainment, which represents companies in celebrity endorsement negotiations.
 Rachael Flatt and Mirai Nagasu: Neither teenager won a medal in figure skating, but both planted the seeds for future exposure at the 2014 Winter Games. Flatt, in particular, won kudos for doing her homework during the Olympics, music to every teacher's ears.
 Johnny Spillane: The American won two individual silver medals in the Nordic combined, which includes ski jumping and cross-country skiing, including the first medal for the United States in the event. Given the sport's obscurity, he may not win an endorsement deal from a national brand. But he could garner interest from smaller companies. ''If an athlete wins a medal in a less significant event like Nordic combined, it's going to be harder to get on Leno or Regis,'' said Peter Carlisle, the managing director for Olympics and Action Sports at Octagon. ''But there are regional and local deals. It's about reasonable expectations.''

HEADLINE: A Country Basks in the Glow Of a Hockey Gold

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 ''For Canada's Faithful, a Gold That Means Most,'' March 1, captured the true and exact feeling of Canadians. John Branch has explained, as only a good and close neighbor could, the importance of our national sport. Strange in a way that this should come from one of our greatest rivals.
 Al Neill
 Ottawa 
 To the Sports Editor:
 You captured our feelings toward the win of our game so well. It brought tears to my eyes and I felt the need to share with our American friends how much we appreciate such kind respect.
 Daniel Bond
 Victoria, British Columbia
 To the Sports Editor:
 Americans, like the game of hockey itself, have trouble understanding the intricacies of the more recent international history of the game. Yes, it's true, Canada went 50 years without winning an Olympic hockey gold medal, but it wasn't because the game was ''slowly slipping away'' from us. There was the issue of top Communist national teams under the guise they weren't professionals playing our amateur kids. In response, there were several Winter Olympics Canada refused to participate in hockey at all.
 Sunday's game will most likely make the top 10 moments of Canada's international hockey history, but hardly stands alone in a nation with so many past heroes and great international hockey moments.
 Sam Kocsis
 Calgary, Alberta 
 To the Sports Editor:
 A thanks for your lovely story on Canadian hockey and what it means to us -- from a Canadian over the moon with our win Sunday night. This was a truly lovely and friendly piece that touched my heart. It also reminds me of how gracious Americans can be. It could have been anyone's game: your guys played awesomely and your goaltender is the best in the world right now. Thanks for being part of our great hockey memory. It means so much to us when our ''big brother'' takes note and celebrates with us.
 Alberta Pos
 Toronto
 To the Sports Editor:
 Some players on the United States team, notably Ryan Kesler, strongly resent our reference to hockey as ''our game,'' but they are missing the point. As this article makes clear, there is simply nowhere else in the world where hockey is so much a part of its national identity. It does not mean that we expect or deserve to win every international contest, though that would be nice, but that such contests mean so much to us. And, yes, to our detriment we sometimes place too much emphasis on winning. C'est la vie.
 Paul Peterson
 Winnipeg, Manitoba
 To the Sports Editor:
 I watched this gold medal game today. As a Canadian, I cannot find words right now to describe how incredible this hockey was. Only the USA and Canada could play a game of hockey like this. This was a game for the history books. Remember to heap praise on this American hockey team. Thank these boys for playing hockey the way it's supposed to be played: fast and rough and without table manners. Remember to tell these American hockey players that you are proud of them. They play North American-style hockey, the hockey we Canadians play on the beaver ponds and flooded fields and outdoor rinks up here, not the wimpy, whiny, cry-to-the-ref European style, which doesn't even deserve to be played on North American rinks. This was the best game of hockey I have ever watched. And I've seen a lot of them. This is beyond Stanley Cup hockey. This is as good as it gets. Thank you, United States Olympic hockey team, for being exactly half the reason this game was so exciting. And although you didn't win the gold, you are quite worthy of that medal, believe me. Hold your heads high, lads.

 To the Sports Editor:
 Andrew C. Holman's assertion that baseball in America ''isn't anywhere near the cultural significance of hockey to Canadians'' ignores the profound impact baseball had on integrating the United States. Jackie Robinson's entry into baseball in 1947 helped end segregation not only in baseball but in American society. Baseball's later embrace of Latin-American and Asian players had a similar effect on transforming America into a multicultural society.

 To the Sports Editor:
 I was lucky enough to watch greatness at age 6 or 7 when Dad took me to watch Bobby Orr who was only 15 or 16. I've heard similar stories from guys who saw a young Bobby Hull at the Gardens in the early '60s, and we all know about Gretzky and Lemieux. Last night, I had the same feeling at the end of the game about Crosby. It punctuated an experience I had about four years ago. I made a point of driving to Buffalo to watch a rookie 18-year-old named Sidney Crosby dominate a very good Buffalo Sabres team. We all agreed that this guy was the best player in that game (at 18!). I remember coming back and raving about him. At the time, Scotty Bowman said Crosby reminded him of a young Rocket Richard. I'm sure Crosby and his fans were honoured. Now Rocket Richard fans are honoured too. 
 After the game I took my daughter to the Toronto bus terminal because she was returning to Montreal. We were overwhelmed by the exuberance of the spontaneous downtown celebration that caused authorities to close off Yonge Street. Canadians from all backgrounds were there to celebrate. We almost missed the bus because of the detours but I felt honoured (with a ''u'') -- occasionally honking my horn to the cheers of revelers who yelled back with notes of approval. I just wish hockey could be more like that more often. Don't ''u''?

 A New Medal Count
 To the Sports Editor:
 Americans feeling proud of their position at the top of the ranks of Winter Olympics medal winners (''A Map of Olympic Medals,'' March 1) would do well to look at the statistics in some different ways.
 Norway, with just a sixtieth of the United States population, managed to win as many gold medals. Indeed, in total medals per hundred million population, the United States (with 12) ranks 20th, far behind Austria (191) and Sweden (118), and all are put to shame by the mighty Norwegians (473!). 
 Things look no better when wealth is considered. Latvia (with 587 per 10 trillion dollars of gross domestic product), Slovenia (549) and Norway (509) come out tops, while the United States (26) trails in 22nd place, right after Australia (30) and just before China (25).
 The fact is our youth are among the laziest in the world. It is only a tiny sliver of the population who become everyday athletes, let alone world champions. The rest of us just watch the show on TV, munching our chips and guzzling our beers.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Fights Crime at Up to $6,000 a Dog

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
You've heard of the Six Million Dollar Man. How about the Six Thousand Dollar Dog?
 That is how much the Metropolitan Transportation Authority pays for each of its elite, highly trained, bomb-sniffing, crime-fighting German shepherds. 
 The dogs travel around the mass transit system with a police officer companion, checking out unattended packages and chasing down criminals. Something tells us they would eat Westminster's Sadie for dessert.
 The transportation authority police, who patrol the region's buses and rails, have 45 of the dogs (a few Labrador retrievers are in there, too). The New York Police Department has 86 dogs, and the Port Authority police keep 46 on hand, officials said.
 ''They're the best technology that's out there, and they're worth every penny,'' said William A. Morange, the transportation authority's director of security.
 Last month, the authority's board approved the purchase of six additional dogs at a cost of $35,800 (some training included). The dogs, which will replace older dogs ''that have been retired due to age and health issues,'' were bought from Connecticut Canine Services, a training center with dozens of municipal clients along the Eastern Seaboard.
 The transportation authority negotiated a cost of $6,000 for each male German shepherd and $5,800 for each female. According to materials published last month, that was a discount from the standard list price of $6,500.
 Dog prices, however, are going up -- even in this economy. The last batch of male German shepherds bought by the authority, in September 2008, cost $500 apiece less. The females were cheaper by $300.
 Still, officials argued that the more expensive prices were still lower than those paid by other law enforcement agencies, including police departments in New Jersey and New York State. (''Unit costs of canines that are trainable for explosive and bomb detection patrol range from $6,800 to $7,000,'' according to the authority.)
 Each German shepherd undergoes three months of rigorous training with the officer with whom it will be working. The last sessions took place this fall at the Orange County sheriff's office.
 The Web site of Connecticut Canine Services advertises ''police dogs, personal protection dogs, boarding and training.'' It also features more than a dozen delightful pictures of smiling German shepherds just waiting to be your fuzzy companion or possibly to detect an incendiary device under a ticket window.
 The transportation authority's canine crew was in the news as recently as Friday, when a suspicious package was discovered at the 125th Street Metro-North train station.
 A German shepherd working with the transit police sniffed the package and ''reacted in such a way that the officers deemed the package to be a problem,'' said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the transportation authority. Live shotgun shells and a firecracker four inches long were later discovered in the package, although law enforcement officials said there was never any danger of its being detonated.
 It was not clear whether the dog in question was new on the job.

HEADLINE: On Primary Eve, Texas Race Seems Close No More

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Rachel Marcus contributed reporting from Houston

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- It was supposed to be a clash of Republican titans -- a vulnerable right-wing governor against a popular and more moderate United States senator -- but as voters in Texas go to the polls Tuesday, the governor's race looks anything but close, and Gov. Rick Perry has a hefty advantage in the polls.
 The three Republican candidates and two Democrats made their final tours of the state on Monday, hammering home their themes. 
 Mr. Perry, who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term, continued to portray his main opponent, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, as a creature of Washington addicted to pork-barrel spending. 
 As he has for weeks now, Mr. Perry also promoted the Texas economy, with its low taxes and relatively low unemployment rate, as a model for other states. His appeal to pride in Texas has resonated with conservative voters, political scientists say.
 ''We're adding to the state population by over 1,000 people per day,'' the governor said to about 100 people packed into the Harris County Republican Party headquarters in Houston. ''People are voting, and they're voting with their feet and coming to Texas.''
 Across town, at a downtown shopping mall, Ms. Hutchison shook hands with shoppers and passed out palm cards. Shifting her emphasis in the last days, she said Mr. Perry had divided the party with his appeals to the far right, losing support for Republicans in urban counties. She also bristled at his portrayal of her as a Washington insider.
 ''It's ridiculous,'' she said. ''Governor Perry knows I fought Obama's stimulus. I fought against the takeover of our health care system.''
 The third Republican candidate, Debra Medina, a staunch conservative who wants to abolish property taxes and opposes abortion in all cases, has struggled to regain momentum after remarks she made last month on Glenn Beck's radio program in which she expressed sympathy for conspiracy theorists who think the United States government was complicit in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 While Ms. Medina appears in recent polls to be above 10 percent, few political strategists give her a chance of winning, though she may force a runoff between Mr. Perry and Ms. Hutchison. Several recent polls show Mr. Perry with 40 percent to 50 percent of the vote, while Ms. Hutchison has 20 percent to 30 percent. 
 On the Democratic side, former Mayor Bill White of Houston appeared to be coasting to an easy victory over his only challenger, Farouk Shami, a businessman who made a fortune in hair-care products.
 Because Republicans have enjoyed a 10-point advantage in most statewide races since the mid-1990s, their primary has attracted the most attention. Ms. Hutchison has outspent Mr. Perry by $2 million on a largely negative campaign accusing him of doing favors for companies that have hired his former aides. 
 Mr. Perry has consistently tarred Ms. Hutchison with the decision by Congress to spend $787 billion on stimulating the economy and to bail out banks, even though she voted against the stimulus bill and the second half of the bank bailout.
 ''Perry has just done everything right,'' said James Henson, a professor of political science at the University of Texas. ''He exploited the environment perfectly well, stayed on message, framed her early, and she has never escaped it. The themes of his campaign spoke so directly to Republican primary voters from Day 1.''
 Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said Mr. Perry's success was all the more surprising since Ms. Hutchison had for years enjoyed higher approval ratings than the governor. 
 ''Her campaign never got traction because, out of the gate, Perry tagged her with Washington and all its ills,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In a Sea of Election Signs, Iraqis Are Awash in Candidates' Gifts

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA; Zaid Thaker contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra, Kirkuk, Babil Province and Diyala Province.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- There are many ways to describe the campaign strategies now being employed in Iraq. Subtle is not one of them.
 Across the country, voters are reaping a windfall as candidates in Sunday's parliamentary elections offer gifts like heating oil and rice. When a candidate recently showed up in a poor village outside Baquba to distribute frozen chickens -- in a literal homage to the political slogan ''a chicken in every pot'' -- so many people rushed to get the free birds that many left disappointed after the supply ran out. 
 In Babil Province, local candidates have imported sports equipment and thousands of running shoes from China for their constituents. In the southern marshes, politicians travel for hours to pass out toys to children, phone cards to adults and blankets to the poor. 
 The practice is hardly a secret. When Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was asked about allegations that he gave tribal leaders pistols, emblazoned with a personal stamp, he openly defended the action. 
 ''Some people criticize me for giving people pistols,'' he said during a meeting with security officials broadcast on television. ''Honestly, I wish I could give a pistol and a rifle to each one who stood beside the government against the gangs to express our appreciation.''
 There are no laws governing how political parties raise and spend money, and while the Americans might have brought democracy to this country, campaigning here is done in a distinctly Iraqi way. 
 For all the outraged speeches, newly created Facebook pages and advertisements on the Arabic satellite channels, Iraqi politics remains an intensely local and personal affair, so much so that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the head of the United States Central Command, has offered a special name for it: Iraqracy. 
 With less than a week until Election Day, the campaign politics are in full bloom. 
 A riot of competing banners and portraits shroud the landscape. Unlike the lawn signs that sprout up on neatly manicured lawns during an American campaign, these reflect the physical state of Iraq today. In all shapes and sizes, they hang from blast walls, dangle from razor wire and jut out of roadside rubble. 
 The jockeying for the best banner locations is so intense that fights have broken out, traffic accidents have increased and volunteers hanging posters have reported being shot at by rivals. 
 An Iraqi campaign is part Tammany Hall and part Bedouin feast, where leaders display their generosity and hospitality by lavishing food and gifts on their constituents. In return, they expect loyalty.
 In fact, there have been so many feasts in the past week that the price of meat has risen as candidates clear out the inventory. One butcher in downtown Baghdad, Muhammad Salal, said the price of sheep meat had gone to $15 per kilogram from $11. 
 To commemorate the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Tariq al-Hashemi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents, held a feast last Friday in the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya. While happy to accept free food, some voters still viewed the overtures cynically.
 ''This is good, try it,'' said Meluk Abdul Wahab, as he ate Mr. Hashemi's cake. But Mr. Wahab was not exactly won over. 
 ''I think I will vote for Hashemi,'' he said with a smile. ''But if someone else gives me something better, I will vote for him. Because after they win the elections, we will never see them or get anything from them. So I don't care. I will vote for whoever gives me more.''
 Most of the gifts from candidates are utilitarian -- blankets for the poor, heating oil, propane tanks, phone cards and food. While residents have reported receiving cash directly, outright bribes are delivered more discreetly.
 Political rallies, the hallmark of an American campaign, are rare, in part because of security concerns. When they are staged, they have a Potemkin village quality. 
 The alliance of Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani held the largest rally in Baghdad to date, with hundreds filling a large outdoor soccer stadium on Saturday. But it was not exactly a show of overwhelming public support. Many in the crowd were police officers employed by Mr. Bolani's ministry. One officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said his battalion had been ordered to attend. 
 The event was as notable for security as it was for political theater. Iraq Army helicopters circled low overhead, American Apaches higher in the sky. Streets were closed in all directions, snipers lined rooftops and each candidate had his own security detail, forming a phalanx around Mr. Bolani's tent, a sea of machine guns and stony stairs. 
 At the end of the rally, doves were released as a symbol of peace. Unfortunately, they were set free just as fireworks burst in the sky, catching many birds in the cross-fire.
 Given the difficulty of pulling off large-scale rallies, candidates mainly appeal directly to their constituents. And business owners have been quick to seize the moment.
 In Babil Province, Ali Hamdan, the director of an import company, said two candidates had asked him to bring in cheap products from China. Mr. Hamdan secured a deal on thousands of running shoes and other sports equipment, which he said the candidates would distribute in poor neighborhoods and villages.
 Riyadh Ali, the director of another import company, said that in response to many requests from candidates, he had ordered four shipping containers full of appliances.
 Voters expect the closing days of the campaign to be the most lucrative, and are keeping their hands out and their options open.
 ''We are still receiving many gifts from the parties,'' said Mohamed Jumah, from Babil. One of the candidates gave his family $100 in cash, while another gave it food and building supplies. ''I have not decided who I will vote for,'' he said.
 Much of the gift-giving is described as charity, with the focus on the poor communities. In a country where unemployment is still rampant and basic services abysmal, the need can quickly outstrip the supplies.
 When a candidate for a Sunni party made a campaign stop in a poor village near Baquba, he handed out rice, flour and oil. He also brought a limited number of frozen chickens. 
 ''The news of free chickens spread everywhere,'' said one resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as taking handouts. The candidate was soon overwhelmed and had to promise to return with more chickens. If he can deliver the chickens, the resident said, ''he could secure dozens more votes among the poor.''
 The gifts do not draw much public outrage, being viewed as part of the campaign. But during a recent meeting with tribal leaders, Ali al-Dabbagh, the government spokesperson, called paying for votes ''a cancer on this society.''
 While acknowledging that many poor people might accept the gifts, he said that their vote remained their own. ''The ballot box will be covered,'' he said. ''Ask your conscience. Ask God.''

HEADLINE: 2,000 Furloughs Linked To Impasse in Congress

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States Department of Transportation said it furloughed 2,000 workers on Monday as a politically charged impasse over unemployment benefits interrupted spending on a handful of federal programs and escalated tensions in Congress.
 With no quick resolution in sight, Democrats characterized the decision by one Republican to block the jobless aid and highway construction financing as an example of the practical consequences of regular opposition by Senate Republicans.
 ''When we talk about the cost of inaction, it is more than just rhetoric,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said as the Senate convened Monday. ''It comes with dire consequences. The Americans who woke up this morning without the benefits they need know that better than anyone else.'' 
 In an effort to end the stalemate, Senator Jim Bunning, the Kentucky Republican who is insisting on a point of parliamentary procedure to block the legislation, offered to lift his objection if an agreement was made to use unspent economic stimulus money to cover the $10 billion cost of the unemployment aid, which would go to those who have already exhausted their benefits. 
 ''We cannot keep adding to the debt,'' Mr. Bunning said Monday. ''It's over $14 trillion and going up fast.''
 But Democrats balked, saying that Republicans had not been concerned about requiring Bush administration initiatives to be paid for and that the unemployment aid amounted to an emergency.
 The loss of highway money could be resolved this week if the House passes a separate $15 billion measure meant to spur job creation, but some of the programs tied up in the Senate blockade, like a cut in Medicare fees paid to doctors, could take a while to disentangle.
 Democrats are compiling state-by-state lists of the impact of the Senate impasse, viewing it as a vivid way to talk about the costs of Republican opposition. 
 Department of Transportation officials said the temporary furlough without pay would primarily affect workers at the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Research and Innovative Technology Administration. Those programs were paid for out of the highway trust fund, which needs to be renewed.
 Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said the furloughs would halt at least 40 major construction projects around the nation because inspectors would be pulled from jobs on federal land.
 ''As American families are struggling in tough economic times, I am keenly disappointed that political games are putting a stop to important construction projects around the country,'' Mr. LaHood said. 
 Besides the highway spending, other programs that expired as of Sunday night included loans for small businesses, the federal flood insurance program, subsidies to help the unemployed buy health insurance and an agreement that allows satellite television services to carry some broadcast channels.
 A law shielding doctors from a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees also lapsed, but the Obama administration took steps to shield doctors temporarily. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it would hold claims for services provided in the first 10 days of this month, so doctors would not see the cut in payments. 
 In a notice to doctors, the Medicare agency said it was working with Congress to avoid disruption in the delivery of health care services and payment of claims. If Congress takes action by March 12, it said, the holding of claims ''should have a minimum impact on provider cash flow.''
 What Mr. Bunning is doing is using his right as a senator to object to a request for unanimous consent to pass the series of program extensions already approved by the House. Democrats could begin the process of bringing the measure to a vote to override his objection, but they say that could consume days and they have already opened debate on a broader economic bill. 
 Mr. Bunning had been acting on his own in blocking the Democratic request to pass the legislation extending the programs for one month while Congress worked on a more permanent solution. But on Monday he drew some support from fellow Republicans who backed his demand that the costs of the programs be covered from unspent economic stimulus funds.
 ''Why pile on the deficit if we have this store of money available?'' asked Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, who suggested that Democrats were eliciting repeated objections from Mr. Bunning to score political points.
 Unless Mr. Bunning relents, it appears that the added unemployment pay will lapse for tens of thousands of people.
 The broader measure the Senate is now considering would extend the added unemployment benefits and health insurance help through the end of the year and renew more than $30 billion in business tax breaks. But it could take days to pass the Senate and then will have to be considered by the House. 
 Mr. Bunning was not happy about the increasing attention he was receiving. ABC News reported that the senator, who was overheard swearing on the Senate floor last week, made a vulgar hand gesture when approached by one of its staff producers about the standoff. 
 Mr. Bunning showed no sign on Monday of changing his position, saying he would not allow Democrats to slip the stopgap measure past him.
 ''I will be here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Backs Rewarding Districts That Police Failing Schools

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama said Monday that he favored federal rewards for local school districts that fire underperforming teachers and close failing schools, saying educators needed to be held accountable when they failed to fix chronically troubled classrooms and curb the student dropout rate.
 The president outlined his proposal to offer $900 million in federal grants, which would be made available to states and school districts willing to take aggressive steps to turn around struggling institutions or close them. 
 The president's proposal, which was included in his 2011 budget request to Congress, is his latest criticism of America's failing public schools. In a speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Obama said federal aid would be available for the districts that are home to the 2,000 schools that produce more than half of the nation's dropouts.
 He spoke alongside former Secretary of State Colin Powell and his wife, Alma, who lead America's Promise Alliance, an advocacy group dedicated to combating the school dropout rate.
 ''We know that the success of every American will be tied more closely than ever before to the level of education that they achieve,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The jobs will go to the people with the knowledge and the skills to do them. It's that simple.''
 He singled out Central Falls High School in Rhode Island, where last week the school board voted to dismiss the entire faculty as part of a turnaround plan for the school, which has a 48 percent graduation rate.
 At Central Falls High, he said, just 7 percent of 11th graders passed state math tests. Mr. Obama said he supported the school board's decision to dismiss the faculty and staff members. ''Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,'' he said.
 The president's comments incensed the leadership of the American Federation of Teachers, which criticized Mr. Obama for ''condoning the mass firing'' of teachers at the Rhode Island school. 
 ''We know it is tempting for people in Washington to score political points by scapegoating teachers, but it does nothing to give our students and teachers the tools they need to succeed,'' the president of the union, Randi Weingarten, said in a statement. 
 In their efforts to overhaul failing public schools, Mr. Obama and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have frequently drawn the ire of teachers' unions.
 In his speech on Monday, Mr. Obama said states would be asked to identify schools that perform at persistently low levels, with graduation rates of 60 percent or less.
 To qualify for the federal money, known as School Turnaround Grants, he said, the school districts must agree to take at least one of the steps: firing the principal and at least half the staff of a troubled school; reopening it as a charter school; or closing the school altogether and transferring students to better schools in the district.
 ''If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year,'' Mr. Obama said, ''if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability.''
 The $900 million grant program, which would be subject to Congressional approval, follows $3.5 billion included in last year's economic stimulus plan that also was aimed at improving school performance and lowering the dropout rate. The program would support interventions at 5,000 of the nation's lowest-performing schools over the next five years.
 Mr. Obama is seeking to use federal money as an incentive for local schools to improve their standards. The initiatives his administration is pursuing are similar to those of the Bush administration. At the event on Monday, Mr. Obama recognized Margaret Spellings, a secretary of education under President George W. Bush, who was seated in the front row.
 Mr. Obama said he was particularly troubled by the dropout rate. He said 1.2 million students left school each year before graduating from high school, at a cost to the nation of $319 billion annually in potential earning losses.
 ''Now it's true that not long ago you could drop out of high school and reasonably expect to find a blue-collar job that would pay the bills and help support your family,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's just not the case anymore.''
 The Powells, who founded America's Promise Alliance in 1997, announced on Monday a 10-year campaign called ''Grad Nation'' directed at the lowest performing high schools in the country and focusing on improving graduation rates and preparations for college.
 ''We've got to catch our kids long before they drop out,'' Mr. Powell said.

HEADLINE: Sand Trap Of His Own Making

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
A once formidable professional golfer, brought low by personal scandals, lets a camera follow him around during a rocky comeback attempt in a futile effort to make himself an object of sympathy. A glimpse of Tiger Woods's future? Maybe, but it's actually ''Being John Daly,'' a reality show that has its debut Tuesday on the Golf Channel. 
 Mr. Daly was unknown when he won the P.G.A. Championship in 1991 at 25, but soon his successes on the golf course were overshadowed by marital troubles, alcohol troubles, gambling troubles and weight troubles. He hasn't been a factor on the PGA Tour for years, a decline that was entirely his own fault, and why anyone would root for him to have a successful comeback is never clear in this rather haphazardly organized show. Mostly you may find yourself rooting for him to shut up, especially when, during these hard economic times, he whines about his version of adversity, like having to sell his two Hummers. 
 The show doesn't seem as if it planned to go into Mr. Daly's past in any kind of depth, instead being content to present him as some kind of oracle: lots of slow-motion shots of him turning his head, exhaling cigarette smoke and so on. The wisdom this oracle dispenses is dubious at best. For instance, ''That's all life is: overcoming the mistakes.'' 
 The show is also constantly floating the ludicrous notion that the life of a golfer is physically draining. ''I just didn't have the energy,'' Mr. Daly says at one point, explaining his lousy play in one tournament. Poor guy. Another time the narrator intones, ''After receiving the Sony Open exemption'' -- allowing Mr. Daly to play in that tournament -- ''next came the painstaking process of packing for the long trip to Hawaii.'' How can one man endure so much hardship?
 Mr. Daly begins his comeback attempt by losing almost 100 pounds the surgical way. And that allows him to do a decent job in his most important function in this show: modeling the Loudmouth brand of golf pants, which he represents. These pants, with outrageous patterns and colors, resemble something you might have found at the Bozo the Clown estate sale. Seeing which pair Mr. Daly will turn up in next is the biggest draw in this show.

HEADLINE: Ways to Respond to Climate Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''We Can't Wish Away Climate Change'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 28):
 Al Gore's thoughtful advocacy for meaningful action on climate change will no doubt bring the climate change ''skeptics'' out of the woodwork once again.
 Our inability to address the climate crisis is both an intellectual and a moral failure. In the 1950s, Sputnik threatened our national pride -- and America responded with an intensified focus on science education, building a space program that accomplished wonders. 
 Fifty years later, the threat we face is not to our pride, but to our planet -- and we respond by ridiculing those who sound the warning. Mr. Gore deserves the thanks of future generations, not uninformed mockery.
 Warren Senders Medford, Mass., Feb. 28, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Al Gore's attempt to sweep ''two mistakes'' by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change under the carpet provoked a wry smile; no mention of the nine major factual errors that a British high court judge noted in a case challenging the showing of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' in schools.
 The sad fact is that these mistakes do matter, and they are not isolated. I.P.C.C. collaborators have been voicing their concern that there is too much pressure to simplify and exaggerate their work and to ignore their doubts. Bottom line: We know that the climate changes, but we are not sure why nor what is short term and what is long term.
 By pushing an alarmist stance to promote huge expenditures at a time of deep recession, Mr. Gore is undermining the case for much-needed but more mundane work. We do need to improve our use of natural resources, clean our water, restore land and forests, and move sensibly to better energy use. Smaller, more local initiatives will get support and will have positive results.
 By swinging for the fences, we are missing the singles and doubles. 
 The more Mr. Gore huffs and puffs and the corrections roll in, the more I hear the catch phrase from ''Saturday Night Live'': ''Never mind.''
 Simon Noble Larchmont, N.Y., Feb. 28, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Al Gore's Op-Ed article was a thoughtful contribution to the frenzied discussion under way on climate change. He went right to the heart of the matter with his comment: ''Though there have been impressive efforts by many business leaders, hundreds of millions of individuals and families throughout the world and many national, regional and local governments, our civilization is still failing miserably to slow the rate at which these emissions are increasing -- much less reduce them.'' 
 Future generations may well be less kind in their assessment of our failure to act.
 Thomas F. Malone West Hartford, Conn., Feb. 28, 2010
 The writer is former president of the American Meteorological Society and former foreign secretary of the National Academy of Sciences.
 To the Editor: 
 Al Gore makes a cogent argument. What is distressing to me is the attempt to combine what are two completely separate issues.
 The first is whether the earth is warming or cooling, or neither. The second is whether the human race is substantially contributing to this effect.
 Mr. Gore's point is well taken that climate change in and of itself is here to stay (and, as theorized, has always been a fact of life on this planet). But the ''mistakes'' alluded to affect the much more important second aspect of the issue -- whether we as a species are in charge of our climate, or merely passengers along for the ride. Going forward, we should keep this scientific segregation always in mind.
 Generoso Pope Bedford, N.Y., March 1, 2010

HEADLINE: Why I'm Not Running for the Senate

BYLINE: By HAROLD FORD Jr.. 
Harold Ford Jr. was a United States representative from Tennessee from 1997 to 2007.

 BODY:
WHEN it was reported two months ago that I was thinking seriously about running for the United States Senate from New York, Democratic Party insiders started their own campaign to bully me out of the race -- just as they had done with Representatives Carolyn Maloney, Steve Israel and others.
 But as I traveled around New York, I began to understand why the party bosses felt the need to use such heavy-handed tactics: They're nervous. New Yorkers are clamoring for change. Our political system -- so bogged down in partisan fighting -- is sapping the morale of New Yorkers and preventing government at every level from fulfilling its duty. 
 The cruel twist, of course, is that the party bosses who tried to intimidate me so that I wouldn't even think about running against Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who had been appointed to the seat by Gov. David A. Paterson, are the same people responsible for putting Democratic control of the Senate at risk.
 These are tough times, and the New Yorkers I have met are facing economic adversity with grace and dignity. They worry about their future, care about their neighbors and hope this storm will pass so they can focus on better days ahead. And yet too few in the Democratic Party are really willing to break with orthodoxy to meet these challenges. We need leaders as good as the people they represent -- leaders focused on creating jobs, keeping taxes low, helping small businesses and restoring faith in government.
 Voting for health care legislation that imposes billions in new taxes on New Yorkers and restricts federal financing for abortions is not good for the people of this state. Voting against critical funds necessary to ensure the survival of the financial services industry -- the economic backbone of this state -- is not good for the people of New York.
 I was considered out of touch with mainstream Democrats when I argued against spending more than $200 million a year to hold the Khalid Shaikh Mohammed trial in New York. I was also labeled out of touch for advocating a payroll tax cut for small businesses and for putting a jobs bill before a scaled-down health reform bill. Though much more needs to be done to create jobs, I am pleased that these ideas have now become part of the Democratic mainstream. 
 Yet the party has been too slow to change. The effects of its lack of flexibility have been clear in a series of worrisome political events: Ted Kennedy's ''safe'' Senate seat was lost to a Republican; Evan Bayh of Indiana and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota announced they weren't running for re-election; Senate seats held by Democrats in Wisconsin and Delaware now seem to be in jeopardy; New York's state government faces even more controversy and challenge.
 There are compelling reasons for me to run. I believe New Yorkers are hungry for a new direction in government. Our elected officials have spent too much time this past year supporting a national partisan political agenda -- and not enough time looking out for their own constituents.
 New Yorkers aren't asking for much. A jobs bill that cuts taxes for the middle class and invests in the future; a health care system that doesn't bankrupt people when they get sick; and public schools that lay the groundwork for children to take advantage of all the future holds. 
 I believe raising these issues over the last two months has forced Democrats and Republicans alike to do better. And I will continue holding their feet to the fire. But I will not do so as a candidate for senator from New York.
 I've examined this race in every possible way, and I keep returning to the same fundamental conclusion: If I run, the likely result would be a brutal and highly negative Democratic primary -- a primary where the winner emerges weakened and the Republican strengthened.
 I refuse to do anything that would help Republicans win a Senate seat in New York, and give the Senate majority to the Republicans.
 I realize this announcement will surprise many people who assumed I was running. I reached this decision only in the last few days -- as I considered what a primary campaign, even with the victory I saw as fully achievable, would have done to the Democratic Party.
 I am a Democrat. But I am an independent Democrat. I am not going to stop speaking out on behalf of policies that I think are right -- regardless of ideology, party or political expediency. I plan to continue taking this message across our state and across our nation.

HEADLINE: Roadside Marquee

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Safety advocates who worry about the dangers of distracted driving have a new concern beyond cellphones and gadget-laden dashboards: digital roadside billboards.
 These high-tech billboards marry the glow of Times Square with the immediacy of the Internet. Images change every six to eight seconds, so advertisers can flash timely messages -- like the latest headlines, coffee deals at dawn, a cheeseburger at lunchtime or even the song playing on a radio station at that moment.
 The billboard industry asserts there is no research indicating they cause crashes, and notes that the signs do not use video or animation. 
 But to critics, these ever-changing, bright billboards are ''television on a stick'' and give drivers, many of them already calling and texting, yet another reason to take their eyes off the road. 
 Abby Dart, executive director of Scenic Michigan, a nonprofit group trying to block construction of new digital billboards in the state, calls the signs ''weapons of mass distraction'' and says they can be more dangerous than phones. 
 ''You can turn off your phone,'' she said. ''The billboard gets your attention whether you want to give it or not.''
 Last Thursday, Michigan lawmakers held hearings on legislation, the first of its kind, that would impose a two-year moratorium on the construction of new billboards. Minnesota's legislature is scheduled to hold hearings this month on a similar moratorium. As digital billboards begin to pop up around the country, questions about whether to regulate the emerging technology are being asked in other states as well, and by federal officials.
 The Federal Highway Administration has been conducting a study, which it says will be completed this summer, that uses eye-trackers inside cars to see whether drivers who have volunteered for the study look at the digital billboards, and for how long. The agency also has organized a tour this spring to take researchers to various cities around the world to study how other nations are regulating digital billboards. 
 In the United States, only about 2,000 of the nation's 450,000 billboards are digitized, but the industry expects there to be tens of thousands of them, as many as 15 percent of its overall inventory.
 The signs are typically used in busy traffic areas, where advertisers are willing to pay a premium for them. A digital billboard costs $250,000 to $300,000, roughly half what it did five years ago, but much more than the $5,000 to $50,000 for a traditional billboard.
 Space on the digital signs fetches a premium in part because up to six advertisers can share a single location. Traditional billboards fetch a wide range of monthly rents (from $1,000 to $5,000 depending on location and audience) and the digital versions cost the same or a bit more, but the industry benefits by selling that space at that price to more than one advertiser.
 Rather than settling the matter, existing research about digital billboards leaves room for debate on the danger. 
 One 2007 study, from the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which used in-car cameras to study motorists, found that digital billboards did not change driver behavior more than ordinary billboards. 
 But critics note that the study was financed by the billboard industry and that it was found to be biased by reviewers who rejected it for publication in 2008 by the Transportation Research Board, a Congressionally chartered agency.
 Even the researcher who led the Virginia Tech institute project, Suzanne Lee, while defending her science as sound, said that the potential for drivers to be distracted by the new billboards -- and digital signs that use video and animation -- should be investigated further.
 ''If we don't study this, and get on top of it right now while the capabilities are expanding, every roadway will be filled with flashing lights and video,'' said Ms. Lee. 
 For decades, the Federal Highway Administration has provided regulations to states governing free-standing billboards that prohibit them from having ''flashing, intermittent or moving light or lights.'' 
 But in 2007, the agency ruled that the free-standing digital billboards did not violate the rule and recommended, among other guidelines, that ads on those billboards stay in place at least four seconds and that they not be ''unreasonably bright.''
 Last week, the Georgetown Institute for Public Representation, a public interest law group, filed a petition with the highway administration asking it to reverse the earlier decision, which would have the effect of banning new digital billboards that include flashing, intermittent or moving lights, and requiring the dismantling of existing ones.
 The billboard industry argues that the new signs are part of a larger technological and economic shift to a paperless society (no more crews hoisting and removing ads from billboards) and that they give advertisers more flexibility. 
 Marketing materials published last year by Clear Channel, one of the nation's biggest billboard companies, say the digital billboards are, among other things, ideal for posting game scores by advertisers like radio stations and sports bars. News organizations can also use them -- ''as the Web site headline changes, so does the digital billboard,'' the materials say.
 ''It's a very flexible, very responsible medium and very impactful,'' said Ron Cooper, chief executive of Clear Channel Outdoor, which has 450 digital billboards and plans to add 150 more this year. Big corporations that have used them include ABC, AT&T, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, General Mills, Ford and Verizon. ''Consumers report seeing it, remembering the brand, remembering the advertisers.''
 He and others in the industry say they have been careful to make the signs memorable but not distracting. They say the ''television on a stick'' label is an exaggeration. 
 ''It's a slide projector -- it shows one image after the next,'' said Bill Ripp, a vice president who oversees digital billboards for Lamar Advertising, another large billboard company. ''We were as concerned as anybody. We wouldn't want to cause danger.''
 The industry has found an ally in some crime-fighting groups and agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which use the new signs to broadcast images of fugitives or of abducted children.
 ''We've had moms grab their sons by the ear and drag them right down to the sheriff's office because they were embarrassed to see the son on the billboard,'' said Bart Dexter, coordinator of the Michigan Crime Stoppers organization, who opposes the Michigan moratorium. 
 Ms. Dart, from Scenic Michigan, said the potential driver distraction outweighs any help the signs may provide in catching fugitives. 
 Rebekah Warren, a Democratic state representative from Ann Arbor, who proposed the moratorium, said the bill reflected broader concerns that legislators around the country had about distracted driving. In December, the Michigan House of Representatives passed legislation banning motorists from texting, something its Senate now is considering.
 ''We are moving so quickly into this digital age,'' said Ms. Warren. ''We are being cautious in state legislatures around the country on how we keep drivers focused on the road.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about concerns that digital billboards may be a distraction to drivers described incorrectly the billboards shown. While the billboard at the far right was digital, the others were conventional billboards; the photograph did not show ''a succession of digital billboards.''

HEADLINE: An Essential Fix

 BODY:
The recession dealt a devastating blow to the post-Katrina rebuilding effort in the Gulf states, where scores of affordable housing projects have been placed in jeopardy. Congress can revive the rebuilding effort by extending the deadline for a tax credit program that is supposed to encourage developers and investors to take on these desperately needed projects. 
 Nearly all affordable rental housing in this country is built with federal tax credits. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Congress allotted Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama more than $300 million in low-income housing tax credits, slightly more than two-thirds of which has been used. At first, these credits, and projects, were hotly sought after. Demand dropped sharply as corporate profits fell and businesses had smaller and smaller tax liabilities.
 As the economy has improved, interest in the credits seems to be picking up in many places -- but not in the Gulf. That's partly because of a provision in the Gulf Opportunity Zone law that requires projects in the region to be ready for occupancy by the end of this year. That leaves just 10 months -- instead of the 18 months that investors like to see -- for the deals to be sealed and the housing built. Projects that miss the ready-for-occupancy date, because of all-too-common weather delays or construction problems, would lose the tax credit. 
 Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat of Louisiana, has introduced an amendment that would extend the occupancy date by two years. Unless Congress moves quickly to pass it, the Gulf states could potentially lose financing for more than 70 housing projects and 6,000 units of affordable housing. The loss would be especially devastating for New Orleans, which is desperately short of housing for the low-income workers who are essential to the city's service economy. 
 The more Congress dithers, the more likely it becomes that tax credit investors will look outside the Gulf states for places to put their money. This is an easy fix -- and a critical one.

HEADLINE: Justices Hear Appeal Of Ex-Chief Of Enron

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Both the law under which Jeffrey K. Skilling was convicted and the way his jury was selected were the subject of skeptical questioning at the Supreme Court on Monday. The law was too vague, several justices suggested, and the jury selection too cursory.
 Mr. Skilling, a former chief executive of Enron, the Houston energy company, was sent to prison in 2006 for his role in its collapse. 
 His lawyer, Sri Srinivasan, spent about 20 minutes of his half-hour argument on the jury selection question and the ''wave of public passion'' in Houston that he said made it impossible for his client to receive a fair trial.
 The appeals court in the case, while affirming Mr. Skilling's conviction, had accepted the premise that there was a ''pervasive community bias against those who oversaw Enron's collapse.'' 
 But the appeals court said the trial court judge, Simeon Lake III, had not committed reversible error in failing to grant Mr. Skilling's motion for a change of venue because Judge Lake's questioning of prospective jurors was thorough and careful.
 Mr. Srinivasan disputed that, and several justices appeared sympathetic to his argument. The lawyer said Judge Lake had spent only five hours on the task, posing cursory questions to jurors and taking them at their word that they would be fair despite evidence to the contrary. 
 By contrast, Mr. Srinivasan said, questioning in the trial of Timothy McVeigh for his role in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, took 18 days after a motion for change of venue from Oklahoma City to Denver was granted.
 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the two cases were very different. In Mr. Skilling's case, she said, ''what's involved is money rather than life or limb.''
 Mr. Srinivasan said that extended questioning was not unusual in less serious cases, saying it had taken six days to select jurors in Martha Stewart's trial for lying to federal investigators.
 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy indicated that the questioning in Mr. Skilling's case had been too brief. ''It's hard for me to think,'' he said, that the questioning ''would have been much shorter even if there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice.''
 Michael R. Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general, countered that Judge Lake had 15 years of experience and the benefit of detailed questionnaires completed by potential jurors. 
 But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he was troubled by Judge Lake's failure to dismiss some potential jurors for cause, including one who said she had lost $50,000 or $60,000 in Enron's collapse. ''I am worried about a fair trial in this instance,'' Justice Breyer said. (The defense used a peremptory challenge to strike the juror.)
 Justice Sonia Sotomayor echoed Justice Breyer's concern. ''How can we be satisfied that there was a fair and impartial jury picked,'' she said, ''when the judge doesn't follow up on a witness who says, 'I'm a victim of this fraud'?''
 On the other hand, Justice Breyer said, he was reluctant to have the Supreme Court instruct experienced trial court judges about how to do their jobs.
 Mr. Srinivasan's second argument was that the law under which Mr. Skilling was convicted, which makes it a crime ''to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,'' is unconstitutionally vague. The law is a favorite tool of federal prosecutors in both public and private corruption cases.
 ''Its sweep is breathtaking,'' Mr. Srinivasan said of the law. ''It would have the capacity to convert almost any workplace lie into a federal felony.''
 This argument also got traction from some of the justices. It was helped by a concession from Mr. Dreeben when Justice Ginsburg asked him about the instructions to the jury in Mr. Skilling's case about what honest services meant.
 Mr. Dreeben said the instructions ''did take a somewhat broader view of the honest-services crime than the government has taken in this Court.''
 After hearing Mr. Dreeben read the instructions, Justice Antonin Scalia asked, ''It's circular, isn't it?'' Mr. Dreeben agreed. ''It does seem a little circular to me,'' he said.
 Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked Mr. Dreeben whether precedents in this area contemplate fraud prosecutions over an employee's compensation that was publicly disclosed.
 ''I would frankly acknowledge that this case is a logical extension of the basic principle that we have urged the court to adopt,'' Mr. Dreeben said. ''The court can evaluate whether it believes that that is legitimately within the scope of an honest services violation or not.''
 The Skilling case is the court's third encounter with the honest-services law this term. Federal prosecutors have used the law to combat public corruption and fraud by corporate officials. The law does not require prosecutors to prove theft of money or property but that defendants have been disloyal to or dishonest with constituents or employers.
 One pending case involves a former Alaska legislator, Bruce Weyhrauch, who did not disclose soliciting work from a company with business before the Legislature. Mr. Weyhrauch argued the federal honest-services law should not apply in public corruption cases where no violation of a state law was alleged. 
 The other pending case concerns Conrad M. Black, the newspaper executive convicted of defrauding his media company, Hollinger International. Mr. Black argued that the law should not apply to him because he had not contemplated that Hollinger would suffer ''some identifiable economic injury.''
 In his Supreme Court briefs, Mr. Skilling's lawyer argued that the court should require that prosecutions of employees of private companies be limited to cases in which defendants had obtained some private gain at the expense of their employers. Mr. Skilling's conduct, one of the briefs said, ''even if wrongful in some way, was not the crime of honest-services fraud, because the government conceded that his acts were not intended to advance his own interests instead of Enron's.''
 In answering Justice Alito about whether the government was building on earlier precedents, Mr. Dreeben may have been signaling the government would prefer to lose the Skilling case on narrow grounds than to have the court strike down the law in its entirety as too vague.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths FAIL, JAMES M.

 BODY:
FAIL--James M.,was a true southern gentleman who never met a challenge that did not excite him or an adventure that did not inspire him. He was a successful businessman and a generous philanthropist. Most recently, he served as the chairman of Stone Holdings, his Dallas-based financial holding company. A native of Mobile, Alabama, he attended Murphy High School and served three years in the U.S. Navy before graduating from the University of Alabama in 1949. His lifelong respect for education manifested itself in his numerous gifts to both educational facilities and individuals, including his establishing a scholarship at Birmingham Southern College for "any worthy and deserving student." 
This reiterated his belief that education was the greatest gift he could offer. In 2009, he was honored by the University of the South at Sewanee with a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa. James' love for music began at a young age with the violin, viola, and trombone. He played in the Murphy High School band and continued to enjoy performing with the Woody Herman Big Band and the Swingles in the 1940s. Later, he was a generous supporter of the Phoenix Symphony, serving as director, and the Mobile Symphony; making a sizable donation endowing its principal cello chair in memory of his wife. His great enthusiasm for sports lead him to repeatedly give to the Crimson Tide Foundation. His first donation enabled the University to build the department's media suite, named for his father- in-law, Naylor Stone, whom he greatly admired. In 2008, much to his delight and befitting his wonderful sense of humor, the University of Alabama found a way to thank him for his ongoing support by naming the visitor's room at Bryant-Denny Stadium "The Fail Room." He gained a great deal of joy from making the long journey to Pasadena this January to see the Crimson Tide win the National Championship. James' adventurous and always curious nature led him to make many great trips around the world. He took great joy in bringing his family and friends with him to share the experiences of faraway lands and new cultures; stories of these trips always entertained and inspired those around him. Mr. Fail was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, the Economic Club of New York and a founder of its Centennial Society, the Metropolitan Club of New York, Phoenix Country Club, the Summit Club, The Inverness Country Club, The Club of Birmingham, and The Noah Society. He attended St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands Episcopal Church. James was preceded in death by his wife, Emily Stone Fail; his son, James Naylor Fail; and his parents, Joe and Rosalie Fail. He is survived by his daughters Kathryn Luttrull and Marcia Boykin, both of Phoenix, Arizona; his grandchildren Lindsay, Hayley, Bobby, Marbury, Liza, Grey, Coulter, and Malcolm; his great-grandchildren Stone, Jonas, and Dahlia; brothers Alton and Charles Fail, and a large extended family. Throughout his successes, James Fail never lost his humility and maintained his generosity to a fault. With his beloved wife Emily, he was a shining example of how to live a rich and joyful life. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the University of Alabama general scholarship fund or St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands.Visitation will be held Wednesday, March 3, 2010 from 6pm until 8pm at Johns-Ridout's Southside. A funeral service will be held on Thursday, March 4, 2010 at 11am at St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands, with burial to follow at Elmwood Cemetery. A celebration of his life will follow at the Veranda Restaurant.

HEADLINE: PATERSON IS SAID TO HAVE DIRECTED CALLS TO ACCUSER

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Danny Hakim reported from Albany, and William K. Rashbaum from New York. Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Confessore, David Kocieniewski, Jeremy W. Peters and Serge F. Kovaleski from New York.

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. David A. Paterson personally directed two state employees to contact the woman who had accused his close aide of assaulting her, according to two people with direct knowledge of the governor's actions.
 Mr. Paterson instructed his press secretary, Marissa Shorenstein, to ask the woman to publicly describe the episode as nonviolent, according to a third person, who was briefed on the matter. That description would contradict the woman's accounts to the police and in court.
 Mr. Paterson also enlisted another state employee, Deneane Brown, a friend of both the governor and the accuser, to make contact with the woman before she was due in court to finalize an order of protection against the aide, David W. Johnson, the two people with direct knowledge said. Ms. Brown, an employee of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, reached out to the woman on more than one occasion over a period of several days and arranged a phone call between the governor and the woman, Mr. Johnson's companion.
 After the calls from Ms. Brown and the conversation with the governor, the woman failed to appear for the court hearing on Feb. 8, and the case was dropped. 
 These accounts provide the first evidence that Mr. Paterson helped direct an effort to influence the accuser. 
 Of Ms. Shorenstein's call, the person briefed on the matter described it as an effort to ''reconfirm what the governor had said before, that it was not an acrimonious -- it was not a friendly breakup but it wasn't acrimonious, that the allegation itself was not true.''
 In an interview with The New York Times, the governor had characterized the fight as being ''like breakups you hear about all the time.'' 
 The call from Ms. Shorenstein to the woman came on the evening The Times was preparing to publish an article about Mr. Johnson, his past episodes with women and the police, and his ascent to the top ranks of the Paterson administration.
 The person briefed on the matter said that at the time of the call, Ms. Shorenstein was not aware of the severity of the alleged assault, and that she did not believe that Mr. Paterson was aware of it either. Ms. Shorenstein failed to reach the woman, who has never spoken publicly about the episode.
 Last Friday, Mr. Paterson ended his campaign for election, after The Times first disclosed that he and his State Police detail had intervened in a domestic abuse case involving Mr. Johnson, one of his closest aides. 
 Mr. Johnson's girlfriend had accused him of choking her, smashing her into a mirrored dresser and preventing her from calling for help during a Halloween altercation in the Bronx apartment they shared.
 Mr. Paterson has stated that he was unaware of the details of the case until The Times reported them, and has said he did nothing improper. After the news reports, he suspended Mr. Johnson and asked Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo to begin an investigation. 
 Mr. Paterson's office declined to comment on Monday, citing the pending investigation. John Milgrim, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, also declined to comment.
 The descriptions of the governor's actions come from two people close to him.
 The latest revelations came as Mr. Paterson spent much of Monday vowing to remain in office despite pressure on him to resign and distancing himself from the controversy over the domestic violence case.
 ''This is a separate issue that really involves the problems of someone that worked for us and not me,'' Mr. Paterson said at a Midtown breakfast forum.
 To date, the administration has conceded that the State Police contacted the woman in the hours and days after the Oct. 31 alleged assault in the Bronx, and she has said under oath in family court that they harassed and pressured her not to pursue charges. 
 But the governor's state of knowledge about the alleged assault and personal involvement in the administration's handling of it have remained murky. 
 He has acknowledged having a conversation with the woman on Feb. 7, the day before she was due back in court to seek the final order. But the two people close to the governor also described a more concerted effort to contact the woman before the court date, one involving Ms. Brown. 
 The nature of those contacts and what Ms. Brown was seeking to achieve remain unclear. She has not responded to numerous phone calls and visits to her home. Her husband, in a brief telephone interview on Monday, said he knew nothing about the events and would not comment. 
 A lawyer for the alleged victim has confirmed the conversation with the governor on Feb. 7 and said that Mr. Paterson had asked if the woman was all right and reassured her that ''if you need me, I'm there for you.''
 Ms. Brown had also played a role on the administration's behalf in characterizing one of Mr. Johnson's prior disputes with a woman. Mr. Johnson, according to his girlfriend at the time, punched her in the face outside Mr. Paterson's Harlem office in 2001, when the governor was a state senator from Upper Manhattan.
 The woman did not file a police report, and Mr. Paterson's chief of staff at the time, Woody Pascal, said he had intervened and counseled the woman.
 Shortly before the article on Mr. Johnson was published, Mr. Paterson's press office informed a reporter for The Times that it had unearthed a witness, Ms. Brown, who characterized the incident as nothing more than a verbal argument.
 On Feb. 16, Ms. Brown was interviewed and said she had been working as a volunteer in Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright's office, next door to Mr. Paterson's Senate office, one day in 2001 when she walked out into the hall and encountered Mr. Johnson and a woman whom he had been dating in the midst of a heated argument. Ms. Brown said she witnessed no physical violence during the portion of the argument she saw. She said she felt certain that no physical violence had occurred. 
 ''To me, it was more of a lover's spat,'' she said.
 Mr. Cuomo's investigators appear to be moving quickly in their inquiry. On Monday, they interviewed the two most senior officials in the state police, Superintendent Harry J. Corbitt and his second-in-command, Pedro J. Perez. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Perez, Stephen C. Worth, said he could not comment on what was discussed.
 The investigators also were scheduled to interview the New York City police officer who first responded to the call at the woman's Bronx apartment on Oct. 31.
 Last week, after Mr. Paterson suspended Mr. Johnson without pay, his top criminal justice adviser, Denise E. O'Donnell, resigned, saying it was ''unacceptable'' that Mr. Paterson and the State Police had made contact with the woman and that she could not ''in good conscience'' remain in the administration.
 On Monday, speaking at the breakfast in Manhattan, he emphasized that he would not resign. ''I think there is an hysteria that I've been the victim of over the past couple of months,'' he said. ''I've been resigning about five times before this weekend.''

HEADLINE: Vice Chairman of Fed to Retire, Letting Obama Reshape Board

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve announced on Monday that he would retire in June, giving President Obama an expanded opportunity to put his stamp on the central bank as it faces a difficult balance between heading off inflation and addressing high levels of unemployment. 
 The departure of the vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, a 40-year Fed veteran, means Mr. Obama has three seats to fill on the Fed's seven-member board of governors at a time when the central bank is weighing how aggressively to reverse the easy-money policy it pursued during the financial crisis and recession. 
 The vacancies are likely to spur debate over the Fed's priorities. With unemployment near 10 percent and projected to remain high for years to come, there is sure to be pressure on the administration, especially from liberals, to nominate Fed governors willing to adhere not just to the central bank's mission of price stability but also its mandate of full employment, a goal that has effectively taken a back seat to inflation fighting over much of the last three decades.
 ''Any incumbent president wants to see the economy grow,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton who was vice chairman of the Fed from 1994 to 1996. ''It doesn't matter whether he's a Republican or a Democrat. So I wouldn't be surprised if the Obama administration is looking for someone more dovish on inflation.'' 
 Mr. Kohn, an influential cen-trist, was appointed by President George W. Bush, as were the two most recent board members to leave, who tended to emphasize inflation fighting.
 Henry W. Chappell Jr., an economist at the University of South Carolina and an authority on the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's major policy-setting arm, predicted that the administration would choose nominees who hold the Keynesian belief that full employment does not necessarily return on its own after a recession and who are ''willing to actively respond to prevailing economic conditions like the recession.''
 Lawrence H. Summers, the chairman of the National Economic Council, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, are expected to exert great influence over the selection process. Both of them tend to be identified with their party's market-oriented center more than with its liberal wing.
 A third official, Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the Fed. Like the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, she is an academic economist who has written extensively on the Depression. Unlike Mr. Summers, a former Harvard president who had been mentioned as a possible Fed chairman, she is not widely seen as a polarizing figure. 
 Advocates of making price stability the more dominant of the Fed's mandates say that only through consistent application of aggressive anti-inflation policies can the economy grow to its maximum potential over the long run. Their view has permeated the central bank and the financial markets for years, and deviations from it, real or perceived, are not well received in those quarters, scholars say.
 During his tenure at the Fed, Mr. Blinder, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, found his influence constrained, he has said, in part because of his willingness to raise the question of the balance between inflation and employment growth. 
 The board of governors has historically tended to be somewhat less hawkish on inflation than the presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks, said Michael D. Bordo, an economist at Rutgers.
 ''If you have two or three Obama people and they tend to be more dovish, they would push the conversation in a direction of prolonged ease and act as counterbalances to the inflation hawks, who are pushing for exit sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Bordo said.
 The nominees will be coming into the Fed at a particularly delicate time.
 ''There's going to be a bit of a brouhaha when the tightening comes,'' he said. ''Unemployment will stay high, and yet the recession will have passed. When the Fed starts moving, regardless of all the preparation, there is going to be squawking.''
 Even before Mr. Kohn's announcement, senior Treasury officials had been vetting prospective candidates for the other vacancies, according to officials involved in the process.
 The administration is mindful that the nominees could face a grueling Senate confirmation process, and views the opening in Mr. Kohn's seat as potentially useful in luring a prominent candidate who might otherwise turn down the opportunity, said the officials who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the search.
 Mr. Bernanke won confirmation to a second term in January only after a battle with critics over the Fed's performance in the run-up to the financial crisis.
 The officials said that for the vice chairman's job, they were leaning toward someone with more of an academic or policy background, who might not draw the political fire of a nominee with close ties to Wall Street. 
 Mr. Obama has named one person to the Fed board so far: Daniel K. Tarullo, a law professor who served in the Clinton administration and is an authority on financial regulation.
 The other two governors are Kevin M. Warsh, a former executive at Morgan Stanley who has been Mr. Bernanke's liaison to Wall Street, and Elizabeth A. Duke, a former community banker who has focused on the challenges small businesses have had in getting loans. Both were appointed by Mr. Bush.
 Mr. Kohn's departure would leave Mr. Bernanke as the only professionally trained economist on the board. 
 Mr. Kohn, 67, who joined the board in August 2002, and became vice chairman in June 2006, was unusual in the Fed's history, having risen through the staff ranks. 
 Before joining the board, he was a trusted aide to Alan Greenspan during his long tenure as chairman. Later, at Mr. Bernanke's side throughout the crisis, Mr. Kohn oversaw the stress tests of major financial institutions last year and coordinated the Fed's response to the crisis with that of other central banks. 
 ''The Federal Reserve and the country owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Don Kohn for his invaluable contributions over 40 years of public service,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 When Mr. Kohn told Mr. Geithner of his decision, the secretary asked, jokingly, if Mr. Kohn could stay on until unemployment fell to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Don't Tell the Kids

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
RABBITS are supposed to be easy to kill. The French dispatch them with a sharp knife to the throat. A farmer in upstate New York swears that a swift smack with the side of the hand works. Others prefer a quick twist of the neck. 
 It didn't seem so easy at the rabbit-killing seminar held in a parking lot behind Roberta's restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn in November. 
 The idea was to place the rabbit on its belly on straw-covered asphalt, press a broomstick across the back of its neck and swiftly yank up the rear legs. Done right, it's a quiet and quick end. But it takes a little skill and a lot of fortitude, which some of the novices lacked.
 Nine people had paid $100 each to learn how to raise, kill and butcher the animals. One was a woman hoping to start a farm in the Bronx. Another was considering a move to family land in Montana. A couple dressed in black had traveled from the Upper East Side with their knives and cutting boards in an Abercrombie & Fitch bag. 
 Sharleen Johnson, who rode a bus in from Boston, wanted to raise livestock in her backyard. 
 ''This is my gateway animal,'' she said.
 In an age when diners scoop marrow from roasted beef shins and dissect the feet of pigs raised by people they've met, rabbit certainly seems like the right meat at the right time. 
 American rabbit is typically raised on smaller farms, not in some giant industrial rabbit complex. The meat is lean and healthy, and makes an interesting break from chicken. For people learning to butcher at home, a rabbit is less daunting to cut up than a pig or a goat. And those who are truly obsessed with knowing where their food comes from can raise it themselves.
 Still, it's a rabbit, the animal entire generations know as the star of children's books and Saturday-morning cartoons, and as a classroom mascot. 
 Buttermilk Channel in Brooklyn had rabbit on some menus shortly after it opened in late 2008. But after a table of guests walked out, it came off. Now the only rabbit served at the restaurant is disguised in a country terrine.
 ''It seems to me that the more you can make rabbit not look like rabbit, the easier it is to sell people on it,'' said the restaurant's owner, Doug Crowell.
 But not everybody is squeamish. Some restaurant chefs are lining up for well-raised rabbits from small farms, using the meat in coconut chili braises, liver pates and even upscale sliders inspired by White Castle.
 ''Every time I put it on the menu it flies out the door,'' said Chris Kronner of Bar Tartine in San Francisco. 
 Rabbit is also becoming popular among those with an interest in raising farm animals but without much space or experience. Sure, rabbits can be fragile. They get scared and have heart attacks. Heat or the cold can knock them off. They can be bad parents, abandoning their babies or worse.
 But they breed like, well, you know. That means they produce a lot of meat for not much money. And they're clean and quiet -- especially welcome traits in the suburbs. 
 ''I always say rabbits are the new chickens,'' said Novella Carpenter, who built a farm on an abandoned lot in a poor section of Oakland, Calif., and turned her experience into a book called ''Farm City.'' 
 ''You can pay more, which is the Slow Food method,'' she said. ''Or you can do it yourself. Which is my method.''
 Ms. Carpenter believes anyone who is thinking of raising rabbits should kill one first. That is one reason she, along with Samin Nosrat, a Bay Area cooking teacher, conducted the Brooklyn class. 
 The seminars were part of a larger East-West rabbit cultural exchange organized by the magazine Meatpaper. It was built around a series of rabbit dinners at Bar Tartine last month and at Diner in Brooklyn last November.
 As the pre-slaughter lecture in Brooklyn began, Ms. Carpenter prepared students for the moment.
 ''Today is a somber day because we are going to be killing rabbits,'' she said. ''But I am always psyched after slaughter because I'm like, now I'm going to eat.''
 The rabbit events appealed to the kind of adventurous cook who signs up for weekend sausage-making classes, in part because rabbits are an especially good way to learn basic home butchery. 
 ''They have the same muscle structure as a pig,'' Mr. Kronner said. ''For someone who hasn't broken down a large animal, a rabbit is a great place to start.'' 
 The classes and dinners also attracted those seeking a slower way of living. 
 ''American palates are expanding and looking backwards, and rabbit is a big part of that, '' said Sasha Wizansky, the editor in chief of Meatpaper, who first suggested the bicoastal food exchange.
 Still, arguing that the country is in the middle of a rabbit renaissance might be overstating it. Rabbit never really had a strong first act to begin with.
 It has always been something of a crisis meat in America. Poor rural dwellers who moved to the city and European immigrants looking to assimilate found other animals to eat as soon as they could (the French notwithstanding). 
 And although rabbit consumption spiked during World War II, when the United States government encouraged people to raise them for meat, it never translated to the supermarket. When the French food revolution changed American dining in the 1960s, rabbit in mustard sauce would turn up at the occasional dinner party or restaurant. But the country never quite got past the pets-or-meat problem. 
 Ever since the Victorians began keeping them as pets, the relationship between the rabbit and the table has been uneasy. 
 ''It's this weird association with Easter,'' said Sean Rembold, the chef at Diner and at its sibling restaurant next door, Marlow & Sons.
 Chefs have to tap-dance between customers who are excited to eat rabbit and those who find the mere idea intolerable. And despite its reputation as a staple in frugal times, rabbit isn't cheap these days. A seven-pound live rabbit might weigh four pounds cleaned and cost a restaurant $25 to $30. D'Artagnan sells a whole fryer rabbit for $36.99 on its Web site. 
 Chefs searching for local, fresh rabbit can't always find enough. In the Bay Area, cooks wait for a call from Mark Pasternak of Devil's Gulch Ranch in Marin County. Along with his wife, a rabbit veterinarian named Myriam Kaplan-Pasternak, he raises the most coveted rabbits in Northern California. 
 They are such believers in the economic and health benefits of eating rabbit that they travel regularly to Haiti to teach families to raise rabbits on foraged food. The Pasternaks and their two daughters were in Haiti during the recent earthquake, when they turned their attention from rabbits to rescue.
 Mr. Pasternak began growing rabbits about 12 years ago for his mother-in-law, who is from France. She brought a French chef to dinner and word leaked out to Bay Area cooks. Soon, Mr. Pasternak was selling rabbit to Chez Panisse and the French Laundry. 
 ''I went from two to 2,000 in no time,'' he said. Not that he butchers 2,000 rabbits every week. Usually, it's about 100. But he is preparing to quadruple the number of breeding rabbits he keeps, making chefs in the Bay Area happy. 
 ''I turn down two, three, four restaurants every single week,'' Mr. Pasternak said. ''I get calls from all over the country, but I discourage shipping the rabbits. You don't need me shipping rabbit back to New York.'' 
 Some chefs in Manhattan turn to John Fazio, who sells his rabbits with most organs intact to restaurants like Savoy and Marlow & Sons and to a few Italian markets on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.
 Mr. Fazio started raising rabbits near his home in Modena, N.Y., 80 miles north of Manhattan, after an accident left him unable to make a living as a truck driver. A couple of years ago, a chef at Cookshop in Chelsea started ordering them. Others followed. Now he sells 300 to 400 a week. 
 He slaughters to order. And he has a signature. 
 ''If they don't have a rabbit with a head on it, they don't have a rabbit from me,'' he said.
 Both he and Mr. Pasternak raise a mix of New Zealands and Californians, the two most popular meat breeds. New Zealands are longer and thinner but produce more babies. Californians are a little meatier. Mr. Pasternak adds in some tri-colored Rex rabbits, which are used in the fur trade and have a good temperament.
 In the kitchen, rabbit can be a challenge. The bones are tinier and more fragile than those of chickens, making splintering a constant concern. The meat sticks and clings in an endless number of small nooks and crannies.
 Like chickens, rabbits have parts that cook differently. But it's hard to roast the whole animal at the same temperature without making some meat too dry or tough. 
 The hind legs especially almost always need a moist, slow braise. For frying, plenty of cooks like to give them a good soak in buttermilk or a light brine.
 The saddle, or center portion of the rabbit, is a different story. The meat can be fried, but it can be dry. So it helps to apply a bit more finesse.
 ''Treat the loins like pork tenderloins and wrap them in pancetta,'' Mr. Rembold said. ''It's a great home cook trick. It's like a chicken breast.'' 
 For a salad of bitter greens and rabbit he served at the Brooklyn rabbit dinners, Mr. Rembold removed the legs, sauteed the rest of the rabbit whole, then removed and sliced the meat to toss with frisee and a mustard dressing. 
 To make the most of all bits of the rabbit, Mr. Rembold suggests a sausage made with a medium grind mixed with some fatback or chicken skin to enrich the lean meat. Ms. Nosrat likes to use up all the scraps and legs in a long-simmered ragu.
 Angelina Lippert, the woman who took an Abercrombie & Fitch bag and her boyfriend to the class in Brooklyn, brought home the legs of the rabbit they killed and braised them with almonds, apples, Calvados and cream. The saddle, kidneys and heart went into a rolled roast with garlic, sage and rosemary.
 The killing itself was a little more intense than she had expected, she said.
 ''When I was the first person to volunteer to break the neck, it all seemed so easy and emotionless that I didn't realize until after I'd done it that I was shaking,'' she said.
 But she recovered quickly. After all, there was a rabbit to dress. 
 Ms. Lippert still has the pelt, the head and the feet. They're in her freezer, awaiting the taxidermist. But she doesn't have the boyfriend.
 ''He ended up leaving me for a vegetarian,'' she said.

 Adapted from Sean Rembold
 Time: 1 hour, plus optional overnight refrigeration
 2 large bone-in rabbit saddles (bodies from 3- to 4-pound rabbits, all legs removed) 
 Salt 
 Black pepper
 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard
 2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar or cider vinegar
 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
 1/4 cup dried cranberries, prunes or other dried fruit
 1/2 cup dry white wine or Armagnac, or as needed
 1 head frisee or 8 ounces dandelion or mustard greens
 1/4 cup almonds, toasted and chopped.
 1. Sprinkle rabbit saddles with salt and pepper. If possible, do this the night before cooking and refrigerate.
 2. In a small bowl, combine mustard and vinegar. Whisk in 1/4 cup olive oil and season with salt and pepper. May be covered and refrigerated up to 24 hours.
 3. Place dried fruit in a small saucepan with a pinch of salt and pepper, and add enough wine or Armagnac to just cover. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Drain when cool, remove any pits and cut larger fruits into chunks.
 4. Place a large, heavy saute pan with a lid over high heat with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil until oil shimmers. Add rabbit saddles and sear well on all sides. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and cook until interior is slightly pink, 145 degrees on an instant-read thermometer (about 20 minutes). Allow to rest several minutes, then use a sharp knife to remove loins and tenderloins from bone. Slice meat thinly on the bias while still warm.
 5. In a wide, shallow serving bowl, combine frisee or other greens, almonds and fruit. Add mustard dressing to taste, warmed slightly or at room temperature, season with salt and pepper, and toss well. Add rabbit and toss again.
 Yield: 4 servings.

HEADLINE: Graduates Fault Advice Of Guidance Counselors

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Most people who graduated from high school in the last dozen years believe that their guidance counselors provided little meaningful advice about college or careers, a new study has found. And many said the best advice on their futures came from teachers. 
 ''Most young adults who go on to college believe that the advice of their high school guidance counselors was inadequate and often impersonal and perfunctory,'' according to the study by Public Agenda, a nonprofit research organization.
 ''Most troubling, and potentially significant for policy makers,'' the study added, ''is that young people who characterized their interactions with guidance counselors as anonymous and unhelpful were less likely to go directly from high school into a postsecondary program.''
 The researchers surveyed 600 people who graduated from a variety of high schools across the country in the last 4 to 12 years. The study was sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has sought to shed light on low completion rates at both the high school and college levels. 
 Asked in an e-mail message why, for this particular survey, Public Agenda had focused on people ages 22 to 30, Melissa R. Feldsher, a spokeswoman, said the organization was interested in hearing from ''those who had the benefit of work experience, as well as hindsight.''
 As the study notes, counselors' caseloads and responsibilities have only grown in recent years. 
 While the American School Counselor Association considers a ratio of 100 students to each counselor to be ''optimal,'' according to the report, that ratio is closer to 1,000 to 1 in California's public schools; 700 to 1 in Arizona, Minnesota, Utah and the District of Columbia; and 265 to 1 nationally.
 ''It is also important to remember that advising students on higher education choices is just one of many things that guidance counselors do,'' the researchers wrote, adding that ''much of their effort is devoted to discipline issues and sorting out scheduling and other administrative mix-ups within the high school.''
 In an interview, Jim Jump, a high school college counselor who is the president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling, echoed the report's findings in expressing his concern that ''so many other things are tossed on counselors' plates that actual counseling takes up a very small part of the time.''
 Mr. Jump, the academic dean and director of guidance at St. Christopher's, a private school in Richmond, Va., added, ''I worry that's just going to get worse, as school districts encounter the economy and don't see counselors as essential instructional personnel.''
 In the study, 67 percent of those surveyed rated their counselor as ''poor or fair'' at ''helping you decide what school was right for you''; 54 percent gave similar ratings to their counselors for ''explaining and helping you with the application process,'' and nearly half said their counselors made them feel ''like I was just another face in the crowd.''
 The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 25, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 3 about a survey by Public Agenda, a nonprofit research group, of the opinions of high school graduates in the last dozen years toward their guidance counselors referred incorrectly to two ratios cited in the survey. The ratio of students to counselors that is considered optimal by the American School Counselor Association is 250 to 1, not 100 to 1. The average student to counselor ratio nationally is nearly 470 to 1, not 265 to 1.

HEADLINE: Bread and Butter

BYLINE: By SAM SIFTON

 BODY:
46 Henry Street (Cranberry Street), Brooklyn Heights; (718) 858-9605.
 Daniella Silone ran Le Petit Marche on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights for three years, serving good French food to people who understood what that meant -- not enough of them. She closed the restaurant on New Year's Eve. 
 Now the restaurant has reopened as Bread and Butter, a junior-varsity Buttermilk Channel, serving approximately Southern food to people eager for value -- and plenty of them. The place has been crowded almost since its opening, in early January. 
 The menu has ''bites'' and cold cuts from the ''butcher block,'' three selections of macaroni and cheese, lobster and clam rolls, fried chicken, a burger, slow-roasted meats and fries on the side. You're served bread and butter pickles when you take a table, as well as corn bread and biscuits that would be excellent if they weren't so cold. 
 A seafood gumbo comes thick with lobster and crab, but not with roux; it's comfort food lite, and totally inoffensive unless you care about such things ($19). Chicken wings owe nothing to Buffalo, but they're meaty and firm, with sauce more sticky than flavorful ($9). Baked taleggio with croutons and lingonberry jam nods at the place's European roots; it's good ($5).
 The fried chicken, though, wan and chewy, rather than crusted and rich, raises ire ($18). Served with roasted corn that tastes as if it's been out in the silo since August, fair mashed potatoes and brown gravy the flavor of salt, it has barely a lead on what you'd find at a steam-table salad bar somewhere along Second Avenue late one winter night on your way home from work.
 So this is a taste of the new economy: first-apartment food in a bedroom community one stop from Wall Street, comforting only in name. It's depressing. You'd think rillettes and moules frites would have been more resilient.

HEADLINE: Seeing the Investor Value in Being Green

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Constructing or renovating a building to make it environmentally sustainable can be a daunting task for any owner, but Jamestown Properties, a German commercial real estate investment company, has decided it will go ''green'' in nearly its entire $4 billion portfolio of buildings, all located in the United States. 
 The overhaul involves fixes as simple as installing low-flow water fixtures and as complex as revamping heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. Jamestown expects to recoup costs through energy savings, the ability to charge higher rents and higher resale values.
 Jamestown, an acquisition and management firm based in Cologne, Germany, and Atlanta, has invested $12 billion in commercial properties in the United States since 1983 through private equity funds for German investors. Matt M. Bronfman, the company's managing director and chief operations officer, said Jamestown's executives believed that real estate holdings, new and existing, would be increasingly valued by their sustainability and environmental impact. 
 ''We come at things from a bit of a European perspective, and Europe is far ahead of the United States in the environmental movement,'' Mr. Bronfman said. Sustainability ''will become a key factor to the point where, if you haven't taken environmental measures, you will have trouble, whether it's leasing your office building or what have you,'' he added. The company said it would spend $3 million to $10 million to retrofit all of its properties.
 Jamestown invests through private equity funds. There may be several dozen public and private green building funds worldwide, said Gary Pivo, director of the Responsible Property Investing Center at the University of Arizona and a professor of urban planning and natural resources. Prominent ones include the Investa Commercial Property Fund, based in Australia, and the Rose Smart Growth Investment Fund I, based in New York. ''There are an increasing number of private funds that are incorporating green buildings and energy-efficient buildings and other principles of sustainability into their property selections and their portfolios,'' Mr. Pivo said. ''But there are not very many that are committed exclusively to green buildings.''
 In December 2008, Jamestown acquired Green Street Properties, a development and consulting firm in Atlanta that focused on environmental sustainability. It will continue to operate as a subsidiary of Jamestown.
 Jamestown ''saw us as a way of accelerating the greening of their brand and portfolio,'' said Katharine Kelley, who retained her position as president and chief executive of Green Street. ''One of the first things we did after joining forces was to start work immediately on a number of existing buildings in Jamestown's portfolio.'' 
 One building where the conversion is virtually complete is 999 Peachtree Street, a 621,000-square-foot office building with street-level retail space in midtown Atlanta, acquired through the Jamestown Co-Invest IV fund in 2007 for $127 million.
 Jamestown has obtained gold certification from the United States Green Building Council with various strategies, like starting bicycle sharing and carpooling programs, and adding a Zipcar station. Energy-efficient lighting saves 476,000 kilowatt hours a year, and the building recycles paper and uses sustainable Post-it notes and file folders.
 Tenants in the building, including ERS Global and Flad Architects, follow sustainable practices, said Michael Phillips, Jamestown's creative director. ''I would say we look kindly on tenant build-outs or interior choices that are green,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''But I don't think it's a requirement.''
 The goal with 999 Peachtree is to hold it for the duration of the closed-end Co-Invest IV fund, which is seven to 10 years, benefiting from reduced operating costs that may also attract tenants who will pay a bit more, Mr. Phillips said.
 Rents for green offices have been shown to be about 2 percent higher than rents for comparable buildings nearby, according to a study done by John M. Quigley, an economist and professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and two other researchers.
 When the fund closes, Jamestown will sell 999 Peachtree, but it is difficult to tell how much the building's conversion and certification will add to its valuation, Mr. Phillips said. Since green building funds have been around only for a half-dozen years or so, few if any of their assets have sold, he said.
 ''It depends on who buys the investment at the end,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''An insurance company or pension fund typically wants to buy buildings that offer the most modern technology. Green technology is considered the most progressive. 
 ''At the moment,'' he continued, ''the advantages of being green might be less about a premium, and more about offering a wider pool of buyers.''
 Other buildings that Jamestown is retrofitting for environmental sustainability include 1250 Broadway, near 31st Street, and Chelsea Market, at 75 Ninth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets in Manhattan. 
 While 1250 Broadway is poised to obtain a gold certification from the Green Building Council, Chelsea Market, a collection of 17 buildings cobbled together, is quite old and doesn't make a good candidate for certification, Ms. Kelley said.
 ''You have to customize a green solution depending on the specific project, and its investment profile, and where it is in the market cycle,'' she said.
 Jamestown has performed an energy audit at 1250 Broadway, a 770,000-square-foot office building built in 1968, that has led to a 15 percent reduction in annual energy consumption and carbon emissions.
 ''It's things as mundane as adjusting fan speeds or repairing or upgrading controls, or even some more expensive items like cleaning the chiller cores,'' Ms. Kelley said.
 Jamestown is also setting up programs to replace cleaning chemicals with environmentally safe products and retrain the custodial staff.
 ''We're putting aerators on the faucets, and changing out the water closets in the bathrooms and looking at perimeter office lighting,'' Ms. Kelley said. ''There's a whole laundry list of topics.''
 Within a year, Jamestown will recoup the $350,000 it has invested in converting the 39-story building through increased efficiencies, she said.
 The plans for Chelsea Market, a 1.1 million-square-foot retail and office property, call for a rooftop market garden.
 Mr. Pivo said there had been no empirical studies showing the effectiveness of green building funds, which are still only a fraction of the entire universe of property funds, in achieving environmental ends, though he said they should prove beneficial.
 ''There is at least a theoretical probability that when enough investors commit to selecting for greener or more sustainable investments,'' he said, ''that that will lower the cost of capital for corporations and developers who are working in the greener and more sustainable area.''
 Jon Boggiano, a principal partner in Everblue Energy, a company in Charlotte, N.C., that offers training in sustainable building principles, said green building funds could overcome one of the biggest problems in sustainable building -- a lack of capital.
 Most of the truly sustainable buildings, he said, cost more upfront and are developed by government, universities or as corporate headquarters. ''Those owners are looking at the lifetime costs of the facility, whereas most commercial developers look at the first cost and don't really care about future utility payments or impacts because they will sell the building and not have to pay those bills.''
 ''Unless the capital that's buying buildings is willing to pay for true sustainability,'' Mr. Boggiano said, ''developers are going to go for cheaper costs. So if a fund is willing to say that green is going to be one of our criteria, and they're willing to invest in those front costs, that actually is the best way to have an impact.''

HEADLINE: North Carolina: Board Passes Plan to Restrict Busing of Students

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The board that controls schools in Raleigh voted 5 to 4 on Tuesday to begin moving away from a policy of busing children throughout the district to achieve economic diversity. Under the plan, subject to final approval this month, students would no longer be assigned by socioeconomic background, and ''community assignment zones'' would restrict busing distances. Wake County's current plan, adopted in 2000, kept schools racially integrated but grew unpopular with parents.

HEADLINE: Slumbering Pittsburgh Neighborhood Reawakens

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE H. O'TOOLE

 BODY:
PITTSBURGH -- In the 1950s, the East Liberty neighborhood five miles east of downtown was Pennsylvania's third-largest shopping district, behind Center City Philadelphia and downtown Pittsburgh, with more than 500 local businesses and a population of 14,000. 
 The suburbs began to draw residents from the densely populated area in the late 1950s, however, and urban renewal schemes like high-rise public housing and ring roads were enacted to stem the flight. Instead, they drove the area into a 40-year coma. By the 1980s East Liberty had lost more than one million square feet of commercial space and half its population. 
 Now, two recent major commercial developments have begun to put a still-poor neighborhood back on its feet. New design standards have restored the traditional urban street grid to attract shoppers to national retailers, and a third office and retail project, a converted Nabisco bakery, has landed Google as an anchor tenant. 
 ''Urban renewal has been a recurring theme in East Liberty for the past 50 years,'' said Sabina Deitrick, a co-director of the Urban and Regional Analysis Program at the University of Pittsburgh. Yet even as East Liberty foundered, nearby residential districts retained their attractive features. The adjoining neighborhoods of Highland Park, Shadyside and Friendship contain the city's wealthiest and best-educated households, with an average income of more than $81,000 a year. 
 A community plan in 1999 led by East Liberty Development Inc. called for attracting shoppers to a broader range of businesses than the aging mom-and-pop stores that remained, reviving the street grid, and creating jobs and better housing. 
 In the decade since, the city has replaced 1,400 high-rise public housing units with 450 new mixed-income units. The opening in 2000 of a big-box retailer, Home Depot, on a failed Sears site suggested opportunities to other developers. Whole Foods, a $7.6 million development on an abandoned stretch of Centre Avenue, ignited immediate activity when it opened in 2002. 
 The development, called Eastside, stretches east along Centre Avenue, linking the Hillman Cancer Center of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, national and local retailers, and express bus lanes -- known to Pittsburghers as a busway -- to downtown. 
 ''We are interested in building the core for retail,'' said Steve Mosites Jr., whose firm, the Mosites Company, brought Whole Foods to the neighborhood with the help of East Liberty Development Inc. 
 National retailers like Borders, Walgreen's and FedEx/Kinko's are pillars of Mosites's $32.5 million Eastside II, and the firm is now readying the five-acre site of the demolished Penn Towers public houses for a proposed 145,000-square-foot Target store. Federal tax credits and financing from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a $10 million loan and a $2 million grant, will aid the project. 
 The influx of national retailers has stabilized commercial activity in East Liberty, but smaller businesses have been slow to open. Among a half-dozen entrepreneurs who are opening restaurants near Whole Foods is Sonja Finn, whose 1,500-square-foot bistro Dinette overlooks the corner of Centre and Highland Avenues.
 Ms. Finn, a 29-year-old chef, analyzed East Liberty's redevelopment history for her senior thesis at Columbia. Her upscale two-year-old restaurant is thriving, she said, but she is disappointed that empty storefronts persist along Penn Avenue. ''We need a higher percentage of retail in the core,'' she said.
 Chris Ivey, a filmmaker who has chronicled the changing fortunes of the neighborhood in a documentary series, said its redevelopment was ''definitely a big success story. But there were residential and business casualties that didn't have to be. When rents tripled on Penn Avenue, a lot of mom-and-pop stores couldn't afford that.'' 
 Mr. Mosites said old traffic patterns and other constraints had posed obstacles to development. Railroad tracks and the adjacent busway remain ''an institutional barrier'' for the neighborhood, he said. Several blocks of Penn Circle, the one-way ring road around the district, have been reconstructed for two-way traffic, but extending the two-way street on the eastern part of the circle and improving sidewalks and lighting will cost $7.5 million. 
 That project will begin this summer, financed by a state grant and two tax increment financing plans, or TIFs, one from the Target site and one from Bakery Square, a $150 million project that combines new construction with new use of the former Nabisco plant. 
 A 110-room Springhill Suites hotel will open there May 1, near a 41,000-square foot Urban Active fitness club. The women's clothing retailer, Anthropologie, will lease 12,000 square feet. Google's Pittsburgh office will build out 40,000 square feet of space in the complex, moving from the campus of Carnegie Mellon University, two miles nearer to downtown. 
 ''It's got a personality,'' said Andrew Moore, the director of Google Pittsburgh, of the industrial-style space. ''It has a history associated with very large-scale engineering of a completely different kind.'' 
 The demand for office space from companies like Google is also coming from area universities. said Gregg Perelman, the chief executive of Walnut Capital, which is a partner with the RCG Longview Fund and the Feil Organization in the Bakery Square project. 
 The University of Pittsburgh has leased 23,000 square feet in the complex for researchers in its department of rehabilitation science and technology, while Chatham University has acquired a nearby 250,000-square-foot office building for graduate programs. 
 The institutions' expansion toward East Liberty has been prompted by a shortage of Class A office space in Oakland, the district where Pitt and Carnegie Mellon University are located. The neighborhood had a zero vacancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2009, when the city's overall commercial real estate market was ranked as the healthiest in the nation by Moody's Investor Services. 
 Ms. Deitrick of the University of Pittsburgh said that over all, East Liberty's fortunes finally seemed to be on the rise. ''Pittsburgh grows so slowly that gentrification means something different here,'' she said. ''The recent stages of development could be a way to reunite neighborhoods that were separated by urban renewal.''

HEADLINE: CF Returns to Terra Fray

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and JAMES PETHOKOUKIS

 BODY:
The battles among fertilizer companies have been rejoined. CF Industries told shareholders in January that it was done chasing its big rival, Terra Industries. The nearly yearlong pursuit included some ungainly moments, as when CF's nominees to Terra's board rejected one of CF's many offers. 
 But an about-face by CF has brought it back with a new unsolicited bid worth $4.7 billion, or $47.40 a share. This leaves uncomfortable questions all around. 
 Terra needs to respond soon. The company did not seem very interested in being sold to CF a few months ago. But then in February, Terra accepted a slightly higher cash bid from a Norwegian competitor, Yara International. 
 CF's new bid contains a stock component, but it is currently worth about 15 percent more than Yara's $4.1 billion. At the very least, Terra's shareholders may wonder whether the company's board could squeeze more out of Yara. 
 CF also has some explaining to do. It explicitly stated just six weeks ago that continuing to raise its bid for an unwilling target would not be prudent. Now it is doing just that. 
 True, CF's earlier analysis assumed that Terra wasn't interested in selling to anyone -- and the math has changed somewhat. Even so, CF might have been smarter not to come back into the fray. 
 Even Terra's advisers have stated in a fairness opinion that the company is worth at most $47.55 a share. Under three different measures -- discounted cash flow, industry multiples of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and a look at similar transactions -- the CF bid comes in close to the top valuation. Investors seem to be worried that CF could be overpaying. The company's shares fell 4 percent by midday on Tuesday before recovering most of their losses. 
 Muddying the situation even more, CF is knee-deep in a battle to preserve its own independence. It is fending off a bid from a fourth fertilizer concern, Agrium. With consolidation in the sector so obviously frenzied, CF shareholders may wonder why the company appears so eager to be a buyer instead of trying to extract a large premium for itself.
 Formidable Lobbyists 
 America's big banks aren't being broken up. Nor does it appear there will be strict new limits on their activities. And while lenders may have to cope with a new consumer regulator, its power and scope is shrinking daily. Surely if there is any group from Wall Street deserving of fat bonuses this year, it's the industry's lobbyists in Washington. 
 The banks smartly recognized regulatory reform was inevitable after the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. So rather than try to stop it, the industry helped mold and massage any changes into a shape it could tolerate. And the latest indications from Congress suggest they've been successful. 
 Wall Street's crew on K Street -- lobbyists' answer to advertising's Madison Avenue -- has been formidable. It includes the American Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the Financial Services Forum and the United States Chamber of Commerce. They set their sights early on defeating a White House proposal to create a powerful and independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency. 
 The lobbyists have successfully scaled back various iterations of the plan. One would make the regulator part of the Treasury Department, and force it to consult with existing watchdogs before imposing restrictions. 
 Republican alternatives are even weaker, alternately housing a consumer unit either in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Reserve. Expect a diluted compromise between diluted compromises -- just as seems the case for the Volcker Rule idea to limit proprietary trading by banks. 
 The Independent Community Bankers of America, an advocate for smaller lenders, helped force large banks to prefund any future possible bailouts. And the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which represents brokerage firms, along with the insurance industry, derailed strict Senate regulation of retail investment brokers. 
 There is one mark against the lobbyists. The International Monetary Fund recently found that banks that spent more to influence policy over the last decade were more likely to take more securitization risks, have larger loan defaults and experience sharper stock falls during crucial points of the crisis.

HEADLINE: Letting a Grape Be a Grape

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

DATELINE: CUPERTINO, Calif. 

 BODY:
 HERE at the rustic wooden headquarters of Ridge Vineyards, nestled 2,400 feet up in the Santa Cruz Mountains overlooking Silicon Valley, the winery is celebrating its 50th anniversary this week, practically an eternity in the California wine business. Most wineries seize anniversaries as an opportunity for marketing and promotion, and Ridge is not immune, assembling a small group of wine writers and sommeliers for an in-depth, historical tasting of its top wines.
 Ordinarily, I pay little attention to such events. But for a half-century, Ridge has made one of California's greatest cabernet sauvignons, Monte Bello, in a remarkably consistent style independent of the twists and turns of fashion. Ridge has also been the leading standard-bearer for zinfandel, which has likewise followed a serpentine path of styles.
 Perhaps because of its longevity and its consistency, and because its wines are actually available to consumers, Ridge tends to be taken for granted, its achievements noted dutifully even as attention shifts to the new, the expensive and the scarce. That seemed reason enough to spend an afternoon visiting Ridge before the celebration. 
 Over the last few years I've had the opportunity to drink Monte Bellos covering a range of 40 vintages. The 1970 is one of the greatest California cabernets I've ever drunk, beautifully balanced and graceful with a pronounced minerality and the sort of herbal accents that are routinely denounced in California but which I think are integral to good cabernet. 
 Meanwhile, the latest release, the 2006, offers all of these qualities, along with the gentle fruit and violet flavors and aromas that you would expect to find in a young wine. In an era when cabernet growers pick grapes ever riper for wines of great power, fruit magnitude and impact, Monte Bellos remain focused and intense yet, above all, balanced.
 Not that Monte Bello hasn't evolved at all. The first vintage, 1962, cost $3.50 a bottle. It's now up to $145, though it is still cheap next to other elite wines. (The vineyard-designated zinfandels are more approachably priced, from $25 to $35.) 
 Over time, Ridge has refined its approach in the cellar, treating the youthful wine more gently so the tannins are softer and less imposing. One thing that hasn't changed: Ridge's reliance on American oak for its barrels, rather than the French oak that is standard for almost all leading California cabernets. In its style and the methods by which it is made, Monte Bello manages to bridge Old World and New.
 In many ways this is a testament to Paul Draper, Ridge's chief executive and winemaker, who is marking the 40th anniversary of his affiliation with the winery. For as much as Ridge wines display the greatness of place -- Monte Bello as well as its two primary zinfandel vineyards in Sonoma, Geyserville and Lytton Springs -- Ridge's success also affirms the greatness of Mr. Draper's vision of applying traditional European techniques to wines that demonstrate the potential of California.
 Indeed, it may seem odd to celebrate Mr. Draper, who attributes his success to what he calls ''nonaction.'' 
 ''Our main thing is to allow grapes to show their character rather than imposing our will on them,'' he told me as we looked out over the dormant cabernet vines awaiting their winter pruning.
 Noninterventionist winemaking has become one of the great modern marketing cliches. But Mr. Draper's beliefs are grounded in preindustrial techniques practiced by Europeans for centuries: rely on natural yeasts for fermentation, use minimal amounts of sulfur dioxide as a stabilizer and otherwise do as little as possible beyond gently guiding the transformation of grape juice into wine.
 Crucially, he also believes that wine's place is on the table with food, which explains why, year in and year out, Monte Bello's alcohol content hovers around 13 percent, even as other top California cabernets break the 15 percent level. Its zinfandels are higher in alcohol, naturally, but not as high as the full-bore, high-octane zins that top most critic's charts.
 Here in the Santa Cruz Mountains, cabernet and the other Bordeaux grapes in the vineyard cannot achieve the high levels of ripeness typical of grapes grown in the warmer parts of Napa Valley. Warm air wafts over from the San Francisco Bay, fending off the fog and cold that blow in from the Pacific and moderating the temperatures just enough to ripen the grapes.
 Apparently not enough for some critics. In his blog last fall, James Laube, who covers California for Wine Spectator, suggested that the cool climate made for reds that were too green and herbal to suit his taste. It was an opinion that stung Mr. Draper.
 ''We've always made wines that we loved to drink,'' he said. ''We've never made for the market. Luckily, people have always bought our wines.''
 Mr. Draper has always contended that he knew nothing about making wine when he joined Ridge in 1969. The winery was founded in 1959, which makes both anniversaries a bit approximate. Four scientists from Stanford Research Institute bought 80 acres on Monte Bello Ridge, including an abandoned winery and a mature vineyard. Without training, they made wine and liked the results so much that they went into business.
 Mr. Draper, born in the Midwest and educated at Choate and Stanford, had served in Army intelligence in Italy, where he developed his taste for fine wine and food. After his discharge and further work for the government, Mr. Draper and two partners began an economic development project in Chile. Among other things, they had the idea of creating a model winery, making first-class wine that could be exported for hard currency.
 When the partners determined that the political climate in Chile would not support a profitable enterprise, Mr. Draper returned to California with the cabernet he had made. The Ridge partners, impressed by its quality, invited Mr. Draper to join them. 
 Mr. Draper had no formal training, either, so he took as his guiding light an 1883 manual written by E. H. Rixford, who coincidentally planted a cabernet vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains that became legendary as La Questa. Cuttings from La Questa were the basis of the original Monte Bello vineyard, planted in 1886 by Osea Perrone, an Italian doctor from San Francisco. 
 Even today, getting to Monte Bello requires a harrowing 4.4-mile drive of narrow hairpin turns around which one can only pray a truck is not barreling. Whatever possessed somebody, I asked Mr. Draper, to plant a vineyard up here?
 ''They were Europeans,'' he said. ''You grew grapes where nothing else would grow.'' 
 Mr. Draper, who will turn 74 next week, has made few concessions to age. He still moves easily up and down the old steps of the restored three-level winery, where the original 19th-century redwood joists and limestone walls are covered in the sort of black mold common in ancient European cellars but rare in California. His new Acura is equipped with a five-speed manual transmission, and he doesn't plan to rest on his laurels.
 ''Every year we're trying to learn something that will push us 1 percent or 5 percent forwards,'' he said, ''and it's gone on for 40 years.''

HEADLINE: A Plan to Talk About Jobs, Elbowed Aside by Health Care

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
SAVANNAH, Ga. -- By the time March arrived, President Obama was supposed to be entering his third month of the year talking about three things: jobs, jobs, jobs.
 That was the plan of the White House -- and the plea from many Democrats -- as the unemployment rate remained frozen near 10 percent and the economy showed only hints of brightening. The administration created a ''White House to Main Street'' tour, giving Mr. Obama a forum to see and feel America's pain, and offer his plan for relief.
 So whatever happened to that shift from health care to the economy? 
 That question came to mind as Mr. Obama arrived in Savannah on Tuesday, where he delivered a 17-minute economic speech and talked to bricklayers and steelworkers before returning home to settle in for another push on health care legislation.
 Those two words -- health care -- crossed Mr. Obama's lips only once in his four-hour trip to Georgia. Near the end of his speech, in which he outlined his plan to give rebates to people who make their homes more energy efficient, he conceded that it had been difficult trying to turn some of his proposals into reality.
 ''These things are hard,'' Mr. Obama said. He drew a sympathetic laugh from the crowd, adding, ''You know, working stuff through Congress is more than a notion.''
 But even as Mr. Obama spoke about how people should weatherize their homes to save money, his advisers back at the White House were working on a statement he will deliver on Wednesday making the case for why Democrats must proceed -- alone, if necessary -- on health care. That decision has created ripples for Democrats, many of whom had hoped the conversation would already be back on the economy.
 Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., Democrat of Georgia, who was on hand for the visit, said he was delighted to hear Mr. Obama change the subject from health care. But Mr. Bishop worried about the prospect of a bitter fight over the matter for the next month.
 ''Health care is important,'' he said, wheeling a suitcase behind him for his trip back to Washington. ''But it's jobs, period. We need to talk about jobs.''
 Democrats on midterm election ballots feel a growing sense of worry that the year is quickly ticking away. If the next chapter of the health care debate consumes the month of March, will there be time to pursue other legislation before campaigning begins in earnest?
 The trip was Mr. Obama's first to Georgia since campaigning against Hillary Rodham Clinton nearly two years ago in the presidential race. He was greeted by an editorial in The Savannah Morning News, with a headline declaring: ''Welcome Mr. President: It's about jobs.''
 The president may not have had time to pick up the local paper in his brief visit, but he acknowledged in his speech that he understood.
 ''When it comes to domestic policy, I have no more important job as president than seeing to it that every American who wants to work, and is able to work, can find a job, and a job that pays a living wage,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That was my focus last year, and that is my focus this year.''
 In his speech before about 300 people at Savannah Technical College, the president urged Congress to approve a $6 billion proposal to provide cash rebates to homeowners who replace windows, insulate or install energy-saving heating and cooling systems. The so-called cash-for-caulkers initiative -- modeled after the popular cash-for-clunkers program for old cars -- would offer rebates directly at stores.
 Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, said it was refreshing to hear Mr. Obama set aside health care -- even briefly -- to discuss the economy, even if the two parties do not see eye to eye on all of the proposals to create job growth.
 ''As long as we're talking about jobs, it's a positive thing,'' Mr. Kingston said. ''It will really hurt the tone by shoving health care through. It will spill over to other very important issues, and it's going to be harder for us to get other things done.''
 As Mr. Kingston spoke, the president finished shaking hands and left the stage inside the college auditorium. A few moments later, the White House released a letter Mr. Obama had sent to Congressional leaders, saying he was interested in accepting four Republican ideas on health care legislation.
 He intended to move forward whether they joined him or not, aides said, so the White House could return to its originally scheduled message of jobs, jobs, jobs.

HEADLINE: American Envoys Arrive in Beijing to Try to Mend Relations

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Two senior United States officials arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for meetings aimed at smoothing relations with China after months of economic and political disputes.
 The officials, Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg and Jeffrey A. Bader, the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, are to hold high-level discussions with Chinese officials ''about the broad U.S.-China relationship, where we are at this stage,'' the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley, said Monday. 
 ''We've gone through a bit of a bumpy path here,'' he said, ''and I think there's an interest both within the United States and China to get back to business as usual as quickly as possible.''
 The nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea are among the issues that will be discussed, Mr. Crowley said. Both China and the United States have sought to persuade North Korea to return to six-party talks over its nuclear-weapons programs, and President Obama is seeking to enlist Beijing's support for sanctions on Iran over its intent to enrich nuclear fuel to levels that would put nuclear arms within reach.
 China so far has resisted sanctions against Iran, an important supplier of oil and natural gas.
 Mr. Obama took office pledging to make closer relations with China a centerpiece of his foreign policy. But relations have become strained in the months since Mr. Obama visited Beijing in November, with the White House complaining about China's currency and trade policies, and Beijing sharply criticizing Mr. Obama for approving the sale of arms to Taiwan and holding a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama.
 The government's main English-language newspaper, China Daily, quoted a Chinese expert on Monday as saying that the American emissaries were seeking to ''save strained bilateral ties.'' Mr. Steinberg may invite senior Chinese officials to visit the United States, perhaps to attend a conference on nuclear security in April, according to Da Wei, an expert on United States affairs at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, who was quoted by the paper.
 The United States Embassy declined to comment on whom Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Bader would meet in Beijing. They are expected to leave on Thursday for meetings in Tokyo.

HEADLINE: Possibility of Senate Run, Nurtured and Abandoned

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, Harold E. Ford Jr. had a telephone conversation with his friend Doug Band, the powerful counselor to former President Bill Clinton.
 Mr. Ford, the former Tennessee congressman who now works on Wall Street, wanted to discuss a potential challenge to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in New York's Democratic primary, a possibility he had flirted with for weeks. 
 But Mr. Band was not encouraging. He told Mr. Ford that with Democrats reeling from political setbacks across the country, it would be bad for the party and his career if he entered the race. ''It's not the right thing to do,'' he said, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation.
 A Ford spokesman confirmed the call but denied that Mr. Ford had been discouraged from running or that he had been told that doing so would hurt the party. The spokesman said Mr. Band told him the White House had pressured Mr. Clinton into supporting Ms. Gillibrand. 
 Mr. Ford's decision not to run for the Senate, which he disclosed on Tuesday, came after he reached out to dozens of donors, advocates and political leaders. In private conversations, the same worries emerged: that a race against Ms. Gillibrand would be a brutal fight, dominated by endless debates about when he began paying taxes as a New York resident and the sincerity of his support for gay marriage and abortion rights. 
 A campaign that he had hoped would focus on tax cuts and job growth would instead, he feared, become mired in discussions of ''who got there first, and who meant it the most,'' on social issues, he told an associate. That might allow a Republican opponent to swoop in and take the seat from the bloodied Democratic nominee. 
 What seemed to weigh on him, interviews with dozens of people who have met and spoken to his advisers revealed, was not his status as a carpetbagger who had moved to New York from Tennessee, but rather the reality that there were few easy constituencies for him to grab on to, outside of Wall Street, where he has worked since moving here in 2006. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be seen as disclosing private conversations.
 As he hopscotched from city to city, charming crowds with bits of his Southern biography, signs of trouble for Mr. Ford emerged. His voting record in Congress put him on the right fringes of state Democrats, and his $2 million-a-year job at Merrill Lynch made it hard to run as a Scott Brown-style populist. 
 What seemed like an improbable, even impossible campaign had its roots in conversations, many dating back a year, among Mr. Ford, 39, and a coterie of powerful friends from New York City, Washington and Los Angeles. 
 Over dinner last July at the Post House, a clubby steakhouse on the Upper East Side, Richard Plepler, a co-president of HBO, urged Mr. Ford to restart his political career in New York. ''I think you should give this serious thought,'' he said, of the Senate race. Mr. Ford replied that he would. 
 After the dinner, Mr. Plepler sent an e-mail message to Douglas E. Schoen, a top Democratic pollster, to bounce the idea off him. Mr. Schoen was intrigued, and as he studied public polls, became convinced that Mr. Ford's best shot at reaching the Senate was to wage a campaign against Ms. Gillibrand. 
 Over the next few months, Mr. Ford sounded out many of New York's wealthiest and most politically connected executives, frequently over breakfast at the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue: Robert Wolf, the head of the United States investment banking division at UBS; Ronald Perelman, the billionaire chairman of Revlon; and Steven Rattner, the founder of Quadrangle, the private equity firm, all of whom are big Democratic donors. 
 Mr. Rattner told Mr. Ford, who is also a political analyst on NBC, that money would not be a problem. ''You can raise the money,'' he told him in December. 
 Yet several big-name donors warned him that Ms. Gillibrand, a relentless campaigner, had beaten him to the punch. ''She has already locked a lot of Wall Street up'' was the message that Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge fund manager, conveyed to Mr. Ford in a telephone conversation. 
 As Mr. Ford traveled outside New York City, especially upstate, he found political support for Ms. Gillibrand to be shallow, and the hunger for change palpable. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, told him that residents there were ''scared and desperate'' about the economy, and she told Mr. Ford that Ms. Gillibrand was a rare presence in her city. 
 But Ms. Gillibrand's strategy of portraying Mr. Ford as a showboating out-of-towner was starting to stick. In late January, the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, held a luncheon for Mr. Ford, and invited local lawmakers. During a two-hour question-and-answer session, Marty Markowitz, the borough president, pointed to several up-and-coming state senators around the room and observed that all of them had greater experience in New York politics than Mr. Ford. 
 ''With all due respect,'' he asked Mr. Ford, ''why do you think you have what it takes to be New York's senator?''
 Even lawmakers who seemed open to a Ford candidacy warned him that peeling away support from Ms. Gillibrand would be harder than it seemed. 
 Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, told Mr. Ford between bites of an omelet at a diner near his office, ''It's difficult to make a strong case against her here.'' Ms. Gillibrand, he explained, had just secured $4 million worth of federal stimulus money to train his constituents for green jobs. Mr. Ford knew that some liberals would attack his relatively conservative voting record but, those he spoke with said, he was taken aback by the depth of the anger he encountered from advocates for abortion rights and gay marriage. 
 After reporters found examples of Mr. Ford calling himself pro-life during his time in Congress, Mr. Ford vehemently pushed back, saying he had always supported a woman's right to choose. He assumed that would put the matter to rest. It did not. ''He was dumbfounded that it kept tripping him up,'' a friend said. 
 One of Mr. Ford's top advisers, Bradley Tusk, the campaign manager for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 2009 re-election, arranged a meeting for Mr. Ford with a close Bloomberg ally, Kelli Conlin, the head of Naral-Pro Choice of New York. Mr. Ford expected a polite conversation that would help neutralize a foe. Ms. Conlin, however, started the meeting by quizzing Mr. Ford on his voting record and public statements. 
 Did he realize, she asked, that he had backed legislation that would outlaw late-term abortions even when a woman's health is in danger?
 Far from conciliatory, Mr. Ford wanted to know why Naral allowed Ms. Gillibrand to vote for a health care bill that cut off financing for abortions. ''You gave her a pass,'' he said. Before leaving, Mr. Ford told Ms. Conlin that if he chose to run he hoped to return to ask for the group's support. Ms. Conlin responded: ''We can never support you if you take these positions.'' Mr. Ford ''looked shocked,'' a person in the room said. 
 His meeting with gay rights advocates on Feb. 24 was rockier still. When he walked into the headquarters of the Stonewall Democrats in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, he was greeted by signs that read ''Liar!'' and ''Go home snake oil Harry,'' a reference to his recent support for gay marriage after having twice voted to outlaw it in Congress.
 A few days later, the results of a poll that Mr. Ford had paid for out of his own pocket began to trickle in, giving his advisers pause. His negative ratings had increased slightly. A liberal primary electorate seemed wary about portions of his record. Ms. Gillibrand remained vulnerable, the data showed, but Mr. Ford's chance seemed to be 50-50. ''It was not a slam dunk, at all,'' said a person who spoke with him and was briefed on the data. 
 Mr. Tusk had told associates that to win, Mr. Ford needed 80 percent of the state's black vote, a tall order, but not inconceivable for an African-American in a Democratic primary. But by the end of the week, Gov. David A. Paterson and Representative Charles B. Rangel had become embroiled in ethics scandals. New York's black political elite was in seeming disarray, just when he needed them to be organized and unified. 
 By Sunday, he had made up his mind not to run. He told his wife, Emily, and his father, former Representative Harold Ford Sr. He began to call friends the next evening, leaving many of them brief messages. 
 ''I'm not going to run this time,'' he said in one message. ''Thank you for your support.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the reasons that Harold E. Ford Jr., a former congressman from Tennessee, abandoned his bid to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York misspelled, in some editions, the given name of the leader of Naral Pro-Choice New York, who grilled Mr. Ford on his abortion rights voting record. She is Kelli Conlin, not Kelly. The article also misidentified the New York neighborhood that includes the headquarters of the Stonewall Democrats, who met with Mr. Ford. It is Greenwich Village, not Chelsea.

HEADLINE: California Ex-Governor Announces Encore Run

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- If Attorney General Jerry Brown, who formally announced his candidacy for governor of California on Tuesday, is to succeed in his efforts to return to the job he held for eight years, he will have to convince an angry electorate that a career politician is the right choice at a time when voters here -- and nationwide -- seem to have little patience for that particular breed. 
 The Field poll of voters in the state, for instance, shows that the Legislature has a meager 16 percent approval rating and that nearly half feel that California is on the wrong track. 
 And while Mr. Brown says he agrees, in his Web video announcing his encore campaign he repeatedly mentioned his experience, which besides the governorship includes a term as California's secretary of state, two terms as mayor of Oakland and his current attorney general post. 
 ''Some people say that if you've been around the process you can't handle the job, that we need to go out and find an outsider who knows virtually nothing about state government,'' said Mr. Brown, a Democrat whose resume also includes three failed bids for the Democratic presidential nomination. ''Well, we tried that, and it doesn't work.''
 Those remarks were intended as a jab at Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a movie actor turned Republican politician whose popularity is also low, as well as at Mr. Brown's most likely opponent, Meg Whitman, the Republican front-runner and former chief executive of eBay, who is a political novice. 
 On Tuesday, Ms. Whitman said that was her biggest strength. ''I've spent my career in the private sector creating jobs,'' she said, characterizing Mr. Brown's 40-year political career as ''a trail of failed experiments, big-government spending and higher taxes.'' 
 ''The definition of insanity,'' she added, ''is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.'' 
 Ms. Whitman's competition for the Republican nomination -- to be decided in a June primary -- is Steve Poizner, the state insurance commissioner, who also said the election should be ''about the future of California, not the past.''
 ''The last person they are going to turn to is a person like Jerry, the consummate career politician,'' Mr. Poizner said in an interview last week. 
 Mr. Brown has been a nearly constant presence in California politics since the late 1960s, when he followed his father, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, into what amounts to the family business. And as months of speculation about his candidacy wore on and Ms. Whitman spent millions trying to raise her public profile, Mr. Brown seemed to be banking on his name recognition. 
 His fame will also be called upon to bridge a likely fund-raising gap: Both Ms. Whitman and Mr. Poizner have large personal fortunes and have donated heavily to their own campaigns. Mr. Brown has about $12.1 million on hand, according to his campaign.
 Mr. Brown turns 72 in April and would be the state's oldest governor.
 In his Web video, he described himself as ''someone with insider's knowledge but an outsider's mind.'' And sure enough, Mr. Brown has proved to be something of political chameleon. 
 At various times, he has been seen as an eccentric chief executive (his Governor Moonbeam days, during his first time in office); a tough-on-crime lawman (as Oakland's mayor); and a populist attorney general (his current incarnation, during which he has filed civil actions against banks and staked out socially liberal positions like support for same-sex marriage).
 Jack Citrin, the director of Institute for Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, said Mr. Brown was unlikely to dwell on the details of his previous governorship, from 1975 to 1983, which saw the passage of Proposition 13 -- an antitax measure blamed by some for the state's current fiscal problems -- and a second-term recession. 
 ''As far as he'll mention it, it will be, 'Look, I've got experience, I've been in government, I've run a city, I've been attorney general, dealing with crime and punishment, which people think is critical, and then here you have this woman who is parachuting in from another world,'' Mr. Citrin said, referring to a potential attack on Ms. Whitman.
 In a head-to-head contest, Mr. Brown narrowly leads Ms. Whitman, with Mr. Brown getting strong support among Democrats, said Mark Baldassare, president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, which polls voter sentiment.
 Independents, who make up more than 20 percent of the California electorate, ''are pretty undecided,'' Mr. Baldassare said.
 Independents have played major roles in dealing the Democrats losses in the recent Massachusetts Senate race and in governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey. 
 But Mr. Brown says that the problems facing California -- including a $20 billion deficit and an unemployment rate of more than 12 percent -- are so profound that they need someone who has taken the reins before.
 ''Our state is in serious trouble, and the next governor must have the preparation, and the knowledge and the know-how to get California working again,'' he said in his Web video. ''That's what I offer.''

HEADLINE: Gridlock May Be Ending On Consumer Protection

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A proposal to give the Federal Reserve the primary responsibility for protecting consumers from abusive and deceptive financial products emerged on Tuesday as a potential breakthrough after months of partisan gridlock in the Senate over the terms of a broad overhaul of financial regulations.
 But the plan, which would represent a fundamental shift in the role, if not the authority, of the central bank, still faced significant hurdles. Members of both parties, while not rejecting the idea outright, said they were leery, and consumer advocates said it would further empower an institution that had failed to keep mortgage and credit card companies in check and ensure fair terms for borrowers, even though it has had authority to do both. 
 The push to create a regulator with a mandate to protect consumers from predatory lending practices and other financial wrongdoing has been one of the main points of contention between the two parties as they debate legislative proposals to respond to the lessons of the financial crisis. Most Republicans object to a new freestanding regulator with broad authority, while most Democrats back proposals to create a regulator that can operate with substantial independence.
 Some members of the Senate Banking Committee, who have been locked in negotiations over the reform package, said Tuesday that they had reservations about giving the regulatory powers to the Fed, though they stopped short of rejecting it.
 ''It may represent the best hope of actually getting something done, and I disagree with those who think we'd be in a better position in January or February to get a stronger bill,'' said Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, who announced recently that he would not seek re-election. ''If you look at the likely course of the coming elections, the more likely outcome would be a weaker approach.''
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the committee, and Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, declined to provide details of the new proposal, which originated from their one-on-one negotiations over the last few days. Both expressed hope that they were on the brink of a compromise that could attract widespread, if grudging, support.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, has softened his criticism of the Fed in recent days. But he said he had concerns about possible interference by the proposed consumer unit with regulation intended to guarantee ''safety and soundness'' of banks. 
 ''It doesn't matter that much whether it's housed in the F.D.I.C., housed at Treasury or housed at the Fed,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''If it's freestanding and has rule-making power and is not subject to 'safety and soundness,' I think it will be a no-go for the Republicans.''
 Another committee member, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said, ''My view is that the consumer agency has to answer to somebody, and it should be a prudential regulator.'' 
 Mark W. Olson, a former Fed governor, said that housing the consumer agency within the Fed would have the benefit of avoiding the expensive and laborious process of building a regulatory infrastructure from scratch. 
 ''I think there is a new commitment within the Fed on the whole subject of bank supervision,'' said Mr. Olson, who is now a regulatory consultant. 
 Officials at the Fed declined to comment on the latest proposal. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, has focused on preserving its regulatory powers, which Mr. Dodd had initially suggested stripping away.
 The Fed already has much of the rule-making authority that would be designated for a new consumer agency. It writes regulations governing consumer practices at financial services companies and examines the institutions it oversees for compliance.
 Its consumer division also promotes community development and runs financial education programs, activities that have increased in the last two years after the mortgage crisis. 
 And the Fed recently put in place new mortgage lending rules, as well as protections for credit card holders.
 Many consumer groups believe those efforts are too little and too late, however. John Taylor, president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said the organization had spent years raising consumer protection and fair lending concerns with the Fed, to little avail. 
 ''The Fed has repeatedly shown a lack of desire to enforce the laws that are already on its books,'' Mr. Taylor said. Asked where he would want to house the new consumer agency, if not at the Fed, he replied: ''I'd take the National Zoo over these guys. This is a place to bury it, or at least to make it ineffective.''
 Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America, noted that the Fed acted only after a crisis emerged to rein in subprime mortgage lenders, though it had had that authority since 1994. 
 Other Democrats on the banking committee expressed similar skepticism.
 ''Monetary policy is in the penthouse of the Fed, 'safety and soundness' are on the upper floors, and consumer protection has been stashed in the basement,'' said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon. To accept the new proposal, he said, ''I'd have to be convinced that the culture of the Fed has gone through some radical change.''
 Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and shepherded a regulatory overhaul through the House in December, said he was ''dumbfounded'' by the idea.
 ''When I first heard it, I thought it was a joke,'' he said. ''More consumer powers have resided in the Fed for some time than in any other agency, and they haven't done it well.''
 And yet, Mr. Frank said he could consider the idea if it were accompanied by robust ability to issue rules independently of other regulators. If not, he vowed, ''I won't bring it to the House.''

HEADLINE: Calculating Poverty in New York: More by City Standard, and Less by Federal One

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The number of poor people in New York rose by about 300,000, according to a new measure of poverty by the city that takes into account expenses like housing, medical costs and child care that the federal government does not include in its formulation. 
 The increase in poverty under the city's calculation from 2005 to 2008 contradicts the official federal poverty rate, which showed a decline in New York for the same period, and defied the efforts of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had made combating poverty a priority of his second term and pioneered the new poverty measurement. 
 City officials said the poverty rate could show a further increase again for 2009 as a result of the recession. Although the recession does not seem to have drained the city of jobs as severely as once feared, about one in five working families failed to earn enough to escape poverty, the city's analysis found. 
 Many blacks were bumped into lower-paying jobs during the economic slump, and older New Yorkers recorded the highest poverty rates because they were pinched by unreimbursed medical expenses. 
 ''The recession is not equal opportunity,'' said David R. Jones, the president of the Community Service Society, an advocacy and research group for low-income people. 
 According to the city's analysis, 22 percent of New Yorkers were classified as poor in 2008, compared with 20.6 percent in 2005. The Census Bureau found a far different picture: It said the city's poverty rate fell to 17.6 percent in 2008, from 19.1 percent in 2005. 
 Linda I. Gibbs, the city's deputy mayor for health and human services, said she was not surprised that poverty had risen, but added that the data about how specific groups had fared would enable the administration to aim its antipoverty programs better. Citing Mr. Bloomberg's dictum, Ms. Gibbs said, ''If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.''
 A major factor driving up the city's poverty rate was the cost of housing, which has remained relatively high despite the real estate collapse. To account for the cost of shelter, city officials raised the poverty threshold for a family of four by nearly 25 percent, from an annual income of $24,353 in 2005 to $30,419 in 2008. The federal threshold in 2008 for a family of four was $21,834. 
 When the city announced in 2008 that it was unveiling a new measure of poverty based on recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences, officials said they hoped it would prompt the federal government to rethink how it calculated poverty. Two years later, the federal government has decided to follow the city's lead. 
 On Tuesday, the Obama administration said it would adopt a version of the city's standard, which also factors in benefits like food stamps and tax credits, as a companion to the formula first devised nearly 50 years ago. The new version would be adjusted to reflect varying living costs in metropolitan areas across the country.
 ''The new supplemental poverty measure will provide an alternative lens to understand poverty and measure the effects of antipoverty policies,'' said Rebecca Blank, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs.
 Advocates for the poor have long argued that the federal formula originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty was sorely outdated because it continues to assume that an average family spends far more on food than on other basic necessities, like clothing, shelter and utilities. 
 The new federal poverty rates will be released next year. ''They've shown the way,'' Ms. Blank said, referring to the Bloomberg administration.
 Mark K. Levitan, the director of poverty research for the Center for Economic Opportunity, which issued the city's analysis, described the sharp rise in poor blacks as ''the canary in the coal mine for the recession.''
 ''People aren't necessarily losing their jobs,'' he continued, ''but are moving down the job ladder.''
 Ms. Gibbs said the findings had ''helped us to think differently about some of our populations, particularly the elderly.'' 
 The city's analysis cited the profound impact of public housing and rent subsidies in concluding that ''access to the affordable housing provided by public programs appears to be a more-important determinant of whether working families with low earnings can make it over the poverty line.'' 
 Without such housing assistance, the poverty rate would have soared to nearly 28 percent in 2008. ''If I could wave a wand and make housing assistance an entitlement, you would have a very different story,'' Mr. Levitan said.
 Mr. Bloomberg has made the development of housing for lower-income New Yorkers one of his signature programs.
 ''The fact is, 480,000 more people would be living in poverty but for the investment this city makes in affordable housing,'' said Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner. ''The report focuses our efforts on ensuring that the housing we create is for those most in need -- the working poor, who are on the verge of falling into poverty.''

HEADLINE: Chile Says Rebuilding May Cost Tens of Billions of Dollars

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and MARC LACEY; Ginger Thompson reported from Santiago, Chile, and Marc Lacey from Callao, Peru. Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations; Andres Schipani from Santiago; Anne M. Sorensen from Santa Cruz, Chile; Charles Newbery from Buenos Aires; and Jack Healy and Catrin Einhorn from New York.

 BODY:
SANTIAGO, Chile -- As the Chilean government employed helicopters and boats to extend aid to earthquake-battered regions, President Michelle Bachelet on Tuesday began to grapple with the enormous cost of rebuilding the country, saying it could extend into the tens of billions of dollars.
 The death toll from the earthquake rose to nearly 800, Ms. Bachelet told reporters during a visit to the shattered city of Curico. Overall damage estimates ran as high as $30 billion, Ms. Bachelet said earlier in the day, with about 500,000 homes destroyed and serious damage done to bridges, roads, ports and public transportation stations. 
 Some of Chile's economic engines, like its forestry companies and its wineries, were also hard hit, economists said. The country's important copper mines, which produce about a third of the world's mined copper, are mostly in the north and appear to have been largely spared.
 When pressed for a monetary estimate of the damage at an appearance with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Santiago airport, Ms. Bachelet, whose term ends soon, gave a heavy sigh and said, ''All I can say is it's going to be a lot.'' 
 She added, ''Chile has the capacity, but I think it's going to take a long time and it will mean a whole lot of money.''
 Mrs. Clinton, on a tour of Latin America, greeted Ms. Bachelet with an embrace and vowed to help Chileans with whatever they needed to get back on their feet. Delivering 25 satellite phones, one of which she handed to the Chilean president personally, Mrs. Clinton said that the United States was already preparing to send eight water purification units, temporary bridges, a field hospital and other medical supplies to the damage zone.
 ''We'll be here to help when others leave because we are committed to this partnership and this friendship with Chile,'' Mrs. Clinton said. 
 Access to the country began opening up Tuesday as the government announced that the damaged passenger terminal at the Santiago airport would be replaced with tents to allow more flights in and out. 
 Although a large aid effort was under way, tens of thousands of Chileans affected by the quake that struck early Saturday remain with little or no food, drinking water and shelter, and reports of looting and other lawlessness continued. In Concepcion, one of the hardest-hit cities, thousands of government troops were sent in to restore order, extending an overnight curfew until midday.
 Ms. Bachelet said that putting an end to the violence in affected areas was her most pressing concern, while her successor, Sebastian Pinera, called the wave of vandalism ''unacceptable.''
 The potential for serious economic setbacks in a country considered one of this region's success stories was a central concern among government officials on Tuesday. Mr. Pinera, the first conservative elected to office since the end of the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, said he had not abandoned his campaign promises to grow Chile's economy this year and create about 200,000 jobs.
 But in some outlying areas, entire towns have been utterly destroyed or have ''totally disappeared,'' according to World Vision, an aid organization. People are camping in the streets, in tents and in the hills, and ''supplies are low nearly everywhere,'' the group said, but bringing in aid has been difficult because many roads are impassable. 
 In Constitucion, a town on the Pacific coast that endured both the earthquake and the tsunami that followed, the bodies have begun to smell. The gym has been turned into a makeshift morgue, and residents gathered in the plaza on Tuesday in the hope that relief trucks would arrive. 
 ''The best moments of my life, I've had there,'' said Karina Murga, 27, whose family fled Constitucion to stay with her brother in Talca after their house was ruined. Her brother has electricity but still no water, so Ms. Murga has to use a fire hydrant. Many residents of Constitucion say they will not return, Ms. Murga said, but she wants to go back. 
 ''Part of my heart is there,'' she said, beginning to cry.
 At the United Nations, Catherine Bragg, the deputy head of humanitarian relief, said that Chile was probably the best-prepared country in Latin America for such a disaster and as such required relatively little aid from the world body. Still, she said, ''No matter how prepared you are, there are going to be repercussions from something as big as this.''
 Wine is a major segment of the Chilean economy, and the Maule Valley, Chile's oldest and most productive wine region, was struck hard. Vina Concha y Toro, the country's largest wine maker, said its wineries were significantly damaged, leading the company to stop production and sales for a week.
 ''There is much destruction,'' Mario Lobo, director of Los Vascos in the Colchagua Valley, north of the epicenter, said in an e-mail message. ''We are looking after our people first to provide the neediest with shelter, water and food. There is still no electricity, water or any type of phone service.''
 Elsewhere in the countryside, the story was much the same: wine casks destroyed; huge vats cracked, their wine spilling out; ruined equipment; and structural damage that could threaten the coming vintage as well.
 ''It was a double whammy,'' said Michael Evans, founder of The Vines of Mendoza, a winery in Mendoza, Argentina, a region that felt the earthquake on the other side of the Andes. ''This is all happening when the harvest is beginning, when the grapes are ready to be harvested.''
 In the central valley of Colchagua, a three-day party to mark the wine harvest was to begin next week. Not this year. 
 ''This is no time to celebrate,'' said Jose Miguel Viu, the third-generation owner of the Viu Manent vineyard near the tourist town of Santa Cruz. Wine barrels were ruined, about 132,000 gallons have been lost and broken bottles littered the floor. The smell of wasted wine was everywhere.
 In contrast, copper prices that rose after the quake began to fall on Tuesday when reports came in that damage was less than anticipated, Reuters reported. Chile's Codelco, the world's top copper miner with annual production of 210,000 tons, said that all operations at its major Andina copper mine would be back online soon.
 For many Chileans, though, normality seemed a long way off. Daniela Aguero, 24, who works in Santiago, the capital, was still trying to reach her missing relatives in Concepcion. ''I am desperate, been waiting for days with no news,'' she said with tears in her eyes. ''I fear the worst.''

HEADLINE: Allies for Rangel Fall as G.O.P. Seeks Vote to Oust Him From Post

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE; Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Caught in a swirl of ethics inquiries, Representative Charles B. Rangel, the dean of the New York Congressional delegation, appeared to be losing his grip on his powerful post as chairman of the tax-policy-writing Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday as Republicans planned to force a vote to remove him from his position. 
 The House ethics committee last week admonished Mr. Rangel, an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for violating Congressional gift rules by accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. 
 The ethics panel is still investigating more serious accusations regarding Mr. Rangel's fund-raising, his failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic and his use of four rent-stabilized apartments provided by a Manhattan real estate developer. 
 And with Republicans preparing to force a vote Wednesday seeking to oust Mr. Rangel from his chairmanship, support among his fellow Democrats appeared to be crumbling. He huddled in a meeting with senior party leaders, including Ms. Pelosi, and officials said Democrats were urging him to step down, at least temporarily. 
 As he left his crisis meeting with party leaders around 8 p.m., Mr. Rangel insisted that he was not stepping down. Asked if he was going to remain as chairman, he said, ''You bet your life.'' 
 Pushed on whether he would step aside temporarily, he replied, ''No.'' 
 He said he was headed back to his office to work on jobs legislation, and when a reporter asked if he would still be the committee chairman on Wednesday, Mr. Rangel said, ''Yes, and I don't lie to the press.'' 
 A growing number of rank-and-file Democrats said they could not envision standing behind the embattled chairman given the likelihood that he would soon face further reprimands by the ethics committee, and Republican challengers would criticize such a vote in the fall elections. 
 Representative Debbie Halvorson, Democrat of Illinois, said in a statement Tuesday: ''I believe it would be most appropriate for Mr. Rangel to step aside as chair of the Ways and Means Committee. The American people are facing enormous challenges, and Congress must be completely focused, without distraction, on the important work that remains to be done to continue creating jobs, fixing health care and turning our economy around.''
 A senior Democrat on the committee said that he could not vote to support Mr. Rangel and had informed House leaders of his position. ''I think it's done,'' this lawmaker said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was worried about opening the floodgates to further criticism of Mr. Rangel. 
 Representative Artur Davis, Democrat of Alabama, on Tuesday became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to call for Mr. Rangel to step down. Mr. Rangel is one of the most senior members of the caucus; Mr. Davis is running for governor of Alabama this year. 
 Another member of the caucus, Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, said Tuesday night that he believed Mr. Rangel retained the support of rank-and-file Democrats. ''In my estimation, Mr. Rangel should stay as chairman,'' he said in an interview. ''He will still have the overwhelming support of the Democratic caucus.'' 
 But other lawmakers and Congressional officials said that giving up his chairmanship temporarily was perhaps the only way for Mr. Rangel to avoid the embarrassment of Democrats joining Republicans in rebuking him. 
 Mr. Rangel's ethics problems have threatened to become a serious distraction for party leaders at a time when they face numerous challenges, including a battle to revive the stalled health care legislation. 
 Officials said the Ways and Means panel had been hobbled in recent weeks. The committee has authority over the tax laws that are central to Democrats' various jobs proposals, and it shares jurisdiction over the health care legislation. 
 House Republicans, seizing on the findings by the ethics committee last week, were readying a vote on a resolution aimed at stripping Mr. Rangel of his chairmanship and chiding Ms. Pelosi, who upon becoming speaker after the 2006 elections promised to run an ethical and scandal-free Congress. 
 Mr. Rangel, who has represented Harlem since 1971, has been dogged by accusations of impropriety. 
 He was one of five members of the black caucus who accepted trips to attend business seminars in Antigua and Barbuda and in St. Maarten organized by the Carib News Foundation, a charity affiliated with a Caribbean-focused newspaper in New York. The conferences had been underwritten, however, by corporations like AT&T and Verizon. 
 The ethics committee admonished Mr. Rangel, even though it said it did not have proof he knew of the corporate sponsorships. But two members of his staff knew, and the panel said he should be held accountable. 
 Mr. Rangel and the other lawmakers who attended the seminars were told to repay the cost of the trips, about $11,800. 
 But the erosion of support for him among Democrats most likely stems from the investigations into more serious accusations, including that Mr. Rangel had failed to pay federal income taxes on a vacation property he owns in the Dominican Republic. 
 The ethics inquiry about Mr. Rangel started in September 2008 after reports that included assertions that he was renting four rent-stabilized apartments in Harlem at a price well below market value, despite rules forbidding House members from accepting gifts worth more than $50.

HEADLINE: Senate Ends an Impasse Over Extending Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE; Peter Baker and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate ended a politically charged impasse over unemployment pay on Tuesday night, voting to allow jobless Americans in danger of exhausting their benefits another month of aid.
 The bipartisan 78 to 19 vote in favor of the extended compensation came after Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, dropped his objection to extending unemployment compensation in exchange for a largely symbolic vote on paying for the aid. 
 The measure, which now goes to President Obama, should also allow 2,000 federal workers furloughed from the Department of Transportation to return to work as early as Wednesday and construction to resume on dozens of highway projects. Senators now will begin debating in earnest a much broader bill that would extend the safety net programs through the end of the year. 
 ''It is time for us to stick together, both parties I hope, in an effort to stand up for the unemployed and get this economy back on its feet,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.
 After holding up the bill since last Thursday, Mr. Bunning retreated under pressure from members of his own party as well as intense criticism from Democrats, who had threatened to keep the Senate in session while lawmakers unloaded on the Kentucky Republican. The agreement essentially allowed Mr. Bunning the vote that he could have had last week but refused.
 His proposal was defeated on procedural grounds, but the senator stuck by his position that the $10 billion costs of the unemployment pay should not be added to the deficit.
 ''We are on an unsustainable path as far as the budget,'' said Mr. Bunning, who said the fight had caused him to be on the floor more than any other time during his 24-year-career in Congress.
 Mr. Bunning's about-face came after his fellow Republicans began to air their own concerns about how the Senate blockade had the potential to damage their political brand while also having a direct impact on their constituents. 
 ''With Mr. Bunning's battle quickly becoming a national cause celebre, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and Mr. Bunning's home-state colleague, made clear earlier that Republicans were trying to end the stalemate. 
 And Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican colleague of the conservative Mr. Bunning, joined Democrats in trying to force the measure through, calculating that perhaps a plea from a fellow Republican would get him to change his position. 
 ''When I was home this weekend, I talked to constituents who expressed their utter bafflement that Congress could not proceed on something that has widespread support,'' Ms. Collins said.
 ''While trying to blame Democrats for mishandling the entire matter, other Republicans also distanced themselves from Mr. Bunning, whom Democrats were holding up as the embodiment of what they say has been a maddening pattern of Republican obstruction in the Senate.
 ''This is one senator,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a chief political strategist for Senate Republicans. ''This does not represent the position of the caucus.''
 Other party officials said that while the Bunning fight was not helpful, it probably would not do serious damage as long as it ended rapidly.
 Republicans were not just unhappy that the back-and-forth was allowing Democrats and editorial writers around the country to portray them as heartless curmudgeons, denying jobless aid to struggling Americans while Mr. Bunning complained that late-night debate was preventing him from watching a college basketball game.
 The attention to the impasse was also cutting into Republican efforts to focus on the evolving Democratic strategy on the health care overhaul, which Republicans are trying to portray as an end-run around Senate rules. Instead, Democrats were having a field day citing Mr. Bunning's repeated objections as evidence of how Republicans abuse the rules to delay needed legislation, helping them build a case in favor of using any available tools to overcome such opposition.
 Complicating the situation was the fact that Mr. McConnell and Mr. Bunning have a tortured relationship because Mr. McConnell was instrumental last year in making it difficult for Mr. Bunning to seek a third term. The rift left Mr. McConnell with little leverage to apply to get his fellow Kentuckian to retreat.
 Not all senators were engaged in Bunning-bashing. ''He's my hero this week,'' said Senator Jim DeMint, the conservative Republican from South Carolina, who said Mr. Bunning was exposing Democratic hypocrisy of embracing budget controls but adding spending like the unemployment aid to the deficit. ''We have to quit complaining about unsustainable debt and passing new spending programs every week.''
 The fight spread to the House as well, with Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, saying Mr. Bunning has ''got a legitimate argument that he's making.'' At the same time, dozens of House Democrats sharply criticized Mr. Bunning, with Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky saying he was ''embarrassed that a senator from Kentucky is holding our government hostage.''
 Even as negotiations toward a resolution continued, a parade of Senate Democrats kept up vigorous expressions of displeasure with Mr. Bunning.
 ''I come to the floor of the Senate to say to my colleague from Kentucky,'' Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland intoned Tuesday with a bit of biblical fervor, ''let the unemployment bill go.''

HEADLINE: The Next Battles For Marja

BYLINE: By JOSHUA FOUST. 
Joshua Foust writes the blog Registan.net.

DATELINE: Charlottesville, Va. 

 BODY:
 THIS year will be the third in a row that tens of thousands of new United States troops have arrived in Afghanistan with plans to ''clear, hold and build'' areas controlled by the Taliban. Those previous surges have achieved little success at holding or building, as the international coalition and Afghan government have inevitably failed to come up with realistic plans for what happens after the fighting is done. Is the campaign in Marja destined for the same fate? 
 The international coalition's strategic goal for Afghanistan is to build ''an enduring stable, secure, prosperous and democratic state.'' Only by focusing on the messy medium-term stages of reconstruction -- those months, and possibly years, after the fighting dies down -- do we have any chance of achieving such a goal. In this regard, Marja presents us with four distinct hurdles. (Disclosure: I work as an analyst for a military contractor, but these views are my own.) 
 The most pressing problem is displaced civilians. During the weeks leading up to the offensive, Afghan and American authorities asked residents to leave their homes. Many obliged: according to the United Nations, several thousand families, representing upward of 25,000 people, have fled the area. 
 But accurate reporting is always an issue in Afghanistan, and the Western coalition put the number of families that fled in advance of the fighting at about 200. In either case, aid workers say that the families cannot find temporary housing or medical assistance either in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, or Kabul. Many hundreds of other residents have had their homes and livelihoods destroyed in the fighting. 
 Then there is the question of how Marja will be governed. Unfortunately, Western leadership is undecided about the nature of the place itself. Depending on which official is speaking, Marja is either a teeming ''population center'' of 85,000 residents or an isolated farming town of about 50,000 or a district with about 125,000 people. But if Marja is a district, it is unrecognized by the Afghan Interior Ministry. And if Marja is a town, then it needs to hold a constitutionally mandated election to choose a mayor, and not face a governor forced upon it by Kabul. 
 Regardless of Marja's status, the choice of new ''district governor,'' Haji Abdul Zahir, does not make sense. Mr. Zahir has lived in Germany for the last 15 years and had never set foot in Marja until two weeks ago. He is also widely seen as an unassertive crony of Gulab Mangal, the provincial governor. Mr. Zahir's main power rival in the area is Abdul Rahman Jan, a fearsome former police chief whose forces had such a nasty reputation that people in Marja reached out to the Taliban for protection. The international force needs to either find more appropriate candidates or hold an election. 
 Good government will matter little, though, if the local economy is in a shambles. Marja's agricultural base relies primarily on opium, and any new counternarcotics policies will wreak havoc; arresting or killing the drug traffickers will ultimately be the same as attacking local farmers. The timing of the offensive could not be more damaging: opium is planted in the winter and harvested in the spring, which means those who planted last year cannot recoup their investment.
 In Helmand, opium is the only way farmers can acquire credit: they take out small loans, called salaam, from narcotics smugglers or Taliban officials, often in units of poppy seed, and pay back that loan in opium paste after harvest. If they cannot harvest their opium, they are in danger of defaulting on their loan -- a very dangerous proposition.
 Western aid groups distributed wheat seeds last fall, but there was little follow-up and it seems few farmers used them. This year, the aid workers should be prepared to pay farmers compensation for any opium crops they are unable to harvest as a result of the fighting, and the Western coalition should help the groups develop a microcredit system.
 Last, progress on these other fronts will do nothing if the Taliban return, which means a significant number of troops must stay for at least a year. Gen. David Petraeus, head of the Central Command, has said that Marja was merely an ''initial salvo'' in an 18-month campaign to also retake neighboring Kandahar Province, the birthplace of the Taliban. Kandahar is Afghanistan's second-largest city, so it is reasonable to assume that many troops will be pulled out of Marja for that campaign. 
 This looks like part of a familiar pattern: troops move into an area, kill anyone firing a machine gun, then move on to the next, bigger target hoping they have left behind a functioning government. It's why many communities in central Helmand have experienced three influxes of NATO forces in three years.
 At a minimum, at least two battalions should stay in Marja permanently, to undergird the new government. They shouldn't build a new base outside the town for this, or ''commute'' to the area from strongholds in Helmand like Camp Leatherneck. They should live right inside the town, providing security and guidance from within. You can't have a ''population-centric'' counterinsurgency unless you take care of the people.

HEADLINE: Fighting Chance

 BODY:
Hemmed in by residential development and the nation's demand for energy, the number of sage grouse has dropped from 16 million to a few hundred thousand scattered across 11 Western states. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to decide soon whether to place the bird on the endangered species list. 
 The service is unlikely to do so, at least for now. The mandated protections could seriously inhibit coal mining, oil and gas exploration and other businesses vital to Western economies. It also could slow the development of wind power, a resource cherished by conservationists.
 There is a compromise solution that could give the grouse a fighting chance. And that would be for the service to place the sage grouse high on its list of 270 or so ''candidate species.'' That acknowledges that the species is in trouble, asks federal and state land management agencies to work harder to protect the bird's habitat, and holds out the promise -- or threat -- of more stringent protections if these agencies fail to do so. 
 For this to work, it will require good-faith efforts from the states and federal agencies. Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming -- more than half the remaining grouse population is there -- has designated ''core areas'' for the sage grouse, restricting development. These could be expanded. The Bureau of Land Management, which governs development, has altered its plan to allow only one well pad per square mile in Wyoming. It is studying the impact of drilling and wind power on the grouse.
 These are useful first steps. But in a landscape already full of threats to the grouse, including grazing, a lot more will be needed to ensure the bird's survival at robust levels.

HEADLINE: In New York, Wall Street Bailout Softens the Blow of a Recession

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In fall 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed and other Wall Street firms seemed ready to topple, New York appeared to be headed for a brutal recession, one that would rival the worst downturns in the city's history.
 Now city officials and private economists are revising their forecasts with a drastic change in tone. The gathering consensus is that the recession is nearly over in the city and, largely because of the enormous amount of federal aid poured into the big banks, the toll on New York will be much less severe than most had feared.
 Not only will the job losses in the city fall far short of the recession that wracked the metropolitan area in the early 1990s, economists and analysts say they will also not measure up to the losses in the shorter, shallower recession that surrounded the 9/11 attacks. Where once the projections called for employment in the city to decline by as many as 300,000 jobs, they now estimate the losses will be about 200,000.
 Nobody is playing down the damage that the financial crisis has caused in the city. The unemployment rate hit 10.6 percent in December, more residents are unemployed than at any time in at least 34 years, and the city and the state are cutting services to bridge growing budget gaps. 
 But the primary measure of the local impact of a recession has always been how many jobs it wiped out; on that score, this recession has been significantly milder in New York than in the rest of the United States. The most closely watched forecasters now expect the city to follow the nation out of recession in the next few months without having suffered as much as other large cities in big states like California, Florida and Illinois.
 ''We've been surprised, too, that the city economy hasn't been hit harder than it has, given that Wall Street was at the center of the financial crisis and panic,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com. ''Of course, there have been lots of layoffs on Wall Street, but not nearly as significant as in past recessions.''
 Mr. Zandi said he expected the job losses in the metropolitan area to end within a couple of months and to amount to less than 4 percent of the region's total employment at the peak of the last boom. By contrast, the nation lost more than 6 percent of its jobs over the last two years.
 City officials agree. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his lieutenants have been telling audiences that the recession will cost the city 100,000 fewer jobs than they had forecast a year ago.
 They have also pointed to other signs that the city weathered the crisis better than the nation. Tourism fell off only slightly last year and declined much less than in some other big cities, like Chicago. Housing prices have declined less than in most other regions. Office vacancy rates, though they have doubled in the last year, are still lower than in most other large American cities.
 But the key indicator, economists said, is the number of jobs lost. ''The job statistics are the most timely, accurate barometer of how the economy is doing broadly at a local or regional level,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''If you pick almost any economic statistic -- income, house prices, construction activity -- it would tell the same story: New York has gotten hit, but it hasn't gotten creamed.'' 
 And the city appears poised to track the national recovery more closely than in the last two recessions, when the city kept losing jobs for 12 to 18 months after the nation began to recover, said Ken McCarthy, managing director of New York-area research for Cushman & Wakefield. ''If there's any lag at all,'' he said, ''it's going to be three to six months.''
 Why has New York fared much better than many feared?
 Economists say the hundreds of billions in loans and aid the federal government pumped into the city's banks fueled a quick reversal of Wall Street's fortunes. That turnaround saved thousands of high-paying jobs and the controversial bonuses that go with them, averting a sharper drop in tax collections and consumer spending that would have brought more layoffs. ''A lot of us had expected there would be 60,000 or 70,000 jobs lost directly in the financial services sector,'' said James Parrott, an economist with the Fiscal Policy Institute. 
 ''Then there would have been a spillover effect,'' he said, referring to the widely accepted idea that each job on Wall Street supports two others in and around the city.
 Instead, employment in financial companies in the city has declined by only about 30,000 jobs, and some big banks have been hiring again. Some analysts say they think that some of the biggest banks in New York, like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have emerged in stronger relative positions than they held two years ago.
 ''To some degree, the city's financial services sector has been strengthened by the crisis,'' Mr. Zandi said. 
 ''A lot of financial institutions in a lot of other parts of the country have evaporated,'' he said, leaving the big New York banks to fill some of the lending void.
 Through the infusions of capital into its banks, New York has been the biggest beneficiary of the federal assistance of the last two years, Mr. Zandi and other economists said.
 ''One could argue that no city in America got as much government help as New York City,'' Mr. Zandi said.
 Citigroup received $45 billion in aid. JPMorgan Chase borrowed $25 billion; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley got $10 billion each. But each gained far more from the Federal Reserve's policy of holding interest rates at very low levels all last year, helping them to amass record annual profits.
 The bailout ''didn't prevent substantial losses,'' Mr. Parrott said, ''but they would have been greater without it.''
 For a change, New Yorkers have no reason to complain about sending far more of their tax dollars to Washington than they get back, Mr. Parrott said. He said it was possible that New York recovered all of the surplus in its balance of payments to the federal government over the years.
 Whether or not that is true, economists agree that the course of this recession was radically altered by the federal aid the banks received. Few are ready to say that the recession is over in the city, but they expect the recovery, slow and halting as it may be, to begin soon.
 ''I think it's too soon to say, Was that all?'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the city's Independent Budget Office. But she said people would look back on the recession that began two years ago and see that ''it wasn't as sharp a contraction as some people had anticipated.''
 Ms. Lowenstein, whose agency was updating its forecast of the city's financial condition for release this week, said she did not foresee the overall job loss being significantly larger than the 157,000 jobs in its last forecast. But she and other economists said they expected the city's employment decline to be revised this month to be slightly larger than the current official estimate.

HEADLINE: Postal Service Revives Cutback Plans

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
Faced with growing deficits and rapid erosion of its business, the United States Postal Service on Tuesday reintroduced proposals to cut costs, close post offices, raise rates and eliminate some services, most notably Saturday mail delivery.
 The service said that without drastic changes, it would run deficits of $238 billion over the next decade, according to studies it commissioned from outside consultants. 
 But eliminating Saturday delivery would take an act of Congress -- something that would seem unlikely in an election year. 
 Still, the postmaster general, John E. Potter, stressed the urgency of the financial crisis in Washington in a briefing before executives of businesses that use the mail heavily as well as the Postal Regulatory Commission. He cited studies from Accenture, the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey to argue that measures more sweeping than basic cost-cutting will be needed in the next year. 
 ''Without any congressional changes, we can manage half of that shortfall,'' Joseph Corbett, the chief financial officer of the service, said in an interview. ''But even with efficiency enhancements, it still leaves us with about $115 billion in 10 years.''
 Eliminating Saturday delivery, Mr. Corbett said, ''is one five or six areas that will save $3 billion a year.''
 As could be expected, two unions representing letter carriers and other postal workers objected strongly to the elimination of Saturday delivery. Direct-mail marketers and other customers of the postal service offered a more tempered reaction because they depend on the agency for their livelihood. 
 ''I think it will be the beginning of the demise of the postal service,'' William Burrus, the president of the American Postal Workers Union, referring to the erosion of customer confidence. ''They've already made a lot of cost savings, a lot on the backs on my union, which we understand. But what's the next step? Do you go to four days a week, three days? Once you establish the financial problems, it's never-ending.''
 Fredric V. Rolando, president of the National Letter Carriers Association, said in a statement, ''I do not believe that weakening our commitment of six-day service to the public will enhance the long-term position of the Postal Service as a critical element in our nation's economic infrastructure.''
 The service reported a loss of $3.8 billion last year, as mail volume fell by nearly 26 billion pieecs, to 177 billion in 2009 from 203 billion the year before. 
 The service is also asking Congress to extend the temporary relief it granted in September for prepayments to its retiree health care benefit fund, which now costs the agency about $5.5 billion a year. 
 ''We need some movement -- the last thing we want to do is have a dramatic increase in pricing,'' Mr. Corbett said. 
 One-third of the service's revenue comes from advertising mail, according to Linda Woolley of the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group. She said her association, which includes magazine and catalog publishers as well as direct-mail marketers, supports the service's proposals because its members, too, depend on the Postal Service remaining viable without sharply raising rates. 
 ''I think it's more serious than ever,'' Ms. Woolley said. ''The economic downturn of 2008 was very significant, the mail volume that went away in 2008 is never going to come back. If the postal service can't keep doing business, then we're really in a collision course with disaster.''
 The Postal Regulatory Commission must offer an official advisory to the service on significant changes like reducing mail service to five days a week. The Postal Service will formally propose its changes to the commission later this month, said Ruth Y. Goldway, the chairwoman of the commission.
 After that, she said, the commission will organize of series of public hearings to gauge reaction, and present its findings to Congress, which would then consider legislative changes to give the service more flexibility in its business operations. 
 Senator Thomas R. Carper, the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the postal service, said he was open to such ideas. ''As the Postal Service embarks on the tough journey ahead, it is imperative that Congress give postal management the flexibility they need,'' Mr. Carper said. ''Too often over the years, Congress has tied the Postal Service's hands and prevented it from making the smart business decisions needed. For example, we have prevented the Postal Service from realizing the billions in savings projected from the elimination of Saturday delivery -- a difficult step, but one that large majorities of postal customers have said they can accept.''
 Ms. Goldway said that today's briefing showed that the postal service was being more open in perparing its proposals for Congress. 
 ''They were trying to change their tone a bit and be more transparent and inclusive, such as showing some of the proposals they were not considering,'' she said.
 Ms. Goldway said the postal service had decided not to change its target for delivery of first class letters -- now 1 to 3 days -- to 2 to 5 days. . 
 ''I feel what was missing from this discussion -- these were all the engineers talking -- is the vital role of the postal service as part of the fabric of the United States in promoting public discourse,'' she said. 
 A basic national public service since Benjamin Franklin was appointed the nation's first postmaster general in 1775, the postal service is in danger of losing its relevance for many Americans, she said. 
 ''It is an icon of the community,'' Ms. Goldway said. ''Think of the role of the letter carrier who checks on people -- none of that was mentioned today.''
 The postal service tries to be an ''independent, self-sufficient business,'' she said, but ''if you don't emphasize some of the other aspects of the postal service, it could shrink and shrink.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths FAIL, JAMES M.

 BODY:
FAIL--James M.,was a true southern gentleman who never met a challenge that did not excite him or an adventure that did not inspire him. He was a successful businessman and a generous philanthropist. Most recently, he served as the chairman of Stone Holdings, his Dallas-based financial holding company. A native of Mobile, Alabama, he attended Murphy High School and served three years in the U.S. Navy before graduating from the University of Alabama in 1949. His lifelong respect for education manifested itself in his numerous gifts to both educational facilities and individuals, including his establishing a scholarship at Birmingham Southern College for "any worthy and deserving student." 
This reiterated his belief that education was the greatest gift he could offer. In 2009, he was honored by the University of the South at Sewanee with a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa. James' love for music began at a young age with the violin, viola, and trombone. He played in the Murphy High School band and continued to enjoy performing with the Woody Herman Big Band and the Swingles in the 1940s. Later, he was a generous supporter of the Phoenix Symphony, serving as director, and the Mobile Symphony; making a sizable donation endowing its principal cello chair in memory of his wife. His great enthusiasm for sports lead him to repeatedly give to the Crimson Tide Foundation. His first donation enabled the University to build the department's media suite, named for his father- in-law, Naylor Stone, whom he greatly admired. In 2008, much to his delight and befitting his wonderful sense of humor, the University of Alabama found a way to thank him for his ongoing support by naming the visitor's room at Bryant-Denny Stadium "The Fail Room." He gained a great deal of joy from making the long journey to Pasadena this January to see the Crimson Tide win the National Championship. James' adventurous and always curious nature led him to make many great trips around the world. He took great joy in bringing his family and friends with him to share the experiences of faraway lands and new cultures; stories of these trips always entertained and inspired those around him. Mr. Fail was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, the Economic Club of New York and a founder of its Centennial Society, the Metropolitan Club of New York, Phoenix Country Club, the Summit Club, The Inverness Country Club, The Club of Birmingham, and The Noah Society. He attended St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands Episcopal Church. James was preceded in death by his wife, Emily Stone Fail; his son, James Naylor Fail; and his parents, Joe and Rosalie Fail. He is survived by his daughters Kathryn Luttrull and Marcia Boykin, both of Phoenix, Arizona; his grandchildren Lindsay, Hayley, Bobby, Marbury, Liza, Grey, Coulter, and Malcolm; his great-grandchildren Stone, Jonas, and Dahlia; brothers Alton and Charles Fail, and a large extended family. Throughout his successes, James Fail never lost his humility and maintained his generosity to a fault. With his beloved wife Emily, he was a shining example of how to live a rich and joyful life. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the University of Alabama general scholarship fund or St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands.Visitation will be held Wednesday, March 3, 2010 from 6pm until 8pm at Johns-Ridout's Southside. A funeral service will be held on Thursday, March 4, 2010 at 11am at St. Mary's-on-the-Highlands, with burial to follow at Elmwood Cemetery. A celebration of his life will follow at the Veranda Restaurant.

HEADLINE: A Word From the Wise

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I was traveling via Los Angeles International Airport -- LAX -- last week. Walking through its faded, cramped domestic terminal, I got the feeling of a place that once thought of itself as modern but has had one too many face-lifts and simply can't hide the wrinkles anymore. In some ways, LAX is us. We are the United States of Deferred Maintenance. China is the People's Republic of Deferred Gratification. They save, invest and build. We spend, borrow and patch. 
 And this contrast is playing out in the worst way -- just slowly enough so the crisis never seems acute enough to take urgent action. But, eventually, infrastructure, education and innovation policies matter. Businesses prefer to invest with the Jetsons more than the Flintstones, which brings me to the subject of this column. 
 I had a chance last week to listen to Paul Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, the microchip maker and one of America's crown jewel companies. Otellini was in Washington to talk about competitiveness at Brookings and the Aspen Institute. At a time when so much of our public policy discussion is dominated by health care and bailouts, my public service for the week is to share Mr. Otellini's views on start-ups. 
 While America still has the quality work force, political stability and natural resources a company like Intel needs, said Otellini, the U.S. is badly lagging in developing the next generation of scientific talent and incentives to induce big multinationals to create lots more jobs here.
 ''The things that are not conducive to investments here are [corporate] taxes and capital equipment credits,'' he said. ''A new semiconductor factory at world scale built from scratch is about $4.5 billion -- in the United States. If I build that factory in almost any other country in the world, where they have significant incentive programs, I could save $1 billion,'' because of all the tax breaks these governments throw in. Not surprisingly, the last factory Intel built from scratch was in China. ''That comes online in October,'' he said. ''And it wasn't because the labor costs are lower. Yeah, the construction costs were a little bit lower, but the cost of operating when you look at it after tax was substantially lower and you have local market access.''
 These local incentives matter because smart, skilled labor is everywhere now. Intel can thrive today -- not just survive, but thrive -- and never hire another American. Asked if his company was being held back by weak science and math education in America's K-12 schools, Otellini explained:
 ''As a citizen, I hate it. As a global employer, I have the luxury of hiring the best engineers anywhere on earth. If I can't get them out of M.I.T., I'll get them out of Tsing Hua'' -- Beijing's M.I.T. 
 It gets worse. Otellini noted that a 2009 study done by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and cited recently in Democracy Journal ''ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness -- not great, but not bad. Yet that same study also measured what they call 'the rate of change in innovation capacity' over the last decade -- in effect, how much countries were doing to make themselves more innovative for the future. The study relied on 16 different metrics of human capital -- I.T. infrastructure, economic performance and so on. On this scale, the U.S. ranked dead last out of the same 40 nations. ... When you take a hard look at the things that make any country competitive. ... we are slipping.''
 If the government just boosted the research and development tax credit by 5 percent and lowered corporate taxes, argued Otellini, and we ''started one or two more projects in companies around the country that made them more productive and more competitive, the government's tax revenues are going to grow.'' With the generous research and development tax credits and lower corporate taxes they receive, Intel's chief competitors in South Korea basically have ''zero cost of money,'' said Otellini. Intel can compete against that with superior technology, but many other U.S. firms can't.
 Does the Obama team get it? Otellini compared the Obama administration to a ''diode'' -- an electronic device that conducts electric current in only one direction. They are very good at listening to Silicon Valley, he said, but not so good at responding. 
 ''I'd like to see competitiveness and education take a higher role than they are today,'' he said. ''Right now, they're going to try to push this health care thing over the line, and, after that, deal with the next thing. God, I'd just like this [our competitiveness] to be the next thing. Something has to pay for'' everything government is doing today.
 We had to do the bailouts, the buy-ups and the jobs bills to stop the bleeding. But now we need to focus on the policies that spawn new firms and keep our best at the top. ''Having run a company through a major transition, it's a lot easier to change when you can than when you have to,'' said Otellini. ''The cost is less. You have more time. I am a little worried that by the time we wake up to the crisis we will be in the abyss.''

HEADLINE: 'Yes' for Texas Governor Is 'No' to Washington

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; James C. McKinley Jr. reported from Houston, and Clifford Krauss from Katy, Tex. Pamela Kripke contributed reporting from Dallas, Rachel Marcus from Houston, and Staci Semrad from San Antonio.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison had all the advantages a year ago when she laid her plans to run for governor: a high popularity rating, a party shaken by President Obama's victory, a big bankroll and, most important, the backing of influential Republicans, who felt the incumbent governor, Rick Perry, was too divisive and too conservative. 
 But by the time Republican voters went to the polls here in a primary on Tuesday, the political ground had shifted under Senator Hutchison, who lost in a three-way race to Mr. Perry.
 Early on, he had courted the Tea Party movement and had wooed social conservatives worried about abortion and right-wing Republicans fed up with Congress. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Perry had run against Washington, portraying Ms. Hutchison as a spendthrift who had supported pork barrel projects and the bailout for the banks. 
 Speaking to supporters on Tuesday night in Driftwood, Tex., the governor said the election had proved the conservative movement in America was alive and well despite the Obama presidency. 
 ''I think the message is pretty clear: conservatism has never been stronger than it is today, and we are taking our country back,'' Mr. Perry said.
 So strong was the anti-Washington sentiment here that a political neophyte from the far-right wing of the Republican Party, Debra Medina, came in third in the race with a respectable showing, despite having only a fraction of the money of Mr. Perry and Ms. Hutchison.
 The senator called the governor and conceded defeat at 9:30 p.m. Central time, when the returns showed she was losing 31 percent to 52 percent, putting Mr. Perry over the mark he needed to avoid a run-off. She thanked her supporters, including the first President George Bush, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Vice President Dick Cheney. 
 ''It has been a long road and a hard-fought campaign, but tonight we fell short,'' she said, calling on the party to unite behind the governor.
 Mr. Perry will face Bill White, the former mayor of Houston, in the general election. Mr. White cruised to an easy victory over six other Democrats.
 ''You have got to give Rick Perry and his team a great deal of credit for being the longest-serving governor in Texas history and still running a campaign as an outsider,'' said Mark Sanders, a Republican consultant. ''Outsiders are what people want right now.''
 The Republican primary in Texas reflects the grass-roots rebellion among conservatives against moderate Republicans and Democrats that has shaken up politics across the country, beginning with the defeat of the Democratic candidate for Senate in Massachusetts by Scott Brown, a Republican. 
 In California, for instance, the longtime Democratic senator, Barbara Boxer, is facing her toughest challenge in years from a field of three Republicans.
 In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist, a centrist Republican, is facing a strong challenge to his bid for the United States Senate from a more conservative candidate, Marco Rubio. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, once considered unbeatable, has a primary challenge from a conservative talk-show host, J. D. Hayworth. And in Kentucky, Rand Paul, son of Representative Ron Paul, the Texas libertarian, is giving the Republican establishment a rough ride.
 These insurgent candidates have been tapping into the anger among independents, libertarians, evangelical Christians and right-wing Republicans -- loosely tied together by the nascent Tea Party movement -- who tend to oppose a strong federal government, dislike taxes, support gun rights, stand against abortion and fiercely protect privacy and property rights. 
 Mr. Perry began laying the groundwork for this race a year ago by loudly rejecting federal stimulus money for unemployment insurance. He also said he would not accept new federal aid for education.
 Then on April 15, he was one of the few incumbents to show up to the first Tea Party protests, recognizing that an anti-Obama wave was building in Texas. That same day, he expressed sympathy for protesters who wanted to secede from the union, opening himself up to ridicule outside the state but playing to a deep streak of provincial pride here.
 Mr. Perry was also helped by the national recession, which did not hit Texas as hard as it did the rest of the country, allowing him to claim his conservative fiscal policies were the reason. 
 Mr. Perry lost no opportunity to portray Senator Hutchison as ''a creature of Washington,'' even though she had voted against the second bank-bailout bill and the $787 billion stimulus bill. He even attacked her for bringing federal projects to the state.
 His tirade against Washington resonated with many voters on Tuesday. 
 ''I feel Perry is strong enough to butt heads with Washington, and I'm not sure Kay Bailey is strong enough,'' said Susie Bradley, 67, a housewife from Fulshear. ''I wanted to send a big message to Washington with all the trillions of dollars they are spending that we don't have and ruining the future of our children and grandchildren.'' 
 Ms. Hutchison, who said she would resign her seat, then changed her mind in the fall, never found an effective message, political strategists said. A senator since 1993, she is serving her third full term, which expires in 2012. She accused the governor of trying to do favors for companies that had hired his former aides. She said he had been in office too long and had bred a culture of cronyism. She tried to hang the 30 percent high-school dropout rate in the state around his neck. 
 None of those strategies worked. Poll after poll showed she was stuck with about a quarter of the people who usually vote in primaries, while he had more than 40 percent.
 Many Republicans were clearly conscious of sending Washington a message with their votes, which, at a local school board office in the Houston suburb of Katy, appeared to be overwhelmingly in favor of Mr. Perry. Federal spending and immigration were issues on peoples' minds.
 ''Kay Bailey Hutchison is part of the Washington system,'' said Greg Seipel, 57, an offshore oil and gas engineer, who voted for Mr. Perry. ''What Washington is doing now is spending, spending, spending without paying for the expenditures,'' he added. ''We don't want to go along with what Washington says.''
 In the past, the voters who come out for Republican primaries have proved to be from the most conservative wing of the party, and this year the party placed several nonbinding resolutions on the ballot that motivated them to show up, among them a measure urging mandatory sonograms for women seeking abortions and another allowing the word ''God'' and the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public buildings.
 Others were concerned with the economy. Earl Bennett, 61, a retired businessman, said he voted for Mr. Perry because ''Texas is not hurting as much as the rest of the country.''
 There appeared to be more support for Ms. Hutchison in affluent sections of Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, where some voters said they thought Mr. Perry had served too long and had become a conservative ideologue. 
 ''I think he's too far right, even though I consider myself a conservative,'' said Van Williams, 47, as he cast his vote at the Tom C. Clark High School in an affluent San Antonio suburb. ''His leadership has been abysmal. He hasn't solved anything.'' 
 In rural areas, the Republican primary took on the tone of a cultural as much as political battle. Many voters in the farming community of Fulshear, outside Houston, for instance, expressed support for Mr. Perry, in part because they say he has helped keep the economy stronger than the rest of the country.

HEADLINE: Still With Obama, but Worried

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla. 

 BODY:
The nation's union leaders said on Tuesday that they were ''appalled'' at remarks made by President Obama condoning the mass firing of teachers at a Rhode Island high school. 
 Coming the day after union presidents sharply complained to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. over stubbornly high unemployment, stagnant wages and the administration's failure to do more to create jobs, the statement -- voicing a rare vehemence toward a Democratic president -- underlined the disillusionment of an important Democratic constituency. 
 Because unions have been so crucial to the Democrats election after election, political experts say labor's ambivalence, or worse, toward the Democrats could greatly deepen that party's woes this fall. 
 ''Labor is very disappointed, whether it's about card check or the effort to tax Cadillac health plans,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr., publisher of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, referring to a bill that would have made it easier to unionize and to tax high-cost health plans that many union members have. ''They're really disillusioned. I think one by one unions will start getting engaged and helping out the Democrats, but it could be half-hearted.'' 
 Mr. Cook said that ever since the Republicans captured the House in 1994 (the Democrats regained it in 2006), labor has played an increasingly important political role every two years to lift the Democrats' fortunes. But he does not see that happening this fall.
 Labor leaders are disappointed over how little Mr. Obama has delivered and are angry over his support of the firings of the entire faculty at Central Falls High School in Rhode Island because of its poor graduation rate. Nevertheless, leaders attending the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting here in Orlando said they would mobilize labor's base for this fall's elections. They hope to minimize widely anticipated Republican gains. But that might not be easy.
 ''People aren't feeling so good about the president because the economy hasn't turned around,'' said Johnny Saunders, a steelworker in Martins Ferry, Ohio. ''There are still massive layoffs, and people really believe that he bailed out Wall Street and forgot about Main Street. I think it's going to be a real challenge for organized labor to try to re-energize its base.'' 
 Organized labor played many roles in electing Mr. Obama: spending more than $200 million on his behalf; getting white male union members, who often vote Republican, to support him; and providing 200,000 ground troops for canvassing and getting out the vote.
 In battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, unions like the Teamsters, United Steelworkers and United Automobile Workers helped Mr. Obama roll up substantial victories. Mr. Obama beat his opponent, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, by 18 points among white males who belonged to unions, while losing among white, male nonunion members by 16 points.
 Now, even as many conservatives assert that Mr. Obama has done too many favors for labor -- they often cite the Detroit auto bailout -- union leaders complain that he has fallen short on several of their priorities. They note that he has failed to enact the card-check bill, which would make it easier to unionize workers, and has not pushed for a government option as part of a health care overhaul. 
 And they are fuming that he has sought to tax some unionized workers' health benefits.
 ''The relationship between labor and Obama is far better than it was under Bush, but some people in labor are still wondering, 'Where's the beef?' '' said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, voiced frustration along with some praise.
 ''We obviously hoped that more would have been done,'' he said. ''We're disappointed that jobs were not emphasized the first year. We're disappointed that the president got bogged down in the health care debate. To some extent we're all frustrated, although we're explaining to our members that he's been slowed down by the right wing.''
 Concerned about disaffection among union members and middle-class voters, the White House has taken several recent steps to show it cares. President Obama has visited several economically battered towns, pushed for a second stimulus bill to create jobs and began an initiative to rebuild manufacturing, especially through renewable energy projects. The Obama administration is also drafting a new procurement policy that would favor contractors that provide higher wages and better benefits.
 Mr. Obama and the Democrats face problems among much of their base. Women's groups are angry that some Democrats are pushing new restrictions on abortion as part of the health care overhaul. Many Hispanic groups are upset that Mr. Obama has not pressed for immigration reform this year. And gay and lesbian groups are unhappy he has not ended ''don't ask, don't tell'' as a military policy. 
 In light of these problems, not having the 15-million-member union movement fully engaged and enthusiastic this November could be a major blow for the Democrats. 
 In a poll of Pennsylvanians conducted by Franklin & Marshall College in January, just 44 percent gave Mr. Obama a favorable rating, a development that has Democrats worrying that they might lose several House seats in the state and perhaps Arlen Specter's Senate seat, as well.
 ''We've seen a decline in support among union members for both Obama and the Democrats,'' Terry Madonna, director of the college's Center for Politics and Public Affairs, said. ''Part of it is that unemployment brings low job performance ratings, no matter what the party. And less enthusiasm means that union members are less likely to vote.'' 
 After labor leaders grew angry at Mr. Obama's effort to tax high-priced health plans, he negotiated changes so that union members would be exempt through 2018. 
 Republicans say Mr. Obama's concession to labor on the excise tax enraged so many Americans that it helped deliver victory to Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts.
 ''There are a lot of things he's done that are egregious giveaways to labor,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ''Obama has been identified as this guy who's really pro-labor in a way that is out of the mainstream. Some of his pro-labor policies are so radical that even with 60 Democrats in the Senate he couldn't get them through.''
 Mr. Obama has certainly taken numerous actions that have pleased labor: pushing through the $787 billion stimulus plan, naming a union-friendly labor secretary and ruling against China in trade disputes involving tires and steel.
 ''He really does get it,'' said the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, Richard L. Trumka. ''He understands what working people are going through and he really does listen and we really have a seat at the table.''
 ''It's totally unfair to say that the president hasn't done this or done that,'' Mr. Trumka added. ''He's tried on the stimulus bill. He faces tremendous Republican opposition. On health care, I give him the highest marks for tenacity.''
 Mr. Trumka said that unions would not campaign for Democrats who had done little for labor, especially on issues like the card-check bill. Even though Mr. Brown's victory denied the Democrats the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, Mr. Trumka voiced confidence that Mr. Obama and the Democrats would find a way to enact that bill, the Employee Free Choice Act.
 Union leaders have adopted variedstrategies toward Mr. Obama. Some criticize him to nudge him to do more, while others praise him, hoping to reassure a restive rank and file that he still deserves their support. 
 ''We haven't gotten everything we've wanted, but we sure get a hell of a lot of things from him,'' said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
 Mr. McEntee predicted that if Mr. Obama got a health care overhaul enacted and advanced a bill making it easier to unionize, that would go far to re-energize the labor base. But Larry Newbury, a longtime member of the firefighters' union in Traverse City, Mich., is not so sure.
 Having voted enthusiastically for Mr. Obama in 2008, Mr. Newbury now says, ''He's not what he purported to be, which was, 'I'm going to change things, I'm going to fight for you, the average guy in the street.' He's not fighting. He doesn't have the guts to push hard enough for what he believes. The ones that voted for Obama, they're not as enthusiastic.''

HEADLINE: In California, Thousands of Citizens Compete for a Shot at Redistricting

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Here in California, Democrats have just one candidate for governor (and he has already done the job), and state lawmakers from both parties seem incapable of passing even modest legislation without a meltdown. 
 But while the state's political class may be languid, a sea of residents is not. Nearly 31,000 of them have raised their hands for the complex and highly bureaucratic task of redrawing the districts of the State Legislature and of the State Board of Equalization, which administers certain taxes -- the only citizen effort of its kind in the country. 
 ''As you know, California is in a mess,'' said one of those citizens, Gordon G. Bernstein-Potter, a member of the Green Party from Vacaville. ''I'm a native of California, and I want to help in some small way to bring California back.'' 
 The wild popularity of the redistricting commission reflects the political climate around the country and in California in particular, where voters have become disgusted with the state's budget crisis and capitol gridlock. Further, the state has a well-oiled reform industry of sorts, fueled by voter initiatives and money.
 ''This is just a sign of just how engaged or enraged people are by the political process,'' said Shaun Bowler, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside. 
 Like every other state, California redraws its legislative boundaries every 10 years to reflect new population data. That job had been left to lawmakers -- at times with the intervention of the California Supreme Court -- but in 2008, voters (barely) passed a ballot measure supported by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and various election reform groups that transferred the responsibility to a Citizens Redistricting Commission. 
 Now, a review panel is plowing through the roughly 26,000 applications that made the first cut -- about 5,000 did not meet the basic criteria -- to find 14 commission members. In California, a state of 37 million people with some legislative districts more populous than many other states' Congressional ones, the potential realignment of power and money is lost on few. 
 The applicants include Linda Crase, who was recently laid off from her job as a hospital executive and who longs to ''make a difference''; and Jade Keala Agua, a 26-year-old employee at the University of Southern California who wants to ensure that Asians and other minorities are represented.
 Redrawing legislative districts in the country's most populous state is clearly daunting. In a Harvard working paper on redistricting, Roland G. Fryer Jr. and Richard T. Holden concluded that the number of possible ways to construct political districts in California was ''larger than the number of atoms in the universe.'' 
 But only slightly less confounding is the process for getting a spot on the commission. First, a panel from the state auditor's office will review the application materials, which include letters of recommendation and personal essays from commission hopefuls. The panel will then somehow identify 120 of the most qualified applicants -- 40 Democrats, 40 Republicans and 40 that are either independent voters or members of other parties -- interview them and winnow the number down to 60, 20 from each subset. 
 In early October the auditor is expected to hand over the 60 names to the state's four legislative leaders, who will have until Nov. 15 to eliminate two names each from the three subsets. From the remaining people, the state auditor, Elaine M. Howle, will randomly draw the first eight commissioners -- three Republicans, three Democrats and two others -- and those eight will then select the remaining six members. The final outcome will be five Republicans, five Democrats and four others. 
 Applicants range from professors, doctors, lawyers and businessmen to the unemployed. There are those whose family incomes exceed $250,000, and those who are barely getting by. All must have voted in the last few elections, and some have had political jobs. 
 ''I have done a lot of community services and thought my experience might be helpful,'' Ms. Crase, the former hospital executive, said. ''I have served on the City Council and served on different committees and thought this would be something important to do.'' 
 Ms. Crase, a Republican who lives in Tulare, in the Central Valley, the state's farm belt, said she could bring a strong regional perspective, too.
 The list is also dotted with professional reformers who worked toward creating the commission they now want to sit on, like the heads of two nonpartisan research groups based in Los Angeles: Robert M. Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies, and Zabrae Valentine, the executive director of the California Forward Action Fund.
 ''I have always believed that anybody but the Legislature should draw the lines,'' Mr. Stern said in an e-mail message, who then pointed out that given the numbers of applicants for the commission, ''the odds are not with me.'' 
 Ms. Valentine said in an e-mail message that she had applied only to see what the process was like so she could assist other applicants. 
 Mr. Bernstein-Potter, the Green Party member, said in his application essay that he had given some thought to how to redistrict the state. ''I am going to use the KISS strategy -- keep it simple,'' he said.
 In typical California style, just as the process is getting off the ground, two other ballot initiatives dealing with redistricting are in the works for November. One would extend the new commission's purview beyond the State Legislature and the Board of Equalization to include Congressional districts. The other, paid for in part by donations from members of California's Congressional delegation, would repeal the proposition that created the commission in the first place.
 If this seems confusing, it is useful to remember that California voters passed not only Proposition 13, which limited property taxes and thus school financing, but also Proposition 98, which earmarked so many state tax dollars for education that it is now extremely difficult to balance the state budget.

HEADLINE: Shifting Soil, Strained Foundations

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
STEVEN DERSE, the owner of a corporate travel business in Nashville, cannot feel his house move, but he can hear it. ''It's an eerie creaking sound,'' he said, and it echoes throughout his two-story Georgian-style house.
 It started two years ago when a severe drought contracted the soil beneath the foundation, which caused it to crack and sink, pulling the house down with it. The noise has continued intermittently, becoming more insistent last year when flooding pushed the already compromised foundation and house back upward.
 This seesawing effect was noisy and expensive. Mr. Derse has spent more than $10,000 to install subterranean piers to stabilize his foundation, and he expects he will have to install more to prevent further cracking and crumbling. ''You lose your sense of security,'' he said. ''You love your home and then it literally turns on you.''
 His is not the only house buffeted by shifting soil. Extreme weather possibly linked to climate change, as well as construction on less stable ground, have provoked unprecedented foundation failures in houses nationwide. Foundation repair companies report a doubling and tripling of their business in the last two decades with no let-up even during the recession 
 ''We've seen a tremendous influx of pretty severe cases due to either drought or too much rain,'' said Dan Jaggers, vice president of technical services at Olshan Foundation Repair, which has offices in the South, Midwest and Great Plains. ''People call panicked because they've got gaping cracks in their walls, tile breaking, grout popping and they don't know what to do.'' Other telltale signs of foundation failure include doors and windows that will not close, chimneys or porches separating from the house and bowing basement walls.
 After a particularly dry summer followed by deluges in the fall, Psonya Wilson, a lawyer in Brandon, Miss., noticed light streaming in where the wall had separated from the baseboard in the bedroom of her 5-year-old son. ''I could stick my finger through it,'' she said. ''I couldn't believe it. The whole back part of the house had sunk about six inches.'' To stop further collapse, not to mention to control the draft, she is having several stabilization piers installed to shore up the foundation of her two-story garden style house; it will cost more than $5,000.
 Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association indicates that since the 1990s there has been an accelerating trend nationwide toward more extended dry periods followed by downpours. Whether due to random climate patterns or global warming, the swings between hot and dry weather and severe rain or snow have profoundly affected soil underneath buildings.
 Clay soils, like those beneath the houses of Mr. Derse and Ms. Wilson, shrink during droughts and swell during floods, causing structures to bob. And because sandier soil loses its adhesive properties in dry conditions, it pulls away from foundations. Heavy rains cause it to shift or just collapse beneath structures. With both kinds of soil, such sinking, called subsidence, usually happens gradually, said Randall Orndorff, a geologist with the United States Geologic Survey. But, he said, ''swinging from very wet to extremely dry weather like we've been seeing lately in many parts of the country may be accelerating the effect.''
 Experts estimate the cost to homeowners to stabilize or shore up foundations is around $4 billion annually, up from $3 billion 10 years ago, although more houses have also been built in that time period. Subsidence is not covered by most homeowners' insurance policies in the United States, unlike in Britain, where the increasing number of homeowners' claims due to foundation failure prompted the Charter Insurance Institute, an industry trade group, to issue a dire warning about the financial drain in its 2009 report, ''Coping with Climate Change: Risks and Opportunities for Insurers.''
 ''The question we need to ask is, are we building to cope with the enhanced weather events related to climate change,'' said Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group advocating science-based solutions to environmental and health issues. ''It's obvious that we need to look at changing building codes worldwide to deal with this.''
 Compounding the problem is that, during the recent housing boom in the United States, houses were built in areas where the soil was particularly prone to shift. ''If you think about it, the best ground in cities is usually taken early on, so the builders and developers have often been expanding into less desirable areas, and in their rush to make money, may not have designed structures to deal with it,'' said David Lourie, a geotechnical engineer in New Orleans.
 Lawyers who specialize in foundation failure cases say states usually have an 8- to 10-year statute of limitations following completion of a house for homeowners to seek relief for inadequate construction given the soil conditions.
 Mr. Derse's house was built in 1992 and Ms. Wilson's in 1995 so they were out of luck. But Travis Fonseca, a sales manager at a biotech company, was able to sue the builder of his house in Aurora, Colo. The house was built in 2000; shortly thereafter the foundation developed cracks that worsened as the soil shifted through the seasons. ''We sued in 2005 and finally settled last year,'' he said. ''It's been an ordeal, and what we got is not enough to fix it but we're better off than we were.''
 ''Builders can't say, 'Oh, look, it's an act of God,' and they aren't responsible if the foundation fails,'' said his attorney, Scott Sullan with Sullan, Sandgrund, Smith & Perczak in Denver. ''They know how to build on these soils no matter what the weather. They've got geotechnical engineers to tell them.''
 Fixing a failed foundation usually involves hiring a foundation repair company to install cement or steel piers around the perimeter of the house's slab or near its existing piers if it is a pier and beam foundation. Once in place, hydraulic jacks lift and level the house and transfer its weight to the new supports. The cost depends on the severity of the problem but generally runs about $1,000 to $2,000 per pier, which should include a lifetime transferable warranty.
 ''It's amazing to watch your house get jacked up like that,'' said Miguel Rivera, a designer of heating and air-conditioning systems, who had to pay $13,000 to have his 60-year-old house in West Orange, N.J., shored up in January. ''It's just immediate. You're like, whoa, up it goes.''
 His dining room began separating from the rest of his house about five years ago after repeated heavy rains shifted the earth beneath it. The problem was made worse when he removed a nearby tree, which was probably siphoning off excess water and providing structure to the soil beneath his house.
 ''It often happens that you upset the moisture and structural balance when you knock down or tear out trees,'' said Mr. Lourie, the geotechnical engineer, adding that planting trees too close to the house can be harmful. ''Plant them at least half their mature height away from the house.''
 Landscaping should, as a rule, be installed so that water slopes away from the house and gutters should discharge at least five feet from the house to avoid oversaturating the soil. During droughts, experts recommend placing soaker hoses around the perimeter of the house and turning them on for 30 minutes a day. ''The idea is to maintain a constant amount of moisture in the soil,'' said Tom Witherspoon, a foundation engineer in Dallas. ''If you can do that, your house will never move.''
 Don't Wait For Creaking
 Engineering and structural-repair professionals say it is relatively easy to spot foundation problems in structures that are more than 10 years old. If you are considering buying a house, look for patched-over cracks in brick or drywall and doors that have been planed. Also notice if there are cracks in sidewalks and streets in the neighborhood.
 In newer developments, it's harder to know if the homes will withstand a shift in soil. Therefore, it might be a good idea to have a geotechnical engineer do an inspection -- in addition to having a normal home inspection -- before you buy. Home inspectors may not have the expertise to assess soil conditions. (Licensed professionals can be found at the Web site of the Associated Soil and Foundation Engineers, asfe.org)
 This is especially important if you are considering buying a home in problematic areas like the Southeast, Southwest, Midwest and coastal states.
 ''My home inspector said my house had no problems,'' said Steven Derse, who bought his house in Nashville in 2002. ''Then it started to move and fell apart like a cracker box.''

HEADLINE: The Job You Make

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
AFTER 24 years as a marketing manager for Coors, Cinde Dolphin knew what was coming -- Miller and Coors had just merged their United States beer operations, and hundreds of jobs were sure to be eliminated.
 Worried that these youth-oriented companies might lay off an old-timer like her, Ms. Dolphin decided to take a buyout and relax. She sunned on the beaches of New Zealand, went whitewater rafting on the Yampa River in Colorado and saw friends and Broadway shows in New York. 
 But after a few months, she realized that she missed working. So at age 55, she began applying for marketing jobs, confident she would be quickly hired because of her Coors pedigree. ''About four months into my job search, I realized I wasn't getting many callbacks,'' she said.
 A Sacramento resident who has survived three bouts with cancer, Ms. Dolphin is not one to give up easily. She decided on an alternate tack -- she would start her own business and thus join the nation's fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs, those age 55 and above. 
 Mining her decades of experience, she created a marketing and public relations firm that helps California winemakers get their message out through Facebook, Twitter and other social media.
 ''I'm having a ball,'' she said. ''I can set up my own hours and work schedule, and do other things I enjoy.''
 More than five million Americans age 55 or older run their own businesses or are otherwise self-employed, according to the Small Business Administration. And the number of self-employed people ages 55 to 64 is soaring, the agency says, climbing 52 percent from 2000 to 2007.
 Like Ms. Dolphin, some use money from a buyout to finance a new company. Some of these entrepreneurs were already retired, but after seeing their 401(k) retirement plans plunge in value, created a business in a quest for extra income. Some had lost their jobs and, after months of searching for work, started a business to make ends meet, perhaps catering, cabinet making or doing photography.
 But experts on starting a business strike a cautionary note. ''The first piece of advice is don't buy the mythology -- all you need is a new idea, that you wander out there, you run your own B.& B., you start your nonprofit and all the birds are singing,'' said Marc Freedman, founder of Civic Ventures, a group based in San Francisco. ''That's what you'd think if you pick up some of these money magazines. This is a pretty daunting decision, and it's also a risky one.
 ''People should start with some realism about what it takes to do this. It's important to realize that this is a trajectory that can last 10, 15, 20 years. That means take some time to prepare, whether it means going back to school or doing an apprenticeship. There's no need to succeed at the very first attempt at this. There's room for readjustment and regrouping.''
 Ms. Dolphin agreed that starting a business was definitely not a cinch. Complicated contracts and legal matters needed to be worked through, and she needed to get up to speed on Twitter. (At one point, she hired a 20-something Twitter tutor at $25 an hour.) But now she is well on her way to success, having lined up Story Winery and two other wineries as clients. 
 ''A business adviser told me, 'Take a leap of faith, and you'll see you're more knowledgeable than you think,' '' she said. ''I think other people can do it, too.'' 
 Deborah Russell, director of work force issues at AARP, said one factor driving older Americans to go into business is that because of the downturn, unemployed people age 55 and older have been out of work for 36 weeks on average. 
 ''A lot of these people have a lifetime of knowledge, skills and networking they've amassed, and it's very easy to use all of that to start a business,'' she said. ''At the same time, we caution people not to invest their retirement savings into risky start-ups because if you lose your retirement money, you can end up worse than where you started.'' 
 A study by Babson College and Baruch College found that Americans age 55 and above started 18.9 percent of all businesses created in 2008, compared with 10 percent in 2001. The 55-and-overs are playing a larger role in entrepreneurship partly because the number of Americans in that age category is rising rapidly. (The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found only a small increase in the percentage of those older than 55 who are self-employed since 2001, although it found a spurt upward since mid-2008.)
 One entrepreneur is Bob Mello, 57. He was teaching English at a preparatory school in Bay St. Louis, Miss., when Hurricane Katrina destroyed the school -- and his job along with it. Helped by government funds, the mansion where Sydney Pollack filmed ''This Property Is Condemned,'' released in 1966 (with Natalie Woods and Robert Redford), is being restored, to be used as a theater. Part will be used for plays, and Mr. Mello, pursuing his love of film, will turn part into a 100-seat repertoire movie theater.
 ''It seemed like a thing I'd like to do,'' said Mr. Mello, who is doing this for money as well as love.
 ''I wish it was just a hobby,'' he said. ''Since Katrina, I've been substitute teaching and doing odd jobs, just trying to pay the bills.''
 He is hoping a friend will donate $20,000 worth of projection equipment. ''This is pretty small scale, but it's daunting,'' he added.
 The federal government has numerous programs to help older entrepreneurs. Traditionally, laid-off workers cannot obtain unemployment benefits unless they are looking for a job, but in 10 states, they can continue receiving jobless benefits if they show they are setting up a business instead.
 The Small Business Administration has a Web site that offers advice and expertise to entrepreneurs age 50 and older. The site says age 50 to 70 is ''the perfect time to leverage experience, passions, hobbies and resources to launch or purchase a small business.''
 Norberto Bogard took advantage of the Small Business Administration's offerings. A year ago, he lost his job as a reporter for a Spanish-language financial news program that Bloomberg News broadcast in Latin America. His job search yielded just one offer, which would have paid far less than his old job. 
 So he struck out on his own. ''It was my dream, just to have my own business,'' he said.
 A devotee of Time Out, the popular culture guide, Mr. Bogard was amazed that nobody had created a Spanish version for New York. So he founded Pie Derecho (Spanish for ''right foot''), a free magazine that publishes 10,000 copies a month and relies on advertising for revenue. 
 ''I was surprised that nobody was pursuing this particular niche,'' he said. ''I knocked on the doors of many investors, but nobody wanted to support it, so I used money from my severance package. It was scary.'' 
 He took the Small Business Administration's free courses on starting a business and legal matters for start-ups. And for advice and encouragement, he often turned to a mentor, a small-business owner whom a Hispanic business group had recommended to him. 
 Mr. Bogard expects to break even with his March issue, his seventh month of publication. 
 Mr. Freedman of Civic Ventures observed: ''There's a growing number of people over 50 who are entrepreneurs. That network can be a real source of support and knowledge. That's no reason to go it alone.''
 Civic Ventures gave its award for social entrepreneurship to Robert Chambers, who, as a car salesman, grew angry about the unreliable cars and high-interest loans often pushed on used-car buyers. After quitting that job at age 56, he founded a nonprofit company that helps low-income people obtain deals on reliable, fuel-efficient cars. 
 His company, Bonnie CLAC (Car Loans and Counseling), based in Manchester, N.H., has arranged low-interest car purchases for 1,200 people. He sees it as a way of giving back.
 ''I had enough assets to retire, but I got very passionate watching low-income people getting taken advantage of in the car business,'' he said. ''Being over 55 and the experience I had was important to making this work.''
 Jeri Sedlar, a consultant on career change and an author of ''Don't Retire, Rewire,'' said two types of people start businesses: those who always planned to, and those who cannot find a job. 
 Those who planned to start a business ''have a leg up,'' she said. ''They have an idea what it takes to be an entrepreneur.''
 The others ''want to use their current skills and market those skills to new clients,'' she said. But she warned that many of these entrepreneurs stumbled because they did not know how to market themselves or did not have relevant or current skills. 
 ''People have to keep up on their skills, keep up with the latest,'' she said. ''You need to be sure you are really a valuable asset. The entrepreneur of today has to be motivated not just to know their skills and the job, but to be constantly challenging themselves. Every day they have to be reconfirming to their clients, 'I'm good, I'm on top of things. Age is not a factor. Here I am doing it.' ''
 Ms. Sedlar said entrepreneurs needed to create a realistic budget and should not rush to rent space for an office or workshop because that could mean high fixed costs.
 She recommended testing the waters before plunging in. ''You have to try this on,'' she said. ''You can't just hold your own counsel. You have to have your own sounding board. It could be your accountant, your banker, your lawyer, your therapist, your trainer. You can't just talk to yourself.''
 Marcia Duhart figured that out on her own. During her final years at Merrill Lynch, where she trained people to use computers, she devoted several days off to testing her idea of teaching computer skills to the elderly. When she taught a few classes at East Windsor Senior Center in New Jersey, people flooded in. 
 ''People said they'd go to a family reunion and everyone was doing e-mail and they felt out of the loop,'' Ms. Duhart said.
 After retiring from Merrill Lynch in 1998, she founded CyberSenior Services, teaching at senior centers and giving one-on-one classes for $35 to $45 an hour. 
 ''My business spread by word of mouth,'' she said, adding that some days demand was so great that she left home at 9 a.m. and returned at 7 p.m.
 ''I've had students up to 90,'' she said. ''I'm 67 now, and I have a lot of energy to do this because I do what I love. I love teaching people.'' 
 Howard Stone, an author of ''Too Young to Retire,'' warned that starting a business can be emotionally grueling because it can mean lots of rejection in struggling to get clients and customers. He said new entrepreneurs needed to retain their confidence and know how to present themselves.
 He warned older entrepreneurs not to go overboard and work 50-hour weeks because that could be exhausting and dispiriting. 
 ''We do our best work when we set a balanced lifestyle,'' he said. ''Instead of saying, I'm semi-retired, say I'm semi-working.''

HEADLINE: Arnold Beichman, 96, Political Analyst

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Arnold Beichman, a prominent political analyst, author and newspaper columnist known for being ardently anti-Communist, died Feb. 17 in Pasadena, Calif. He was 96 and lived in Naramata, British Columbia.
 His son Charles confirmed the death.
 Mr. Beichman (pronounced BYSH-man) wrote five books, the best known of which was ''Nine Lies About America'' (Library Press, 1972), a repudiation of New Left assertions in the 1960s that the United States was a racist, materialistic, imperialist nation. He was also a research fellow at the conservative-leaning Hoover Institution at Stanford and, since 1986, a columnist for the similarly inclined Washington Times.
 Mr. Beichman's articles also appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times, The Christian Science Monitor, The Weekly Standard, Commentary and National Review, among many other publications. 
 He had been an editor at the left-leaning New York daily newspaper PM in the 1940s, but, like many friends and colleagues, turned from pro-labor, anti-Communist liberalism to neoconservatism.
 Communism, Mr. Beichman wrote in a 1982 Op-Ed article for The New York Times, is ''a system that prohibits personal freedom and punishes citizens who insist on such freedom -- a system run by a single party, the sole repository of truth, which brooks no dissent from that truth.'' 
 It rules, he said, ''by terror, secret police and the midnight knock on the door.''
 John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary, said in an interview Thursday: ''Arnold was a leading figure in the world of American anti-Communism. He was a tireless advocate of the notion that in no way, shape or form could Communist regimes be negotiated with effectively, be accommodated, humored or brought into the community of nations.''
 Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on May 17, 1913, Arnold Beichman was one of three children of Solomon and Mary Beichman, immigrants from what is now Ukraine. His father owned a cotton goods store. Besides his son Charles, Mr. Beichman is survived by his wife, the former Carroll Aikins; another son, John; a daughter, Janine; six grandchildren; and one great-grandson. 
 By his own assessment, Mr. Beichman was ''a centrist, and felt that the left left him,'' his son Charles said, adding that his father ''never lost his concern for the plight of workers, racism, anti-Semitism.'' 
 Freedom of speech was also a constant cause. In 1934, Mr. Beichman graduated from Columbia, where he had been editor of The Columbia Spectator. That year, when the ambassador from Nazi Germany was invited to speak on campus, Communist students demanded that the newspaper run an editorial calling for the speech to be canceled.
 ''Beichman said innocently that he wouldn't do it, on free speech grounds, and also because the ambassador from the Soviet Union had recently been given a Columbia podium,'' David Brooks, now a New York Times columnist, wrote in The Weekly Standard in 2003. ''The Communists exploded and called Beichman a red-baiter, the first but not the last time that charge would be thrown at him.''
 The Stalinist purge trials of the '30s awoke Mr. Beichman to the reality of Soviet dictatorship. In the United States, he began to see a cynical effort by Communist front organizations to infiltrate labor unions and promote worldwide Communism.
 Mr. Beichman wrote for Newsday in the early 1940s and was then hired by PM. He rose to assistant managing editor, but was fired in 1946 in a struggle over the paper's turn toward the radical left. (PM lasted until 1948.) As a freelance reporter, he covered civil wars in Algeria, Nigeria, Congo and Yemen, as well as the Vietnam War. He also became close to Irving Kristol and other intellectuals who would become leaders of the neoconservative movement. 
 When he was 48, Mr. Beichman returned to Columbia, earning a master's degree in political science in 1967 and a Ph.D. in 1973. He went on to teach at the University of Massachusetts, the University of British Columbia, the University of Calgary and Georgetown University. 
 Socialism is dictatorship, he told Columbia College Today, the alumni magazine, in 2005. ''The control of wealth is the control over human life,'' he said. ''So if a centrally planned economy decides how wealth is to be created and how it is to be distributed, then they really have a control over human life.''

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
At this point there's probably no stopping the genealogy craze, which for a few decades now has been causing people to go rooting around in their familial past, trying to find out who gave birth to the person who gave birth to the person who was related to the person who gave birth to them. And on Friday night this happy cult may sign up a bunch of new members when an addictive little program called ''Who Do You Think You Are?'' has its premiere on NBC.
 The show tracks seven celebrities, one per episode, back through time, familiarizing them with great-great-great-relatives they didn't know they had and, more to the point, to stories they weren't aware they could claim as their own. Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor, has done the same thing in a couple of PBS specials, and other shows have also worked the gimmick, both in the United States and abroad. It's great stuff for the historically curious, full of musty libraries, faded documents and the occasional DNA swab. But what about the raised expectations? 
 In the opening installment of the NBC show, Sarah Jessica Parker finds herself first in the midst of the Gold Rush and then in the infamous town of Salem, Mass. Later episodes take Brooke Shields to Europe for a revelation as to why she was always so interested in French literature, and Susan Sarandon on a search through the New York club scene of 80 years ago for traces of a dance-hall girl, the grandmother she never knew. 
 Spike Lee, Matthew Broderick, Lisa Kudrow and Emmitt Smith have equally eventful excursions. Some are full of serendipity: Mr. Smith, for instance, finds that the number on his football jersey, 22, plays a role in his family history as well. Others' trips, especially Ms. Kudrow's, are downright traumatic. (''Luckily, there's a ridiculously happy ending that was a shock,'' she noted over coffee the other day.) But all are fascinating, and that's the problem. Some of us may take the genealogical plunge expecting cool family stories like the ones the celebrities get, only to find that we've been ordinary and uninteresting since we were living in caves. 
 The Internet has made it easier than ever to trace roots, on sites like ancestry.com, which is a partner in ''Who Do You Think You Are?'' Mike Ward, the site's public relations director, said users had built 14 million family trees so far, drawing on the millions of census documents, draft cards, passenger lists and so on available there. It's easy to spend hours on sites like this, as I know from doing so after the ancestry.com people built a quick family tree on me for demonstration purposes. 
 But I also ended up wondering if there should be a warning screen that you have to click past to enter, as on a pornography site. ''You are not a celebrity, and no one is going to pay for you to go to Tuscany, Poland, Benin and other far-off places as they do on those genealogy shows,'' it would say. ''Also, you may find that everyone you're related to was nothing but a drone in the vast hive of humanity, living unremarkably and dying unexceptionally, just as you probably will.''
 My own tree, for instance, shows that, on my father's side, Great-Grandpa Fred and Great-Grandma Elisa came to the United States from Germany on the same ship, the Noordland, in June 1889, apparently meeting onboard, down in steerage. That's nice, but more legacy-conscious ancestors would have instead survived the Johnstown flood, smashed a Champagne bottle at the opening of the Eiffel Tower or refereed the legendary 75-round bare-knuckle fight between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain, all of which took place that same year. Similarly, on my mother's side, back in 1881, the year of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the birth of Pablo Picasso, Great-Great-Grandpa George Rose was, according to the British census that year, making an unspectacular living as a mat manufacturer in London. 
 After a few hours of this it was apparent to me that what we need is a companion site to this one, for the more mundane among us: fakeancestry.com. Because the hazard of genealogical research isn't that you'll find scallywags, rapscallions and miscreants in your family tree; it's that you'll find a bunch of ordinary folks, which as the mania for genealogy spreads will make you death at parties. 
 ''My great-great-grandpa witnessed the eruption of Krakatoa. How about yours?'' 
 ''Well, I hear he made a pretty good mat.'' 
 On fakeancestry.com, everyone would have a black-sheep great-great-great-uncle who rode with Jesse James in the years just after the Civil War. But, by way of atonement, everyone would also be related to a G-man who helped gun down John Dillinger in 1934. Everyone would have royal blood in the line, but everyone would also have a connection to ragtag rebels who overthrew some despot. 
 Maybe there'd be a section on the site where drab families could swap ancestors with people who have too rich a heritage, which carries its own burdens. I'll give you two farmers and a dry-goods merchant for a fiery abolitionist. 
 I raised all these concerns with Ms. Kudrow, not because she had had her tree traced or even because she's also an executive producer of ''Who Do You Think You Are?'' but because she has experience as a therapist. Specifically, as a therapist named Fiona Wallice, the character she plays on the hilariously deadpan Internet series ''Web Therapy.'' 
 Genealogy, she counseled, isn't just about looking for ancestors who were historically noteworthy; the most remarkable fact of history is simply survival, through mass migrations and economic depressions and flu epidemics and so on. Several of the stars in ''Who Do You Think You Are?'' seem genuinely humbled by how close they came to never existing. 
 ''To me that's what this show is about,'' Ms. Kudrow said, ''that all of us are here because the people before us endured something extraordinary.''
 And, she noted, it's also heartening to turn the telescope around and imagine those humble ancestors looking ahead to what, for celebrities or newspaper scribes or almost anyone else, is a relatively affluent present. 
 ''They're thinking, 'Really?' '' Ms. Kudrow said. '' 'I have a great-great-grandson who has enough to eat?' ''

HEADLINE: Nation's Capital Joins 5 States in Legalizing Same-Sex Marriage

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was cold and drizzling outside the City Courthouse just after 6 a.m. on Wednesday, but no one seemed to mind among the same-sex couples waiting for the chance to apply for a marriage license. 
 ''This is a dream come true,'' said Sinjoyla Townsend, 41, as she smiled ear to ear and held up her ticket indicating she was first in line with her partner of 12 years, Angelisa Young, 47. ''We wanted it so bad.'' 
 Gay rights advocates hailed the day as a milestone for equal rights and a symbolic victory as same-sex marriage became legal in the nation's capital.
 Washington is now the sixth place in the nation where same-sex marriages can take place. Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont also issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.
 Despite failing in court, opponents of the law vowed to fight another day.
 The law survived Congressional attempts to block it, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Tuesday rejected a request from opponents of same-sex marriage to have the United States Supreme Court delay it.
 Mayor Adrian M. Fenty signed the measure into law in December, but because the District of Columbia is not a state, the law had to undergo Congressional review, which ended Tuesday.
 Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington on Tuesday limited employee health care benefits to avoid coverage of same-sex couples. It was the second time Catholic Charities changed its rules to protest same-sex marriage, having earlier ended its foster care program.
 The new law was already having regional implications. 
 Maryland's attorney general, Douglas F. Gansler, issued a legal opinion last week concluding that Maryland should immediately recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. 
 Mr. Gansler's move is expected to draw legal and legislative challenges, but for Terrance Heath of Montgomery County, Md., it was the turning point that persuaded him to get married.
 ''We realized that we can finally get many of the benefits and protections that other couples take for granted,'' said Mr. Heath, 41, a blogger who lives with his partner, Rick Imirowicz, 43, and their two adopted sons. 
 ''Before that attorney general decision we could have the legal documents, like wills and medical power of attorney,'' Mr. Heath said. ''But there was no guarantee that those documents would be recognized.''
 He said that he and Mr. Imirowicz had worried about what might happen to any inheritance meant for their sons, Parker, 7, and Dylan, 2. ''Marriage gives us peace of mind,'' Mr. Heath said. ''It gives my family security that we deserve.''
 At the city's Marriage Bureau inside the Moultrie Courthouse, just blocks from the Capitol, the mood was giddy as couples hugged and talked about a day they never thought would arrive.
 ''I became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the mid-'90s,'' said Cuc Vu, a native of Vietnam who was third in line with her partner of 20 years, Gwen Migita. ''But this is really the first time that I feel like I have the full rights and benefits of citizenship.''
 Court officials explained that the Marriage Bureau had changed its license applications: They ask for the name of each spouse rather than the bride and groom. Officials who perform the weddings read, ''I now pronounce you legally married.''
 On a typical day the office processes 10 licenses, court officials said. By late Wednesday afternoon, more than 140 couples had filed to be married, the mayor's office said.
 Because of a mandatory waiting period, couples will not be able to marry in the city until Tuesday. 
 City officials say the measure will also provide a financial boost to the local economy. A study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, predicted that more than 14,000 same-sex marriages would occur in the city over the next three years, which would bring in $5 million in new tax revenue and create 700 jobs.

HEADLINE: A New Home for Vintage Wallpapers

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
Suzanne Lipschutz's vintage-wallpaper shop, Secondhand Rose, has been a fixture of downtown Manhattan since 1965. Now, thanks to the recession, it has moved uptown -- and upstairs -- to a fifth-floor shop on Fifth Avenue. 
 The new location has not deterred her clients, who are as likely to be set decorators as interior designers. They know they can browse through more than 5,000 patterns there, sourced from places like a former hardware store in Ohio or a Belgian paper maker. The wallcoverings in Ms. Lipschutz's collection date from 1860 to 1970, including (from left to right) a 1960s Belgian damask, a 1940s American waterlily and a 1940s American caladium leaf (each design is $250 for a double roll).

HEADLINE: No-Child Law Is a Highlight Of Hearing On Education

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is presiding over the rollout of the largest competitive grant program in his department's history, a vast expansion of the government's direct loan program for college students and sweeping new expenditures on failing schools, teacher quality and other big initiatives. 
 Everyone agrees it is a hugely ambitious agenda. 
 So it was not surprising that the first question Mr. Duncan faced from lawmakers on Wednesday in an appearance before Congress was whether the Obama administration would also would try this year to rewrite, or reauthorize, the main law on federal policy on public schools, No Child Left Behind.
 ''Every Monday or Tuesday when we come back to Congress, my colleagues come up and ask when we're going to reauthorize, and between us, I don't know if we have a complete answer yet,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. ''Our position is we would really like to get this done this session of Congress.''
 Is that your position? Mr. Miller then asked Mr. Duncan.
 The secretary replied: ''That is absolutely the goal. There is so much we can do to fix the current law.''
 But questions remain. Neither the administration nor anyone in Congress has made public any new draft bill, and the ranking Republican member on the committee, Representative John Kline of Minnesota, congratulated Mr. Duncan for working with Republicans and listening to their ideas before writing one.
 ''Starting with a blank piece of paper is absolutely the right process,'' Mr. Kline said.
 Still, any effort at reauthorization beginning with a blank slate would take many months, and experts say any successful overhaul this year must culminate in August, before midterm elections gobble up the Congressional schedule. Administration officials say, however, there is much behind-the-scenes progress.
 So far, the administration has outlined only its general intentions for changing the law. Those include replacing the current school rating system, built around the requirement that schools make ''adequate yearly progress'' toward a 2014 deadline for having all students proficient in reading and math. A new goal, the administration has said, would be for all students to leave school ''college and career ready.''
 In written testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Duncan offered more details.
 ''States would measure school performance on the basis of progress in getting all students, including groups of students who are members of minority groups, low-income, English learners, and students with disabilities, on track to college- and career-readiness, as well as closing achievement gaps and improving graduation rates for high schools,'' the secretary said.
 The administration also wants changes in the law's provisions on teacher quality, he said.
 The current law requires states to certify that all teachers are highly qualified, based on their college coursework and state-issued credentials. 
 The administration hopes to refocus that section away from paper credentials to teacher effectiveness, in part by asking states to devise better systems for teacher evaluation. Race to the Top, the grant program in which 41 states are competing for a share of $4 billion in federal money, requires participating states to develop the capability to evaluate teachers based on student test data, at least in part.
 Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana, said he admired several of the administration's initiatives, but he warned Mr. Duncan against being blinded to the grim economic conditions across the country by the billions he was disbursing.
 ''In Indiana, the budget is tight, the governor has cut back, we see schools laying off teachers, we see them closing down schools,'' Mr. Souder said. ''And we come out here and we hear how we're going to spend money this, spend money that. There's an increasing disconnect between Washington and the grass roots.''

HEADLINE: Handling Investments and Investors' Fears

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
DANIEL DUNN has been on Wall Street for 25 years, but his route to investments was nontraditional. After earning a degree in clinical psychology from Pace University, he worked at an inpatient ward at a mental hospital on Staten Island and then moved through various careers, at one point selling advertising for a radio station. 
 Mr. Dunn landed on Wall Street in 1985, and today he is a senior vice president for investments at the private wealth management unit of Merrill Lynch. But he believes strongly that his training in psychology was the most useful part of his education. 
 Mr. Dunn, 58, supervises a team that oversees portfolios starting at $250,000. His personal specialty as a financial adviser is families with $5 million or more in investments. 
 But he says people of all levels of wealth have come to view their assets differently after the financial crisis. 
 Q.What is that change?
 A. This generation got scared. They had never seen anything like the crisis. There were people in the market who were just common Joes; whether they had $100,000, $1 million or $10 million, they all lost a lot of money. And even people who are worth $50 million got frightened. They realized that they could lose a lot, and they are more focused today on preserving their capital. 
 Q.For people who got hit, are they able to cut back if they have to?
 A. For people who have had money and lost it in the market, if they have a certain lifestyle, it can be very difficult to dial down because they are often in denial. It is interpersonal. It is about how they deal with their spouses, with their children and with others. They look in the mirror and the person who has less is not who they want to see. They can still have millions in the bank and feel like paupers. 
 Q.Is it easier for people who are very wealthy?
 A. The amount of money does not matter at all. Their emotionality is the same whether they have $1 million or $10 million. There are people who live in New York and they just don't have a big lifestyle. Their identity is not based on what they spend. Some of them live a very frugal existence. 
 But in some of these large cities, the cost of living is much higher than other areas and therefore people need a larger nest egg. 
 If a couple had $5 million, for example, they should not spend more than $250,000, or 5 percent of their assets pretax. If their portfolio drops to $4 million, they should live on $200,000. That means they have 25 percent less money to spend, and many people are having a hard time making that adjustment. These people need to pull back even more than the percentage decline in the portfolio, and it is hard to make the behavioral changes necessary.
 Q.Is it easier when people are still working?
 A. Yes. I find that if people are still working, they don't spend the money that has been in their savings. 
 Q.What if they are already retired?
 A. They have to discipline themselves not to spend more than 4 or 5 percent of their pretax income in any year. I bring it up with clients because I prefer to talk to them when they still have the opportunity to make a choice. I tell them that if they keep on spending at a higher rate, they could run out of money. 
 Q.Is it always about getting people to cut back?
 A. No, not at all. I had a client who had lost a spouse and this person was very, very frugal and worried about spending money. I had to reassure them that they had enough money to spend more. But people get frightened. I said, ''You have enough money to keep on spending the way you are and you will be fine.'' If you are feeling scared, you should own up to it. 
 Q.Do you think people are facing up to the potential problems of retirement, which is generally considered to be far more difficult than it was years ago?
 A. Generally not. It is very scary. So many people are dealing with school costs and all those other expenses with raising children, and if you ask them how they are going to deal with retirement, they are going to have so much fear that they really cannot cope with the discussion. 
 Q.And once they do focus, what do they need to know?
 A. My concern is seeing people who currently have not saved enough for retirement and are approaching it in the next several years. From a health care point of view, the current system is unsustainable because the costs of Medicare and medical care are escalating at an unsustainable rate. At the same time, government subsidies -- whether medical, Social Security or unemployment -- are unsustainable in their current form.

HEADLINE: Broad Report on Economy Leads to a Mixed Finish

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Early gains in stocks unraveled Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled that the economic recovery would be slow.
 Stocks ended mixed after the Fed's announcement that economic activity had improved in nine of its 12 districts but that the gains were ''modest.''
 The report damped enthusiasm after an upbeat report on services industries and more takeover news. The Dow Jones industrial average fell nine points. 
 Stocks had been up for three consecutive days and major stock indexes stand at their highest levels since mid-January, so some slowdown was not surprising. 
 The market was supported early Wednesday by a report that the services industries grew at the fastest rate in two years last month. Growth in services industries is seen as crucial for a rebound. The Institute for Supply Management's services index for February rose to 53 from 50.5 in January. Economists had forecast that the index would hit 51.
 More corporate deals also helped stocks. In the latest, a private equity firm, Elliott Associates, bid for the 91.5 percent of the software maker Novell that it does not already own.
 Separately, a report on the labor market came in as expected. The payroll company ADP said employers cut 20,000 jobs last month.
 The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that the unemployment rate edged up to 9.8 percent last month and that employers cut 50,000 jobs. 
 But the Fed's afternoon report raised concerns that the recovery would be slow because of weak demand for loans and a mostly soft job market.
 Tom Samuels, manager of the Palantir Fund in Houston, said he was not seeing enough of an improvement in economic numbers to justify confidence in the recovery.
 ''We're coasting along from one day to the next and from one week to the next but we're really not getting any sense that things are being structurally fixed,'' Mr. Samuels said. 
 The Dow fell 9.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,396.76. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.48 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1,118.79, its highest close since Jan. 20. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,280.68.
 Bond prices fell, pushing yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 100 2/32, and the yield rose to 3.61 percent from 3.60 percent late Tuesday.
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. Gold rose.
 Crude oil rose $1.19, to $80.87 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Recent merger and acquisitions raised hopes that businesses would increase spending. The American International Group agreed earlier in the week to sell its Asian life insurance business to the British insurer Prudential for $35.5 billion. On Tuesday, the Dow Chemical Company sold its Styron plastics business to private equity firm Bain Capital for $1.63 billion.
 Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global in Chicago, said the merger news had reassured investors that stocks were not overpriced because companies were still willing to pursue deals.
 ''It's causing people to get excited about owning stocks, and I think it shows that there might be some value here,'' Mr. Kalivas said.
 Meanwhile, austerity measures announced by Greece on Wednesday allayed some concerns about the global economy. Investors have been trying to determine whether problems there will spill over to other economies.

HEADLINE: Town Finds Good Neighbor In Nuclear Plant

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
VERNON, Vt. -- A storm knocked out Kathleen Halvey's power for eight hours last Wednesday, an event she found both disruptive and prescient. 
 ''I said to my husband, 'This is what it will be like without Vermont Yankee,' '' Ms. Halvey, 65, a retired nurse, recalled saying on the day the State Senate voted to close the plant here by withholding its operating certificate. 
 Vermont would lose the source of one-third of its electricity, but residents say the move would forever change Vernon, the small town on the Connecticut River that has been the reactor's home for 38 years. 
 ''It will ruin this town,'' said Robert Miller, 49, who works in an auto body shop and serves on the Vernon Selectboard. 
 The reactor is the area's largest source of high-paying jobs -- the average worker makes $100,000 with benefits, according to the Entergy Corporation, the Louisiana-based owner -- and the influx of employees has allowed the town to expand its elementary school and to build a library. 
 It has also provided residents with a hefty tax break. Many worry that last week's vote will torpedo their property values -- some residents said that the vote probably took $100,000 off the value of their homes. 
 ''It's always kept our taxes down,'' Donna Serviss, 48, said. ''That's the biggest thing people are worrying about, that they'll tax us like crazy.'' 
 Given the reactor's tangible benefits, Vernon residents find themselves defending it against deteriorating support statewide.
 On Tuesday, 15 towns voted to call for the decommissioning of Vermont Yankee and for the state to explore alternative energy. In a new survey of Vermonters, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation for the nonprofit Civil Society Institute, two-thirds of the respondents said they favored closing the reactor because of concerns about leaking radioactive tritium -- a problem that some two dozen of the nation's 104 reactors have reported, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Misstatements officials made before the legislature and a cooling tower that collapsed in 2007 also influenced public opinion.
 The majority of Vernon residents remain fiercely loyal, arguing that the plant is safe despite the leak. They feel that the amount of tritium leaking from the plant is too small to affect their health, and officials said none had been found in the drinking water.
 ''Those guys aren't going to jeopardize their own families,'' said Marion Mitchell, 60, a school bus driver whose late husband worked in security at the plant. 
 ''They don't want that running into the river,'' Ms. Mitchell said. 
 Ms. Mitchell said she took solace in the plant, which sits on the western bank of the river next to a farm. 
 ''To me, it's comforting,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''I know that's weird. I think it's pretty. I like when the steam rolls up off the river on a clear night and the lights are on.'' 
 Residents also take a peculiar pride, joking that the plant lends Vernon and its residents a certain incandescence.
 ''I always make jokes to people that we don't use electricity in Vernon at night because we all glow,'' Ms. Serviss said.
 For others in the region, last week's vote was a victory. In January dozens of protesters marched 122 miles from Vernon to Montpelier, the state capital, to demand that the plant shut down and to lobby the state to look at alternative forms of energy. (In the recent survey, only 9 percent of the respondents wanted nuclear energy to power their homes.)
 Opposition to the plant became more widespread after the leak was made public in January and increasingly high concentrations of tritium were found. People were also angry about accusations that the company that runs the plant made false statements to state regulators about whether its underground pipes contained the material. 
 Sarah Childs Gagnon of Brattleboro, Vernon's fiercely anti-nuclear neighbor, said: ''It's an old plant that has served its purpose. It's time to close it.'' 
 David Coriell, a spokesman for Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican who is reserving judgment on the future of the plant, said the lights in Vermont would stay on, but no one is sure right now who will supply the power if the plant closes.
 ''It will continue to be an ongoing saga,'' Mr. Coriell said of the fight to decommission the reactor. ''If it's not relicensed in 2012, Vermont certainly will have power. ''
 Here in Vernon, people said they were mostly concerned about the impact of the closing on Vermont Yankee's 650 full-time employees and the ripple effect on neighboring Massachusetts and New Hampshire, where many employees live. The plant also pays $13.8 million in state and local taxes annually.
 With a renewed push for nuclear power in Washington, many expect those skilled workers to leave Vermont for other plants, leaving Vernon, a town of 2,100 dotted with dairy farms, with few jobs. 
 Residents are hoping that the federal government intervenes to save the plant (considered unlikely) or that someone files a lawsuit to determine that the federal government, not the state, should have authority over it (a possibility). 
 Those who have spent their careers in Vernon and raised their children here, like Wayne Nickerson, are loath to leave. Mr. Nickerson, who grew up nearby, went to the plant in 1987 as a contractor and now works for Entergy, has friends who earn $10 an hour at a lumber yard, while he makes about twice that. If the plant closes, he said he would find a job elsewhere in the area, probably for 50 percent or 60 percent less. 
 ''I lived here all my life; I'll probably stay here,'' Mr. Nickerson said. His wife grew up in the area, he said, and his daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren are here. 
 Mr. Nickerson said that he thought the plant was safe, but that he understood risk. 
 ''Hey, I just bought a Toyota,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Finds Recovery Plodding Ahead

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A report by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday portrayed an economy that was making hesitant progress but still wrestling with familiar troubles: high unemployment, tepid spending by businesses and consumers, and deterioration in the commercial real estate market.
 In its anecdotal survey of economic conditions across the country, the central bank said most regions ''continued to expand'' at a ''modest'' pace in late January and most of February. But a series of winter storms along the East Coast constrained activity in several areas, the Fed said.
 In total, nine of the central bank's 12 districts reported improvement, mostly in areas like consumer spending and residential real estate. That provided some reassurance that the recovery was on track, despite a recent batch of weak economic data. The halting pace of renewal suggested that the Fed would probably keep interest rates near zero when it met on March 16 to set monetary policy. 
 James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global, said the report indicated that the economy was not on the verge of falling into another downturn, as some people had suggested in recent weeks.
 ''There's certainly nothing in this report to show a double dip,'' Mr. O'Sullivan said. ''The implication seems to be that outside of weather effects, there is improvement.''
 Talk of a double-dip recession resurfaced last week after a report showed an unexpected decline in home sales in January. That stoked fears that a rebound for housing, considered crucial to the broader recovery, could falter despite significant government support. 
 But the Fed's report, known as the beige book, pointed to signs of growth for residential real estate in many regions, which it attributed to a government tax credit of up to $8,000 for home buyers. At the same time, markets like Atlanta, Chicago and New York remained weak or deteriorated, probably because of harsh weather and difficulty securing mortgages, the report said.
 The commercial real estate market continued to hinder growth in many areas, the Fed reported. Loans for development remain difficult to obtain, construction is slow and vacancy rates continue to climb. 
 Demand for loans remains weak in general, with credit standards tight and spending restrained. The report said banks ''remained cautious about lending,'' with the Atlanta region reporting that banks were reluctant to reduce cash reserves, and Dallas saying increased regulation had hampered efforts to increase real estate lending.
 Economists remain concerned about the labor market, and say they expect the government's monthly employment snapshot on Friday to be grim, in part because of the snowy weather. The unemployment rate is expected to rise slightly to 9.8 percent, with job losses totaling 55,000, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.
 The Fed's report, however, offered some hope that hiring was picking up: the pace of layoffs slowed in most regions, and businesses continued to recall laid-off workers and hire temporary staff members, usually the first signs of renewal. Still, the report concluded, hiring ''remained generally soft.''
 While weak consumer spending is holding back the recovery, areas like manufacturing continue to grow, and there are signs of expansion in other areas. A separate report by the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday recorded a modest increase in service industry activity in February, when compared with January. Employment in the service sector, which includes industries like retail and transportation, also improved.
 A research note by Goldman Sachs said the pickup in hiring reflected an ''underlying stabilization in labor market conditions.'' But the note cautioned that ''the impact on the underlying trend is modest'' and that job losses for February would probably still be severe.
 For now, the Fed seems likely to prolong a period of extraordinarily low interest rates as it tries to pump up the economy. Last week, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, reiterated a pledge to keep interest rates low for an ''extended period.'' 
 But some economists say they believe that low rates may be a precursor to uncontrollable inflation and speculative activity. On Tuesday, Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said near-zero rates were ''nonsustainable.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Circulates New Iran Sanctions Draft

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The United States is circulating a draft of new, tougher sanctions against Iran that concentrate on the banking, shipping and insurance sectors of Iran's economy and is now waiting for China and Russia to signal that they are willing to start negotiating over the measures, United Nations Security Council diplomats said Wednesday. 
 The proposed sanctions would both broaden the scope and intensify three previous rounds of sanctions enacted since 2006 in an effort to persuade Iran to halt uranium enrichment and negotiate the future of its nuclear development program. 
 The diplomats said the proposed sanctions called for an outright ban on certain transactions with Iran, whereas the existing sanctions called on United Nations members to exercise ''vigilance'' or ''restraint'' in interacting with Iran in some areas of weapons trade, shipping and banking. The focus is on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which runs a vast array of Iranian businesses, while the oil industry is not included, diplomats said. 
 The proposed sanctions seek to expand other aspects of those already in place, including the list of banks singled out, adding at least the country's central bank to Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, which were listed before.
 The new sanctions would also expand the list of individuals facing a travel ban and assets freeze for their work in the nuclear program. Sanctions to date, which run to about six pages, have singled out companies and individuals involved in the nuclear and missile development programs or in efforts to help to finance them. They include a ban on arms exports.
 There has been no reaction to the draft from China, which has publicly opposed sanctions, but the United States and its Council allies are hoping that James B. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, will elicit a response in talks this week in Beijing.
 At the United Nations, the previous Chinese permanent representative, Zhang Yesui, has left to take up his new post as ambassador to Washington. The new ambassador, Li Baodong, who previously represented China at the United Nations in Geneva, planned to present his credentials to begin work on Thursday. 
 The proposed measures, already negotiated by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, are likely to be diluted in further talks. The initial reaction from Russia was negative. The Russians said the measures were too strong, diplomats involved in the talks said, with one noting, ''There is quite a bit that they didn't like.'' Yet Moscow continues to endorse the idea of new sanctions in tandem with talks. 
 ''When we sought and continue to seek to keep the negotiation window open, Iran has not followed up with the appropriate responses that we expected,'' Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said at a news conference late Tuesday. 
 He said Russia was increasingly concerned about the latest conclusions from the International Atomic Energy Agency indicating that Iran might be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon despite its claims of peaceful intent.
 ''When they are not satisfied with what they see in their cooperation with Tehran, we are obviously also very concerned,'' Mr. Churkin said. ''This raises worries about the nature of their nuclear program.''
 Mr. Churkin said he had not received instructions from Moscow to begin talks over the new round of sanctions. Still, that puts Beijing in the position of being the lone standout. 
 The main leverage the other four countries have in support of sanctions is that Moscow and Beijing still want the forum of six to be the main arena for such talks.
 Mr. Churkin said as much. ''The value of the six is obvious,'' he said. ''I see no reason why the six cannot continue to work effectively in hammering out joint positions in our dealings with Iran.''
 The Western nations want a Security Council resolution finished before May, when the world powers will be engaged in reviewing the global Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and when Lebanon, home to the militant group Hezbollah that is closely allied with Iran, will be president of the Council.
 President Obama is holding a nuclear summit meeting in Washington on April 12 and 13; diplomats say that if the sanctions are not negotiated by then, the leaders themselves may be able to resolve any differences. 
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, on a trip to Latin America, was unable to budge Brazil from its opposition to sanctions against Iran. Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, ruled out supporting a resolution even before he met Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday.
 ''It is not prudent to push Iran against a wall,'' Mr. da Silva told reporters, according to The Associated Press. ''The prudent thing is to establish negotiations.''
 Mrs. Clinton, administration officials said, argued that imposing sanctions would focus the attention of the Iranian government. But Brazilian officials responded that they feared that such measures would only lead Iran to harden its position. 
 Brazil is a voting member of the Council, and while its support is not necessary to pass a resolution, the United States is seeking global unity in the confrontation with Iran.
 In previous rounds of sanctions negotiations, the opening position of both Russia and China has been that the sanctions are much too strong and that there is insufficient proof to link all the suggested entities or individuals to nuclear proliferation activities. So intelligence experts from the United States, France, Britain and Germany are amassing as much evidence as possible to expand the list of specific entities. 
 One diplomat, expressing frustration with the level of proof demanded by China and Russia, said their negotiators went down the list as if they were expecting to get ''a picture of each guy building the bomb.''

HEADLINE: Matching Life Experience With New Careers

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH POPE

 BODY:
HEALTH navigator? Conflict coach? Pollution mitigation outreach worker? These emerging jobs aren't household terms yet, but they are a natural fit for older people looking for new career opportunities, said Phyllis Segal, vice president at Civic Ventures, a nonprofit research group based in San Francisco.
 ''Many of today's new encore careers build on multiple work and life experiences, so they are a good match for older adults who've spent decades in the workplace,'' Ms. Segal said. To help older workers upgrade skills for such jobs, she added, community colleges, online degree programs and intensive workshops are expanding training and fast-track certification programs. 
 Jobs in health care, education, government and nonprofit organizations are likely to grow in coming years because of an aging population, pending retirements and demographic changes, said Barry Bluestone, a labor economist at Northeastern University. 
 ''Between 2008 and 2018, we project 3.5 million more jobs in health care and social services,'' Professor Bluestone said. He is examining census and federal labor statistics for a study sponsored by Civic Ventures and the MetLife Foundation. 
 Education will add 800,000 jobs, he said, with 400,000 additional openings at nonprofit organizations, in the performing arts, museums and libraries. The study will be released this month, with three reports on promising second careers in health care, education and the green economy.
 Demand is already high in health care for workers who provide support and advocacy to patients confused by a complex, fragmented system. Health navigators, sometimes called patient advocates, help patients find and coordinate treatment, comply with medical advice and manage illnesses.
 ''Navigators connect you to the health care system. Chronic illness coaches motivate you to stick to healthy habits, and community health workers educate people in workshops and other group settings,'' said Sandy Atkins, associate director of Partners in Care Foundation of San Fernando, Calif. 
 Navigators, advocates, coaches and health workers may be self-employed consultants, or work for hospitals, community organizations or health management plans. Education, licensing requirements and salary vary with the complexity of tasks, ranging from a hospital worker who schedules appointments to a $300-an-hour retired physician who advises on gold-standard treatments. Opportunities in advocacy and disease management are already attracting retired health care professionals, medical researchers and insurance company employees. 
 Marleise Brosnan, a former corporate human resources executive, has a second career that owes its origins to an emergency room visit with a young employee 12 years ago. The patient and his family listened in shock to the doctor's diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, a life-threatening disease. Ms. Brosnan started taking notes, questioning the team of specialists and interpreting the medical jargon. 
 ''I spent the next six weeks in the I.C.U.,'' she said. ''His family says they think I saved their son's life.'' The experience was so profound she vowed to go into health care when her son finished college. Last May, Ms. Brosnan, 54, earned a master's degree in health advocacy at Sarah Lawrence College. In August, she was hired as project director of Eldercare Workforce Alliance, an advocacy group in Washington. She credited her corporate and internship experience in employee relations, strategic planning and public policy with helping her land the job. 
 With the legal system overburdened, too, mediation is another expanding area that attracts older workers who want to change careers. Mediators work to bring two parties in conflict to a mutually agreed resolution, avoiding lengthy and expensive litigation.
 ''Over the past 30 years, mediation has spread to nearly every nook and cranny of American life, from adoption to the workplace,'' James C. Melamed, chief executive of Mediate.com, a professional group, wrote in an e-mail message. While mediation has long been a side practice of lawyers, nonlawyers are entering the field with only 40 to 60 hours of basic courses, he added. 
 One mediator, Janet Mitchell of Leo, Ind., trains social workers, therapists, ministers and others in elder-care mediation to help resolve family disputes. 
 ''About half are baby boomers with aging parents,'' she said. ''Younger people might not have the credibility to do this job.'' 
 So-called green jobs may be difficult to define and be untracked by federal labor statistics, but opportunities in the sector are expanding beyond construction and building positions, Rona Fried, founder of GreenDreamJobs.com, said. ''We're seeing highly skilled midlevel and senior workers -- C.E.O.'s, engineers, scientists, sales managers and administrators -- who are well positioned to transition to green businesses.'' 
 Retraining opportunities through workshops, continuing education and certificate programs are also proliferating, she said.
 However, extra training for today's emerging jobs can be difficult to track down, Ms. Segal of Civic Ventures said. ''We're still in the do-it-yourself phase of encore careers,'' she said. ''We're just beginning to create the institutions and pathways people need in order to retrain. Some communities are leading the way, and depending on where you live, you will be able to find services.'' For a list of current resources, go to encore.org/colleges. 
 PATIENT ADVOCATE Eleven years ago, a State Department economics officer, Elisabeth Schuler Russell, learned her 2-year-old daughter had an inoperable brain tumor. ''We were thrown into a terrifying universe where you have to make life-or-death decisions about treatments we didn't understand,'' Mrs. Russell, 51, of Vienna, Va, said.
 She contacted the nation's best pediatric specialists, investigated clinical trials and researched nutritional supplements. In her spare time, she helped others investigate treatment options. Today, her daughter is a thriving middle school student, and Mrs. Russell, newly retired from the Foreign Service, runs Patient Navigator to help clients with cancer and other serious diseases. 
 Skills acquired in her 25-year diplomatic career -- cross-cultural sensitivity, language learning and negotiation -- easily transferred to dealing with doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. ''Instead of advocating for U.S. foreign policy, I'm advocating for people who need help finding a way through the system,'' she said. 
 ELDER-CARE MEDIATOR As a professional court-appointed guardian in Orlando, Fla., Lennie Burke, often sees families battling over the care of an elderly loved one. 
 ''A classic case is Mom has a stroke and can't return to her condo. Where will she go? A nursing home?'' said Mr. Burke, 62, a retired senior civilian executive for the Navy. ''Old sibling rivalries break out, and pretty soon, the family is lawyering up.'' Last fall, Mr. Burke opened Harmony Mediation to help families resolve elder-care issues before they escalate into litigation. 
 ''I'm atypical for a scientist -- I know how to listen and talk to people,'' he said. To burnish his credentials, he took 44 hours of mediation training and volunteered to mediate in small claims court. So far, he has not signed any clients, but he remains confident that a marketing effort will build his practice. ''That's the trouble with an emerging field -- nobody knows elder-care mediation exists,'' Mr. Burke said. 
 GREEN ENTREPRENEUR Barack Obama's emphasis on the green economy during the presidential campaign struck a chord with Mark Davis, 51, owner of a title company in Washington. When Mr. Davis discovered there was a dearth of solar installation companies in the city, he set out to open one.
 ''I wanted to make sure the green economy didn't bypass the urban environment,'' he said. Two brief workshops in California taught him the basics of selling, designing and installing solar panels, and how to set up a solar training program for hard-to-employ individuals, like those who had not finished high school. 
 His new company, WDC Solar, employs trained urban youths and already has orders to install systems on three commercial buildings.
 Mr. Davis credited a strong work ethic with helping him in his latest venture. ''I've had a job since I was 6 years old, working in a tobacco field down in Georgia,'' he said. ''I have to be doing and busy.''

PERSON: Theodore Cross 

HEADLINE: Theodore Cross Dies at 86, A Champion of Civil Rights

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Theodore L. Cross, a publisher, investor and entrepreneur who also had parallel careers as a writer on civil rights issues and a noted photographer of birds, died on Sunday in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 86 and had homes in Princeton, N.J., and on Sanibel Island, Fla., and Nantucket.
 The cause was heart failure after a recent fall, his wife, Mary S. Cross, said. 
 At his death, Mr. Cross was the editor and publisher of The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, a quarterly publication he founded in 1993. (The journal's online edition is published weekly at jbhe.com.) 
 Mr. Cross, who was white, was a recognized authority on the economics of black empowerment. He wrote two books on the subject, ''Black Capitalism: Strategy for Business in the Ghetto'' (Atheneum, 1969) and ''The Black Power Imperative: Racial Inequality and the Politics of Nonviolence'' (Faulkner, 1984).
 He was also the founder of Business and Society Review, a journal about business ethics and corporate responsibility that began publication in 1972.
 Mr. Cross came to wide attention in 1987, when he tried to acquire the venerable book publisher Harper & Row, reportedly offering about $190 million. He was outbid by Rupert Murdoch, who bought the company, now known as HarperCollins Publishers, for about $300 million.
 Originally a lawyer, Mr. Cross made his reputation in business by buying faltering periodicals and making them highly profitable. In 1983, for instance, he and two partners bought Investment Dealers' Digest, then a money-losing financial weekly, for $800,000. In 1986, in a widely reported transaction, they sold the publication for about $40 million.
 With his brothers, Warren and Gorham, Mr. Cross started Warren, Gorham & Lamont, a publisher of professional journals about banking, real estate and other fields, in 1975. The company was sold in 1980 for about $60 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.
 Theodore Cross's other business ventures included the JPT Publishing Group, a professional publisher he helped found in 1987.
 In later years, Mr. Cross released two lavish books of photographs, ''Birds of the Sea, Shore, and Tundra'' (Grove/Atlantic, 1989) and ''Waterbirds,'' published last year by W.W. Norton & Company.
 Reviewing ''Waterbirds,'' Natural History magazine called it ''extraordinary,'' adding: ''The color photographs, so richly detailed that you can see texture in each feather, convey deep empathy with the natural world. The birds preen, strut, and pose -- as if the photographer were not just watching from a distance, but sharing intimate moments with good friends.''
 Theodore Lamont Cross II was born on Feb. 12, 1924, in Newton, Mass. After serving as a naval officer in the Pacific in World War II, he received a bachelor's degree in English from Amherst College in 1946. In 1950, he earned a law degree from Harvard, where he was an editor of The Harvard Law Review.
 As a young lawyer, Mr. Cross became general counsel for the Sheraton Corporation of America, the hotel chain. In the early 1960s, Sheraton sent him to San Francisco to put an end to a sit-in over racially discriminatory hiring practices at one of its hotels. The task made him uneasy.
 ''It seemed to me that I was working on the wrong side for the wrong people,'' Mr. Cross told Fortune magazine in 1987.
 He took a leave of absence and became involved in civil rights work, participating in the second of the three historic voting rights marches that began in Selma, Ala., in 1965. A lifelong Democrat, Mr. Cross later advised the Johnson and Nixon administrations on economic development opportunities for black Americans.
 In his 50s, Mr. Cross became ardently interested in birds. Over the next three decades, he traveled with his camera to Siberia, South America and many other places in search of elusive quarry.
 In 2004, he founded Birders United to Defeat Bush, a Florida organization that invoked President George W. Bush's environmental record to marshal support for Senator John Kerry in that year's presidential election.
 Mr. Cross's first marriage, to Sheilah Ross, ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Mary, whom he married in 1974, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Amanda Cross and Lisa Pownall-Gray; his brother Gorham; a sister, Margaret Bean; three stepdaughters, Stuart Warner, Ann Anderson and Polly Warner; three grandchildren; and eight step-grandchildren.
 For all his accomplishments, it was for a single omission that Mr. Cross said he wished to be remembered. As he told The St. Petersburg Times last month, he wanted his epitaph to read thus:
 He Passed on
 To a Better World
 Still Waiting for
 A Perfect Picture 
 Of a Reddish Egret.

HEADLINE: Education on the Company's Dime

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
ROBIN ROUSE just turned 50 and is thinking ahead to retirement from I.B.M. She loves her job in the company's Cambridge, Mass., office, but she is also honing her film-writing skills, with the company helping to pay for classes.
 She is taking advantage of I.B.M.'s personal learning accounts plan, in which the company pays part of the cost for courses. A number of companies reimburse all, or some, costs for courses as part of career development, but some companies are allowing workers to pursue whatever interests them, whether agriculture or filmmaking. 
 About 50 companies nationwide offer employee-controlled education accounts. Some are large health providers like BJC Healthcare of St. Louis. Others, like the United Technologies Corporation of Hartford, also pay for education, but offer a different model. The company has an ''employee scholar'' program, begun in 1996, which pays colleges for its employees enrolled in degree programs.
 The employee chooses the courses, but the program is not portable, a feature advocated by the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, a Chicago nonprofit. It is urging nationwide adoption of portable Lifelong Learning Accounts. These are controlled by employees, with their costs partly matched by employers, and the money in the accounts earns interest. 
 The council is teaming with companies and foundations for three-year pilot programs across the country, the council spokeswoman, Amy Sherman, said. The companies include Sinai Health Systems in Chicago, whose program is backed by Illinois economic development funds, and City College of San Francisco, whose program is being financed by Atlantic Philanthropies and is aimed at older workers who want to retool themselves for second careers.
 ''These accounts are a great fit for mature workers who want to broaden their skills or use this as a career changer,'' Ms. Sherman said. In the San Francisco program, the employer matches dollar-for-dollar up to $600 a year, and the pilot program adds 50 percent, up to $300 a year. 
 The education benefits offered by United Technologies draw about 15,000 employees annually. About 2,500 graduate with a degree each year, according to the company.
 Annemarie Romano, 48, an industrial engineer with the company's Sikorsky Aircraft unit in Stratford, Conn., is pursuing a master's degree in teaching. She decided she needed job flexibility to follow her husband, who works in supply chain management, if he is transferred. 
 ''Teaching is a back-pocket career for me,'' Ms. Romano said. ''It is more transportable,'' she said. But she has realized that the presentation skills she has learned in her University of New Haven classes have been helpful in her current job.
 Two years ago, I.B.M. decided to adopt the personal learning account, because, Robin Willner, vice president for community initiatives, said, ''Our employees will have lots of different jobs in the global economy.'' 
 Employees, who contribute up to $1,000 yearly, which I.B.M. matches, must enroll at an accredited institution. The more than 2,000 employees who have enrolled have taken classes as diverse as aerobic training, tax preparation and Mandarin, Ms. Willner said.
 ''We also have a lot of people trying weekend intensive courses, which we see as a great way for people to explore a new career.''
 Steve Gaylord, 52, a technical sales specialist at I.B.M. in Texas, raises horses with his wife on 43 acres in Valley View, north of Dallas. He has been taking courses in pasture management, welding, power machinery and horse care at North Central Texas College.
 Last semester, he took a marketing class to help turn around declining sales of horses. If the horse-buying market remains weak, Mr. Gaylord has a plan B: getting a law degree.
 And, he's got it all figured out. The state of Texas has plans to start a new law school in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
 ''That's about an hour away,'' Mr. Gaylord said. ''I still have a few years where I.B.M. will pay for courses before it's time for me to retire.''

HEADLINE: On Road to Expected Political Romp, Tories Appear to Take a Detour in Britain

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
LONDON -- A year ago, it looked as if the next British election would be an easy rout. The Conservative opposition was ahead in the polls by more than 20 percentage points. The prime minister was widely unpopular, the economy was an overstretched disaster, and the government seemed at times to be a chaotic pool of exhausted self-loathing. 
 Since then, in what may strike a note of caution for Republicans in Washington, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, has learned that it is not enough to sit back, relax and wait for a government to eat itself alive. With an election just months away, Mr. Cameron now finds that his lead is steadily evaporating and that despite his best efforts, the electorate still seems unsure what his party represents or what it intends to do, exactly. 
 ''They don't know what policies the Conservative Party would put forward and what they would do in office,'' said Anthony Wells, associate director of YouGov, whose latest poll shows the Conservatives leading the Labour Party 39 percent to 32 percent. (A poll over the weekend put the Tories only two points ahead, but that seems to have been an anomaly.) ''They have made lots of little policy announcements, but no overall statement of their message.'' 
 In an interview with The Sunday Times of London, Mr. Cameron insisted that he was offering a clear change, and said that much change had come about already, within the Conservative Party itself. 
 ''Some people say to me, 'Play things safe, try to win by default; the government is in a mess,''' Mr. Cameron told the paper, in an article whose headline read: ''If Labour Is So Terrible, Why Are The Tories Doing So Badly?'' 
 He added: ''I say, 'No. This is the Conservative Party that is offering radical change. I'm doubling up on change.' '' 
 Both parties are now in full campaign mode, even though the election date has not been set (by law, it has to be sometime before the end of June, and early May seems likely). But Mr. Cameron has made some missteps. 
 After vowing to hold a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, which set out changes to the European Union and was enacted last year, for example, Mr. Cameron backpedaled and said it was too late to hold a vote. 
 He has also wavered on the issue of budget cuts in a potential Tory government. At first, his party spoke in the grimmest of tones about tough choices and huge slashes in spending. But when voters recoiled and economists said that harsh cuts might damage the recovery, the party softened its position and indicated that the reductions would not come too quickly. 
 Mr. Cameron declared early on that the government should offer financial rewards to married people, but then seemed unsure whether the country could afford to pay for his proposal. He has drawn complaints about his policy of placing his own parliamentary candidates -- rather than local candidates -- in some districts in advance of the election. 
 He has also seemed to lack some backbone in dealing with the embarrassing revelation earlier this week that Lord Ashcroft, a highly influential Tory who has donated some $7.5 million to the party, is registered as a ''non-domicile'' and pays relatively little tax in Britain. 
 In January, Mr. Cameron was derided for a campaign poster featuring an enormous, 15-foot-tall photograph of his face.The party denied that anything had been done to the photograph, but the image appeared to be so aggressively airbrushed that it made Mr. Cameron, who is running in part on an image of honesty and directness, look more like Data from ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' 
 In a speech in Brighton last weekend, Mr. Cameron announced that a Tory government would, after all, give tax breaks to married couples. But many of his other promises were of the vague, can't-argue-with-that kind: pledges to trim needless school bureaucracy, to reduce bloat in government, to support the National Health Service and the armed services, and to ''give people back control over their lives.'' 
 As ever, Mr. Cameron devoted the most passionate portions of his speech to denouncing the Labour government, which he said was ''locked in this dangerous dance of death'' with a prime minister who was mistrusted by his own cabinet but somehow clung to power. 
 ''Everyone in this country knows that another five years of Gordon Brown would be a disaster for our country,'' Mr. Cameron said. 
 Mr. Brown, of course, is a soft target, particularly after revelations of his bad temper and aggressive management style. His ability to turn positive developments into humiliating fiascos is such that you suspect if he were to be handed a baby in a crowd, he would drop it. 
 But the economy has started to improve, gingerly, and suddenly voters seem unsure whether, for all their distaste for Mr. Brown, they trust Mr. Cameron to run the country. 
 ''It is not sufficient to say, 'Vote for us because we are not Labour,' '' the Daily Telegraph, a Tory-supporting paper, said in a recent editorial.
 ''Mr. Cameron has two months in which to convince the nation that the change he promises is more than an empty slogan and carries with it the prospect of hope and renewal.''

HEADLINE: Ultimate Bush Insider Lifts Veil on Presidency

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Karl Rove, the chief political adviser to President George W. Bush and architect of his two successful campaigns for the White House, says in a new memoir that Mr. Bush probably would not have invaded Iraq had he known there were no unconventional weapons there.
 Mr. Rove adamantly rejects accusations that the administration deliberately lied about the presence of such weapons in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. But he acknowledges that the failure to find them badly damaged Mr. Bush's presidency, and he blames himself for not countering the narrative that ''Bush lied,'' calling it ''one of the biggest mistakes of the Bush years.'' 
 Mr. Rove's book offers the most expansive account yet of the Bush presidency by one of the people most responsible for it. Addressing the most controversial and consequential moments of Mr. Bush's eight years in power, Mr. Rove takes responsibility for the widely criticized Air Force One flyover after Hurricane Katrina and writes that he secretly cried in his White House office when he learned he would not be indicted in a C.I.A. leak case.
 For the most part, his book, ''Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight,'' to be published by Threshold Editions on Tuesday, is an unapologetic defense of Mr. Bush and his presidency, and takes aim at Democrats, the news media and disloyal Republicans for what he describes as hypocrisy, deceit and vanity. He also recounts his hardscrabble upbringing in a family broken by divorce and his mother's suicide.
 The book is the latest in a stream by top figures from the Bush administration. Mr. Rove's may carry special interest given his outsized reputation as the political maestro who vaulted a Texas governor to the presidency and guided him through a tumultuous tenure that saw war, terrorism, natural disaster and recession. A hero to conservatives and villain to liberals, Mr. Rove may be the most high-profile White House aide in modern times.
 In offering his take on history, Mr. Rove ruminates on what would have happened had Mr. Bush known the truth about the absent unconventional weapons, known as weapons of mass destruction, or W.M.D., in Iraq. While the opportunity to bring democracy to the Middle East as a bulwark against Islamic extremism ''justified the decision to remove Saddam Hussein,'' Mr. Rove says the suspected weapons were the primary justification for war.
 ''Would the Iraq War have occurred without W.M.D.? I doubt it,'' he writes. ''Congress was very unlikely to have supported the use-of-force resolution without the W.M.D. threat. The Bush administration itself would probably have sought other ways to constrain Saddam, bring about regime change, and deal with Iraq's horrendous human rights violations.''
 He adds: ''So, then, did Bush lie us into war? Absolutely not.'' But Mr. Rove said the White House had only a ''weak response'' to the harmful accusation, which became ''a poison-tipped dagger aimed at the heart of the Bush presidency.''
 ''So who was responsible for the failure to respond?'' he writes. ''I was. I should have stepped forward, rung the warning bell, and pressed for full-scale response. I didn't. Preoccupied with the coming campaign and the pressure of the daily schedule in the West Wing, I did not see how damaging this assault was.''
 More personally damaging was the long-running investigation into the leak of the identity of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Plame, whose husband, Joseph Wilson, was a critic of the administration. Mr. Rove discusses in greater length and more intimate terms than ever before his experience as a target who was ultimately never charged.
 At one point, Mr. Rove says, the prosecutor told his lawyer that he was ''inclined to indict your client.'' Only after five grand jury appearances and marathon efforts by the lawyer to address any suspicions did the prosecutor decide not to charge Mr. Rove. ''I placed the receiver in its cradle and wept,'' he writes of learning that an indictment was unlikely. Mr. Rove describes the stress on his wife, Darby, but does not mention their recent divorce as the book was being finished.
 ''I obsessed about all the Wilson stuff, but out of everyone's view,'' he writes. ''I was determined not to let White House colleagues, the press, the public, or anyone else -- up to and including Darby -- see me suffer. Stiff upper lip, soldier on, all that.'' He added, ''But behind the mask, the whole thing was scaring the hell out of me.''
 He discloses that after the furor erupted, Mr. Bush called him from the Oval Office to ask about his involvement. Mr. Rove says he told the president that he had had a conversation with the columnist, Robert Novak, in which Mr. Novak asked whether Mr. Wilson's wife was a C.I.A. official, and he responded, ''I have heard that, too,'' a comment that Mr. Novak took as confirmation. ''Bush sounded a little annoyed,'' Mr. Rove writes, ''but took my word.''
 For all the tribulations, Mr. Rove remains deeply loyal to Mr. Bush and venerates him as a man of conviction who rose to the challenge of history after the attacks of Sept. 11. ''His presidency was not without errors; none is,'' Mr. Rove concludes. ''But taken in their totality, his achievements over eight years were impressive, durable and significant.''

HEADLINE: Gambit in Texan's Battle To Unseat the Governor

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- The confetti had barely settled at the victory parties after the Texas primaries on Tuesday when the Democratic nominee for governor, Bill White, took off the gloves and went after Gov. Rick Perry.
 As he accepted his party's nomination, Mr. White, the former mayor of Houston, called Mr. Perry a ''career politician'' who had cynically distracted voters from the problems Texas faced by complaining about Washington.
 Mr. White's effort to define the governor is the gambit in what promises to be an uphill battle against an entrenched incumbent whose party has enjoyed a 10-point advantage in statewide races for more than a decade. 
 Mr. Perry, a staunch conservative who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term, has also tapped a wave of anger among many conservatives and independents about the federal government's vast spending bills to bail out banks and spur the economy, as well as President Obama's push to revamp the health care system. That anger at Washington is a potent force here and has made the political environment hard for any Democrat, political scientists said. 
 ''It is sort of David versus Goliath,'' Mr. White said at a news conference here on Wednesday morning. ''There is no doubt that I start out as an underdog.''
 Mr. Perry's campaign was buoyed Tuesday by a strong victory over his chief Republican rival, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He won 51 percent of the vote to the senator's 30 percent, in a race where turnout was 11 percent -- more than twice as high as usual.
 The strong showing of Debra Medina, a third candidate allied with the Tea Party movement who is more conservative than Mr. Perry on some issues and who received 18 percent of the vote, reflected the surging popular discontent on the right.
 To win, Mr. White not only needs a high turnout among Democrats, but he needs to persuade most independents in the state to support him, as well as to encourage some defections among Republicans, several political scientists said. That entails finding a set of state issues on which Mr. Perry is vulnerable without walking into the minefield of social issues that usually divide the parties, like abortion and gun control. 
 ''White has got to make a case to fire Rick Perry, to show he's somehow been negligent, incompetent, corrupt, etc.,'' said Daron Shaw, a political scientist at the University of Texas. 
 David Carney, the political consultant who has shaped Mr. Perry's message, said the governor would continue to portray himself as a conservative antidote to the Democrats controlling Congress and the White House, just as he did against Senator Hutchison. 
 The governor will emphasize Mr. White's ties to Mr. Obama, whom he supported and advised, and to President Bill Clinton, under whom he served as deputy secretary of energy, Mr. Carney said. Mr. Perry will call attention to Mr. White's history as a trial lawyer, a group not beloved among Texas Republicans, and he will also raise questions about Mr. White's handling of Houston's budget, asserting the city took on too much debt. 
 ''I see zero chance a Democrat can win in this environment,'' Mr. Carney said. ''This is a tough sledge for any Democrat, but one with his baggage, I just don't see it.''
 One open question is whether the bitter battle between Ms. Hutchison, who had the support of many moderate Republicans, and Mr. Perry has left an opening for Mr. White to win over some moderates in the party, some political scientists said.
 Richard Murray, a political scientist at the University of Houston, pointed out that Mr. Perry had alienated the Farm Bureau and other rural constituencies over the years with his policies, like seizing land for toll roads. Mr. White will have to make inroads with some of those voters to win, Mr. Murray said. 
 Mr. White, at his news conference, said he expected the governor to try to make the race a referendum on events in Washington, but he said he would challenge Mr. Perry on his record in Austin. Mr. White portrayed himself as a political outsider and Mr. Perry as an ''entrenched politician'' trying to distract people from his shortcomings with attacks on the federal government.
 Mr. White pointed out that Texas, though it has fared better than some states during the recession, still has the highest number of unemployed in its history. College tuition has skyrocketed, and local property taxes continue to rise because of cutbacks in state financing to schools, he said.
 ''Perry's problem is his job performance,'' Mr. White said.

HEADLINE: In Governors, The Averages Aren't Good

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If there were one story line in our endless tale of exploding governors, it would be simpler to decode. Instead, it's like a political version of Clue. Mr. Spitzer in the hotel room with the hooker. Mr. Rowland in the cottage with the swag. Mr. McGreevey, well, you get the idea. 
 It's unclear how Gov. David A. Paterson's troubles will conclude, but it's unlikely he will rank with Franklin D. Roosevelt or Nelson A. Rockefeller in the pantheon of New York governors. 
 On the other hand, compared with his peers in these parts, he ranks around the mean. Let's go to the videotape. 
 In New Jersey, Donald T. DiFrancesco became acting New Jersey governor in 2001 after 25 years in New Jersey government. (He was retroactively elevated to governor.) Three months later, battered by ethics allegations, he quit the race to be elected governor and left elective politics when his term ended. Then came James E. McGreevey, who resigned midway through his term after acknowledging he had an affair with a man he put on the state payroll as homeland security adviser. Richard J. Codey, president of the New Jersey Senate, stepped in and may have been done a favor when Jon S. Corzine's billions elbowed him aside. Mr. Corzine served one term, almost died in a traffic accident and then lost to Christopher J. Christie, in the wake of the state's worsening fiscal travails. Props to Mr. Christie for managing to get through two months unscathed. 
 In New York, Eliot Spitzer took office in January 2007 and resigned in March 2008, after revelations that he frequented prostitutes. Mr. Paterson's many problems we're familiar with. 
 In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland announced his resignation in June 2004, midway through his third term, and in March 2005 was sentenced to a year in federal prison for accepting $107,000 in gifts from people doing business with the state and not paying taxes on them. His successor, M. Jodi Rell, did get elected on her own and has remained reasonably popular, but, with Connecticut mired in red ink, decided this year not to run for re-election.
 She's what passes for a success these days, but Connecticut is a mess, too, near the top in per-capita debt with dead-in-the-water job creation even before this recession, and its own budget nightmares and legislative dysfunction. Apparently, the new standard for success as governor is making it through your term without getting run out on a rail or taken out in handcuffs.
 Of course governors elsewhere (Hello, Mr. Blagojevich, Mr. Sanford, et al.) have had their problems. And as Representative Charles B. Rangel and others can attest, it's not just governors. Still, our local cascade of gubernatorial catastrophe almost defies belief.
 It's too diverse a cast of characters, flaws and misdeeds to fit any unified field theory. This is a tough area with voracious media that scoop up what might get overlooked elsewhere. The toxic combination of money, special interests and its corrosive role in politics is at its most overheated around here. Tough times make for tough governing. Governors, who actually have to do something, as opposed to being grandstanding legislators, are like the canaries in the coal mines of political dysfunction. Changing times create more ethical trip wires -- would the assault case bedeviling Mr. Paterson have surfaced or had the same throw weight three decades ago before women's issues became as much a part of the conversation? We're in a meltdown of our political system everywhere and we've just managed to stumble into a particularly baroque version here. Add your own explanation. 
 Brendan T. Byrne, New Jersey governor from 1974 to 1982, said pressures have always been there -- people, he said, are still mad at him for enacting an income tax -- but with 24/7 media and new levels of disclosure, the scrutiny, oversight and accountability is completely different. ''It's a much more unforgiving environment now,'' he said. 
 Still, if we look at fallen politicians and just see fallen politics, we're missing something. Politicians are our last exhibitionists -- they do it all out in the open. But really, are these guys as a whole so much worse than the geniuses of Wall Street or corporate boards? Personal transgressions aside, would anyone argue that collectively we're acting like grownups in addressing monumental problems like health care or climate change or financial regulation? 
 As they say, we get the government we deserve. We want two things: painless quick fixes for every complicated issue and constant entertainment. The first, alas, is beyond us. The second is no problem, one depressing sideshow after another until the next one rolls along.

 BODY:
9:30 P.M. (SNY) GOING HOME WITH JOHAN SANTANA Mr. Santana, the ace pitcher of the New York Mets, wasn't always living the high life. In this premiere episode of ''Going Home,'' which follows several of the team's players back to their roots, Mr. Santana travels to his native Venezuela, where he reminisces about Little League games, breaking an aluminum bat on his first home run and the mountain he used to climb before each game. He also visits his mother, his childhood home and his first-grade classroom, where he sits, above, and where he met his future wife.

HEADLINE: Divorced Before Puberty

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine that there have been many younger divorcees -- or braver ones -- than a pint-size third grader named Nujood Ali.
 Nujood is a Yemeni girl, and it's no coincidence that Yemen abounds both in child brides and in terrorists (and now, thanks to Nujood, children who have been divorced). Societies that repress women tend to be prone to violence.
 For Nujood, the nightmare began at age 10 when her family told her that she would be marrying a deliveryman in his 30s. Although Nujood's mother was unhappy, she did not protest. ''In our country it's the men who give the orders, and the women who follow them,'' Nujood writes in a powerful new autobiography just published in the United States this week, ''I Am Nujood, Age 10 and Divorced.'' 
 Her new husband forced her to drop out of school (she was in the second grade) because a married woman shouldn't be a student. At her wedding, Nujood sat in the corner, her face swollen from crying.
 Nujood's father asked the husband not to touch her until a year after she had had her first menstrual period. But as soon as they were married, she writes, her husband forced himself on her. 
 He soon began to beat her as well, the memoir says, and her new mother-in-law offered no sympathy. ''Hit her even harder,'' the mother-in-law would tell her son.
 Nujood had heard that judges could grant divorces, so one day she sneaked away, jumped into a taxi and asked to go to the courthouse.
 ''I want to talk to the judge,'' the book quotes Nujood as forlornly telling a woman in the courthouse.
 ''Which judge are you looking for?''
 ''I just want to speak to a judge, that's all.''
 ''But there are lots of judges in this courthouse.''
 ''Take me to a judge -- it doesn't matter which one!''
 When she finally encountered a judge, Nujood declared firmly: ''I want a divorce!''
 Yemeni journalists turned Nujood into a cause celebre, and she eventually won her divorce. The publicity inspired others, including an 8-year-old Saudi girl married to a man in his 50s, to seek annulments and divorces. 
 As a pioneer, Nujood came to the United States and was honored in 2008 as one of Glamour magazine's ''Women of the Year.'' Indeed, Nujood is probably the only third grader whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has described as ''one of the greatest women I have ever seen.''
 Nujood's memoir spent five weeks as the No. 1 best-seller in France. It is being published in 18 other languages, including her own native language of Arabic.
 I asked Nujood, now 12, what she thought of her life as a best-selling author. She said the foreign editions didn't matter much to her, but she was looking forward to seeing it in Arabic. Since her divorce, she has returned to school and to her own family, which she is supporting with her book royalties.
 At first, Nujood's brothers criticized her for shaming the family. But now that Nujood is the main breadwinner, everybody sees things a bit differently. ''They're very nice to her now,'' said Khadija al-Salami, a filmmaker who mentors Nujood and who translated for me. ''They treat her like a queen.''
 Yemen is one of my favorite countries, with glorious architecture and enormously hospitable people. Yet Yemen appears to be a time bomb. It is a hothouse for Al Qaeda and also faces an on-and-off war in the north and a secessionist movement in the south. It's no coincidence that Yemen is also ranked dead last in the World Economic Forum's global gender gap index.
 There are a couple of reasons countries that marginalize women often end up unstable.
 First, those countries usually have very high birth rates, and that means a youth bulge in the population. One of the factors that most correlates to social conflict is the proportion of young men ages 15 to 24.
 Second, those countries also tend to practice polygamy and have higher death rates for girls. That means fewer marriageable women -- and more frustrated bachelors to be recruited by extremists. 
 So educating Nujood and giving her a chance to become a lawyer -- her dream -- isn't just a matter of fairness. It's also a way to help tame the entire country.
 Consider Bangladesh. After it split off from Pakistan, Bangladesh began to educate girls in a way that Pakistan has never done. The educated women staffed an emerging garment industry and civil society, and those educated women are one reason Bangladesh is today far more stable than Pakistan. 
 The United States last month announced $150 million in military assistance for Yemen to fight extremists. In contrast, it costs just $50 to send a girl to public school for a year -- and little girls like Nujood may prove more effective than missiles at defeating terrorists.

HEADLINE: What States and Cities Are Doing to Help Small Businesses

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
While Washington debates how to help the country's struggling small businesses, states and municipalities have stepped up with an array of initiatives to stanch closings and save jobs.
 The local approaches are as varied as subsidizing wages for new hires, running a $100,000 regional business-plan competition and giving out grants to help small manufacturers reposition themselves. Some states and cities are using federal stimulus dollars, and others are mixing federal, state and private dollars. 
 Here are some examples:
 A 100 Percent Hiring Subsidy 
 San Francisco is using federal stimulus funds to give immediate aid to small-business owners. Its $25 million program reimburses owners for 100 percent of the wages for certain new hires. So far, restaurants, cafes, delivery services and even law firms have hired nearly 1,800 people through the program, called Jobs Now.
 Employers do have to pay for Social Security and unemployment insurance, and the program requires those hired to have been unemployed for 30 days or longer. More than 800 businesses have signed up for the program, and the city is pushing to extend it beyond its September expiration.
 At first, said Steven B. Falk, chief executive of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, ''businesses had to warm up to the idea of turning to the government for hiring. Now, small businesses are telling me this is the motivation that pushed them to hire.''
 Encouraging Customer Loyalty
 A Cleveland-area small-business council is trying to shore up its 17,000 member businesses with a program that encourages consumers to patronize locally owned enterprises instead of big-box chains or Internet sites.
 Last year, the Council of Smaller Enterprises began a Web site called ''I Buy NEO'' -- that's Northeast Ohio -- where consumers can search for discounts and bargains at participating local businesses. So far, about 300 businesses as diverse as art galleries and home-improvement stores have signed up to offer rebates or discounts. About 11,000 cards, which cost $10, have been sold. ''When a resident buys locally,'' said Dan Roman, the council's director, ''independent studies have found 68 cents of each dollar stays in the community.'' The current average for the region is 43 cents.
 There is no charge for small businesses to join, and about two dozen companies have been signing up each month. Even though the program's $150,000 budget for marketing, Web development, printing and postage is modest, Mr. Roman says, sales activity tied to the loyalty cards has increased 40 percent over the last six months.
 Training for Laid-Off Workers
 Last June, the Michigan Small Business and Technology Center began to train laid-off workers to start new ventures.
 So far, 527 people have taken the course, which the center offers in partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. To date, 160 people in the Michigan program have introduced new business ventures, and more than 125 owners of existing businesses have enrolled in separate courses to bolster their chances of surviving. Another 1,000 would-be entrepreneurs are expected to complete the program this year.
 The unemployed workers, many laid off from the auto industry, come to the program with an idea for a small business and must search for capital on their own. The program, said a spokeswoman, Jennifer Deamud, ''preps the company for a loan and makes connections for the owner.''
 Of course, the training is no guarantee of success. Only about half of the enterprises are likely to survive beyond three years, according to the Kauffman Foundation, which has been offering training since March 2009, in New York City, Philadelphia, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota.
 When Tracy Pospeshil, 37, of Fenton, Mich., lost his job at an automotive supply company, he enrolled in Michigan's program and started a new business last spring selling engine-warming heaters for trucks and buses. He says he's on track to make a mid-five-figure income by this summer.
 Helping Small Manufacturers Retool
 Connecticut is using state money to set up a matching grants pilot program to help its small manufacturers -- many of them in the aerospace industry -- aim at the growing medical products market. The state budgeted $250,000 and is accepting applications for grants of $5,000 to $25,000, said Deborah Santy, director of the Connecticut Small Business Innovation and Research Office.
 Firms applying must provide at least three years of financial information, be located in Connecticut and be registered as a manufacturing company and keep their manufacturing in the state. Ms. Santy said she had received more than 60 applications for the program so far. Kristen Muschett, chief executive of aerospace test-equipment maker Habco, said the $35,000 matching grant was helping her explore the feasibility of manufacturing and marketing a new machine that helps stroke victims and other neurologically impaired patients learn to walk again. 
 Providing On-Site Financial Expertise
 Last year, North Carolina began a $600,000 pilot program called BizBoost to help the Charlotte area rebound from the big-bank layoffs. The program has provided financial guidance to 158 small businesses, typically with 10 or fewer employees, since last fall.
 In January, Gov. Beverly Perdue announced the program would be expanded to the entire state, with $2.4 million in state and federal funds that will be used to add additional experts, including accountants and managers with small-business experience. The goal is to help small businesses with the nitty-gritty of managing cash flow and lining up financing. ''We are helping businesses manage their customer base, restructure their debt and position themselves to grow,'' said George McAllister, regional director of the North Carolina Small Business and Technology Development Center.
 Still, Mr. McAllister conceded, it is hard to measure the program's success. One client, John Meeks, owner of AppleBlossom Insulators, said his insulation business got help from a BizBoost expert who did a financial analysis of his books, developed cash-flow projections, helped him ready his finances to seek an angel investor and helped him produce a 5 percent increase in revenue in a tough year. 
 Loans and a Business-Plan Competition
 In Missouri, Charlie A. Dooley, chief executive of St. Louis County, had heard complaints from owners who could not get bank loans, so he decided to spearhead a new small-business loan program called Boost. The program is administered by the St. Louis County Economic Council and uses county funds and a $5 million line of credit from PNC Bank, a Pittsburgh-based financial institution that had recently bought a St. Louis bank.
 The program is aimed at owners who want to purchase land, machinery, equipment or buildings but do not have adequate income or net worth to qualify for conventional bank loans. The maximum loan is $500,000, and in the few weeks since Boost was announced, Mr. Dooley said, more than 100 owners have applied.
 The county also started a business-plan competition featuring $100,000 in cash prizes and in-kind professional services. The competition, with money provided by the St. Louis-based financial services firm, Edward Jones, will announce its winners in June. So far, it has received applications from more than two dozen hopefuls, including would-be microbrewers and laid-off scientists.
 Helping Businesses Expand
 Last year, Florida introduced a state-financed program to help businesses keep their employees by expanding their customer base. The GrowFL program helps established companies identify new markets, research industry developments and maximize their use of social media. The program has a team of business analysts whose assistance is free to companies with at least $1 million in annual sales and 10 or more employees. 
 So far, the program, operated by the Florida Economic Gardening Institute, has enrolled 13 companies, including a Jacksonville industrial pump manufacturer that is trying to locate new customers after sales declines forced it to lay off workers. Another 72 established companies are in the pipeline for help. Gov. Charlie Crist has asked the legislature to add $3 million to the program's $1.5 million budget.
 Other areas, including Portland, Ore., have started similar programs.

HEADLINE: When New Hips Go Bad

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Some of the nation's leading orthopedic surgeons have reduced or stopped use of a popular category of artificial hips amid concerns that the devices are causing severe tissue and bone damage in some patients, often requiring replacement surgery within a year or two.
 In recent years, such devices, known as ''metal on metal'' implants, have been used in about one-third of the approximately 250,000 hip replacements performed annually in this country. They are used in conventional hip replacements and in a popular alternative procedure known as resurfacing.
 The devices, whose ball-and-socket joints are made from metals like cobalt and chromium, became widely used in the belief that they would be more durable than previous types of implants. 
 The cause and the scope of the problem are not clear. But studies in recent years indicate that in some cases the devices can quickly begin to wear, generating high volumes of metallic debris that is absorbed into a patient's body. That situation can touch off inflammatory reactions that cause pain in the groin, death of tissue in the hip joint and loss of surrounding bone. 
 Doctors at leading orthopedic centers like Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis say they have treated a number of patients over the last year with problems related to the metal debris. 
 Artificial hips, intended to last 15 years or more, need early replacement far more frequently for reasons like dislocation than because of problems caused by metallic debris. But surgeons say that when metal particles are the culprit, the procedures to replace the devices can be far more complex and can leave some patients with lasting complications. 
 ''What we see is soft-tissue destruction and destruction of bone,'' said Dr. Young-Min Kwon, an orthopedic surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
 A recent editorial in a medical journal for orthopedic surgeons, The Journal of Arthroplasty, urged doctors to use the metal-on-metal devices only with ''great caution, if at all.'' 
 The limited studies conducted so far estimate that 1 to 3 percent of implant recipients could be affected by the problem. Given the large number of people who have received metal devices, that could mean thousands of patients in the United States. Reports suggest that women are far more likely than men to be affected. 
 All the major orthopedics makers sell these devices. Several companies said in statements that the implants did not pose a significant risk and that the incidence of metal debris problems was extremely low.
 For example, Zimmer Holdings, one of this country's biggest producers of artificial joints, said in a statement that published data ''suggests that ion release levels from Zimmer's metal-on-metal hip systems are commensurate with other metal-on-metal systems in the industry, and are not associated with significant risk to patients.''
 But some surgeons are concerned that they may only now be seeing the leading edge of a mounting problem. The current generation of metal-on-metal devices is still relatively new, having been used increasingly over the last decade.
 Studies show that the devices can shed atomic-size particles of metals like chromium and cobalt that can be readily absorbed by tissue or enter the bloodstream. 
 Surgeons at Rush University Medical Center have performed about two dozen replacement procedures because of metal debris over the last year, said Dr. Joshua J. Jacobs, the head the orthopedic surgery department there. A similar number of patients have had metal-on-metal hips removed at the Mayo Clinic, according to Dr. Daniel J. Berry, Mayo's head of orthopedic surgery.
 Dr. Berry added that surgeons at the Mayo Clinic had reduced by 80 percent their use of metal-on-metal implants over the last year in favor of those made from other materials, like combinations of metal and plastic. Other doctors said that to be cautious they were also scaling back their use of the all-metal implants until the scientific evidence became clearer.
 It is not clear whether some makers' devices are more prone to the debris problem than others. But some experts argue that some manufacturers, in a rush to meet the demand for metal-on-metal devices, marketed some poorly designed implants and that some doctors fail to properly implant even well-designed ones.
 ''It is a sad travesty,'' said Dr. Harlan C. Amstutz, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles who helped pioneer hip resurfacing. ''It is design-related and it is technique-related.''
 Dr. Amstutz, who developed a hip-resurfacing system sold by the Wright Medical Group, said he believed that resurfacing, which typically uses all-metal components, was safe. The procedure, which preserves more thigh bone than in a conventional hip replacement, is aimed at younger, more active patients who may need several hip replacements in their lifetimes. 
 Several orthopedic surgeons agreed that the procedure was generally safe. But those doctors said they were limiting resurfacing procedures to men under 55 with strong bones because other patients, including women, did not have good outcomes.
 One hip device company, Smith & Nephew, which markets an implant called the Birmingham hip resurfacing system, said that data from an implant registry in Australia showed that fewer than 1 percent of patients using that product had reactions to metal. 
 Another major producer, the DePuy Orthopaedics division of Johnson & Johnson, said that, ''as with other materials, metal-on-metal wear debris may cause soft tissue reaction in the area of a hip implant in a small percentage of cases.'' 
 All hip devices, regardless of the material, create debris as the ball rotates and rubs against the cuplike socket. But in metal-on-metal hips, either because of poor design or poor implant technique, the ball can sometimes press against the cup's edge. This creates a chisel-like effect referred to as ''edge-loading'' that produces large volumes of microscopic metallic particles that can cause havoc in some patients. 
 Three years ago, for example, Gregory Smith, 35, of Milan, Ill., got a metal-on-metal joint to correct a congenital hip disorder. Mr. Smith, an unemployed heavy-equipment operator, said that he began experiencing severe pain almost immediately.
 Finally, last year, he went to Rush University, where an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brett Levine, removed the device and replaced it. The soft tissue surrounding Mr. Smith's left hip was severely inflamed, and some of it had died.
 ''It was like having a fire taken out of your body,'' Mr. Smith said of the removed joint. 
 Dr. Levine said he was now replacing metal-on-metal devices at the rate of one a month. He said that the surgeon who had implanted Mr. Smith's artificial hip had installed the cup component slightly askew. The misalignment, he said, probably would not have created a serious problem if the device had not been metal on metal. 
 ''These implants are less forgiving,'' Dr. Levine said.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about metal-on-metal hip replacements misidentified the Minnesota city that is home to the Mayo Clinic, where doctors say they have treated patients over the last year for problems related to metal debris from the devices. The clinic is in Rochester, not Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: For Movie Stars, the Big Money Is Now Deferred

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When Wolfgang Puck lays out the annual post-Oscar banquet in Hollywood on Sunday, he might want to think about doggie bags.
 Movie stars, who not so long ago vied to make $20 million or even $25 million a picture, have seen their upfront salaries shrink in the last several years as DVD sales fell, star-driven vehicles stumbled at the box office and studios grew increasingly tightfisted.
 How bad is it?
 Pretty bad. 
 Most of the three-dozen or so top-billed actors in the 10 films up for best picture in this Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, including blockbusters like ''Up'' and ''Avatar,'' appear to have received relatively minuscule upfront payments for their work. 
 When the estimated salaries of all 10 of the top acting nominees are combined, the total is only a little larger than the $20 million that went to Julia Roberts for her appearance in ''Erin Brockovich,'' a best-picture nominee in 2001, or to Russell Crowe for ''Master and Commander,'' nominated in 2004. 
 Peter Dekom, a film industry lawyer who co-wrote the book ''Not on My Watch: Hollywood vs. the Future,'' pegged the general devaluation of movie stars to a lack of interest among younger viewers. 
 ''Stars don't resonate with the 'what's next' '' crowd, theorized Mr. Dekom. ''They attract an over-30 audience, which is going to the movies less in an impaired economy.'' 
 Specific salaries and deal terms are notoriously difficult to pin down. (The estimates are based on interviews with a dozen producers, agents and executives who were briefed on the various deals but spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with the actors and companies involved.)
 Producers and others behind this year's best-picture candidates uniformly declined to comment or sidestepped queries about what their actors were paid.
 ''Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to be of any help,'' Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for George Clooney, said in response to a query about Mr. Clooney's pay for his work in Paramount Pictures' ''Up in the Air.''
 That film was made for about $25 million. It was possible only because Mr. Clooney, according to people briefed on the film's finances but speaking anonymously to avoid conflict with the star or Paramount, took an initial fee that was roughly a tenth of the $20 million that Leonardo DiCaprio, a frequent Oscar contender, has received in the past. 
 Once upon a time, the biggest stars were rewarded with deals that paid them a percentage of so-called first-dollar gross receipts; that is, they began sharing in the profits from the first ticket sale, not waiting until the studio turned a profit. Now studios often insist that even top stars forgo large advance payments in return for a share of the profits after a studio has recouped its cash investment.
 The fashionable deal now is called ''CB zero.'' It stands for ''cash-break zero,'' and refers to an arrangement under which the star or filmmaker begins collecting a share of profits after the studio has reached the break-even point.
 Such deals can be extremely lucrative when they give stars a substantial share in home-video revenue. So Sandra Bullock, who cut her usual $10 million fee to just $5 million for ''The Blind Side,'' another of this year's nominees, will eventually make $20 million or more from the movie because it was a hit. Mr. Clooney similarly stands to make additional millions when all the revenue from ''Up in the Air'' is finally counted.
 A rare star, in rare circumstances, can still command the kind of deal that was more prevalent five years ago. Angelina Jolie, for instance, still receives $20 million for appearing in an action film like ''Salt,'' set for release in July by Columbia Pictures, according to two people who were briefed on her deal.
 Geyer Kosinski, who manages Ms. Jolie, and a spokesperson for Columbia Pictures both declined to comment. 
 In this year's best-picture roster, the star that attracted the largest upfront fee appears to be Brad Pitt, for his work in ''Inglourious Basterds.'' People briefed on that film's finances put his initial payment at $10 million, with more to come from a participation in profits. 
 But Mr. Pitt's co-stars and the stars of pictures as impressive as ''The Hurt Locker,'' which has emerged as a front-runner in the Oscar race after winning a series of professional society and critics' awards, or ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire,'' another nominee, often worked at or near guild minimums.
 For the most part guild minimums are set in a provision of the Screen Actors Guild contract that Hollywood cognoscenti refer to as Schedule F. It requires than an actor receive at least $65,000 for work in a feature film. Overtime is negotiable. The actor must be fed and, at some point, allowed to rest.
 The pay for a number of actors in ''District 9,''''A Serious Man'' and ''An Education'' was at or close to guild minimums, as each was made on a relatively low budget. As for the ultrahigh-budget ''Avatar,'' the highest paid appears to have been Sigourney Weaver, though she almost certainly worked for a small fraction of the $11 million she was reported to have been paid for ''Alien: Resurrection'' in 1997.
 Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington, meanwhile, got fees that were more than guild minimums but less than enough to make them feel financially secure, despite having acted in a picture with over $2.5 billion in ticket sales around the world.
 ''Every actor fears unemployment,'' Mr. Worthington said in a January interview with The Herald Sun in Australia. He has continued to work frequently in forthcoming films like ''Clash of the Titans'' and ''The Texas Killing Fields,'' said Mr. Worthington, because it ''beats sitting there waiting for the phone to ring thinking, give me some work I've got bills to pay.'' 
 At least Mr. Worthington wasn't scratching for fees in the animation world.
 ''I was paid for sessions,'' said Ed Asner, a veteran actor who provided the voice for Carl Fredricksen, an aging adventurer in ''Up,'' a best-picture nominees. Typically, the eight or 10 sessions required of a voice actor might pay $50,000 -- but only if the actor negotiates a guarantee that boosts his pay above union minimums that could yield only a third of that.
 Still, Mr. Asner, who spoke by phone last week, said he ultimately received much more because the Walt Disney Company's Pixar unit, which produced ''Up,'' augmented his small front-end fee with bonuses that came with the film's success: it took in more than $723 million in ticket sales around the world.
 ''If it does well, you do well,'' Mr. Asner said.

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT CALLS FOR FINAL VOTE ON HEALTH BILL

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, beginning his final push for a health care overhaul, called Wednesday for Congress to allow an ''up or down vote'' on the measure, and sketched out an ambitious -- and, some Democrats said, unrealistic -- timetable for his party to pass a bill on its own within weeks.
 ''I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on health care reform,'' Mr. Obama said during a 20-minute speech in the East Room of the White House. He said there was no point in starting over, as Republicans are demanding, and called on nervous Democrats to stick with him, declaring there was no reason ''for those of us who were sent here to lead to just walk away.'' 
 The speech, less than a week after Mr. Obama held a high-profile televised health care forum, will usher in what White House officials say will be their last campaign to bring Washington's long and contentious health care debate to a close -- with a bill-signing ceremony at the end. 
 On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will meet at the White House with insurance industry executives to spotlight unpopular rate increases; next week, Mr. Obama will travel to Missouri and Pennsylvania to stump for the health care bill.
 In his remarks, the president refrained from using the word ''reconciliation,'' the parliamentary tactic that Democrats are expected to employ to avoid a Republican filibuster and win passage with a simple majority. But he made clear that was his intent, and reminded Americans that despite current Republican objections, other major bills had been passed using the same tactic.
 ''Reform has already passed the House with a majority. It has already passed the Senate with a supermajority of 60 votes,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And now it deserves the same kind of up or down vote that was cast on welfare reform, that was cast on the Children's Health Insurance Program, that was used for Cobra health coverage for the unemployed and, by the way, for both Bush tax cuts -- all of which had to pass Congress with nothing more than a simple majority.''
 Republicans were furious.
 ''They're making a vigorous effort to try to jam this down the throats of the American people, who don't want it,'' the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, told reporters after Mr. Obama's remarks. ''We think that's a policy mistake, and we think resorting to these kind of tactics, to thumb your noses at the American people, is something that ought to be resisted.''
 On Capitol Hill, the strategy could prove a heavy lift for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, who are now under intense pressure from the White House to translate Mr. Obama's wishes for a final bill into legislative language. Both leaders issued statements Wednesday praising Mr. Obama and vowing to press ahead. But, noticeably, neither publicly committed to Mr. Obama's timetable. 
 Privately, Senate leadership aides said Mr. Obama's deadline could be difficult to meet. The tentative plan is for the House to adopt the bill passed by the Senate, and for both chambers to use reconciliation to pass a package of changes that would bridge gaps between the initial House and Senate versions. 
 But the final language must still be sent to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for evaluation, a process that takes time. Many aspects of the legislation remain unresolved, and rank-and-file Democrats in the House remain deeply uneasy over both the substance of the bill and the process by which it would be adopted. 
 Ms. Pelosi does not yet have the votes she needs to pass the legislation. She faces complex negotiations with both the moderate and liberal wings of her party to come up with a package that can pass the House without deviating so much from the existing Senate version that Mr. Reid would have trouble assembling a majority for the final vote in the Senate.
 ''I am not inclined to support the Senate version,'' said Representative Shelley Berkley, Democrat of Nevada, who voted for the House bill in November. ''I would like something more concrete than a promise. The Senate cannot promise its way out of a brown paper bag.''
 As Democrats prepared for a final showdown with Republicans, other potential stumbling blocks emerged. House Democrats from New York met Wednesday with Ms. Pelosi to discuss their concern that the emerging bill would shortchange their state on Medicaid and other issues.
 ''I am very, very disappointed and unhappy,'' said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York. ''The White House is taking us for granted, and they shouldn't.''
 Supporters of abortion rights, in and out of Congress, said Wednesday that they were alarmed at the prospect that lawmakers might impose new restrictions on insurance coverage of abortion in the push to enact sweeping health legislation. Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said language restricting insurers' ability to cover abortions ''remains in the president's proposal, and we are very concerned about that.''
 Friday will mark one year since Mr. Obama laid out his plans for a health care overhaul with a high-profile forum at the White House, where he engaged in a lively debate with lawmakers of both parties and executives from the insurance, hospital and pharmaceutical industries. On Wednesday, the scene at the White House was far different.
 Mr. Obama spoke, without taking questions, to a group of sympathetic medical professionals, many of them clad in white lab coats to provide a TV-friendly image. After 12 months of legislative hearings, town hall meetings, speeches, polls and debates, Mr. Obama was in the position of selling not only the public, but his own party, on his top domestic priority.
 ''The American people want to know if it's still possible for Washington to look out for their interests and their future,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They are waiting for us to act. They are waiting for us to lead. And as long as I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership. I don't know how this plays politically, but I know it's right.'' 
 Seeking to reassure wavering Democrats that he would back them up, he pledged to do ''everything in my power to make the case for reform.''
 Moments after he finished speaking, the White House announced plans for him to visit Pennsylvania and Missouri -- states that are home to vulnerable Democrats like Representative Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania and Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who were among 39 Democrats to vote against the health measure when it passed the House last year. If Mr. Obama is to sign his legislation into law, he is going to have to convert some of those no votes into yeses; traveling to a lawmaker's home state could be one way to do that.
 Senior advisers to Mr. Obama are betting that the politics of health care will eventually turn in the party's favor, if the president can actually sign a bill into law. The legislation includes popular restrictions on the insurance industry; some, like a provision barring insurers from discriminating against children on the basis of pre-existing conditions, would take effect quickly -- a point noted by Mr. Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs. 
 ''The president has always subscribed to the notion that the politics will catch up,'' Mr. Gibbs said.

HEADLINE: Bill Offered To Restrict Big Banks

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels and Louis Uchitelle from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration put forward legislation on Wednesday to rein in the size and scope of the nation's largest banks. But the proposal faces strong resistance in Congress, where lawmakers have shown little appetite for adding to the prolonged debate on overhauling financial regulations.
 The legislation would ban banks that take federally insured deposits from investing in hedge funds or private equity funds and from making trades that are for the benefit of the banks, not their customers, a practice known as proprietary trading. 
 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would probably be the Wall Street firms most affected by the ban, known informally as the Volcker Rule, but they might be able to shed their status as bank holding companies, to avoid some of the restrictions. 
 The legislation also would ban any bank from acquiring another bank if the merged company would have more than 10 percent of all liabilities in the financial system. 
 When President Obama presented the Volcker Rule, named for its champion, Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, on Jan. 21, he argued that banks that benefit from the government safety net should not take undue risks. 
 Mr. Volcker said through a spokesman on Wednesday, ''I have not seen the final version, but from what I understand, it is good, tough language.'' 
 The Volcker Rule counts among its supporters five former Treasury secretaries, elder statesmen like William H. Donaldson and John S. Reed and prominent investors like George Soros. But when Mr. Volcker and the deputy Treasury secretary, Neal S. Wolin, presented the plan to the Senate last month, they were met with a frosty reception.
 Senators said the rule would not have prevented the financial crisis or saved companies like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and the American International Group. They said the idea, as outlined by President Obama, was vague and difficult to enforce. And representatives of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase testified that limits on risk-taking could be achieved by other means.
 Another concern is that the rule would encourage banks to take flight to other countries with fewer restrictions on speculative trading.
 After meeting in Brussels, European finance ministers said in a policy paper on Feb. 10 that while they ''support the overarching aim of reducing the buildup of risks in the financial system,'' any new policy should ''avoid pushing risks to other parts of the financial system.''
 As proposed by the Treasury Department, the Volcker Rule would define proprietary trading as the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives for the institution's or company's own trading book, and not on behalf of a customer. 
 The legislation would also seek to restrict proprietary trading by nonbank financial institutions by directing the Federal Reserve to set ''capital and quantitative limits'' on such trading. Congress is considering proposals that would give the Fed supervision over the largest and most interconnected financial institutions, not just the bank holding companies and state-chartered member banks it now oversees.
 The second part of the legislation would prohibit financial institutions from assuming, by acquisition, more than 10 percent of all liabilities in the financial system. The idea is an outgrowth of a cap, in place since 1994, on the share of deposits that any one institution can hold.
 ''The existing cap on deposit concentrations has become less effective as large banking firms have increasingly relied on other sources of funding and has given these firms an incentive to shift towards riskier sources of funding,'' the Treasury said in a statement.
 It continued: ''We need to update existing concentration limits to check future growth of our largest financial institutions and to make the system safer.'' 
 Two experts on finance expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the proposal after being shown it.
 ''The law is sufficiently ambiguous as to be practically unenforceable, so that it appears to be more about grandstanding to score political points than an attempt to really improve the regulatory toolkit,'' said Anil K. Kashyap, an economist at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago.
 Cornelius K. Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at the Boston University School of Law, said the language ''raises more questions than it answers.''
 He added: ''This is the price the administration must pay apparently for inserting a game-changing proposal at the end of the legislative process. It would have been much better had this been part of the opening salvo rather than a last-minute call.''
 Michael S. Barr, the assistant Treasury for financial institutions, said in an interview that the legislative proposals should be understood as part of a broader regulatory package put forward last June. ''Certain proprietary trading activities that are risky and conducted only for the trading book of the firm shouldn't be subsidized by deposit insurance,'' he said.
 As for the definitions of proprietary trading, Mr. Barr said: ''Will it require the exercise of regulatory judgment? Yet it will, but that's consistent with existing banking regulation.''
 Jockeying over other elements of overhauling financial regulations continued Wednesday.
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, and a senior White House adviser, Valerie Jarrett, told representatives of AARP, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and consumer and civil rights groups that Mr. Obama was committed to creating an agency to protect consumers from abusive financial products, with an independent director and budget and the power to write and enforce rules.

HEADLINE: Traders Turn Attention to the Next Greece

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Is Spain the next Greece? Or Italy? Or Portugal? 
 Even as Greece pledged anew on Wednesday to rein in its runaway budget deficit, briefly easing the anxiety over its perilous finances, traders on both sides of the Atlantic weighed the risks -- and potential rewards -- posed by the groaning debts of other European governments. 
 While investors welcomed news that Athens would raise taxes and cut spending by $6.5 billion this year, analysts warned the moves might not be enough to avert a bailout for Greece or to contain the crisis shaking Europe and its common currency, the euro. 
 Indeed, some banks and hedge funds have already begun to turn their attention to other indebted nations, particularly Portugal, Spain, Italy and, to a lesser degree, Ireland. 
 The role of such traders has become increasingly controversial in Europe and the United States. The Justice Department's antitrust division is examining whether at least four hedge funds colluded on a bet against the euro last month.
 ''If the problems of Greece aren't addressed now, there is a risk the market will focus on the next weakest link in the chain,'' said Jim Caron, global head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley.
 Whatever the outcome in Athens, the debt crisis in Europe threatens to tip the financial, as well as political, balance of power across the Continent. With Germany and France emerging as the most likely rescuers, leaders in Berlin and Paris could end up dictating fiscal policy in Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.
 And in the months ahead, fears about the growing debt burden elsewhere in Europe are likely to return, according to investors and strategists. That is particularly worrying given that Western European countries must raise more than half a trillion dollars this year to refinance existing debts and cover their widening budget gaps.
 The way fear can spread from capital to capital reminds Mr. Caron of how the American financial crisis played out. ''What people are doing in the markets is no different from what they did with the banks,'' he said. ''First it was Bear Stearns, then it was Lehman Brothers and so on. That's what people are worried about.''
 France and Germany are emerging as the crucial backers of any lifeline for Greece, but they have slow growth and budget troubles of their own -- deficits equaling 6.3 percent of gross domestic product in Germany and 7.5 percent in France. And among voters in both countries, ''there is very little appetite for rescues,'' said Marco Annunziata, chief economist for Unicredit.
 The most vulnerable country after Greece, some analysts say, is Spain, which has been mired in a deep recession. Facing an unemployment rate of 20 percent, a budget gap of more than 10 percent of gross domestic product, and an economy expected to shrink by 0.4 percent this year, Madrid has little wiggle room if investors shun an expected 85 billion euros in new bond offerings this year.
 Spain's neighbor Portugal is also vulnerable. Large budget and trade deficits, combined with a shortage of domestic savings, leave Portugal dependent on foreign investors. And, as in Greece, there may be little political will to slash spending or raise taxes.
 That's in sharp contrast to Ireland, which had been a source of anxiety last year. New austerity measures, including a government hiring freeze and public sector wage cuts, have put it in a stronger position as it raises 19 billion euros this year.
 The Italian government is also heavily indebted -- it has more than $2 trillion in total exposure -- but it is also in a slightly stronger position than Spain or Portugal because its economy is expected to grow by 0.9 percent this year and 1.0 percent next year. In addition, its budget is not as far out of whack, with the deficit this year expected to equal 5.4 percent of G.D.P.
 According to Kenneth J. Heinz of Hedge Fund Research, the big hedge funds are now evaluating the response by other European countries in extending a lifeline to Greece before they probe weaknesses and opportunities in other countries.
 Hedge funds, banks and other institutions are still wagering on a drop in the euro as well as the British pound.
 Those trades have been controversial for months in Europe. But the debate shifted to the United States on Wednesday, after it emerged that at least four hedge funds had been asked by the Justice Department to turn over trading records and other documents. That request followed a dinner in New York last month where, among several other subjects, representatives of some of these hedge funds discussed betting against the euro. 
 The funds that received the letters -- Greenlight Capital, SAC Capitol Advisors, Paulson & Company and Soros Fund Management -- are among the best-known names in the hedge fund universe. Greenlight and SAC declined to comment, as did the Justice Department. Paulson & Company, whose representatives did not attend the dinner, also declined to comment. 
 In a statement, Michael Vachon, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, denied any wrongdoing and said, ''It has become commonplace to direct attention toward George Soros whenever currency markets are in the news.'' 
 The dinner, in a private room at the Park Avenue Townhouse restaurant in Manhattan on Feb. 2, involved about 20 people and was characterized as an ''ideas round table'' by several who attended. But people present at the dinner or knowledgeable about the discussion said the idea of shorting the euro occupied only a few minutes of the conversation. 
 The presentation on the euro, by SAC, lasted less than five minutes, according to these people. 
 Notes provided by one of the firms that attended the dinner summarized the discussion on the euro state: ''Greece is important but not that important; instead you have to start thinking about every other country. What's after Greece? Spain, Ireland, Portugal.'' 
 James S. Chanos, a hedge fund investor who has not been making bets on the euro, defended the positions taken by hedge funds, calling the inquiries into their activities ''witch hunts.''
 ''Hedge funds and short-sellers are being blamed for the failings of other people,'' he said. Nevertheless, the anxiety in Europe is reflected on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where trading in futures on the euro soared to a record $60 billion in February -- up 71 percent from a year ago.
 ''The Greek story is putting downward pressure on the euro,'' said Derek Sammann, a managing director at the CME. According to CME data, hedge funds are in their most bearish position in a decade in shorting the euro, said Mary Ann Bartels of Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
 ''They have been short for a while, but in the past two weeks have really pressed it,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Under Attack, Rangel Steps Down From Key Post

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Robert Pear and Janie Lorber contributed reporting from Washington, and Alison Bowen from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Charles B. Rangel stepped down on Wednesday as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee after losing support within his party because of ethics violations, shaking up the Democratic power structure in the House and costing New York a powerful seat of influence in Congress.
 Mr. Rangel, for decades an institution both on Capitol Hill and in New York politics, said he was leaving the post to prevent Republicans from forcing his fellow Democrats to vote on ousting him from the position after he was admonished by the House ethics committee last week for accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean. 
 The ethics panel is still investigating more serious accusations regarding Mr. Rangel's fund-raising, his failure to pay federal taxes on rental income from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic and his use of four rent-stabilized apartments provided by a Manhattan real estate developer. 
 ''In order to avoid my colleagues having to defend me during their elections, I have this morning sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking her to grant me a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work,'' Mr. Rangel said.
 He will remain a member of Congress and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. But in giving up the chairman's gavel little more than three years after attaining it, he is leaving one of the most prominent positions in Congress, a post with great influence over tax, health care and other legislation and with the ability to command the attention -- and campaign donations -- of American business leaders. 
 The trappings are elaborate, with an ornate hearing room and stately offices. The stature of the post has occasionally overwhelmed those who hold it; two previous Democratic chairmen, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas, left in disgrace.
 Mr. Rangel's departure sent Democrats looking for a successor at a critical time in the debate over Democratic plans for a health care overhaul. Some of the central elements of the health plan fall squarely under the purview of the tax-writing committee.
 Representative Pete Stark, 78, a liberal California Democrat and a longtime health policy expert, is next in line by seniority. But some Democrats were anxious about that choice, citing possible health concerns, Mr. Stark's brusque demeanor and his own recent brush with the ethics panel, which cleared him of a residential tax issue.
 Democratic members of the committee were weighing the possibility of handing the gavel to another senior member, possibly Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, or even naming co-chairmen. In the meantime, Mr. Stark became the interim chairman.
 Mr. Rangel's ethics troubles presented a particularly delicate political issue for Democrats as they head into a difficult midterm election cycle. They campaigned hard against what they called the Republican ''culture of corruption'' in their 2006 takeover of the House, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised to root out wrongdoing, providing an opening to Republicans who accused her of protecting Mr. Rangel.
 ''It's disappointing that Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leaders let this situation go on this long -- especially after promising to preside over the most honest, open, and ethical Congress in history,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said in a statement.
 In making his announcement at a hastily called news conference on Wednesday morning, Mr. Rangel sought to portray his departure as temporary. But Republicans and Democrats said that given the political climate and the slap by the ethics committee, he was unlikely to be able to reclaim his leadership post. 
 Initially, Mr. Rangel would not discuss whether he still intended to seek re-election in November. He said only that he had served in his district in Harlem and most of Upper Manhattan for 40 years and would communicate with his constituents directly. 
 ''I'll be in touch with them,'' he said. ''I just don't really believe that I should be talking at this point to the press when there's just so many things to be done.''
 Later, though, he said there was ''no way that I can foresee anything'' to stop him from running.
 The House ethics committee last week admonished Mr. Rangel for violating Congressional gift rules by accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Seizing on that finding, Republicans planned on Wednesday to force a vote on removing him from the chairmanship. 
 Mr. Rangel had weathered such votes in the past year, but the ethics committee's finding seriously undermined his Democratic support, and it appeared that he could lose the showdown. The prospect sent Ms. Pelosi and her leadership team searching for a way to spare lawmakers a potentially bruising fight over the chairman. Though he declared defiantly on Tuesday night that he would not step aside, Mr. Rangel arrived at the Capitol on Wednesday morning and did just that.
 ''I commend Chairman Rangel for his decades of leadership on jobs, health care and the most significant economic issues of the day,'' Ms. Pelosi said.
 Though his decision averted the floor fight, some of Mr. Rangel's defenders said they found the outcome unfair and illustrative of the toxic partisan atmosphere in Congress. 
 ''We remain concerned about the precedent this sets for the House of Representatives, that the political climate is such that a member would feel the need to step aside, even temporarily, during an ongoing proceeding,'' Representative Barbara Lee of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in a statement.
 After Mr. Rangel first said he was stepping down temporarily, Republicans considered proceeding with their planned vote to call for his removal. But they sought and received a ruling from the presiding officer of the House on Wednesday afternoon that Mr. Rangel was considered to have resigned his chairmanship.
 Facing an angry electorate, Democrats were becoming increasingly concerned about being tied to Mr. Rangel. The ethics report issued last week -- with the potential for more revelations to come -- was too much for some. They began going public with their opposition to the chairman, an unusual turn of events because junior members are typically fearful of angering such a senior member. Some members also began returning past donations from Mr. Rangel.
 Some of his colleagues said they thought he had made the proper choice and was eliminating a distraction that had hindered the work of the committee.
 ''My North Carolina neighbors want a Congress that maintains the highest ethical standards,'' said Representative Bob Etheridge, a North Carolina Democrat who sits on Mr. Rangel's panel.
 In Harlem, some of Mr. Rangel's constituents voiced support for him. Dewey Morgan, 64, a retired therapist who has lived in the neighborhood for decades, said Mr. Rangel had made the right decision to give up his chairmanship ''before it gets any worse.'' 
 But he said Mr. Rangel should not be forced to resign from Congress. ''He's been in there for a long time, so he must have been doing something right,'' he said. 
 Mona Newton, 55, who works at a Harlem car service and was born in Harlem Hospital, said it should be left to voters to judge the congressman. ''Let him do out his term and let the people decide,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Despite Storms, Stores Beat Expectations With Relatively Strong Gains

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Despite fears that snowstorms in February would dampen sales, the nation's stores posted their strongest results on Thursday since late 2007, suggesting the beginnings of a broad recovery in retailing. 
 Nearly every major chain turned in robust figures, beating analysts' expectations and recording the sixth consecutive monthly sales increase. Even long-struggling stores and sectors came back from the dead. 
 ''If anybody was wondering about the real state of the consumer, this is their answer,'' said John D. Morris, a retailing analyst with BMO Capital Markets. ''The consumer is coming back.'' 
 The results provoked a measure of skepticism, however. A major reason they looked so good was that they were being compared with the deep declines of February 2009. That tempered industry professionals' enthusiasm, as did the continuing high rate of unemployment, which strongly correlates with consumer spending. 
 Moody's Investors Service said in a research note on Thursday that while retailers reported ''modestly positive results, we remain unconvinced that this is evidence of a sustainable trend.'' 
 Analysts at Moody's said that in the year ahead, many consumers would be forced to increase their savings to pay off debt, and that the weak credit market would continue to squeeze consumers. 
 With February always a slow sales month, retailing analysts said the major test of the nascent recovery in retailing would come at the end of April. Over the next two months, they will be looking to see whether consumers are willing to open their wallets for spring clothes and Easter-related treats and decorations. 
 But for now, the February results are the best news in retailing in many months.
 Comparing this February to last, the industry reported a 4 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts polled by the company had expected stores to do well, in contrast to last year's 4.7 percent decline. Even so, the results exceeded their expectations by more than 1 percent.
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, published its own figure, saying the industry had a 3.7 percent increase -- the strongest since November 2007, when sales grew 4.9 percent by that group's measure. 
 Had the weather been better, the results would probably have been even more robust. Retailers have a tendency to blame snow and rain for lackluster sales. But Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at SpendingPulse, an information service of MasterCard Advisors, said this time the retailers' lament was justified. He pointed out that sales in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states -- hit by repeated storms -- account for about 25 percent of all retailing in the United States. 
 Macy's, for instance, reported a 3.7 percent increase at stores open at least a year but said that its February increase would have been about 5 percent if not for the storms. 
 The retailing industry's 4 percent increase in February was the best monthly percentage jump that the chains had collectively posted since the end of 2007. But that does not mean the stores have returned to the sales levels they hit at the peak of the boom. Sales fell so far in the recession that stores have climbed only part of the way back. 
 Still, the improvement last month was not only pervasive, it included categories of merchandise that had been hurt most by the downturn. 
 For example, sales of luxury goods not including jewelry peaked in 2007, and while they have yet to climb back to that level, they rose by double digits last month. Sales of luxury goods increased 15.2 percent year-over-year, according to SpendingPulse. ''You're just growing off of an absolutely tiny sales base last year,'' Mr. McNamara said.
 The February results continue a positive trend for the sector. Sales were up 8.1 percent in January and 5.5 percent in December, compared with the same months the previous year. 
 February sales at Saks stores open at least a year, a measure of retail health known as same-store sales, increased 2 percent. Same-store sales in the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores, increased 5.1 percent. At Nordstrom, which offers a wider range of prices than Saks and Neiman Marcus, sales rose 10.3 percent.
 As expected, stores that sell brand names at a discount thrived. Analysts said that while luxury retailing was enjoying an uptick, value was still king. Same-store sales rose 11 percent at Ross Stores and 10 percent at TJX Companies, which owns chains like TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods. 
 Other clothing purveyors showed improvement. Same-store sales climbed year-over-year at nearly every major department store chain, a long-struggling sector, including Macy's and Kohl's (both up 3.7 percent), Dillard's (up 2 percent), J. C. Penney (up 1.2 percent) and Bon-Ton (up 0.5 percent). Stein-Mart was an exception, posting a 9.3 percent decline. 
 There were also increases at most specialty clothing stores and retailers that cater to teenagers, including Aeropostale (up 7 percent), American Eagle Outfitters (up 6 percent), Buckle (up 5.1 percent), Wet Seal (up 4.7 percent) and Gap (up 3 percent). 
 Abercrombie & Fitch, the worst-performing chain for much of the recession, reported a 5 percent same-store sales increase. 
 Same-store sales rose by double digits at Zumiez (up 11.2 percent) and Limited, which owns chains like Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works (up 10 percent). Hot Topic was an exception, with sales sinking 7 percent. 
 Yet even as some consumers bought discretionary items like shirts and sneakers, they continued to be frugal-minded, driving sales at stores that sell food and other necessities at low prices. 
 Same-store sales were strong at discount chains like Costco (up 9 percent), BJ's Wholesale Club (up 7.5 percent), and Target (up 2.4 percent). Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, does not report monthly sales. Costco said in a statement that customer traffic increased by about 3 percent and that the average transaction amount rose 1 percent. 
 The International Council of Shopping Centers expects the industry to post a 2.5 percent same-store sales increase in March. Easter, which is a week earlier this year than last, will most likely help increase sales. So might tax refunds.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Moves Closer to Sale of Another Big Unit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
The American International Group moved closer to the $15 billion sale of a second major life insurance unit on Thursday after the Internal Revenue Service indicated that it would rule favorably on a tax issue that had stymied the deal, people briefed on the matter said. 
 With the resolution of the tax issue, A.I.G. would be able to wrap up the sale of the unit, the American Life Insurance Company, known as Alico, to MetLife within days, these people said. One of them said a deal could be reached by Sunday evening.
 Representatives for A.I.G. and MetLife declined to comment. If a deal is reached, it would represent another big repayment on the federal government's bailout of A.I.G. The first $9 billion of proceeds from the sale will go toward repaying the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which owns preferred shares in the unit.
 This week, A.I.G. agreed to sell its big Asian life insurance unit, American International Assurance, to Prudential of Britain for $35.5 billion. The New York Fed is set to receive about $16 billion from that sale.
 The government has committed more than $180 billion to supporting A.I.G., which was by far the costliest bailout of any company rescued during the financial crisis. 
 A.I.G. has committed to selling off nonessential businesses to help pay down that investment, reducing itself to a global property and casualty insurer and a domestic life insurer. 
 News of the potential resolution of the Alico tax issue was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online.

HEADLINE: Who Can Clean Up Albany? Koch and Company Will Try

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The subject kept coming up. 
 ''Everybody I talked to over the past year has been saying, 'Ugh, it's so awful,' '' former Mayor Edward I. Koch said recently. At lunches and dinners, in meetings with clients, law partners, fellow alumni of public service, business associations and good government groups, the conversation invariably turned to the political chaos in Albany. 
 ''I finally said to myself, somebody's got to do something,'' Mr. Koch recalled. ''And if no one else does anything, notwithstanding the fact I'm 85 years old, I'm going to throw myself into it.''
 So Mr. Koch is assembling a coalition of powerful civic groups that, starting next week, will plot a purge of the State Legislature by taking aim at incumbents judged to be impediments to change. 
 ''I don't believe the good ones are good enough,'' Mr. Koch said, referring to state lawmakers, ''and the bad ones are evil.''
 In a letter inviting others to the meeting, Mr. Koch, a Democrat, and the leaders of two good government groups, Citizens Union and New York Civic, insist that their efforts are not driven by ideology. 
 ''The key,'' the letter says, ''must be the defeat of those incumbents, regardless of party, who are responsible for this odious situation, and the election of new candidates, committed to a reform agenda, to take their place.''
 The fledgling effort has already stirred a spirited debate among civic groups, several of which are officially nonpartisan and do not endorse candidates. Even the agenda is in flux. Does the coalition go after every incumbent? Who would be singled out? Do they have the resources to raise money for challengers? Can they even agree on a platform?
 Among the other groups that have been invited are Common Cause, the Urban League, the Hispanic Federation, the League of Women Voters and the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. Representatives of some nonpartisan groups said that for them to participate, the agenda would have to be broadened to drafting a reform platform rather than going after individual legislators.
 ''We certainly are interested in the reform agenda,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the nonpartisan New York Public Interest Research Group, ''but we couldn't be part of any agenda that's designed to knock off incumbents.'' 
 No matter the challenges, Mr. Koch believes there has never been a more opportune time for such an ambitious endeavor. ''There will never be for another 100 years the same kind of environment that we have today that would help us succeed -- that is, the disgust people have toward Albany,'' he said. 
 The odds are formidable. 
 Since 1982, 2,958 elections have been held for individual Senate and Assembly seats, and only 39 times have incumbents lost, according to records kept by Mr. Horner's group. In 2008, more than half of the 212 senators and Assembly members won with more than 80 percent of the vote; 57 ran unopposed. In the Senate, the average tenure is nearly 14 years. 
 Mr. Koch acknowledged that challenging every incumbent was unrealistic. Still, he added, ''It's possible that the defeat of a few will turn the others into reformers.''
 There is no doubt that public revulsion at legislative gridlock, partisan bickering and a governor mired in scandal is at a palpable level. A poll released on Wednesday by Marist College found that less than half of respondents said they would vote for their incumbent legislator in the election this year. 
 ''We believe we need to challenge incumbents in a way they have never been challenged before,'' said Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, which was founded in 1897. 
 Henry J. Stern, the director of New York Civic, expressed dismay that in some political circles the low regard that lawmakers were held in had elevated Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, to a paragon of statesmanship. ''To think there's an area where Shelly Silver is the giant is ridiculous,'' Mr. Stern said. 
 The letter outlining the campaign's mission does not mince words in portraying the dismal state of affairs in Albany.
 ''Our state government, including the Legislature, is an embarrassment,'' the letter says. ''Their collective inability to deal responsibly with substantive issues has led to the deterioration of New York State's economy and the accumulation of billions of dollars in deficits. This impacts the delivery of services and impairs the quality of life our citizens should enjoy. 
 ''The situation is coming to a boil. The 2010 election presents a unique opportunity for us to convert the public sentiment for fundamental reform into citizen action.''
 Some political analysts who are not involved in Mr. Koch's campaign agree that this election year may be unlike others. 
 ''I am not an advocate of taking out incumbents because they are incumbents,'' said Gerald Benjamin, a dean and political science professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz. ''However, I do think the anti-incumbent idea as an organizing impulse has legs now.'' 
 Mr. Koch likened the fledgling movement to the reform coalitions that endorsed mayoral candidates in the early 20th century and helped sweep Fiorello H. La Guardia into office in 1933. 
 ''What we're missing at the moment, and I hope that we will remedy that, is bringing in four or five figures who are universally respected like Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman, and we're working on it,'' he said.
 He said the group would not apply a purity test to potential candidates on the basis of every issue, but would ''look at the character of the person and his or her career.'' 
 A priority for Mr. Koch and others working with him is ensuring that the reapportionment of legislative and Congressional districts based on the 2010 Census is nonpartisan, so that competitive challenges to incumbents would be a realistic possibility. 
 ''The most jealously guarded prerogative of the Legislature is its power to gerrymander districts to keep incumbents in office,'' Mr. Koch said.
 State Senator Martin J. Golden, a Republican from Brooklyn, said a nonpartisan reapportionment was ''a great idea, but I just don't think it's going to happen.''
 ''I have no problem passing reform that's reasonable and responsible,'' Mr. Golden added. ''But what people are concerned about most are jobs, taxes and spending.'' 
 Mr. Koch, a veteran of many political fights, has no illusions about what he is seeking to do. 
 ''Whether or not this succeeds is to be determined by the courage of people,'' he said. ''Whether they want to stand up in the face of possible retaliation by the Legislature. People in politics have relationships with people in Albany, and they will be endangered by this. The question is whether good government is more important than special interest.''

HEADLINE: 16 Finalists Are Named for School Grant Program

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- New York, Florida and Pennsylvania are among the 16 first-round finalists in the federal grant competition known as Race to the Top, in which states compete for a share of $4 billion in school improvement money, the federal Department of Education said Thursday.
 The other first-round finalists are Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Tennessee. 
 The first-round winners will be announced on April 1. Forty states and the District of Columbia submitted proposals. There are expected to be only a handful of winners in the first round.
 Under the rules, the awards that states are likely to win vary according to the size of their student populations. According to those guidelines, Florida and New York could win $350 million to $700 million; Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania could win $200 million to $400 million; and Indiana, Massachusetts and Tennessee could win $150 million to $250 million.
 In addition, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, and South Carolina might win $60 million to $75 million, and Delaware, the District of Columbia and Rhode Island might win $20 million to $75 million.
 But since those rules are nonbinding, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has the power to apportion winnings any way he wishes. ''These states are an example for the country of what is possible when adults come together to do the right thing for children,'' Mr. Duncan said Thursday.
 States that do not win first-round money can reapply by June 1 for a second round. 
 In their proposals, states had to document their efforts to make changes in educational policy supported by the Obama administration, like integrating what the administration calls ''career-ready standards'' and new tests into their school systems, building better teacher evaluation systems, creating school data systems that can track student achievement, intervening in failing schools and eliminating caps on charter schools. 
 Critics have said the administration has taken the federal role in education far beyond what is proper; Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican, refused to participate on those grounds.
 In providing money for the competition in the economic stimulus bill last year, Congress gave Mr. Duncan the power to pick the winning states. Mr. Duncan and his staff set up an elaborate judging process, and sought help from dozens of reviewers -- most of them former superintendents, principals and other educators -- to read the proposals. After each application was read by five reviewers and scored on a 500-point scale, the rankings were forwarded to Mr. Duncan, officials said.
 But Mr. Duncan can pick winners out of order if he wants, officials said.
 New York's placement among the finalists had been anything but certain, even though Mr. Duncan has frequently praised New York City's school improvement efforts under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. But the competition barred states with laws that prohibit the use of student achievement data to evaluate teachers, and New York has a law that seemed to fit that criteria. But the state argued that the law banned the use of such data only in making teacher tenure decisions. The law sunsets at the end of June.
 Merryl H. Tisch, chancellor of the state Board of Regents, said Thursday that she believed the Legislature needed to pass a law raising the state's cap on charter schools before New York could be awarded money.
 Even if the Legislature raises the cap in the coming weeks, however, that will not improve New York's chances for a first-round award on June 1, Department of Education officials said.
 Many analysts had identified Florida and Louisiana as strong contenders. Florida has one of the most advanced student-data tracking systems in the country, as well as a system that rates schools like report cards, A through F. Louisiana was an obvious contender, partly because scores of charter schools opened in New Orleans after the city's school system was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. 
 President Obama last month requested an additional $1.3 billion to extend the competition into a third round next year. And in a meeting with governors last month, Mr. Duncan said the administration hoped to extend it even further.
 ''We want to come back round after round,'' Mr. Duncan told the governors, adding, ''We'd love to see this four, five, six years out -- just keep growing it.''
 Some critics think those plans are premature.
 ''We haven't seen any results,'' said Representative John Kline of Minnesota, the ranking Republican on the House Education and Labor Committee. ''Let's see what states get approved, which states get left out. There are a whole bunch of unanswered questions.''

HEADLINE: New Unemployment Claims Fall, After Weeks of Unsettling Gains

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims retreated from a three-month high last week, the government said Thursday, reviving hopes that the labor market was on the track to recovery.
 But the housing market had another setback as pending home sales fell more than expected in January, rekindling worries that the market could stumble. Sales fell 7.6 percent in January, the National Association of Realtors said, compared with a forecast of a 1 percent increase.
 A third report on Thursday showed that factory orders climbed 1.7 percent in January, in line with expectations. 
 Jobless claims fell 29,000, to 469,000, the Labor Department said, and a closely watched four-week average also declined. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations.
 The jobs market had shown signs of weakening in recent weeks, with claims reaching unexpectedly high levels. Some economists attributed the increase to a spell of stormy weather, which closed many businesses along the East Coast for several days and created a backlog of claims. Others saw it as evidence that the labor market was deteriorating in the face of a feeble recovery.
 Thursday's report provided some indication that the jobs market was stabilizing, even as businesses remained reluctant to hire.
 ''Firings appear to have stopped, but hiring has not yet resumed at a steady pace,'' said Anna Piretti, senior economist for BNP Paribas. ''There is still a very large pool of unemployed people out there, and it's going to take years before they are reabsorbed into the work force.''
 Economists said the decline in pending home sales was a return to the norm after a tax credit pushed sales up rapidly at the end of 2009. Thursday's report underscored the fragile nature of the market, following similarly dreary data recently on new- and existing-home sales. 
 ''It will be a slow recovery,'' said Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''There will be more home sales in 2010 than in 2009, but not a whole lot more.''
 Ms. Chen said unusually stormy weather in January could also have affected sales.
 Pending home sales, which measure contracts to buy previously owned homes, were 12.3 percent higher than in January 2009, according to the report. Over the next several months, analysts expect an increase in sales as the April 30 deadline for the end of a second government tax credit approaches.
 The Commerce Department's report on factory orders recorded a strong gain, largely because of a surge in demand for airplanes. But a closely watched indicator of capital investment fell 4.1 percent.
 Uncertainty was high in advance of the government's monthly employment report on Friday. Analysts expect February's snowy weather to make for a dismal report that significantly exaggerates the size of job losses. Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a loss of 50,000 jobs.
 The Labor Department said on Thursday that productivity continued to climb as employers tried to do more with less. Nonfarm productivity increased at an annualized rate of 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to the 6.3 percent forecast by economists.
 The number of people continuing to file claims declined to the lowest level in more than a year, according to the Labor Department's report, reaching 4.5 million. But when adding in those who filed emergency and extended benefits, the number was 10.5 million, just shy of a record set last month.
 A four-week moving average, which removes some of the volatility in the numbers, fell to 470,750 last week, a decrease of 3,500 from the previous week, after climbing for several weeks.
 Persistently high unemployment threatens to hamper the strength of the economic recovery. With paychecks scarce, consumer spending remains weak, and Americans are reluctant to make large investments in items like homes. Given the tepid economic outlook, businesses are also hesitant to expand their ranks.
 The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $15 billion measure that would give companies tax breaks for hiring unemployed workers.

HEADLINE: China's Premier Presents Plan for Growth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China said Friday that the nation would expand social spending, bolster lending, curb inflation and meet its traditional 8 percent economic growth target in 2010, but he cautioned that China still confronted ''a very complex situation'' in the wake of the global financial crisis.
 Delivering his annual report to China's unelected legislature, the National People's Congress, Mr. Wen said that ''destabilizing factors and uncertainties'' in the world economy posed a challenge to China's continued growth. But he effectively said that China's plan to slowly ease away from last year's enormous economic stimulus program, which spared China the worst of the recession, would continue unchanged. 
 ''There's no surprise here,'' Tao Wang, an economist for USB Securities in Beijing, said in an interview after Mr. Wen's address. ''This has been the working assumption for a long time.''
 Mr. Wen's 35-page speech, the rough equivalent of an American State of the Union address, included a listing of statistics aimed at underscoring the government's successful policies, swathed in boilerplate assertions of arduous struggle and glorious achievement. 
 While economies in most of the rest of the world struggled last year, China managed an 8.7 percent increase in its gross domestic product, capped by 10.7 percent growth in the last quarter of 2009. Many economists, including Ms. Wang, predict that China will easily beat its goal of 8 percent growth this year.
 But Mr. Wen's address also referred to problems in China's booming economy that some experts say could hamstring future growth if they are not addressed quickly.
 He pledged to clamp down on speculative real-estate purchases, which some analysts say are creating a bubble in China's housing market. He also said the state would take measures to rein in an explosive rise in urban land prices. He warned that some Chinese industries, fed a diet of easy money and loose regulation, had developed serious overcapacity problems.
 And even as he committed to expand the nation's money supply by 17 percent this year, increasing lending by 7.5 trillion renminbi, or $1.1 trillion, Mr. Wen warned that ''latent risks in the banking and public finance sectors are increasing.''
 More skeptical economists have contended that China's flood of lending during the recession will create a mountain of bad debt that will hamper future growth. 
 Mr. Wen said the government would run a budget deficit of $154 billion in 2010, which is in line with economists' expectations. As a share of gross domestic product, the projected deficit is unchanged from last year.
 Over all, spending will rise about 11.4 percent this year, half of the increase in spending during the recession last year.
 Beyond economics, Mr. Wen's speech laid out a familiar blueprint for raising China from a developing nation into the top ranks of the developed world. Last year, he said, the government's stimulus measures helped increase auto sales by 46.2 percent, housing by 42.1 percent, as measured in square meters, and retail sales of consumer goods by 16 percent.
 He recited a series of often-staggering numbers to highlight the country's rapid development: 800,000 older homes were renovated in 2009; 165,000 miles of power lines were upgraded; 3,450 miles of new rail lines were laid; 2,900 miles of new freeway were opened; 35 airports were either built or renovated.
 Mr. Wen said that the government had drastically increased spending on low-income housing, pensions, education and health care, and that the increases would continue this year. The government will take new steps to recruit top-level educators to China, to improve teacher training and to direct talented teachers to impoverished rural areas, he said.
 Mr. Wen also said that China would pour money into strategic industries, increasing research and development and infrastructure spending to ''capture the economic, scientific and technological high ground.'' Among the areas he singled out were biomedicine, energy conservation, information technology and high-end manufacturing.
 In a bow to China's status as the world's single-largest polluter, Mr. Wen also pledged to increase environmental protection measures, planting nearly 23,000 square miles of new forests, expanding sewage treatment and clean drinking-water programs, and retrofitting coal-burning power plants with advanced machinery to cut emissions.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Declines Slightly in New York

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Unemployment rates for New York City and the state dipped in January, providing a faint signal that the waves of layoffs set off by the financial crisis may be subsiding.
 According to figures that the State Labor Department released on Thursday, the city's official unemployment rate declined to 10.4 percent in January from a revised 10.5 percent in December. That was still well above the national unemployment rate, which dropped to 9.7 percent in January from 10 percent in December.
 But the report, which contained annual revisions to previous estimates of job losses during the recession, reinforced the view of many economists that New York has fared considerably better than the nation since the crisis took hold two years ago. 
 The revisions raised the estimate of the total job loss in the city. Yet proportionally, the loss of jobs is significantly smaller for the city than for the nation. 
 Employment in the city peaked in August 2008, several months after the national recession began. For every 50 private-sector jobs that existed in the city back then, about 2 have been lost. By contrast, about 3 of every 50 such jobs in the nation have been lost. 
 ''Despite the fact that this was one of the worst financial crises in more than half a century, its effect on the New York City economy was one of the mildest,'' said Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. 
 ''It is still kind of bumpy. I don't think there's going to be real job growth for at least four months, maybe longer.''
 The city lost jobs in January, as it usually does when temporary workers hired for the holidays are let go. But the decline in employment in January, which totaled 72,700 jobs, was significantly smaller than the average January loss in the city over the last 10 years, which was 107,600 jobs, said James Brown, an analyst with the Labor Department. 
 After those numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations in hiring and firing, the decline in employment in January is likely to appear as a gain. The department makes seasonal adjustments to the monthly jobs data it releases for the state, but does not adjust the city numbers. Ms. Denham calculates her own seasonal adjustment of the city numbers; by her estimate, the city added about 25,000 jobs on an adjusted basis in January, a gain that reduced the total job loss in the city during the recession to about 160,000.
 ''January numbers are notoriously volatile, depending on the exact timing of post-Christmas layoffs and school closings,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But we did see significantly fewer layoffs in the professional and business services sector than we usually get. That could be a positive sign.''
 The jobs estimate and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys, which is one of several complications that make it possible for the unemployment rate to decline while the city is still losing thousands of jobs.
 The state's unemployment rate slipped to 8.8 percent from 8.9 percent as private-sector employers added 30,500 jobs, according to the department's seasonally adjusted figures. That gain represented an increase of 0.4 percent and raised the number of private-sector jobs in the state to 6.99 million. The state's public sector shrank a little in January, so the total of nonagricultural jobs increased by just 25,500, to 8.49 million. 
 The state's unemployment rate has remained below the nation's throughout the recession. 
 Since the state's job count peaked in April 2008, New York has lost 352,700 jobs, or about 4.8 percent of its highest total. The state's unemployment rate averaged 8.4 percent for all of 2009, the highest annual rate since 1992, said Peter A. Neenan, director of the department's research division. 
 ''Our newly revised jobs data indicate that the impact of the national recession on New York state's economy was deeper than first estimated,'' Mr. Neenan said.

HEADLINE: China to Slow the Rise of Military Spending

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and JONATHAN ANSFIELD

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's official military budget will rise by just 7.5 percent in 2010, a government spokesman said Thursday, a rate that is about half the official increase in recent years and the first to fall below 10 percent since 1989.
 The announcement by Li Zhaoxing, a spokesman for the National People's Congress, China's legislature, gave no explanation for the slowdown. Some analysts speculated, however, that China's huge economic stimulus program and other efforts to address unemployment and welfare had eaten into monies that in a normal year would go toward defense. 
 It is also possible that China reduced the growth of its publicly acknowledged defense spending to help allay international concerns about its rising power.
 While China's government has disclosed more information about military spending in recent years, much of its spending remains secret, and, in the past, military experts in the United States and elsewhere have said Beijing's real military spending is at least double the announced figure. A 2009 Pentagon report estimated China's total military spending to be between $105 billion and $150 billion. While growing rapidly, China's military spending is still dwarfed by that of the United States, which has about $719 billion in outlays this year for national defense. 
 American military spending amounts to about 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product -- compared with about 1.4 percent for China -- and, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, accounted for 48 percent of the entire world's military spending in 2008.
 At a news conference before Friday's opening of the legislature, Mr. Li said that the government had always tried to limit military spending and that it had ''set the defense spending at a reasonable level to ensure the balance between national defense and economic development.'' The legislature must approve the government's 2010 budget at its session this month, but the vote is a formality.
 A budget report submitted to the legislature said the government had earmarked about $77.9 billion for the military in 2010, an increase of about $5.4 billion from actual spending last year.
 Military spending in 2009 had been forecast to expand by 14.9 percent over the 2008 total, but Reuters reported that spending grew at a slightly greater rate because the military spent about $2 billion more than anticipated.
 On Thursday, Mr. Li said that the budget increase would go toward ''enhancing the military's capability to meet various security threats,'' advances in China's military affairs and addressing the needs of the armed forces. Some of the money will be spent to raise the living standards of military officers in line with improvements in national living standards, a spokesman for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a government advisory body that is also meeting in Beijing, said this week.
 The slower growth could be linked to the maturing of costly weapons programs that have reached the end of expensive development cycles, said David Shambaugh, the director of the China Policy Program at George Washington University and a noted expert on the Chinese military. But he said it was equally possible that the smaller increase followed an internal debate over ''guns or doufu'' -- the dietary staple known commonly in the West as tofu.
 ''Given other demands on state expenditures from various sectors -- the stimulus, unemployment, insurance -- to continue giving the military 15 percent increases year on year does cause some Chinese to raise questions,'' Mr. Shambaugh said in a telephone interview. ''There have been complaints from some other sectors that it has been distorting expenditures. Maybe some of those arguments have come home to roost.''

Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an article on Friday about the relatively small increase in Chinese military spending announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, misstated the relationship of Mao Xinyu, an officer in the People's Liberation Army who was shown attending the session, to Mao Zedong. Mao Xinyu is a grandson, not a son.

HEADLINE: Thousands In California Protest Cuts In Education

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Reporting was contributed by Malia Wollan from Berkeley, Calif.; Jennifer Steinhauer and Rebecca Cathcart from Los Angeles; and Gerry Shih from San Francisco.

 BODY:
SACRAMENTO -- Angered by increases in tuition and cuts in state financing, thousands of students, parents and faculty members protested across California on Thursday at colleges, universities and even elementary schools to plead for help with the state's education crisis. 
 Called a ''strike and day of action to defend public education'' by organizers, the demonstrations were boisterous and occasionally confrontational -- campus and building entrances were blocked at several schools -- but they were largely peaceful for most of the day. 
 Late Thursday afternoon, however, more than 150 people were arrested after they stopped traffic along an interstate in Oakland, according to the California Highway Patrol. There was also one injury. Protesters in Davis, outside Sacramento, also tried to block an interstate but were rebuffed by the authorities using pepper spray. One student protester was arrested. 
 Scattered tuition protests occurred in other states, too, with at least 16 people arrested at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, when protesters tried to force their way into administration offices and threw ice chunks at campus officers, according to a university spokesman. 
 One of the largest demonstrations in California took place here on the north steps of the Capitol, where more than 1,000 people used drums, bullhorns, and scores of young voices to try to get their message across.
 ''How are we going to save the future if we can't even get into our classes?'' said Reid E. Milburn, the president of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges, referring to tuition increases and reductions in the number of courses. Her comments drew a large cheer from those in the crowd, many them students avoiding classes in a show of protest.
 California's public education system has been racked by spending cuts because of the state's financial problems, which include a looming $20 billion budget deficit. Layoffs and furloughs have hit many districts and school systems, along with reductions in course offerings and grants.
 On Wednesday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican in his last year of office, said the layoffs and reductions in courses carried out by some schools in the state were ''terrible.'' The bottom line, he said, was that ''they need much more money.''
 Where that money might come from is unclear. Alberto Torrico, the Democratic majority leader in the State Assembly, has proposed a 12.5 percent tax on the state's oil producers, which he says could raise $2 billion for higher education. But with any new tax in California requiring a two-thirds majority in the Legislature, its prospects are uncertain. 
 Educators said the 23-campus California State University system -- which has more than 425,000 students and lower fees than the 10-campus University of California system -- was being hit particularly hard by cutbacks. 
 Julie Chisholm, an assistant professor of writing at one Cal State institution, the California Maritime Academy, in Vallejo, was struggling with 1-year-old twins at the Sacramento protest. She said that her $60,000 salary had been cut 10 percent by furloughs, but that she had chosen to take her furloughs on nonteaching days to avoid inconveniencing her students. 
 ''Our students are getting hit, too, with higher tuition,'' she said. 
 In Santa Cruz, the surfing town south of San Francisco, protesters effectively shut down access to the University of California campus there by blocking entrances, according to a message posted on the university's Web site. Protesters also broke at least one windshield and intimidated visitors, the message said.
 Santa Cruz and several other University of California campuses were the sites of demonstrations last fall when the State Board of Regents approved a 32 percent increase in undergraduate fees, the equivalent of tuition. 
 Several hundred students also protested at Bruin Plaza at the University of California, Los Angeles, where people in one group had painted skulls on their faces. And at the university's Berkeley campus, Rafael Velazquez, 23, a graduate student in the school of education, who plans to be a public high school teacher, was one of hundreds protesting. 
 ''I plan to be a teacher, but it's not my job prospects I'm worried about,'' said Mr. Velazquez, who has a brother in fifth grade in San Lorenzo. ''It's the whole system.''
 The cuts are also being felt in economically depressed areas like Richmond, near San Francisco, where unemployment is 17.6 percent and violent crime and poverty are common. 
 ''Kids come to school hungry; some are homeless,'' said Mary Flanagan, 55, a third-grade teacher from Richmond. ''How can we deal with problems like that with as many as 38, 40 kids in a class?''
 Protesters said they would continue to press their case with more demonstrations, including what was expected to be a well-attended protest on Thursday evening in central San Francisco. But at San Francisco State, where about 150 students, faculty members and administrators had joined to form an ''informational picket line,'' some were skeptical that anything -- other than a sudden influx of money -- would be effective in swaying state leaders. 
 ''We've had tons of protests here, and it doesn't do much,'' said Maura Geiszler, 22, a senior studying music. ''All they've got to do is turn off the news.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Signs That Economy Is Stabilizing

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose Thursday as better-than-expected monthly sales from retailers and a decline in the number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits suggested the nation's economy was stabilizing.
 February retail sales, which were expected to have been hurt by the severe weather across the United States, lifted retailers' shares, and the Standard & Poor's retail index rose 1.3 percent.
 Target, the discount retailer, rose 2.4 percent, to $52.94, after it said sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.4 percent for the month. 
 ''The jobless claims and the retail sales were better than the market expected, and we also saw some upgrades from analysts,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist with Prudential Financial in Newark.
 ''It would suggest to me that traders especially are sensing that the nonfarm payrolls number would not surprise to the downside tomorrow,'' she said, referring to the Labor Department's monthly employment report on Friday.
 The report is expected to show that employers cut 50,000 jobs last month, according to economists polled by Reuters, but investors are concerned that poor weather conditions may cloud the reading, and forecasts are in an unusually broad range.
 The market has been strong recently with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 1.7 percent so far this week. The Dow Jones industrials turned positive for the year, joining the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite, which rose above the break-even mark earlier in the week.
 The Dow gained 47.38 points, or 0.46 percent, to 10,444.14. The S.& P. 500 rose 4.18 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,122.97, while the Nasdaq added 11.63 points, or 0.51 percent, to close at 2,292.31.
 The S.& P. 500 is now down just 2.4 percent from a 15-month closing high set on Jan. 19, after falling more than 8 percent through Feb. 8.
 The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks had a 17-month closing high, a move that suggested it might just be a matter of days before other indexes retested the highs of the rally from the lows hit in early March 2009.
 Fundamentally, small-caps are considered harbingers of an upturn in the economic cycle since smaller companies are more sensitive than multinationals to domestic business activity.
 Of 28 retailers reporting sales, 76 percent topped analysts' expectations, with a median surprise of 2.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 Top gainers included Abercrombie & Fitch, whose shares rose 14.6 percent, to $41.52; Zumiez, another teen retailer, up 10.1 percent, at $17.62; and Family Dollar Stores, the discount chain, up 8.1 percent, to $35.24, after it raised its quarterly earnings forecast.
 The S.& P. consumer discretionary index rose 1 percent, with that sector one of the strongest in the market.
 In a mixed day for economic indicators, the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales fell unexpectedly in January, while a separate government report showed factory orders rose 1.7 percent for the month.
 Data from the housing market has been weak recently, and the latest report weighed on home builders' shares. The Dow Jones home construction index fell 0.9 percent, with KB Home down 0.9 percent, at $16.72.
 Positive brokerage notes helped blue chips, with Boeing, Walt Disney and Coca-Cola ranking among the Dow's top gainers.
 Interest rates were slightly lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 100 6/32, and the yield fell to 3.60 percent from 3.62 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Heads of 12 Fed Districts Press to Keep Central Bank, and Their Role, in Place

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As Congress haggles over a broad overhaul of the nation's financial regulations, officials at the Federal Reserve have mounted a highly public effort to maintain, and perhaps even expand, the central bank's regulatory powers.
 The effort does not appear to have been coordinated by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, or other members of the board of governors in Washington. Instead, presidents of the Fed's 12 district banks have been at the forefront of what amounts to a public relations offensive. 
 In a speech Wednesday to the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, compared the financial crisis to a near-fatal heart attack.
 He warned that stripping the Fed of its supervision powers ''would be the equivalent of ripping out the patient's heart.''
 Mr. Fisher added: ''That would surely prevent another heart attack but would likely have serious consequences for the patient.''
 The district presidents' motivation is not hard to understand. Nearly 3,000 Fed employees around the country work in bank supervision and regulation. The presidents not only fear the loss of prestige and influence, but also have to deal with the concerns of employees anxious about losing their jobs or being reassigned. 
 In a flurry of speeches, as well as correspondence and meetings with lawmakers, the presidents have pressed the case that the Fed should continue to oversee nearly 5,000 bank holding companies, which include the Bank of America and Citigroup, along with the roughly 875 state-chartered member banks, which are fixtures of Main Streets nationwide. 
 Some senators would like to see regulation of the state banks transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which already oversees most small community banks. 
 The bank presidents have responded by arguing that the Fed can be a buffer against financial risk and that monetary policy and bank supervision are mutually reinforcing. 
 In Philadelphia on Wednesday, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, said the Fed should ''play a significant role in overseeing systemically important institutions and addressing systemic risks.'' 
 Mr. Rosengren, speaking to the Global Interdependence Center, a nonprofit group, was responding in part to proposals to create an interagency council, led by the Treasury secretary, to monitor such risks.
 Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, cited the Fed's role as the lender of last resort in a speech on Monday in Washington. Banks use its discount window to borrow money at low interest rates. 
 ''As long as the Federal Reserve is responsible for discount-window lending, it makes no sense to diminish the Fed's robust role in the supervision of a range of banking institutions, from large to small,'' he told the Institute of International Bankers.
 Mr. Bernanke has made the case for the Fed's role in bank supervision in meetings with lawmakers, and in a Senate hearing last week. But he has kept a fairly low public profile on the matter. 
 Irwin L. Morris, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park, who has studied how the Fed decides monetary policy, said the presidents' arguments were self-serving in a sense, though understandable.
 ''Would they like to maintain the status quo because it is supportive of the institution as they prefer it? Yes,'' he said. ''Do they also see it as good policy? Yes.''
 Critics of the Fed say the district presidents are often too cozy with the banks they regulate. The 12 banks have their own boards, which choose the presidents, in consultation with Fed headquarters.
 Member banks elect two-thirds of each board (half are bankers and half are other members of the public), and the Fed's board of governors names the remaining third.
 ''I always thought that the reserve banks, the way they appoint the presidents, was a conflict of interest,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. He said of the member banks, ''They appoint their own regulator, and I'd like to knock that out.'' 
 Damon A. Silvers, policy director at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., agreed. ''If the Federal Reserve is going to have additional regulatory responsibility, it should be clear that it's a public body, and not a self-regulating body or an arm of the banks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Canada Wonders Whether Olympic Hockey Gold Will Lend Shine to Prime Minister

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper demurred Monday when asked at a news conference to comment about what impact Canada's buoyant post-Olympic Games mood might have on his political future.
 ''The games are all about the country, all about the athletes,'' he told reporters. ''I don't think it's about political parties. We'll leave our political battles for another day.''
 But many analysts and the opposition say Mr. Harper has been playing politics with the Games for months as a way of trying to improve his party's flagging approval ratings. 
 First, he temporarily shut down Parliament in December, in what critics say was a gambit to stop a damaging investigation into what the government knew about the treatment of Afghan detainees it handed over to the Afghan government, despite warnings that they would be mistreated. Then, critics say, he spent the Games as the hockey-fan-in-chief, eventually basking in the glow of the country's gold-medal performance and emotional win over the United States.
 ''Everyone in this House and everyone in the country knows why the prime minister shut down Parliament,'' Michael Ignatieff, the Liberal leader, said during the first question period of the new parliamentary session on Thursday.
 Mr. Harper's move initially attracted widespread disapproval that included rallies in several major Canadian cities.
 While Mr. Harper disputes the accusations -- saying he shut Parliament so the government can rethink its economic policies -- it is an open question whether the country's pride in its showing at the Games, where it won 14 gold medals, will in fact help the conservative government's standing. 
 Darrell Bricker, the president and chief executive of Ipsos Reid Public Affairs, a public opinion firm based in Toronto, is among those who believe that Mr. Harper's decision to temporarily shut Parliament will ultimately be a political success.
 ''Canadians were generally proud of their performance at the Olympics,'' Mr. Bricker said. ''These kind of good feelings change the atmosphere in politics.'' 
 If there is indeed a change in the national political mood, polls released this week show only a positive trend for Mr. Harper's government rather than a huge shift.
 A poll by Mr. Bricker's firm, which was conducted during the Olympics but before the hockey finale, found that 37 percent of voters favored the Conservatives compared with 29 percent for the Liberals, the largest of the three opposition parties. (The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.) 
 That level of support is probably not enough to create a Conservative majority in the House of Commons in the next election, whenever it is called, something that eluded Mr. Harper in two previous votes. But the showing is an improvement over polls earlier this year that showed the two parties roughly tied, even though the Liberals had been in disarray since they lost an election in 2006.
 Polls by Ipsos Reid and others also found that during the games Mr. Harper widened his personal approval ratings over Mr. Ignatieff.
 Neither man has a natural political gift for working crowds and greeting strangers. But Mr. Harper is a confirmed hockey fan (he has been writing a hockey history book for several years) and he rarely missed an opportunity during the Olympics to be photographed with hockey stars, past and present.
 In hockey-mad Canada, Mr. Bricker said, those images mitigated the widespread perception of Mr. Harper as a somewhat stiff ''Machiavellian, partisan type of guy.''
 He added: ''He made the most of the moment. He was a real fan, it wasn't just politics.''
 The real verdict, of course, will come during the next federal election, which could be prompted by a defeat of any portion of the budget introduced Thursday.
 But analysts say Mr. Harper played it safe, introducing a budget that is unlikely to stir vehement opposition. 
 And on Thursday, both the Liberals and the New Democratic Party said they did not plan to bring down the government over the budget.
 Unlike Mr. Bricker, however, Frank L. Graves, the president of Ekos, another major Canadian polling firm, said he believed that any reflected glory from the hockey win would wane, while the discontent over Parliament's suspension would linger. 
 He said the suspension ''lit the fuse on a wide range of growing anxieties.''

HEADLINE: Hoping to Make Iran Sanctions Work but Readying Gas Masks, Too

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Preparations for a strike against Iran's nuclear program are as evident as ever: the introduction of an attack drone capable of flying hundreds of miles, the frequent open talk of a possible attack, the distribution of new gas masks to the public. 
 But lately, the real action in Israel on the Iranian issue has been the parade of top American security officials. The chairman of the joint chiefs, the director of the C.I.A. and the national security adviser have all just been here; the vice president arrives on Monday. 
 ''Some have described it as a bear hug,'' a senior Israeli official said of the near-daily high-level meetings, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to express himself freely on a charged issue, as did three other top Israeli officials for this article. 
 ''All the visitors to Israel are sending us and the region a message: that Israel is not alone,'' said Ilan Mizrahi, a former head of Israel's National Security Council. ''That means that Israel will not pull the trigger without a lot of consideration and consultation.''
 The American decision to press Israel to hold its fire stems partly from war game exercises in both countries that have raised complex questions about how effective a strike would be, how Iran would react and when it would be clear that a nuclear line had been crossed in Iran. The officials say this is the time to try to put tougher sanctions against Tehran into place. And Israel is going along.
 ''No Israeli prime minister wants to make the decision to attack Iran,'' commented a former official closely involved in these discussions. ''And for Iran to go nuclear on Obama's watch would be seen as a colossal failure. There is a common interest to make sanctions work.''
 As a result, the Israeli-American relationship has actually been improving lately over Iran. Both countries still find it useful to note that Israel is preparing for a strike and that its government includes some real hawks. This is a point American officials made to China recently to persuade it to join the sanctions regime. 
 But few believe an attack is imminent. Intelligence cooperation between the United States and Israel is intensifying, and assessments regarding Iranian intentions and capabilities are closer than they were during the Bush administration. 
 A year ago, the differences were starker. The Obama administration wanted to engage Iran in talks; the Israelis viewed that as a waste of time that would give Tehran greater opportunity to enrich uranium while stringing along President Obama with promises of diplomatic breakthroughs.
 The troubled June election in Iran, the violent repression of dissent there and the Iranian rejections of Western offers to enrich uranium outside Iran altered Washington's views. ''We have seen a real change in the administration,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''They now see Iran as riper for tough sanctions.''
 Israeli officials agree that the Iranian government and economy are weak and that harsh sanctions could pressure it into changing its nuclear policy. But which sanctions? 
 ''The question now is how much the desire for international consensus will dilute the sanctions,'' one senior official said.
 The United States is aiming at a broad coalition, including Russia and China, signing onto a United Nations resolution. That would mean less severe sanctions than those Israel would seek to impose. Many Israelis would like to single out Iran's energy sector because penalties of that kind are seen as more likely to deal a severe economic blow. 
 The Israelis have made recent high-level visits to China and Russia in an effort to bring officials there aboard. In addition, Israeli officials are due in Washington next week to urge Congress to take a tough unilateral stand on the issue. 
 The Obama administration has not backed sanctions on Iran's energy sector for fear of alienating ordinary Iranians, including the country's struggling opposition movement. But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was here this week and spoke of the importance of tough sanctions. ''I believe that the most biting and important sanctions would be those on the energy side,'' he said at a news conference after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 One of the challenges of forging a coherent joint policy is that developments on the ground are not static. Recently, Iran said it had started to enrich uranium up to 20 percent, a huge step from its current enrichment of 4 percent. This would put it much closer to the capacity to enrich at bomb-making levels. 
 Moreover, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran attended a summit meeting in the Syrian capital with the leaders of Syria and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. His verbal attacks on Israel were harsher than usual. 
 Israel says it is watching with enormous concern. Its officials say they do not want to be lured into what could be an Iranian trap: a confrontation in Lebanon or Syria aimed at diverting the world's attention from Iran. At the same time, they worry about weapons being smuggled into Lebanon and to Hamas in Gaza, and feel they may need to act. 
 The United States hopes to prevent any slide into armed confrontation by increasing its diplomatic relations with Syria and appealing to President Bashar al-Assad to stop transferring arms to Hezbollah.
 Still, for all the agreement between Jerusalem and Washington, there remains a significant difference. It emerged last month when Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, was asked at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy how cooperation was going between Israel and the United States on Iran. 
 ''From America, when you look at a nuclear Iran, you already have, just besides allies like France and the U.K., a nuclear Russia, nuclear China, nuclear India, nuclear Pakistan,'' he replied. ''North Korea is going toward turning nuclear. So probably from this corner of the world, it doesn't change the scene dramatically. 
 ''From a closer distance, in Israel, it looks like a tipping point of the whole regional order.''
 In other words, as a top Israeli official put it afterward: ''For the Americans, Iran is a strategic threat. For us, it's an existential one.''
 Whether that difference becomes more significant in the coming year will help determine whether Israel breaks ranks with Washington.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Health Care Deadline To Democrats and Insurance Leaders

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, beginning a full-court press for his health care overhaul, met Thursday with insurance industry executives and House Democrats as party leaders on Capitol Hill struggled to figure out whether they could meet the president's timetable for enacting legislation within a few weeks.
 One day after Mr. Obama vowed to do ''everything in my power'' to get a bill passed, his health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, convened insurance executives at the White House and pressed them to release actuarial data justifying their rate increases. The president stopped by -- an appearance that was unscheduled, but clearly orchestrated -- to deliver a letter from an Ohio cancer survivor who had dropped her insurance after a 40 percent rate increase.
 The president spent the afternoon in back-to-back private sessions with two separate groups of House Democrats: liberals and members of the various minority caucuses, many of whom are uncomfortable with the bill because it lacks a ''public option,'' or government-backed insurance plan; and leaders of the centrist New Democrat Coalition. 
 He told the liberals that a public option would never pass the Senate, but said he would be ''personally committed'' to pursuing it once the current bill became law, said Representative Raul Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He asked centrists for support.
 ''The president impressed upon us the need to pass comprehensive health care reform and do it soon,'' Representative Joseph Crowley, the New York Democrat who leads the centrist coalition, said after the meeting, adding, ''I think when all is said and done, we will have the votes.''
 A big question, though, is precisely when all might be said and done. Mr. Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters Thursday that the president expected the House to complete its work by March 18, when Mr. Obama is to leave for Australia and Indonesia. But the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other Congressional leaders outlined steps that would make it difficult to meet that timetable.
 First, Ms. Pelosi said, Democratic leaders must agree on the substance of a budget reconciliation bill, the likely vehicle to make changes in the health care bill passed by the Senate. At that point, Ms. Pelosi said, House Democratic leaders will consult with their Senate counterparts, and then their own colleagues in the House. She conceded that some Democrats are skittish.
 ''Every vote, every legislative vote is a heavy lift around here,'' Ms. Pelosi said.
 Many House members seemed to be keeping their options open. Representative Bart Stupak, the Michigan Democrat and author of restrictive anti-abortion language that is not in the Senate bill, said in an interview with Fox News that he did not oppose the use of reconciliation per se. But he also said Mr. Obama needed to be ''more flexible'' in tightening the abortion restrictions.
 ''I want to see health care pass, and whatever vehicle we need to do it, let's get it done,'' Mr. Stupak said. ''But there's a principle and a belief that the American people agree with, which says no public funding for abortion, and that's a principle and a belief I'll continue to fight for.'' 
 Ms. Pelosi said the Senate health bill should be acceptable to the House, with fixes to be made in the budget reconciliation bill: additional subsidies, to make insurance more affordable for moderate-income people; elimination of a special Medicaid deal for Nebraska; and a reduction in a proposed excise tax on high-cost health plans offered by employers.
 While Ms. Pelosi said 80 percent of the excise tax would be eliminated, some Democrats remain unhappy with it. Representative Dan Maffei, Democrat of New York, warned that the tax ''would still hit middle-income people in my district.'' 
 Another New York Democrat, Representative Jerrold Nadler, said Ms. Pelosi told skeptical Democrats, ''When you win 80 percent, take your victory.''
 In the Senate, Republicans said Thursday that Mr. Obama was making a big mistake if he assumed that the Senate would approve, without change, a budget reconciliation bill passed by the House. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, said his colleagues would offer numerous amendments to the budget bill, in an effort to ''stop it.''
 At the White House, participants said the tenor of the meeting between Ms. Sebelius and the insurance executives was surprisingly cordial. Mr. Obama and Ms. Sebelius have been excoriating insurers in public. But the executives said the meeting was civil and focused on health policy and economics, not politics. 
 Two chief executives -- Stephen J. Hemsley of UnitedHealth and Angela F. Braly of WellPoint -- said they had made the case that premiums were higher because they must pay the higher prices being charged by doctors, hospitals and makers of drugs and medical devices. The executives also told the White House that their profit margins were smaller than those in other sectors of the health industry.
 ''If you took all the profits of the seven largest commercial health insurance companies, they would pay for just two days of health care for the uninsured,'' David M. Cordani, the chief executive of Cigna, said in an interview after the session.
 Mr. Gibbs, though, suggested the president took a skeptical view in his talk with the executives. ''The president said, 'Look, I understand. I realize costs are going up, but it is unjustifiable to raise health insurance rates at such a drastic -- to such a drastic level when health care inflation is not at that level,' '' Mr. Gibbs said, recounting the conversation. 
 The White House meeting might not have produced any agreement between Mr. Obama and the insurers, but it did result in some mini-celebrity for the cancer survivor who wrote to the president. 
 She is Natoma Canfield, 50, of Medina, a town outside Cleveland. She has been cancer free for 11 years, but wrote Mr. Obama on Dec. 29 to say that last year, though she increased her deductible to the highest level available, she paid more than $6,075 in premiums, while her insurer paid just $935 in reimbursements. When told that the policy would cost nearly $8,500 this year, she dropped it; in a phone interview, she said she works cleaning houses and could not afford the policy. The White House released her letter, and Mr. Obama's reply; by Thursday evening, she said, she was swamped with inquiries from reporters.
 ''I just wanted someone to have it known that I was for health care and that something needed to be done,'' she said. ''I never expected the president to read it himself.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about President Obama's efforts to get health-care legislation enacted misstated the television network on which Representative Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat, said in an interview that Mr. Obama had to be ''more flexible'' on tightening provisions on abortion in the bill. It was Fox Business Network, not Fox News.

HEADLINE: The Drama of How The Race Is Run

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
WHAT does it mean to manufacture drama? The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences thought it knew when it announced last year that the number of Oscar nominees for best picture would be doubled, to 10 from 5. ''We will be casting our net wide,'' Sidney Ganis, then the Academy's president, said at the time. It was a blatant move to create more buzz around an already artificial buzz machine, an appeal to populism and a gambit to boost ratings. (''Our partners at ABC are very, very happy,'' Mr. Ganis added.)
 As it turns out, the Academy needn't have bothered. Last year ''Slumdog Millionaire'' won enough hearts and had enough box office clout to become the early front-runner and then to win best picture, merrily singing and dancing its way through the economic pallor and any hint of awards suspense. But this year's extended Oscar race was capable of creating drama under its own momentum, thank you very much. 
 When the statuettes are doled out on Sunday, audience members at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood and at home will have already been privy to a season with as much narrative sweep as a made-for-television mini-series. As the writer of the New York Times's Carpetbagger blog, I've been cataloging the in-jokes and jibes, which have grown more byzantine with the red carpet slog extended for two weeks to make room for the Olympics. 
 When first we met our contenders for the golden boy, they included veterans (Clint Eastwood, with the sports drama biopic ''Invictus''), modern heir apparents (Jason Reitman, ''Up in the Air'') and upstarts (Lee Daniels, ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire''). Quentin Tarantino's ''Inglourious Basterds'' was still just a funtastic summer flick. ''Avatar,''James Cameron's behemoth 3-D extravaganza, was withering under the weight of pre-screening bad press, earned when a few clips were shown at ComicCon in San Diego and commercials started popping up on television. And Kathryn Bigelow's ''Hurt Locker'' was part of an admirable but unpopular genre, the pulsating Iraq war thriller, that only critics seemed to have seen.
 Now, of course, ''Avatar'' and ''The Hurt Locker'' are the chief rivals for best picture, though they couldn't be further apart in style or profit margin. That Mr. Cameron and Ms. Bigelow were once married provided a screenplay-worthy twist, though in an uncinematic move they have refused to play the parts of bickering ex-spouses. (Mr. Cameron has even said Ms. Bigelow deserves the prize for best director.) Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in ''Adam's Rib'' they're not, but still: drama. And their competition is exactly the kind of David vs. Goliath, art house vs. blockbuster drama that the Oscars are made for.
 Anyway, there was plenty of bickering and fighting elsewhere. First, the move to 10 nominees produced its own wave of critics, armchair and industry insider alike, who grumbled that the expansion would dilute the value of being noticed; or that there should have been a companion doubling of best director nominees; or that the Academy couldn't come up with 10 good movies, period. This griping largely stopped when the best picture nominees were revealed, and the Academy did exactly what it was supposed to do, pull in unexpected and popular titles like ''The Blind Side,''''District 9'' and ''Up.''
 But with so many movies, the Academy was forced to abandon its usual tabulation method -- ''mark down your favorite movie of the year'' -- in favor of a more complicated system, in which members had to rank all 10 films. I'll spare you the accounting details, but suffice it to say that putting a movie in the No. 2 or No. 3 spot on a ballot could be as important as putting one in the top spot. This will affect the race more than anything, awards pundits contend, though it's not clear whether that message reached busy or older voters holed up with piles of screeners. 
 Oh wait: who cares? People watch the Oscars for stars, and Hollywood's wattage will be out in force, George and Meryl and Sandy, with a few first-name-only newcomers, Mo'Nique and Christoph and Gabby, added to the mix. Yes, the major acting races have seemed sewn up for weeks, bolstered by other awards and love from critical and peer groups, but at least the story lines they represent cut a wide swath. That's true for both the movies and the performers; in Christoph Waltz and Gabourey Sidibe, the Cinderella narrative got some new gloss. I've combed through the collective wisdom and the gut prognostications and offered my own predictions for your Oscar pool. (See chart, Page 8. Though please bear in mind I'm a forecasting newbie.)
 Another reason people watch the Oscars is for the spectacle, and the new producers, Bill Mechanic and Adam Shankman, have taken pains to assure would-be viewers that this year's show will be more -- cue jazz hands -- spectacular than ever. They're aiming for old- and new-school comedy magic in their hosts, Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin, and pop culture squeals with presenters like the ''Twilight'' stars Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner. Performers from ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' the Fox reality show on which Mr. Shankman is a judge, will also appear, to the evident delight of his many Twitter followers. 
 The normally staid Academy is also taking steps to join the social media age, broadcasting pre-Oscar events on its tie-in site, Oscars.com, and its Facebook page. There's also as an iPhone app. For an organization that just officially acknowledged the existence of Oscar pools last year, it's a step toward interacting with the new audience the show's organizers and advertisers are clamoring for.
 And yet: perhaps they shouldn't have worried so much. For reasons that have yet to be fully determined (but probably have something to do with the water cooler, cultural-flattening effect of the Internet) broadcast ratings of awards programs and the Super Bowl are up this year. Box office revenue is too, helped by the added fees that theaters can charge for 3-D tickets. All of this, and the inclusion of a cross-cultural batch of movies with populist and artistic credibility, could add up to a Nielsen bonanza. Unless everybody just watches the highlights on YouTube.
 But all is not cheery. (Remember: drama!) In recent weeks Oscar campaigning has taken a dark turn, as allegations and gaffes have dogged front-runners, most notably ''The Hurt Locker.'' Given the prolonged season and heightened attention on the awards, the charges, which questioned the film's authenticity, probably had more traction than they would have. Yet most also came too late to have much impact on voting. Anyway, doesn't the dirty pool happen every year? Even for a newbie like me it smelled familiar, a part of the Oscar narrative that is as reliable as the last-minute scramble for gowns.
 That, in the end, is all we look for in the Oscars: a little reliability and a little mystery, a dollop of authentic escapism.

HEADLINE: Michigan Lawmaker Steps Up at Ways and Means

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Sander M. Levin, a liberal Democrat from Michigan and a bookish expert on trade policy, stepped into the powerful post of chairman of the Ways and Means Committee on Thursday as Democrats averted an internal battle over replacing Charles B. Rangel of New York. 
 Hours later, Mr. Levin laid out his agenda to create jobs and expand trade, saying he would press South Korea and other countries to do more to open their markets to American-made products, including automobiles manufactured in and around his district in the northern suburbs of Detroit. 
 In an interview in the committee's ornate conference room in the Capitol, Mr. Levin said he was convinced -- based on recent conversations with constituents -- that Democrats must battle harder to enact their goals, including sweeping health care legislation and addressing the aftershocks of the worst recession in generations.
 ''You go home virtually anywhere in this country, and I can't tell you enough -- it's excruciating, what it's doing to families,'' Mr. Levin said. ''To hear the stories of people saying: 'We want to work. Now make it possible.' That's our job, to help make it possible. That's our No. 1 job.''
 By seniority, Mr. Levin, 78, who has been a member of Congress since 1983, was second in line for the top committee post, after Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California. Mr. Stark agreed to stand aside and continue as chairman of the panel's health subcommittee after it became clear that he did not have the full support of Democrats on the committee or of House Democratic leaders. 
 Mr. Rangel, the dean of New York's Congressional delegation, stepped down on Wednesday as Republicans prepared to force a vote to oust him from his chairmanship. Last week, the ethics committee admonished Mr. Rangel for violating House gift rules by accepting two trips to seminars in the Caribbean that were sponsored by corporations. 
 House leaders predicted that Mr. Levin, who referred to himself as ''acting chairman,'' would provide a steady hand, in contrast to Mr. Stark, who is known for occasional verbal outbursts, like one in October 2007, when he accused President George W. Bush of sending soldiers ''to Iraq to get their heads blown off for the president's amusement.''
 The panel has jurisdiction over taxes, health care, trade and other issues central to the economy.
 ''I am collegial and can be tough,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I don't think they are inconsistent.'' 
 Mr. Rangel is generally considered a pro-trade Democrat. Mr. Levin's positions are more nuanced. 
 I. M. Destler, an expert on trade politics at the University of Maryland, said: ''Mr. Levin is assertive, combative and tough-talking on trade. He highlights problems with other countries' policies. But he probably has a more pro-trade voting record than most Democrats in the House.''
 Mr. Levin said he refused to be described as either a free trader or a protectionist. ''I totally reject the polarization in trade,'' he added. ''I'll sum up my position: to expand trade and to shape its course to maximize the benefits and to minimize the detriments.''
 He said he was deeply concerned about trade barriers that made it hard for Ford to sell autos and for Whirlpool to sell basic refrigerators in South Korea.
 ''As a matter of practice and principle,'' Mr. Levin said, ''trade agreements have to have a two-way street, reciprocity.''
 ''I know that globalization is here to stay,'' Mr. Levin said. But, he added, he has insisted on ''fully enforceable labor and environmental standards,'' like those included in a United States trade agreement with Peru.
 Mr. Levin said he had also pushed for greater protection of workers' rights in trade pacts with Panama and Colombia, personally negotiating with officials from both countries to make sure the issue was addressed.
 Mr. Levin and Mr. Rangel are friends, and Mr. Levin expressed mixed emotions about the events that led to his ascent to one of the most influential positions in Congress. But he also voiced confidence. ''I believe I can do the job,'' he said. ''I believe I can work well with people and I can make the tough decisions.'' 
 Mr. Levin was handed the gavel at a tough time for the committee and for House Democrats generally, as they begin a final push to adopt health care legislation amid relentless criticism by Republicans, in a midterm election year. Mr. Levin himself is facing a primary challenge. 
 Mr. Rangel offered praise for his successor. ''It's the best thing for the country, the Congress and the committee under the circumstances,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''I love him. He is good. He is thorough.''
 Mr. Levin also received a congratulatory telephone call from the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, Alan R. Mulally. 
 Mr. Levin, who is known as Sandy, said he had inherited a commitment to social justice from his parents. ''Michigan was where the middle class first blossomed,'' he said. ''In my district, I can knock on doors and see the embodiment of the progress we've made in this country for working families. It was the auto industry that provided people with the means to have a decent salary, a house, health insurance and a pension. We have to preserve that progress and help it expand.''
 Mr. Levin's younger brother, Carl, is Michigan's senior senator and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The two are close, and often play squash, competing fiercely. 
 Senator Levin, in an interview, called his brother ''an absolute expert at reaching out to people and building consensus.'' But he also acknowledged the rivalry. 
 ''He is as nice a guy as you could ever meet,'' Senator Levin said. ''On the athletic courts, he is not so mild-mannered.''

HEADLINE: House Passes Tax-Break Bill To Create Jobs

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday approved a $15 billion measure intended to spur job creation by granting tax breaks to businesses that hire workers, as Democrats, bracing for new jobless figures, tried to show that Congress was doing something about stubborn unemployment.
 Democrats pushed through the measure on a mainly party-line vote of 217 to 201. They characterized the measure, which also funneled an extra $20 billion into road and bridge construction, as just the first step in a broad legislative push to bolster the economy and encourage hiring. 
 Representative Bob Etheridge, Democrat of North Carolina, said the bill was ''really all about our three most important priorities in this Congress: jobs, jobs, jobs.'' He estimated that the measure could create one million jobs.
 Though the measure attracted bipartisan support when approved by the Senate last week, House Republicans were dismissive, saying it was cobbled together by Democrats for political purposes and would do little to spur new employment. And many Democrats, even though they backed the measure, considered it far too limited in scope.
 Just 6 Republicans joined 211 Democrats in backing the measure; 166 Republicans and 35 Democrats were opposed.
 ''This is a no-jobs bill, this is a faux-jobs bill, this is a snow-jobs bill,'' Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, said.
 Democrats in the House and Senate are eager to score some victories on job-related legislation even as they continue to be preoccupied with the fate of their health care overhaul. The bill passed by the House, which also extends the federal highway program and provides federal subsidies for public works bonds, was scaled back from a much larger measure in the Senate in an effort to speed it through.
 But even advancing the narrower measure has vexed Democrats. Senate Democrats had hoped the House would simply pass its measure so it would land on President Obama's desk before a new jobless report on Friday.
 But House Democrats wanted several changes. They adjusted the bill to cover its costs more completely, to satisfy Democratic fiscal hawks. To attract liberal lawmakers who contended the measure was too meager, they added a provision to generate business for minority contractors. The revisions mean the measure will have to be reconsidered by the Senate, where it was unclear whether Republicans would seek to slow its progress.
 The centerpiece of the legislation is a plan to exempt businesses that hire people who have been out of work for at least 60 days from paying the 6.2 percent payroll tax on those employees through year-end. It also grants a $1,000 tax credit if the workers are kept on for a full year. 
 Opinion is divided on whether the approach is effective or simply gives businesses a break on workers they would have hired anyway. But lawmakers said that given the dismal unemployment picture, they were willing to give it a try, and estimated the tax breaks would put 300,000 people to work.
 That was not enough for some Democrats. ''We should stop calling it a jobs bill, and instead acknowledge this is about business tax cuts,'' said Representative Barbara Lee, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She voted against the bill and said much more needed to be done to reach the chronically unemployed.
 In bolstering and extending the federal highway fund through the end of the year, lawmakers hoped to encourage state and local governments to move ahead with projects that provide good-paying jobs and bring some stability to a federal program that was shut down temporarily this week in a Senate fight over unemployment benefits.
 ''It will save hundreds of thousands of jobs,'' said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, about the transportation financing. ''It will incite economic activity.'' 
 House members were upset over a Senate transportation provision that they said funneled too much money to California, Louisiana, Washington and Illinois; they extracted a promise from Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to correct the allocation in a later bill.
 Democrats had intended to focus on job-creating measures this year but that plan has been disrupted by the continuing fight over the health care overhaul.
 As the health negotiations continue, the Senate is moving forward on a $150 billion package of business tax breaks and safety net programs that it hopes to approve next week. Democrats say they will next turn to providing more help for small businesses and aid to states.

HEADLINE: A Place Where Open and Honest Discussions Are in Style

BYLINE: By KATIE FRETLAND

 BODY:
In bright red letters, ''Ron's Barber Shop'' is printed on the glass front at 6058 West North Avenue on Chicago's far West Side. A bumper sticker is plastered on the shop's back door with a message to the community: ''Stop. Killing. People.'' 
 The back entrance to Ron Gibson's shop leads to a small area with a chess table, opening to a large room with five leather chairs, five barbers, children playing video games and customers sharing stories and opinions on the usual barbershop topics: relationships, local political races, President Obama, high school football, churches, favorite places to eat and good movies. 
But two Fridays a month, at 5 p.m., Mr. Gibson silences the cacophony coming from two televisions and turns his shop at the corner of North and Meade Avenues into a forum for the kind of academic discussion not usually heard in a barber shop. 
 The sessions, sometimes led by professors from the University of Illinois at Chicago, have recently explored issues like domestic violence, rape and the state of public education. 
 Mr. Gibson, 41, said he hosts the talks in hopes that a frank exchange of views would help solve community problems. The discussions are organized by the Illinois Humanities Council and the university. 
 At one recent meeting, about 50 men and women sat on benches and listened to Beth Richie, professor of criminal justice and African-American studies at the university, speak about her book, ''Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women.'' The discussion explored why some black men beat women. 
 Fallon Wilson, 27, who said she saw violence against women within her family, told the group that she believed there were multiple, intersecting reasons, including the devaluation of women.
 ''I think it goes back to how we construct traditional masculinity,'' said Ms. Wilson, who researches gender-based violence at the University of Chicago. 
 Ayesha Truman, 37, a teacher at Hinsdale South High School, said she was disturbed by the way some male students treated female classmates, and she pointed to negative messages about women in music and on television.
 ''How do we break the cycle?'' Ms. Truman asked. 
 Mr. Gibson and four other barbers cut hair during the discussion. The male customers listened quietly. 
 Mr. Gibson said the barber shop was a natural place to hold community discussions, whether formally organized or otherwise. 
 ''It's a big melting pot,'' said Dwayne Rushing, 32, who lives in St. Charles and works in Chicago. One of his sons, Nicholas, got his first haircut from Mr. Gibson when he was a year old. 
 ''It brings in a lot of people with different socio-economic backgrounds and lifestyles,'' Mr. Rushing said of the barber shop. ''You get some fairly well-off people and some very poor people. I wouldn't say anybody discounts your opinion one way or another depending on where you are in your life. When you're in a barber shop, your opinion counts.'' 
 On a recent Saturday, a barber, Jeff Williams, 50, flicked a toothpick from either side of his mouth, cutting a customer's hair and singing along with ''Serpentine Fire'' by Earth, Wind and Fire. ''Gonna tell a story, morning glory.'' 
 Aniyah Rushing, 6, wore a pink sweater with her jeans tucked into her boots, and danced around the center of the shop. 
 Gloria Hooker, a minister in a red sweater and a lifelong resident of the West Side, who was waiting for her hair to dry, chatted and let out belly laughs between sips of Pepsi.
 ''There are still good people here who still want to have a beautiful spot for their children and children's children,'' she said. 
 Mr. Gibson keeps close a reminder of why it is important to address community issues. A plastic heart-shaped pin with his cousin's name sits in a drawer beside his chair. In 2008, the cousin, Ryan McDonald, 22, was shot to death on the sidewalk about three miles from the barber shop. 
 ''A lot of times, we stand too divided because we do have our opinions,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''We have older folks that say young folks don't know nothing. We have younger folks that say old folks think they know everything. 
 ''I don't blame any one person for that. If we had a place or a situation where I can hear you, you can hear me, I can hear your opinions, we can disagree without being disagreeable, eventually we will have every question answered.''

HEADLINE: Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Change

BYLINE: By MERRILL A. McPEAK. 
Merrill A. McPeak was the Air Force chief of staff from 1990 to 1994.

DATELINE: Lake Oswego, Ore. 

 BODY:
 THE chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, favors repeal of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' the nickname for the policy regulating military service by homosexuals. ''I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens,'' he told the Senate last month. 
 I was one of the service chiefs when the ''don't ask, don't tell'' compromise was reached in 1993. Until then, every person coming into the military was asked questions directed at establishing sexual orientation, and admitted homosexuals were automatically rejected. Thus the ''don't ask'' part of the rule actually means gays no longer have to lie. 
 In return, the services insisted that homosexuals serving in uniform stay closeted. No doubt this is what bothers Admiral Mullen, as it obliges homosexuals to ''live a lie,'' if not actually tell one. But this part of the formula was not about individuals. It aimed to protect the institutional integrity of the services, which have no higher responsibility than to organize, train and equip formations that are effective on the battlefield. Seventeen years ago, the chiefs -- all four of us, plus the chairman and vice chairman -- concluded that allowing open homosexuality in the ranks would probably damage the cohesiveness of our combat units.
 A lot more heat than light was produced in the 1993 debate. What passed for dialogue then was often strident and uninformed, each side denouncing motives rather than examining convictions. Even though, as Colin Powell observed recently, the world has ''changed'' some in the intervening years, I doubt that we'll have a more enlightened public discussion in 2010. 
 If one is to occur, it should start with the question, ''What are armed forces for?'' Assuming the services exist to fight and win wars, those seeking fundamental change in the composition of combat units carry a special burden of proof. 
 Perhaps young American men and women will fight better when openly gay soldiers are included in the ranks, though I've heard no one make this claim. Instead, advocates for gays in the service have by and large avoided a discussion of unit cohesion, relying instead on arguments falling into three categories: training costs, civil rights and individual performance.
 First, they say, many otherwise proficient servicemen and women are tossed out only because of an inability or unwillingness to stay closeted. As the services keep track of what it costs to train somebody in a specific skill, the price tag, we are told, can be calculated simply by multiplying the number of service members ejected by the cost of training a replacement.
 But this is the wrong way to reckon cost. Each service maintains a multibillion-dollar training system: bases, classrooms, instructors and so forth. This is necessary because of the substantial turnover as service members return to civilian life. The size and cost of the training system is influenced over time by economic factors like pay and benefits or employment opportunities in the civilian sector. In recent years the services have been able to make sizable cuts in training infrastructure because of better retention in an all-volunteer, more professional force.
 Nonetheless, these large-scale factors swamp the question of marginal training cost. In the early 1990s, as we thought through the implications of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' I worked out the numbers for the Air Force. During the previous decade, we'd put about 800,000 people through basic and advanced training programs, at a cost of about $30 billion. The money we expended on training 3,000 people who were eventually removed on account of homosexuality was minuscule by comparison. (During the same decade, we forced out 15 times as many people for failure to meet Air Force weight standards, with no one objecting to the cost.) 
 As one might guess, most homosexuality ''separations,'' as they are called in the Air Force, occurred in the first few weeks of basic training, before the more costly technical training began. And many of these removals would have occurred in any case, since they were the result of unacceptable conduct and not just a declaration of sexual orientation. In any case, it would have made no material difference in Air Force training costs if we had retained all 3,000 people. 
 The second major argument for allowing openly gay service is that it's a matter of civil rights, akin to racial integration. This view must rest on the notion that serving in the armed forces is a job like any other, and therefore civilian anti-discrimination laws should apply. While it may seem hopelessly idealistic, my view is that serving in uniform amounts to a calling, different in many ways from other jobs. (One of the ways is that your employer can order you to risk your life.) 
 But let's limit ourselves to practical considerations. The services exclude, without challenge, many categories of prospective entrants. People cannot serve in uniform if they are too old or too young, too fat or too thin, too tall or too short, disabled, not sufficiently educated and so on. This, too, might be illegal in the civil sector. So why should exclusion of gay people rise to the status of a civil-rights issue, when denying entry to, say, unmarried individuals with sole custody of dependents under 18, does not?
 There is also some misunderstanding about President Harry Truman's executive order of 1948, calling for equality in the armed forces, which is often cited as a model that President Obama should follow. No doubt Truman's action was a landmark in the civil rights struggle. However, the order was not actually sufficient inducement for the armed forces to do the right thing. 
 At the time, the Air Force had prepared itself for racial integration and its leadership pushed hard to make it work. As a consequence, the integration of blacks in the Air Force is one of the great success stories of the civil rights movement.
 The Army and Navy, however, were models of passive resistance. The Air Force had nearly completed integration before the Army really started. Technically, Truman's order made no reference to ending segregation, speaking only of equality of opportunity and treatment regardless of ''race, color, religion or national origin.'' And the Army, at first, argued it was in full compliance. Its subsequent integration was largely forced on it by combat losses in all-white units during the first months of the Korean War. The Navy continued much of its policy of tokenism into the 1960s, with a black steward corps still waiting tables 10 years after the executive order. 
 Harry Truman did not simply pass his hand over the Pentagon and bring about racial justice. Only after the leaders of each service committed their institutions did we make real progress. 
 Thus allowing an openly gay presence in ranks will be very difficult until we have committed leadership for it. I certainly had trouble figuring out how to provide such leadership in 1993. While I believed all people are created equal, I did not believe such equality extended to all ideas or all cultures. And since I didn't know how to advocate the assimilation of this particular form of diversity, I saw no way to prevent it from undermining unit cohesion.
 LAST, and most frequently heard, is the seemingly businesslike argument that what's important is an individual's performance. Hundreds of service members are mustered out annually for failing to stay closeted, regardless of job performance. Indeed, we seem to have here an odd exception to the American idea that people should be judged by their actions rather than their makeup.
 But it would be a serious mistake to imagine that personal performance is what matters in combat. Combat is not a contest between individuals, like poker or tennis; it is a team event whose success depends on group cooperation and morale. So the behavior that concerns us is not individual achievement but the social dynamics of relationships and groups. The issue is whether and how the presence of openly declared homosexuals in the ranks affects the solidarity of the unit. 
 We have already seen the fault lines form in the current debate: the individual service chiefs have expressed reservations about Admiral Mullen's views. This lack of cohesion will likely make the Joint Chiefs less effective in the latest round of this debate.
 Armies have to care about what succeeds in war. Sometimes they win or lose because of material factors, because one side has the greater numbers or better equipment. But armies are sure to lose if they pay no attention to the ideas that succeed in battle. Unit cohesion is one such idea. We know, or ought to, that warriors are inspired by male bonding, by comradeship, by the knowledge that they survive only through relying on each other. To undermine cohesion is to endanger everyone. 
 I know some will see these ingredients of the military lifestyle as a sort of absurd, tough-guy game played by overgrown boys. But to prepare warriors for a life of hardship, the military must remain a kind of adventure, apart from the civilian world and full of strange customs. To be a fighter pilot or a paratrooper or a submariner is to join a self-contained, resolutely idealistic society, largely unnoticed and surprisingly uncorrupted by the world at large. 
 I do not see how permitting open homosexuality in these communities enhances their prospects of success in battle. Indeed, I believe repealing ''don't ask, don't tell'' will weaken the warrior culture at a time when we have a fight on our hands.

HEADLINE: An Agent of Evictions, Surprised by the Humanity She Sees

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
In the dark hours when people learn they are losing their homes, it is Susan J. Parker's face they see, her hand that proffers the eviction notice, her voice they hear: ''You've been served.''
 Ms. Parker is a process server, ''the bearer of bad news,'' in her words. Like bankruptcy lawyers, repo men and second-hand stores, she is in a business -- doing the face-to-face dirty work on behalf of banks, lawyers and businesses -- that is flourishing amid the economic detritus of the recession. 
Because of their closeness to economic despair, process servers have a front-row seat to America in crisis, delivering evictions to those who fail to pay rents or mortgages. Surely this must be a terrible job, confronting people at rock bottom who you would think are likely to behave their worst. 
 Not so.
 ''I've seen a lot of strength,'' said Ms. Parker, who is paid per assignment. ''It's restored my faith in people.''
 It is a remarkable observation, given the extent of California home losses. Foreclosures are projected to claim nearly two million homes from 2009 to 2012, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting homeownership by working to eliminate abusive financial practices.
 Unpaid mortgages represent only part of the problem. Renters who fall behind are served ''unlawful detainer'' papers, forcing them to move. Although it is not known exactly how many face this fate in the Bay Area, County Process Service Inc. of San Jose reported serving as many as 200 such cases per month.
 ''It was real bad there for a while,'' said Scott Soto, who owns the company and has been a process server for 30 years. 
 Mr. Soto said his business had served fewer evictions in recent months, but his is just one of dozens of such businesses in the Bay Area.
 Ms. Parker said unemployment was to blame in many of the cases she had handled.
 ''It's not really their fault,'' she said of the people she had helped evict. ''They're losing their jobs.''
 Ms. Parker, 52, is ebullient and petite. At just 5-foot-2, she moves with a deliberate trot and dons black leather boots while on the job to appear slightly taller. ''Then I'm 5-feet-5 and more threatening,'' she said, laughing.
 The daughter of Harry J. Parker, a former Santa Clara prosecutor, Ms. Parker grew up surrounded by courts and lawyers. She went to work for her father as a legal secretary, and did her first process-serving case 30 years ago. ''I like the action,'' she said. ''I don't like being chained to a desk.'' She has done the job on and off since then.
 She admitted it could be treacherous. ''I've walked into a situation where I was threatened with a shotgun,'' she said. ''I've had some bottles and stuff thrown at me. But I'm not afraid of people, and I'm not afraid of guns.'' 
 She recently served papers on an elderly woman in Redwood City, arriving to find her on her deathbed, surrounded by grieving family members. The latter went into a rage, and the sheriff's department was called to keep the peace.
 Such anger is rare, Ms. Parker said, and her colleagues in the profession agreed. Most people are gracious, even facing homelessness -- like two young men she served in an impoverished block of East Oakland. ''They said, 'Thank you, ma'am.' '' 
 She empathizes with those she must confront, in part, because she was once one of them. 
 It was four and half years ago when she fell behind on rent because of medical bills for a pet. ''The eviction was very traumatic; I never thought it could happen to me,'' she said.
 But it is the quiet dignity and spirit of community that most impresses her these days when witnessing families in tough times, especially those with the least. ''People who are more poverty-stricken will help each other out,'' she said.
 Ms. Parker estimates she has driven 80,000 miles in recent years handling cases, but for the moment she has taken herself out of the chase, living with her elderly mother outside Fresno in order to save money. Work slowed this winter, as it typically does every winter, and she found herself too close to the financial edge again.
 You see, there is a harsh truth of doing this unpleasant work: it does not pay well. Ms. Parker gets just $15 for some assignments. If she fails to find someone, she goes unpaid.
 No one can accuse her of profiting from all the misery.

HEADLINE: Environmentalist Prods Fellow Blacks to Join in Her Crusade

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
No one can accuse Naomi Davis of lacking ambition. She wants simultaneously to rebuild black America and save the planet -- one neighborhood at a time. She knows she cannot do either alone. Her plan is to recruit and train an army. A green army. 
 That is why Ms. Davis, a petite, 54-year-old lawyer turned environmental evangelist, was squeezing her way through a crowded South Side nightclub Monday night, passing out energy-efficient light bulbs that resemble spiral soft-serve custard swirls to anyone who would sign her e-mail list. She has been collecting names from across the country for years, preparing for a war she is waging between the ''old gray economy and the new green economy.'' More than 10,000 names are on her list.
''Instead of waiting for the people to come to us, we go to them, wherever they are,'' she said. ''We're going into the bars, the parks, the churches, the schools, the stores with this new green-economy education. We have to spread the word. Otherwise, people of color are going to be left behind.'' 
 Ms. Davis is the founder and president of Blacks in Green, a three-year-old trade association and education and advocacy group based in Chicago that ''teaches the benefits of the new green economy to communities of color through classes, programs, activities and enterprises.'' 
 She is part of a new generation of black and Latino environmentalists who hope to revitalize their battered neighborhoods, struggling suburbs and rural towns with green-collar jobs and businesses.
 Of the $787-billion federal stimulus package, about $80 billion was allotted for clean energy and other green initiatives. Ms. Davis said her goal was to ensure that black people ''and other people of color have our share'' of the money going to green jobs and businesses, ranging from solar energy projects and wind farms to the construction and renovation of office buildings and apartment towers to make them environmentally sound. 
 Ms. Davis also preaches do-for-self to go along with her gospel of green. ''The move toward eco-friendly development, and the jobs it creates,'' she said, ''is an opportunity for blacks and other minorities to take more control of their destiny. In that sense, it is a way to move forward for communities that often feel left behind by economic opportunity.'' 
 ''What we reject is the 'Help the Negro Industry,' '' she said. ''People coming into our community, thinking they know best, trying to save us. We can save ourselves.
 ''The 'Help the Negro Industry' is what allowed billions of dollars to come down for urban renewal, but the urban did not get renewed. We are absolutely committed that urban renewal not be repeated.'' 
 Ms. Davis said she believed that minorities must educate and prepare themselves to take advantage of the changing, more environmentally attuned economy. It was just as important, she said, to educate people about the ''economics of ecology'' as it was to protest the dire environmental conditions in many black and Latino neighborhoods -- including accusations by some that ''environmental racism'' contributes to the problem. 
 ''There's just a ton of work that going green can generate,'' she said. 
 Then black people can rebuild their neighborhoods, she said, and make them ''self-sustaining'' -- one of her favorite phrases. She calls it ''building green villages,'' meaning neighborhoods with grocery stores, clothing shops, pharmacies and other businesses, all within walking distance of people's homes. It's a far cry, she said, from what she sees today visiting many black or Latino neighborhoods haunted by knots of unemployed men, vacant lots, fast-food restaurants and shuttered businesses. 
 ''The vision of Blacks In Green is self-sustaining black communities everywhere,'' Ms. Davis said. ''That's our focus. To use the new green economy to achieve that is our strategy. We believe nothing trumps self-help.'' 
 While she said she admired her fellow environmentalists who lay down in front of bulldozers or chained themselves to the gates of toxic-producing power plants, that is not her style. She is not a protester. She is, in effect, a town crier, spreading the word that blacks and Latinos should turn green. 
 Among those lauding Ms. Davis is Van Jones, a former green-jobs adviser to President Obama who resigned under fire after conservative critics asserted he had signed a petition accusing the Bush administration of deliberately allowing the Sept. 11 attacks, a claim he denies.
 Ms. Davis has ''been able to create an authentic, grass-roots urban expression of green politics,'' said Mr. Jones, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and teaches environmental policy and politics at Princeton University. ''She's playing almost a Paul Revere role for people who weren't paying attention.'' 
 Bart Schultz, director of the Civic Knowledge Project at the University of Chicago, recently worked with Ms. Davis to organize a panel focused on toxins in the South Side ecology.
 ''She puts in an enormous amount of energy into bringing people into the issue of sustainability, people who have not been involved before,'' Mr. Schultz said. 
 Ms. Davis grew up in a black working-class neighborhood in Queens, N.Y.. Her father was a merchant seaman and was away from home for months at a time. Her mother, the daughter of Mississippi sharecroppers, was a public school teacher. 
 Ms. Davis majored in English and theater at Fisk University before moving to Chicago in 1976 to attend John Marshall Law School. When she was a student, she worked at the Palmer House hotel as a ''gaslight girl.'' 
 ''It was the like the poor cousin of the Playboy bunnies,'' she said. ''I served cocktails, and every hour I got to sing three songs in a tiny costume.'' 
 Since then, she has practiced law and run her own consulting firm. But it was not until 2001 that she began working toward her passion: preaching the power of green.
 ''I was suffering terribly, watching the disintegration of the black community,'' she said. ''Everywhere I looked, it was the same. It seemed that we had the worst of everything: health disparities, mis-education, dropouts, hyperincarceration, violence, unprepared parents, unemployment, misery.'' 
 She started talking to people, reading, searching for solutions. The more she looked, the more convinced she became that the new green economy was the best way to rebuild black America. ''It was back to the future,'' she said. ''It was back to the kind of self-sustaining neighborhood where I grew up.'' 
 On Monday night, Ms. Davis took her gospel to the people. 
 Blacks in Green set up an information table at the entrance of the New Dating Game nightclub on South Stony Island Avenue. It was ''stepper's night'' at the club. Stepping is a smooth, stylized dance, favored by twosomes of a certain age who performed many of the same steps in the 1970s. 
 Latoyia and Theodore Gilbert drove in from Gary, Ind., to help Ms. Davis staff the table, which was covered with the swirly light bulbs and eco-literature. Mrs. Gilbert, 33, is working on a master's degree in environmental education and said that ''being a good steward of our environment is part of our faith.'' 
 The couple's eldest daughter almost died of an asthma attack when she was 6, in 2006. Since then, Mr. Gilbert, 39, a social worker, has been dedicated to making Gary and the rest of the country green. ''It's personal with me,'' he said. 
 Ms. Davis picked up an armful of bulbs and brochures and ventured deeper into the club. 
 ''Have you ever heard of the new green economy?'' Ms. Davis asked, struggling to be heard over the ear-splitting music. 
 ''Not really,'' a man replied. 
 ''Take this,'' she said, handing him the pamphlet, ''Five Things Every Black Person Should Know About Sustainable Communities and the New Green Economy.'' 
 Then she handed himtwo 60-watt energy-efficient bulbs. 
 ''I love these bulbs,'' he said. ''They last a long time. I need to keep the lights on at my house for security.'' 
 Ms. Davis said, ''You're also helping to secure the planet by using them.'' 
 As Ms. Davis moved through the club, her sign-up sheet collected 35 names and e-mail addresses, and the disc jockey, Sam Chapman, announced, ''We're stepping for green, y'all.'' 
 The environmental evangelist smiled. Her army was growing.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION,' through April 4. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CONTEMPLATING THE VOID: INTERVENTIONS IN THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM,' through April 28. In what it calls ''a self-reflexive folly,'' the museum completes the 50th-birthday festivities for Frank Lloyd Wright's building by inviting more than 200 artists, architects and designers to have their way with the landmark rotunda -- imaginatively speaking, of course. Some 193 responded, usually in digital photographs, depicting it as everything from a place to exhibit their work; to a site for trampolines, forests and aquariums; to a jumping-off point for a redesign. The architects tend to be more Oedipal, but not one really improves upon the space. The list of invitees, while global, is a trifle predictable, overloaded with sculptors and installation artists and noticeably short on painters and photographers, who also have imaginations. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,'through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. 
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,'continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson) 
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Anibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. 
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,'through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases the artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith) 
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg) 
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson) 
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: '30 SECONDS OFF AN INCH,' through March 14. This exhibition of 60 disparate artworks by 42 contemporary artists from several generations might be called revisionist. It takes a refreshingly visual, even formal, approach to art that is usually plumbed for political and social meanings based largely on the artist's identity. Its curator, Naomi Beckwith, wants to emphasize the meanings -- social and otherwise -- embedded in the actual objects on view. Her success is mixed, partly because she doesn't spend much time explaining the experiential nature of her selections in the catalog, and also because she includes too many familiar, established artists. But she makes many excellent choices, introduces some promising young talent and displays a visual intelligence that is often rare in her chosen profession. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith) 
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,'through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of brand-new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the fact that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON,' through April 10. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street, (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson) 
 MATTIA BONETTI, through March 13. Here's a show that might brighten your mood in these dark economic times. Either that or the glossy spectacle of Mr. Bonetti's conspicuously expensive-looking furniture will make you want to start a Communist revolution. With an insouciant disregard for stylistic consistency and a fondness for rich materials, this Swiss designer (born in 1952), who is based in Paris, creates luxurious, Postmodernist functional objects that are as witty as they are beautiful. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com. (Johnson) 
 STERLING RUBY: '2 TRAPS,' through March 20. A formidably talented artist -- known for garish ceramics, vandalized Minimalist plinths and spray-paint abstractions -- goes big and relatively bland for his two-piece debut at a big-top gallery. ''Bus,'' a former prison bus with sinister customizing, looks like something Mad Max might drive if he could find the gas; ''Pig Pen,'' a shipping-container-size assemblage of cages made of barred security doors, might imprison Max's competitors for said gas. The qualities that make Mr. Ruby's work compelling are present here, but in uncompelling ratios. Pace Wildenstein, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, pacewildenstein.com. (Smith) 
 Galleries: Other
 JIMMY RASKIN: 'INSEPARABILITY VS. SIMULTANEITY,' through March 14. Mr. Raskin explains his multimedia works in impenetrable prose illustrated by textbooklike diagrams referring to Nietszche, Pinocchio and black holes. Fortunately, he also makes lively, visually interesting sculptures that revolve mainly around oppositions between geometric abstraction and messy collage and assemblage. Modernist purity meets Postmodernist festivity to thought-provoking effect. Miguel Abreu, 35 Orchard Street, Lower East Side, (212) 995-1774, miguelabreugallery.com. (Johnson) 
 Last Chance
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER'; closes on Sunday. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Smith) 
 LEONARDO DREW; closes on Saturday. The artist seems to be losing his taste for tastefulness. ''Number 134,'' a glowering, craggy mass of wood in several forms, painted black, is at once a barricade holding back an unruly force and the force itself, about to break over us like a wave. The flatter topography of ''Number 135'' is no less violent; its 15-by-60-foot sweep of variously pocked, splintered and bristling plywood presents an endless catastrophe from above. The energies intimated here are beyond human control, and Mr. Drew handles them respectfully, but he is also displaying a fuller range of his own powers. Sikkema Jenkins & Company, 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-2262, sikkemajenkinsco.com. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'TINO SEHGAL'; closes on Wednesday. If you've ever wanted to see the interior of the Guggenheim in its pristine state, now's the time. For the solo exhibition of the young European artist Tino Sehgal, the great, spiraling rotunda, recently ablaze with Kandinskys, has been cleared out. Yet the space isn't empty. On the rotunda's ground floor, a man and a woman perform an ever-changing, slow-motion amorous embrace. On the ramps above, people walk and talk in pairs or clusters at a leisurely pace, with new participants periodically joining conversations as others drop away. You're invited to join the conversation, be part of the art, in this deeply refreshing, there-but-not-there show. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter) 
 DAMIEN HIRST: 'END OF AN ERA'; closes on Saturday. The onetime bad boy of British art relies primarily on the shock value of value. Thousands of artificial diamonds are displayed on gold-plated shelves; a calf's head is crowned with a disc of solid gold; and greasy Photorealist paintings of isolated gems are on offer. It is as if Mr. Hirst had seen the light, it was gold, and he wants to shove it in our faces, lest we think we are above greed. If this isn't Sodom, it must be Gomorrah. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)

To the Editor:
 Re ''Extending Our Stay in Iraq'' (Op-Ed, Feb. 24):
 I am disheartened that Thomas E. Ricks, who was so strongly opposed to the war in Iraq, has now recanted and calls for keeping 30,000 to 50,000 troops there for many years to come. I believe that this is a serious mistake. 
 More troops will not prevent the almost daily bombings that continue to destroy lives and property. More troops will not make the Iraqi government more politically and militarily stable. More troops will not squelch a civil war, although Mr. Ricks is willing to take a gamble that it will.
 I will not take that gamble. I am more concerned with the increasing loss of life that we face in Iraq. I am concerned that the fragile Iraqi government has now assumed too much power over our own military and how and when our troops may respond to violence.
 I don't want to create a situation, as we are now doing, that will ultimately lead to an Iranian domination of Iraq. Moreover, I think, given our dire economic situation at home and the severe drain in lives and treasure in Afghanistan, that we can ill afford to stay in Iraq much longer.
 H. David Teitelbaum Redwood City, Calif., Feb. 24, 2010
 To the Editor: 
 Thomas E. Ricks expresses his belief that it may be necessary to extend our presence in Iraq by ''several years.'' He bases his argument on the belief that a force of 30,000 to 50,000 troops with a very narrow mission to advise and assist Iraqi security forces could avert a civil war.
 Mr. Ricks is correct that the fundamental divisions in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds remain unsolved as well as the issues of oil revenue-sharing and the nature of the government. But our continued presence will not serve to advance resolution of these issues and is not likely to prevent a war, since a much larger presence over the last seven years has not led to a resolution amenable to all parties. Senior military leaders have already stated in the press and in other public forums that our influence over events is waning at best, if not virtually nonexistent. 
 The only viable alternative is to withdraw now and quickly. Should we leave now, we can honestly say that we have invested greatly in the future of Iraq (more than 4,000 lives, billions of dollars, national prestige) and done all we could to set the conditions for a successful, peaceful future for the Iraqi people. 
 The rest is up to them; they will either succeed or fail. We must ensure that should they fail, they do not take us down with them.
 Mark Solomon Manassas, Va., Feb. 25, 2010
 The writer is an Army lieutenant colonel who has served two yearlong tours in Iraq.

HEADLINE: SAFETY IS ISSUE AS BUDGET CUTS FREE PRISONERS

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
In the rush to save money in grim budgetary times, states nationwide have trimmed their prison populations by expanding parole programs and early releases. But the result -- more convicted felons on the streets, not behind bars -- has unleashed a backlash, and state officials now find themselves trying to maneuver between saving money and maintaining the public's sense of safety. 
 In February, lawmakers in Oregon temporarily suspended a program they had expanded last year to let prisoners, for good behavior, shorten their sentences (and to save $6 million) after an anticrime group aired radio advertisements portraying the outcomes in alarming tones. ''A woman's asleep in her own apartment,'' a narrator said. ''Suddenly, she's attacked by a registered sex offender and convicted burglar.''
 In Illinois, Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, a Democrat, described as ''a big mistake'' an early release program that sent some convicts who had committed violent crimes home from prison in a matter of weeks. Of more than 1,700 prisoners released over three months, more than 50 were soon accused of new violations. 
 An early release program in Colorado meant to save $19 million has scaled back its ambitions by $14 million after officials found far fewer prisoners than anticipated to be wise release risks. In more than five months, only 264 prisoners were released, though the program was designed to shrink the prison population by 2,600 over two years.
 A victims' rights group in California sued last month to block a state law that expands the credits prisoners can receive to shorten their sentences, and prosecutors in Michigan are challenging release decisions there. 
 ''We're not saying we shouldn't reduce the prison population, but we're saying you have to be very careful, and they're making mistakes left, right and sideways,'' said Jessica R. Cooper, the Oakland County prosecutor in Michigan, where the state prison population shrank by 3,200 inmates last year and where the parole rate is the highest in 16 years.
 ''You cannot measure those mistakes in terms of money,'' Ms. Cooper said.
 The changes in Michigan have been among the most pronounced, and they provide a glimpse into difficulties in about half the states, which have tinkered with parole, early release programs and sentencing laws or are considering doing so.
 The authorities in some places say their changes are driven less by money than by the need to fix systems that are not working, and that such efforts were under way, in some cases, before the recession. 
 ''We can live in fear and make bad policy based on fear,'' said Patricia L. Caruso, director of the Michigan Department of Corrections, ''or we can have some backbone and make policy based on what really helps our communities.''
 Still, she said, the possibility that someone may reoffend always looms.
 ''I worry about it,'' Ms. Caruso said. ''I say a rosary every day.''
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, has approved 133 commutations (more than some of her predecessors), expanded the state's parole board to 15 members (allowing more cases to be considered), and recently proposed a budget that presumes 7,500 fewer prisoners next year for savings of more than $130 million.
 But local prosecutors across the state are challenging at least 20 of the parole decisions, and Ms. Cooper has assigned two lawyers, full time, to review possible parolees from her county.
 Among the 13,541 inmates released on parole in Michigan in 2009 was Scott W. Hankins, who had twice been convicted in sex cases and who had been accused by prosecutors of molesting other girls he had met at church, some of whom were developmentally disabled. The youngest girl, prosecutors say, was 7.
 Mr. Hankins was most recently convicted in 2003 of first-degree criminal sexual conduct for touching a girl who, believing that his children would be present, had gone camping with him. He spent almost seven years behind bars until his release in November, meeting the minimum requirement of the range set by the sentencing judge. But the parole board's decision to release him came well before the maximum of 30 years. 
 Psychologists who analyzed Mr. Hankins in 2009 said he met the criteria for pedophilia, court records say. He had a stellar attendance and homework record in prison treatment for sex offenders, but his responses, according to the psychologists' report, indicated ''that his insight into his actions is still in the development stage'' and that he did not fully recognize how much he had hurt his victims. 
 ''I loved them all -- I would never harm them,'' the report quoted Mr. Hankins as saying. ''I never harmed any of them physically. I was just an overly affectionate person and got carried away.''
 All of that, Ms. Cooper said, made the notion of his release reckless and frightening -- a leap too far, even in the most difficult of recessions. So Ms. Cooper appealed his release, a situation that Michigan corrections officials said was extremely rare. 
 It is one of five such appeals Ms. Cooper has filed so far, several of them involving sex offenders. One of them is Daniel E. Fletcher, who was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in 2007. Prosecutors asserted in court documents that if Mr. Fletcher were to be released, ''the safety of the public will be threatened, and defendant's criminal ways will continue.'' 
 Ms. Cooper said she had to file a lawsuit against the state simply to learn the names of the thousands being considered for parole.
 ''If they're saying to us this is so safe and reasonable, why not allow prosecutors to help cull the list?'' she said. ''We're all law enforcement. The fact that they kept it away from us is an indication that they know they're letting out people they shouldn't let out.''
 In one measure of how tangled the fight in Michigan has become, Mike Cox, the attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor, whose job includes defending the State Department of Corrections and its Parole and Commutation Board in their parole decisions, has also filed separate amicus briefs in eight of the cases, including Mr. Hankins's, opposing parole.
 Administration officials defend the choices not just as sensible budget decisions, but also as intelligent policy for a state that found itself, in 2007, in the unwanted position of having the fifth-largest prison system in the country, behind far more populous states. 
 Meanwhile, the state has vastly expanded its program for prisoners returning to the outside world, officials said, directing millions of dollars toward helping those on parole stay out of trouble. The rate of parole violations, too, has dropped, they say. 
 Corrections officials challenged the notion that local prosecutors had been kept from learning the names of those being considered for parole. Prosecutors are routinely informed of those soon to be granted parole, but corrections officials simply had no list of all those eligible, said Russ Marlan, a department spokesman. These releases are not early per se, corrections officials say, but within the parameters of Michigan's indeterminate sentences, which define minimums and maximums. 
 The prosecutors who accepted Mr. Hankins's 2003 plea agreement, for example -- in which he pleaded guilty to a single count of criminal sexual conduct while counts involving two others (including the 7-year-old) were dismissed -- always knew it was conceivable that he would get out in just under seven years, corrections officials said.
 Mr. Hankins, 53, was released on parole in November under strict rules. He moved to a community facility and wore a tether tracking his movement. He was barred from living with anyone 17 or younger, being near playgrounds, using the Internet or going to a topless bar.
 On Dec. 30, Ms. Cooper's appeal led a judge to send Mr. Hankins back to prison; a hearing on his case is scheduled for Wednesday. 
 ''He wasn't causing any problem,'' said Michael J. McCarthy, Mr. Hankins's lawyer. ''He was trying to find a job.''

HEADLINE: The Newest Hybrid Model

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
INDIANTOWN, Fla. -- In former swamplands teeming with otters and wild hogs, one of the nation's biggest utilities is running an experiment in the future of renewable power.
 Across 500 acres north of West Palm Beach, the FPL Group utility is assembling a life-size Erector Set of 190,000 shimmering mirrors and thousands of steel pylons that stretch as far as the eye can see. When it is completed by the end of the year, this vast project will be the world's second-largest solar plant. 
 But that is not its real novelty. The solar array is being grafted onto the back of the nation's largest fossil-fuel power plant, fired by natural gas. It is an experiment in whether conventional power generation can be married with renewable power in a way that lowers costs and spares the environment.
 This project is among a handful of innovative hybrid designs meant to use the sun's power as an adjunct to coal or gas in producing electricity. While other solar projects already use small gas-fired turbines to provide backup power for cloudy days or at night, this is the first time that a conventional plant is being retrofitted with the latest solar technology on such an industrial scale. 
 The project's advantages are obvious: electricity generated from the sun will allow FPL to cut natural gas use and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It will provide extra power when it is most needed: when the summer sun is shining, Floridians are cranking up their air-conditioning and electricity demand is at its highest. 
 The plant also serves as a real-life test on how to reduce the cost of solar power, which remains much more expensive than most other forms of electrical generation. FPL Group, the parent company of Florida Power and Light, expects to cut costs by about 20 percent compared with a stand-alone solar facility, since it does not have to build a new steam turbine or new high-power transmission lines. 
 ''We'd love to tell you that solar power is as economic as fossil fuels, but the reality is that it is not,'' Lewis Hay III, FPL's chairman and chief executive, said on a recent tour of the plant. ''We have got to figure out ways to get costs down. As we saw with wind power, a lot has to do with scale.''
 For solar power, scale is still a relative term. At its peak, the solar plant will be able to generate 75 megawatts of power, enough for about 11,000 homes. But that is dwarfed by the adjacent gas plant, which can produce about 3,800 megawatts of power. (A megawatt is enough to power a Wal-Mart store.)
 Utilities are being pulled in different directions. They must ensure that the lights remain on at all times as well as provide the lowest-cost power to their customers. At the same time, they are being pressed to find ways to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewable power sources. 
 The latter is critical if the nation is to succeed in reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide. Power plants account for over a third of domestic greenhouse gas emissions that are responsible for global warming.
 ''We believe there is a cost to society associated with carbon emissions and not having energy security and not having domestic energy supplies,'' Mr. Hay said. ''But it's not a level playing field for renewable versus fossil fuels right now.''
 Mark Brownstein, an energy and grid specialist at the Environmental Defense Fund, praised FPL's innovative thinking. ''When we talk about getting to a low-carbon, clean-energy economy,'' he said, ''we know there is not going to be a single technology that is going to transform the industry.''
 Currently, 29 states require utilities to increase the amount of power produced from renewable energy, which includes solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal and biomass. Last year, Congress considered a federal mandate for 25 percent of renewable power by 2025 as part of its energy and climate legislation. (The bill has since stalled.)
 Utilities have been scrambling to meet the state requirements, and many will not be met, according to electrical utility experts. 
 While renewable power is growing, its share of the nation's electrical generation remains small. Wind power, which has surged in recent years, accounts for less than 2 percent of the nation's electrical output. Solar is even smaller. Coal, meanwhile, generates half of the nation's electrical output, followed by natural gas and nuclear energy. 
 Part of the challenge in increasing the share of renewable energy sources is to make up for their variable nature -- at night, for example, or when the wind does not blow. Because electricity cannot be stored easily, utilities must always produce enough power to meet electric demand at any given time. In practice, this means they need keep a lot of idle plants that can be fired up rapidly when demand spikes.
 About 20 percent of the generation capacity overseen by PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission operator covering 13 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, is used less than 100 hours a year, according to Lester B. Lave, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon's school of business.
 ''As long as the contribution of wind and solar is very small, utilities can handle it very well,'' Mr. Lave said. But what happens once the share of renewable power rises to 10 percent? Or 20 percent? ''No one knows what the magic number is.'' 
 Spain, which generates more than 12 percent of its electricity from wind, has struggled with wind variability, Mr. Lave said. Similar problems are also cropping up in the United States, especially in states where solar and wind power are on the rise. In 2008, for example, Texas narrowly avoided a blackout when wind power, which supplied 5 percent of demand at the time, experienced an unexpected lull, driving wind electricity generation down to 350 megawatts, from 2,000 megawatts, in less than four hours, according to Mr. Lave. 
 It is a problem the industry is beginning to focus on, and hybrid plants could provide part of the answer. By adding renewable power to existing fossil fuel plants that operate around the clock, the thinking goes, utilities could have readily available power that could be fired up instantly whenever their wind or solar resources dropped off. 
 The Electric Power Research Institute is working on two pilot programs that seek to integrate solar power with traditional coal and gas plants in New Mexico. A dozen hybrid projects similar to FPL's plant are planned around the world, said Cara Libby, the institute's project manager for renewable energy. 
 ''Intermittency is probably the challenge utilities are putting the most efforts into researching at the moment,'' Ms. Libby said. ''The biggest concern, of course, is how to keep the power on.'' 
 Instead of adding new capacity, smart grid designs and investments in transmission lines could also help balance the contribution of intermittent resources, said Tim Stephure, an analyst at Emerging Energy Research, a consulting firm. Some regional operators, such as PJM, are also encouraging their large customers to cut consumption when demand is at its peak to reduce the overall power requirements on the grid, said Mr. Brownstein of the Environmental Defense Fund.
 At FPL, part of the challenge will be to fine-tune the system so that its gas and solar components provide just as much electricity as needed at any given time -- day or night, cloudy or clear. At a cost of $476 million, the solar project, known as the Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center, will be second-biggest, after the 310-megawatt Solar Electric Generating System in the Mojave Desert in California. That system, also owned by FPL, was built in the 1980s. 
 FPL estimates it will cut its natural gas use by 1.3 billion cubic feet each year, the consumption of 18,000 American homes. It will also cut carbon emissions by 2.75 million tons over 30 years, the equivalent of taking 19,000 cars off the road. 
 The solar panels concentrate the sun's rays into a vacuum-sealed tube that contains a synthetic oil, which heats up to 748 degrees Fahrenheit. The oil is then used to produce steam that is fed into an existing turbine to produce electricity. Using small sensors, the mirrors will be able to rotate during the day to track the sun's movement. In case of a hurricane, they will flip upside down for protection.

HEADLINE: Skyrocketing Prices May Point to a Real Estate Bubble in China

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The spacious duplex comes with crocodile-skin bedposts, hand-carved bronze doors inlaid with Swarovski crystals -- and a $45 million price tag.
 It is still on the market, but Charles Tong, the developer of Tomson Riviera, a luxury riverfront complex in the heart of the financial district here, says he is having no trouble finding takers for similarly priced units.
 ''We're selling three to four apartments every month,'' said Mr. Tong, seated in a white Versace easy chair. ''Now, people here want something more luxurious; they'd like a new lifestyle.''
 Everyone agrees China is in the middle of a spectacular real estate boom. The question is whether it is in the middle of a rapidly growing real estate bubble. 
 When other recent booms collapsed -- in the United States, for instance -- they depressed entire economies. In China's case, a bursting bubble could affect much of the world. China is the fastest-growing large economy and, so far, a main engine pulling the world out of recession.
 Beijing is clearly concerned. Authorities have recently moved to rein in the easy credit that has helped finance China's hyperdevelopment, including making it more difficult for home buyers to take out a second mortgage. 
 Last year, a record $560 billion of residential property was sold in China, an increase of 80 percent from the year before, according to government statistics that are widely considered reliable. And with prices soaring, developers are scrambling to build more mansions, villas and high-rise apartments with names like Rich Gate, Park Avenue and Palais de Fortune.
 Signs of exuberance are everywhere. An investor in Shanghai recently bought 54 apartments in a single day; a villa sold for $30 million last year; and in December a consortium of developers paid more than $3.5 billion for a huge tract of land in Guangzhou, one of the highest prices paid for any property, anywhere. In the city of Tianjin, in north China, developers have created a $3 billion ''floating city,'' a series of islands built on a natural reservoir, featuring villas, shopping malls, a water amusement park and what they say will be the world's largest indoor ski resort.
 ''This is wild,'' said Andy Xie, a former Morgan Stanley economist who is now an independent analyst. ''By all the traditional measures, like rental yield, this is a bubble.'' 
 Speculators are snapping up properties on the expectation that prices will continue to rise, as prices have nearly every year for more than a decade. And powerful developers are working with local governments to transform old cities into urban dreamscapes.
 But Shanghai, China's wealthiest and most dazzling city, is the epicenter of the boom. Prices here have risen more than 150 percent since 2003, pushing the price of a typical 1,100-square-foot apartment up to $200,000, according to real estate experts. (Shanghai residents typically earn less than $5,000 a year.)
 A buying frenzy has gripped the city, leading to billion-dollar land auctions and long waiting lists.
 ''The speed you buy a house here is faster than you buy vegetables,'' said Andy Xiang, an advertising executive who recently put down a large cash down payment to get the right to pay $1.3 million for an apartment in the city's exclusive Xintiandi area.
 Few residences, though, are as upscale as Tomson Riviera, which consists of four golden-hued towers overlooking the Huangpu River, with a central garden mapped out in the shape of a dragon. The apartment complex's entrance has original artworks by Salvador Dali and well-known Chinese artists. The apartments, a few of which have been decorated by Armani and Fendi, as well as Versace, lease for $7,000 to $17,000 a month -- to high-level executives from companies like General Motors. 
 Those who buy an apartment here tend to be extremely wealthy, like Liu Yiqian, an eccentric Shanghai entrepreneur whom Forbes magazine says is worth about $540 million. 
 Mr. Liu, 47, got his start driving a taxicab in Shanghai but eventually made a fortune investing in the stock market. In an interview this week, he acknowledged owning hundreds of apartments in Shanghai (he said he could not remember exactly how many), including a 6,000-square-foot apartment in Tomson Riviera, which he bought in 2008 for about $11.5 million.
 ''I invest in properties,'' Mr. Liu said, noting that he also collects art, antiques and jade. ''I think in Shanghai in five to seven years the real estate prices will be even higher.'' 
 As they try to modulate the market, local and central governments here are walking a thin line. Land sales were a major source of government revenue, raising about $234 billion last year, an amount equal to over a third of the cost of China's half-trillion-dollar stimulus program.
 Whether the country is in the middle of a bubble has become the subject of a debate. Some economists, like Nicholas R. Lardy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, say the housing boom is being propelled by a huge urbanization push that is creating premium-priced houses.
 Other analysts say prices are being propped up by greedy developers and government policies that are making housing increasingly unaffordable for the masses migrating to big cities.
 Despite the fear of a bubble here, Mr. Tong said his prices were just right, particularly because of so much hidden wealth in China. The publicly listed company is controlled by his family. 
 ''I have a friend,'' he said. ''She makes maternity clothes. Her company has 20 percent of the world's market share, and they're not even a listed company.'' 
 Still, Tomson's prices are soaring. The most recent apartment sold for about $2,300 a square foot. The average luxury apartment in Manhattan sold for just under $1,900 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman real estate.
 Indeed, for the price of a Tomson apartment in Shanghai, a buyer could easily purchase a 6,000-square-foot home in Los Angeles built by Frank Lloyd Wright and now for sale ($10.5 million), or a 52-acre site with a 22-room residence in New Canaan, Conn. ($24 million).
 But a sales agent at Tomson Riviera says this is the future financial capital of the world, not the dying one.
 ''Look at this bronze door,'' said Wang Yaodong. ''That costs $50,000! Look at these Gaggenau appliances. They were made in Germany.'' The glasses were imported from Belgium, the Jacuzzi from Italy. And don't worry about losing your key, he said, ''This lock can read the palm of your hand.''

HEADLINE: Now It's Democrats Who Feel Sting of Scandal

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The ethical woes facing Democrats are piling up, with barely a day passing in recent weeks without headlines from Washington to New York and beyond filled with word of scandal or allegations of wrongdoing.
 The troubles of Gov. David A. Paterson of New York, followed by those of two of the state's congressmen, Charles B. Rangel and Eric J. Massa, have added to the ranks of episodes involving prominent Democrats like Eliot Spitzer, Rod R. Blagojevich and John Edwards.
 Taken together, the cases have opened the party to the same lines of criticism that Democrats, led by Representatives Nancy Pelosi, now the House speaker, and Rahm Emanuel, now White House chief of staff, used effectively against Republicans in winning control of the House and Senate four years ago. 
 The mix of power and the temptations of corruption can be a compelling political narrative at any time. But with voters appearing to be in an angry mood and many already inclined to view all things Washington with mistrust, the risks for Democrats could be that much greater this year. 
 With Election Day still eight months away, there is time to avert a history-is-repeating-itself storyline. But Democrats, who are already on the defensive over the economy, health care and federal spending and are facing a re-energized conservative movement, suddenly have a set of ethical issues to deflect as well. ''Speaker Pelosi famously promised the most open, honest and ethical Congress in history,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, said Thursday. ''Yet here we go again.''
 In 2006, when Democrats were battling for control of the House, the message of their campaign against the Republicans could be boiled down to a three-word slogan: culture of corruption. Democratic leaders aggressively seized on each indictment of a Republican member of Congress or lobbyist, building an argument that the controlling party had become arrogant and was in urgent need of a housecleaning.
 So is that moment -- in reverse fashion -- now approaching for Democrats?
 Tim Kaine, a former Virginia governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Thursday that the recent spate of allegations against several political figures in his party was troubling.
 But he said the recent cases -- largely revolving around New York politicians -- had hardly reached the nationwide pitch that buffeted Republicans four years ago. Then, Tom DeLay, the Republican House leader, was indicted in Texas, and the influence-peddling scandal tied to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff touched several Republican members of Congress.
 ''I would never say that folks should be blithe about their ethical responsibilities. But I think it's quite a bit different,'' Mr. Kaine said Thursday in an interview. ''But a couple things that happened in the same week in one state is different than the kind of corruption that roped members of Congress in from all over the country.''
 Ms. Pelosi moved quickly this week to deal with escalating criticism surrounding Mr. Rangel, who was admonished by the House ethics committee for accepting corporate-sponsored trips to the Caribbean. He remains under investigation on more serious accusations.
 Mr. Rangel stepped down on Wednesday as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, heading off any possibility of a drawn-out political battle over his fate. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been intensifying its pressure on Democratic lawmakers in districts across the country to return political contributions from Mr. Rangel, who was among the most generous contributors to fellow members of Congress.
 ''All Aboard for the Ride to Victory,'' screams a poster depicting Mr. Rangel against a train, showing how many Democratic campaigns he helped finance. Republicans have sent around the old Rangel campaign posters this week to highlight his influence. 
 Since last Friday, 29 House Democrats have given back or donated to charity more than $400,000 in contributions from Mr. Rangel's three political fund-raising committees. But several others have not returned the money. Representative Michael E. McMahon, Democrat of New York, is among those who have not returned the money, in his case more than $70,383.
 Ms. Pelosi dismissed the criticism on Thursday that Democrats had not lived up to their promise to sweep away a culture of corruption on Capitol Hill. She also noted that she had established an outside group to receive complaints about members of Congress, which could be easily referred to the House ethics committee.
 ''My commitment to the American people is that the public trust will always be honored,'' Ms. Pelosi said at her weekly news conference. ''And on the floor of the House, that happens.''
 President Obama, who built his campaign around a pledge to change the way Washington works and to strengthen transparency and ethics, has followed a practice of generally not commenting on the scandals or allegations involving the Democratic politicians. Months ago, several of his senior advisers worked behind the scenes to try to dissuade Governor Paterson from running for election, a pitch that failed.
 Last week, Mr. Paterson conceded that he would not be on the ticket in the fall, but he has declined to step down. The White House has said that it has no intention of wading into the Paterson situation again, but several advisers said they were following the developments with interest.
 It is the case of another governor, perhaps, that has drawn even more attention from those inside the West Wing.
 Mr. Blagojevich, who was impeached last year as the governor of Illinois, faces a criminal trial in June. The proceedings are expected to be unfolding at the very moment that Democrats are battling in several races, including a campaign for the Senate seat once held by the man who now sits in the Oval Office.

HEADLINE: The Heat Over Bubbling Arctic Methane

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Amid heated headlines over Arctic methane bubbles, scant evidence for scary outcomes. 

 BODY:
One of the great challenges in assessing the meaning of changes in Arctic climate and other environmental conditions is putting today's observations in long-term context. This is as true for the bubbling emissions of methane from the frozen, but warming, sea bed as for sea ice around the North Pole. Two recent studies of methane emissions from frozen sea-bed sediments, including one published in Science and described in The Times today, found substantial bubbling flows of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, were reaching the atmosphere.
[Dec. 13, 2011, 3:49 p.m. | Updated Fresh alarming headlines about larger "fountains of methane" have renewed a focus on the issue. (Note the "Methane Time Bomb" headline from the same British paper in 2008. I have queries out to a heap of methane and Arctic researchers and will post anew soon.]
In its news release, the National Science Foundation, which helped underwrite the research, described the emissions as taking place "at an alarming rate."
But are these emissions new, or simply newly observed? Does this mean that the Arctic system is coming unglued, and that a great outpouring of this heat-trapping gas is about to upend the global climate system?
Despite portentous headlines -- including one on the news release from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, saying "Arctic seabed methane stores destabilizing..." -- there is no evidence (yet) that what is happening is fundamentally new or destabilizing, at least according to some of the scientists most closely tracking levels and sources of this gas from the poles to the tropics. Here's how Ed Dlugokencky, one of the top federal scientists tracking methane trends, summarized the situation in an e-mail message: 
Are these emissions new, brought on by increasing temperature of bottom waters, or have they been there unnoticed for decades or longer? Based on our atmospheric observations, I suspect they have been there. We saw an increase in CH4 growth rate in 2007 in the Arctic (likely from very warm temperatures in wetland regions increasing microbial CH4 production), but it did not increase in 2008.
Also, the difference in annually averaged CH4 between Arctic and Antarctic latitudes is a sensitive indicator of changing CH4 emissions at high northern latitudes. The only persistent large change in this difference we've observed was from 1991 to 1992 when the economy of former Soviet Union collapsed. The difference has varied since then, but has not recovered.
Dr. Dlugokencky has told me previously that, for the moment, it appears that methane releases from warming Arctic soils and other sources constitute a potentially amplifying warming influence, in which warming releases more gases that contribute to further warming. Such a "positive feedback" adds to the logic for working to limit human-driven warming, many climate scientists say.
But Dr. Dlugokencky, like quite a few other scientists assessing Arctic warming, sees no evidence for a "tipping point" beyond which this cascades uncontrollably. That doesn't mean this is impossible, just that there's no evidence pointing to such a prospect.
Martin Heimann, who wrote an accompanying analysis in Science and is a researcher at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, sent this cautionary note:
Indeed, at this point, it is impossible to tell whether these Arctic emissions are directly caused by recent Arctic warming or whether they have been persistent over at least much of the Holocene. This can only be answered from longer time series; complemented, maybe by borehole measurements in this shelf permafrost. Therefore, these new emission estimates do not allow yet a quantification of the permafrost methane-climate feedback.
Personally, I do believe that this feedback exists, but it doubt very much that it is "catastrophic" with large emissions over relatively short time scales (20-50 years) as implied by the "tipping point" metaphor. Even under strong warming the melting of permafrost takes time and the release of greenhouse gases will be quite gradual and will manifest itself as increased leakages.
Can society grasp the basics here without having to be pummeled with messages overstating the case? Given the seductive power of the front-page thought, scientists, their institutions and grant providers can -- wittingly or unwittingly -- drive overheated media coverage that, in the end, can kick back and undercut credibility.
One thing that would help clarify Arctic trends and their causes is more monitoring of methane on the ground in and around the Arctic, Dr. Dlugokencky and other researchers say.
Euan Nisbet, a University of London scientist from a team that found methane bubbling elsewhere in the Arctic, said this in an e-mail message:
The Arctic is a good example of the need for "in situ" monitoring. Satellites use reflected sunlight, and so cannot see the Arctic in winter. In situ work is relatively cheap, but unloved. We need both in situ and satellite monitoring to assess greenhouse gases. The U.S. deserves a lot of credit for the superb work it does supporting in situ monitoring by NOAA, Scripps and AGAGE.
He added that the European Union had canceled a project monitoring methane that was particularly valuable because it could distinguish between emissions from terrestrial bogs, gas fields and the like and ocean sources.

HEADLINE: Flat Jobless Rate A Sign The Worst Of Slump Is Past

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The American economy lost fewer jobs than expected last month, bolstering hopes that the worst may finally be over in the wrenching event known as the Great Recession.
 The monthly snapshot of the job market released by the Labor Department on Friday was hardly cause for celebration: about 36,000 jobs disappeared from the economy in February, while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 9.7 percent.
 Yet compared with monthly job losses of more than 650,000 a year earlier, and against a backdrop of recent news viewed as pointing to the possibility of a slide back into recession, most economists construed the report as a sign that a tenuous recovery might be gaining momentum. 
 ''It's strikingly good,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, who has been skeptical about earlier signs of recovery. ''It's much better than it had been looking.''
 The February job losses followed a drop of 26,000 in January. Most experts now expect the economy to begin steadily gaining jobs during the spring, as employers edge toward hiring.
 But even as the report eased worries that the economy might tip back into decline, it did little to dislodge the widespread notion that the recession had given way to a tepid and tentative expansion, one unlikely to significantly cut the ranks of the jobless.
 Nearly 15 million Americans were unemployed in February, and four in 10 had been there for six months or longer. The so-called underemployment rate -- which counts people whose hours have been cut along with those working part time for lack of full-time positions -- reached 16.8 percent, up from 16.5 percent in January.
 Some labor experts say the downturn has accelerated a refashioning of the economy that has been under way for decades, eliminating jobs in less competitive industries -- particularly manufacturing, and more recently, housing construction and financial services. In this view, many of those jobs are unlikely to return regardless of growth. 
 Yet, in other industries, jobs are already returning at a much faster pace than after the last two recessions, according to research by Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute.
 ''It's almost two separate Americas,'' he said, meaning that much of the work force is already seeing the return of work opportunities, while those mired in long-term joblessness are facing the worst prospects since the Great Depression. ''They have been left behind, and their problems are not solved by recovery.'' 
 In Beaumont, Calif., nearly two years have passed since Rebecca Miranda lost her job as a hospital recruiter, losing her paycheck of about $4,000 a month for a $1,500 monthly unemployment check. 
 A single mother of a 2-year-old girl, she is barely paying her bills, while worrying that her exile from the workplace has eroded her worth. ''I've been out of work so long, I'm going to be the last kind of person they are going to hire,'' she said. 
 President Obama greeted the jobs report while touring a Virginia company that produces software aimed at helping lower energy use. There, he highlighted his administration's embrace of cleaner-burning ventures as a way to create jobs.
 ''The country that leads in clean energy and energy efficiency today, I'm absolutely convinced, is going to lead the global economy tomorrow,'' he told reporters. ''I want that country to be the United States of America.''
 On Wall Street, investors welcomed the jobs report, and stocks rose over 1.2 percent on Friday.
 Labor experts say the economy must add more than 100,000 jobs a month just to keep pace with new entrants to the work force, so even a sustained surge in hiring would leave joblessness and anxiety for years to come.
 ''We've really hit the bottom, but we haven't embarked on a robust recovery,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, chief economist at Aladdin Capital Holdings.
 Manufacturing added 1,000 jobs in February, on top of a larger increase in January, but some experts say that trend will soon wane because businesses that slashed inventories are merely rebuilding their stocks. Health care and education -- both stalwart sources of growth throughout the downturn -- added a net 32,000 jobs.
 Construction lost 64,000 net jobs in February after a modest improvement in January. 
 The monthly jobs report is the dominant economic indicator and the subject of considerable debate among professional economists seeking to divine its message. The February report came draped in special uncertainty given heavy snowstorms during the month, slowing business.
 In years past, job reports in snowy months have come in weak, then subsequently been revised upward sharply, a pattern that may hold this time.
 But the report did little to resolve contrasting views of the basic dynamics at play, with economists in roughly two camps. Some say a now-tepid economic recovery will eventually become vigorous; others envision a long slog through relatively anemic growth. Optimists point to modest expansion on the factory floor and continued increases among temporary workers (whose ranks rose by 48,000 in February) as a sign that commerce has reawakened.
 Even if manufacturing is merely growing because of a shift in inventories, they say, that is translating into paychecks that workers will spend at other businesses, generating new jobs. 
 In what some economists took as a sign that such an upward spiral had begun, raising confidence, consumer credit expanded by $5 billion in January, a 2.4 percent annualized rate, the Federal Reserve announced. That rise was led primarily by auto loans. 
 But others point to uncertainties gnawing at businesses and households as portents of subdued growth. After years of borrowing against home equity to finance buying sprees, many households are tapped out. 
 Housing prices fell in January, prompting worries of another downturn that could hit homeowners and banks -- a fear enhanced by a growing wave of foreclosures.
 Uncertainty itself is spawning uncertainty: Even healthy businesses are deferring expansion until they are sure of a recovery.
 In Adrian, Mich., Brazeway, a refrigeration tubing manufacturer, has trimmed its work force more than 30 percent in the last two years, and now has about 900 employees. 
 Even as orders and production expand, Brazeway remains cautious about hiring, bringing on mainly temporary workers. The company has added only three permanent positions. 
 ''We have people beating down our doors for jobs,'' said its chief executive, Stephanie H. Boyse. ''We're in this mind-set of adding only the absolute must-haves, and the nice-to-haves stay on the back burner.''

HEADLINE: 'If You Bring in the Cops'

 BODY:
United States and NATO troops have chased most of the Taliban out of the Afghan city of Marja. The fighting was hard. But what comes next will surely be harder -- leaving behind an honest and competent Afghan administration that can win back the loyalty of local people. 
 Without that, Marja will be another empty victory in an eight-year war that Washington has mostly won on the military battlefield and mostly lost everywhere else. 
 Marja is the first test of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's new counterinsurgency strategy based on building effective governance in newly secured areas. The challenges Washington and Kabul face there will be repeated as General McChrystal moves to reclaim other population centers that have fallen back under Taliban control. 
 The Taliban's brutality and medieval ideas have few fans. But the failure, year after year, of President Hamid Karzai and his local allies to provide security or the most basic government services has led many Afghans to decide they had no choice but to welcome back the Taliban. 
 Central to Afghanistan's local governance problem is the discredited national police force, which has earned a notorious reputation for extortion and theft. 
 That problem haunts the Marja operation. When General McChrystal's forces push on to their next target, Afghan police will be in charge of local security along with the Afghan National Army, which freshly discredited itself by looting Marja's bazaar as soon as American Marines secured it.
 Earlier this week, our colleague C.J. Chivers reported on a meeting that two Marine colonels held with Marja residents. The residents assured the Marines of local support. ''But if you bring in the cops,'' they added, ''we will fight you till death.'' 
 Eventually the Afghan National Police must take over. But that must not happen until properly trained and supervised units are available. American commanders promise that different, and presumably better, police will be brought in to walk the beat until an effective local force can be recruited and trained. But despite the millions that Washington has paid to private contractors for police training over the years, few high-quality police units exist anywhere in Afghanistan today.
 A redesigned and expanded police training program, oriented toward ensuring civilian security, not paramilitary combat against the Taliban, must be one of Washington's top priorities. The Obama administration has taken an important first step, winding up the expensive and ineffective training program that the State Department had contracted to DynCorp International and putting police training under direct Pentagon control.
 Besides honest police officers, Marja and other reclaimed cities need teachers, health workers, engineers and judges. They also need experts to direct rural development programs. The only bright spot in Marja's economy today is opium poppy cultivation. The ripening poppies must be destroyed. But the local farmers who counted on their proceeds must be compensated and given help in switching to less harmful crops.
 Afghanistan has talented engineers, agronomists and other professionals, some of whom courageously toughed it out during the Taliban years. Others have courageously chosen to return since the Taliban's overthrow. The problem is that the Karzai government has not been interested in reaching beyond its circle of political cronies. That must change. It will likely be years before Afghanistan's Army can defend its people, judging by its latest (non)performance. Better civil governance cannot wait that long. It is needed now in Marja.

HEADLINE: After Slide, Consumer Borrowing Resumes

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer borrowing broke a record stretch of declines with an increase in January, as a rise in auto loans offset continued weakness in credit card borrowing. 
 The small gain, the first in nearly a year, could be a signal that Americans are regaining confidence in the economy.
 The Federal Reserve reported on Friday that consumer borrowing rose by $4.96 billion in January, surprising economists who expected a decline of $4.5 billion. It was the first gain after a record 11 consecutive declines and the largest increase since July 2008.
 In percentage terms, the overall increase was an advance of 2.4 percent and followed a revised 2.23 percent drop in December.
 The strength in January came from a $6.6 billion increase in borrowing for auto loans and other types of nonrevolving debt. That represented a 5 percent gain and followed a 3.7 percent rise in auto loans in December.
 Credit cards and other types of revolving credit fell $1.7 billion, or 2.3 percent, though that was a far smaller decline than the 12.9 percent drop in December. Credit card borrowing has fallen for 16 consecutive months, a record, although the January decline was the smallest since July.
 A second consecutive month of increases in auto loans and the slowing of the decline in credit-card borrowing could be an indication that consumers are beginning to feel more confident about increasing their spending and taking on more debt. That development is seen as critical to providing support to the overall economy, which is still struggling to recover from the worst recession since the 1930s.
 The rise in overall credit pushed consumer borrowing to a total of $2.45 trillion, still 4.2 percent below where borrowing stood a year ago. The Fed's measure of consumer borrowing excludes home mortgages and other types of credit secured by real estate.

HEADLINE: $400 Hourly To Get Them Off the Sofa

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Lesley Mitler, a longtime recruiter for Wall Street and a former C.P.A., is a practical person, someone who describes herself as risk-averse. Why, then, did she decide that midrecession would be the right time to build a new luxury service? 
 Even more unlikely, Ms. Mitler is offering a high-end service that hopes to find a thriving market in unemployed 20-somethings. For $400 an hour, she is coaching recent college graduates in how to land their first job. Her business, Priority Candidates, has teamed up with Greenberg Educational Group, a tutoring company in New York that already specializes in SAT prep and college advising. 
 If Ms. Mitler's model works, it will be because of those young people's anxious parents, the ones who already have jobs, presumably good ones, and are tearing their nails out as their children move back in indefinitely. 
 Everyone seems to know someone whose child graduated dean's list and can't find work fetching coffee. But if you want official numbers, here they are: Employers estimated that their hiring of recent graduates declined 21.6 percent in 2009, and that it would drop another 7 percent this year. Just under 20 percent of graduating seniors looking for jobs were lucky enough to land one. ''You invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in your child's college education,'' Ms. Mitler noted. ''If, at the end of it your kid's sitting on the sofa playing video games, what was the point?''
 Wealthy New York parents' appetite for paying to provide an edge over the competition now kicks in earlier than ever, with prep services for preschool admissions a growing field. So perhaps it's inevitable that private tutoring extend into adulthood as well. 
 Those panicking parents may intuitively know what is on the line with those first jobs, even if their children insist they're perfectly busy, what with maintaining their Twitter feed and occasionally taking a glimpse at Monster.com. There is an article in the March issue of The Atlantic that outlines the various ways experts think long-term unemployment could damage young people, including mental health and future earnings. 
 The author, Don Peck, also cites Jean Twenge, an associate professor of psychology at San Diego State University, who wrote ''Generation Me,'' about the people who graduated from high school in the 2000s -- a group with high self-esteem, often regardless of accomplishment, thanks to the modern brand of ego-boosting parenting. 
 She makes the case that that generation is particularly ill-equipped for a challenging job market: ''There's an element of entitlement -- they expect people to figure things out for them.'' People like ... tutors?
 In this economy, ''only the most prepared will succeed,'' Eric Greenberg, the founder of the tutoring service, wrote in an e-mail message that outlined his new affiliation with Priority Candidates. Actually, he used that phrase twice in the letter and underlined it once. Maybe the most prepared will get the job; whether or not they'll succeed is a different question.
 IT remains to be seen just how much money can be made preying on parents' fears that their children will never earn a dime. Twenty-five parents showed up for a 90-minute presentation that Greenberg Educational group sponsored in late January, and Ms. Mitler says she has three regular clients so far, one pro bono.
 One of the paying customers is Kim Bodson, 23, a Boston College graduate, who -- she would now tell you thanks to Ms. Mitler's coaching -- is looking to shift from part-time work in music publishing to full-time work in music public relations. 
 At a session this week, they went over her resume and talked about networking contacts she needed to approach again. Ms. Bodson said she had shared a few of Ms. Mitler's tips with her boyfriend, a college student who once managed a movie theater. ''Did you sweep floors with someone?'' she asked him. ''Could that be team-building?'' She credited Ms. Mitler with interview advice -- talk about a passion of yours -- that landed her the current part-time job. 
 Private tutoring, in New York at least, has been one of the few recession-proof industries, possibly because some businesses have seen all the free-floating anxiety as a marketing opportunity. Probably the biggest risk the risk-averse Ms. Mitler will face is an onslaught of competition.

HEADLINE: In Illinois, Race Is Set For Governor

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- A full month after votes were cast in a primary, the race for governor was at last set here Friday. The campaign will pit a conservative downstate Republican lawmaker against the sitting Democratic governor, who must overcome a dire state budget gap as well as memories of the ousted Democratic governor Rod R. Blagojevich. 
 Bill Brady, a state senator, was formally declared the winner of the Republican nomination for governor on Friday, by only 193 votes. That slim margin -- in a universe of more than 767,000 votes cast in the Feb. 2 race -- had led some Republicans to fear that a costly, damaging recount battle might ensue. But after state elections officials announced their final count, Kirk Dillard, another state senator and Mr. Brady's nearest competitor, conceded defeat.
 Political experts here say Mr. Dillard, who comes from Chicago's suburbs, might have been seen as a more formidable opponent for Gov. Patrick J. Quinn, the Democratic former lieutenant governor who was elevated when Mr. Blagojevich was ousted and indicted on corruption charges last year, and who narrowly won the Democratic nomination in February. 
 Mr. Brady, who comes from downstate Bloomington and whose name is less known in the Chicago area, is seen as carrying appeal for conservatives on matters like abortion and gay rights in a state that, in years past, has tended to elect moderate Republicans as governors.
 ''This may have been the more desirable outcome for Pat Quinn,'' said Kent Redfield, a political scientist from the University of Illinois, Springfield. 
 But Republican Party leaders say voters are far more focused more on the dismal economy and the failings of the Democratic Party, which controls all offices elected statewide in Illinois and both chambers of the State Legislature, than on traditional social issues.
 ''The social issues of today are 'My neighbor lost her job,' '' said Pat Brady, the state's Republican chairman, who is not related to the nominee. ''There are no family values if you don't have a job. As I travel the state, that's all anybody cares about. Pat Quinn is going to have a big hill to climb.''
 Mr. Quinn, who built his reputation in Illinois as a consumer advocate and something of an outsider in a world of political insiders, won the primary by fewer than 8,400 votes, narrowly beating the state comptroller in a race that turned notably harsh and personal. He faces new challenges in the general election: trying to push through a tax increase to solve the state's estimated $13 billion budget deficit in an election year while also holding on to his image as a reformer even as Mr. Blagojevich's federal trial begins this summer.

HEADLINE: Vladislav Ardzinba, 64; Once Led Abkhazia

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SUKHUMI, Georgia (AP) -- Vladislav Ardzinba, who led the breakaway Georgian enclave of Abkhazia to de facto independence through a bloody war and ethnic cleansing, died on Thursday in Moscow. He was 64. 
 His doctor, Anzor Gooz, said that Mr. Ardzinba died in a clinic but did not specify the cause of death.
 Russia recognized Abkhazia after the 2008 war with Georgia over another breakaway enclave, South Ossetia. The United States and the European Union consider both territories to be integral parts of Georgia.
 Mr. Ardzinba was criticized for his autocratic policies, his poor human rights record and a determination to secure independence for Abkhazia that led to what Georgian leaders called genocide.
 In 1989, Mr. Ardzinba, a prominent scholar who specialized in ancient Middle Eastern history and mythology, became a member of the Soviet Union's first democratically elected Parliament.
 A year later he was elected chairman of Abkhazia, an autonomous enclave of ethnically diverse Soviet Georgia on the Black Sea coast.
 The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the increasingly nationalist policies of the Georgian government led to disagreements between the central government and its autonomous territories, which exploded into a civil war.
 In 1992, Mr. Ardzinba proclaimed Abkhazia's independence and actively recruited mercenaries from neighboring Chechnya. 
 By late 1993, after the Georgian Army left Abkhazia, Mr. Ardzinba's government orchestrated an ethnic cleansing campaign that resulted in the expulsion of about 250,000 ethnic Georgians, more than half of Abkhazia's population.
 In 1994, the Abkhazian parliament elected Mr. Ardzinba president, and he secured Abkhazia's de facto independence by establishing close ties with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.
 Throughout the 1990s, Abkhazia's economy, which had depended on Soviet tourism, went through a deep recession, while hostilities with Georgia continued. 
 Mr. Ardzinba was re-elected in 1999, but he kept a low profile because of his deteriorating health. He resigned in 2005 and divided his time between Moscow and Abkhazia.
 He is survived by his wife and daughter, who are also scholars of the Middle East.

HEADLINE: A Strong Finish Ends an Up Week on Wall Street

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
A better-than-expected snapshot of unemployment in the United States lifted Wall Street on Friday, reinforcing hopes that the job market -- and the broader economy -- might be gaining strength.
 Investors had been bracing for a dreary report because of speculation that snowstorms in February would exaggerate job losses by 100,000 or more. When the Labor Department's tally came in at a modest 36,000, traders turned optimistic.
 ''It reiterated that the recovery, the end of the recession, is still right around the corner,'' said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management. ''The fact that unemployment is not getting worse is great news for the market.'' 
 Another burst came near the end of the day; traders took the latest consumer credit report as a sign that Americans were gaining confidence in the economy. The Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing increased in January for the first time in a year, rising $5 billion for an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Analysts had predicted a drop of $4.5 billion in January. Compared with a year earlier, however, credit was still down 4.2 percent.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.17 percent, or 122.06 points, to 10,566.20. A surge in energy and financial stocks helped lift the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 1.4 percent, or 15.73 points, to 1,138.70. 
 The Nasdaq climbed 1.48 percent, or 34.04 points, to 2,326.35, fueled partly by Apple's announcement of a release date for its iPad tablet device. 
 Unemployment took center stage on Friday, with the jobless rate holding steady at 9.7 percent in February, the Labor Department said. Analysts had expected the rate to climb to 9.8 percent and for job losses to be as high as 68,000. Estimates had varied wildly as economists tried to account for storms in mid-February that shut down much of the East Coast.
 A rebound for the jobs market has been elusive, reviving concerns that spending by consumers and businesses will remain weak. ''Businesses still need more confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery,'' said Nigel Gault, an economist for IHS Global Insight.
 In light of that uncertainty, the question for Wall Street is whether the upward push can endure. The major indexes have recovered from their losses in January, and they are in positive territory for the year. Last week brought strong gains, with all three indexes ending the week more than 2 percent higher.
 But a recent batch of subpar data on housing and consumer confidence has stirred speculation of a double-dip recession, and light trading on Friday cast some doubt on the significance of the day's gains. Some analysts say they believe the market has lost touch with economic reality and is due for another decline, after tumbling in January amid worries over European debt.
 Mr. Dollarhide said he believed that the rally was sustainable, ''as long as we continue to get proof from the economy that there's a high probability things are indeed going to get better.'' 
 Debt woes abroad have clouded the prospects for the global recovery, fanning the recent volatility in the market. On Friday, the Greek Parliament approved a $6.5 billion deficit-cutting plan, offering some reassurance that Greece would emerge from its mountains of debt and a broader crisis in Europe would be averted. But public outcry over the cutbacks continued.
 Doubts over foreign debt have helped strengthen the dollar's appeal in recent weeks, but on Friday, it fell against the euro. Treasuries also declined, falling 21/32 to 99 17/32 while the yield rose to 3.68 percent, from 3.60 percent.

HEADLINE: How the Tea Party Is Not Like the New Left

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''The Wal-Mart Hippies'' (column, March 5):
 Superficially, David Brooks has a point about certain parallels between the New Left of 40 years ago and today's Tea Party. But the superficial resemblances disguise the deeper differences. 
 The New Left began as a just movement for civil rights, against arbitrary authority and against the abuse of national power abroad. Over the course of years, it evolved -- and in many cases devolved -- toward a mood of reckless, go-it-alone embattlement. 
 The Tea Party movement begins with atavistic delusions about the government and shows no signs of understanding, let alone addressing, the contemporary, out-of-control economy. 
 There were certainly paranoid strains in the New Left, but the Tea Party has yet to exhibit anything but misapprehensions.
 Todd Gitlin New York, March 5, 2010
 The writer is a onetime leader of the New Left and the author of ''The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.''
 To the Editor:
 I was both surprised and disappointed at David Brooks's essentially equating the New Left radicalism of the 1960s with the Tea Party movement. 
 While there are undoubtedly some extremists involved, the overwhelming majority of the Tea Partiers are ordinary American citizens very concerned about the direction of the country. Their passionate opposition relates directly to what is perceived as a huge government takeover replete with irresponsible spending and deficits along with greatly increased taxes.
 James R. Spence Jr. Williamsburg, Va., March 5, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Tactical analogies are not the fodder for apt, substantive comparisons. While the Tea Partiers may share with the 1960s a distrust of an authoritarian ruling elite, it's otherwise much too facile for David Brooks to link the two movements to anything beyond that simplistic similarity. 
 Yes, chaos and disorder may mark both, but the 1960s worldview was one of a just society: challenging institutions that perpetuated things like the growing gulf between rich and poor, health care disparities, and racism and gender inequality. 
 Today, Tea Partiers rail against efforts to take on these inequities and, instead, extol the virtues of selfishness.
 Arnold S. Cohen New York, March 5, 2010
 The writer is president and chief executive of the Partnership for the Homeless.

HEADLINE: In Paris, Daring to See the Bright Side

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
Paris
 The theme is fun. Parisians want it. Everybody wants it, of course, but the French seem to want it more. And these days they are doing a pretty good job of providing themselves with reasons to be cheerful, before and after dark. 
 In what way is this place different from other fashion cities? In New York, Fashion Week can seem like an endless loop of business transactions. And about the last time anyone had a blast during Milan's Fashion Week (now shriveled to about half that time) was during Tom Ford's salad days at Gucci. 
 In just the last 72 hours here, however, a determined partygoer might have dropped in on the following: a party staged for Gareth Pugh by the people from PonyStep, the successor to the London nightclub BoomBox, and held at Le Baron, a formerly seedy bottles-and-models boite; a private wingding for Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga at Le Montana, another nightclub whose inspiration is all things 1980s; and a genteel cocktail gathering for Peter Copping of Nina Ricci, held in the grandmotherly Salon d'Ete at the Ritz.
 Or, a temporary Fashion Week pop-up bar at the Hotel de Crillon instigated by Carine Roitfeld, the editor of French Vogue, to provide all the random beauties floating around town a proper excuse to strap on their stilettos and their gilded Balmain rags. 
 That same partygoer might have joined in the fun at the nutty party at Le Meurice hosted by Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, the Dutch designers with a marked taste for the surreal. To celebrate the fifth anniversary of their popular Viktor & Rolf perfume, Flowerbomb, the designers crammed 1,000 or so of their closest friends into the hotel ballroom for a private concert by Grace Jones. 
 By diva standards, Ms. Jones was relatively punctual. For a set scheduled to start at 10, the singer, who had spent much of the day divagating about what to wear onstage, appeared around midnight. She wore a flattop haircut, a Domino mask, a dress with sleeves resembling turbines; and she concluded a brief greatest-hits performance by serenading an oversize box of Flowerbomb with ''Happy Birthday.'' 
 It was that kind of night. 
 ''Sometimes, you look around a room and you ask yourself, 'How did I get here?' '' the Tunisian-born model and television actress Afef Jnifen Tronchetti Provera remarked as she sipped cranberry juice and awaited Ms. Jones's appearance. She meant this in the most approving way. ''It must be fate,'' she added, referring to the fact of being in that room at that particular instant. A born optimist, Ms. Tronchetti Provera likes to nudge her happy destiny along by piling jeweled cloverleafs and lucky amulets on her arms. 
 ''You hope for the best, but you never know,'' Mr. Horsting said, by which he meant the success enjoyed by Flowerbomb, consistently ranked among the world's top-selling fragrances. A bit later, Mr. Snoeren added, ''You hope, and if the stars are aligned, it works,'' his unwitting echo of Mr. Horsting's point underlining one of the themes of this Paris season: optimism. 
 Remember that?
 It is seemingly everywhere here. Reviewers saw it in Mr. Ghesquiere's graphic and technically strenuous collection. Designers and other creative sorts saw it in the fact that they have remained in business. Even retailers, like Jim Gold, the chief executive of Bergdorf Goodman, saw reason for hope. ''We all thought the financial system was going to fall down,'' he said before the Lanvin show on Friday. 
 Just two days ago, Marco Zanini, the designer of Rochas, remarked, before a charmingly goofball show inspired by the 1969 comedy ''Cactus Flower,'' that ''it's important not to take things too seriously.'' 
 ''We need to have a little fun with fashion,'' Mr. Zanini added. ''We need to be not so worried about what is good taste and what is bad taste. Why not good bad taste?''
 Why not? And why not take risks, said the hairdresser Eugene Souleiman, who has seemed to be everywhere, ratting and teasing hair to produce the disheveled Sharon Tate look that is his current signature. ''There's not quite so much to lose anymore, so you'd better enjoy yourself,'' Mr. Souleiman said as he covered the model Marlena Szoka in a sticky hairspray nimbus. 
 Translated, that could the season's slogan: Don't Worry. Be Happy. Don't Panic. Carry On. 
 ''Designers are not necessarily supposed to filter what's happening socially,'' Rick Owens noted before his show on Thursday, referring indirectly to the economy, a topic so toxic that more superstitious types consider its very mention taboo. 
 But designers, of course, are pelted with the same barrage of bad news and quasi-information we all are. Keeping the panic at bay has been no cinch, the producer Alexandre de Betak said backstage at the Dior show on Friday. ''The New York season was bad and weird and very down,'' said Mr. de Betak, who attributed some of the gloom to news of Alexander McQueen's suicide. ''Even the parties felt like a job.''
 Yet once the caravan moved on to Paris, there was a palpable lightening of mood. 
 ''Economically, we feel that we are out of trouble, and while we may not be, it feels that way,'' Mr. de Betak said. And that is why people here are letting loose and partying so hard. ''It's actually healthy,'' he added. ''It's good to let go. That used to be what parties were for.''

HEADLINE: Columbus Symphony Makes Severe Cutbacks

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
The Columbus Symphony Orchestra has taken drastic action to stay in business. It said on Friday that it had lopped off 13 weeks of its season, translating to a 23-percent pay cut for its musicians and a $1.5 million reduction of its $9 million budget next season. Its season will run for 25 weeks instead of 38. The orchestra said that its reduction, which was negotiated with the musicians, will eliminate three paid weeks of vacation for the players, five weeks of playing for BalletMet and Opera Columbus performances; and five weeks of special one-off concerts. Subscription concerts will be preserved, the orchestra said. The cuts are a particularly draconian example of the trimming going on around the orchestra world after the recession.

HEADLINE: Starless Ensemble Plays Shine, With Limits

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
For the third time this season, the Off Broadway theater Playwrights Horizons has received rave reviews for a production, ''Clybourne Park,'' and has added performances to meet audience demand. What Playwrights doesn't have are tiny casts led by movie stars, the formula that many Broadway producers consider essential for a play to make money in an era of high ticket prices and stiff competition.
 Instead, Playwrights and other nonprofit theaters in New York have been busily mounting ensemble plays with large casts or roles of equal importance and hiring respected stage actors who (unlike some Broadway peers) have never been on or in People magazine. These plays include ''Circle Mirror Transformation,'' ''This'' and ''Clybourne Park,'' at Playwrights Horizons; ''Brief Encounter,'' at St. Ann's Warehouse; ''The Brother/Sister Plays,'' at the Public Theater; and ''The Orphans' Home Cycle,'' at Signature Theater Company. 
 Most of these productions have been extended to run longer than planned, and some have increased ticket prices to make more money -- two prime measures of success. Positive feedback from critics and audiences is another enviable benchmark, but perhaps the most prized is a transfer to Broadway, where real money and prestige (in the form of Tony Awards) can be achieved for an Off Broadway theater.
 Yet despite all the good reviews, the current crop of ensemble plays has not seemed commercially profitable enough to persuade producers and their investors to finance such a move. Efforts to transfer ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' (22 actors, none stars) and ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' (5, ditto) foundered this winter. Broadway producers are now considering a two-character ensemble, ''Venus in Fur,'' that is having an extended run at the nonprofit Classic Stage Company, but a transfer depends on theater availability.
 ''As much as Broadway producers have admired our shows, there hasn't been any actor in those shows that producers felt would 'sell' the show to a Broadway audience,'' said Tim Sanford, artistic director of Playwrights Horizons. ''You hear about a celebrity fatigue setting in on Broadway, but I haven't necessarily seen it change things.''
 Brian Kulick, artistic director of Classic Stage Company, said he had noticed an unusual explosion of well-reviewed ensemble plays in New York this season -- including ''As You Like It'' and ''The Tempest,'' by the Bridge Project at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and ''Emperor Jones,'' at the Irish Repertory Theater -- yet almost none on Broadway.
 ''What stands out the most to me is that all of these plays have extraordinary companies of actors, great New York actors, and none of us are saying we have to put a TV star in the cast,'' Mr. Kulick said.
 The contrast between these Off Broadway plays and those on Broadway has never seemed sharper. Broadway producers are relying ever more on celebrity actors to help sell tickets; scripts with one or two showy roles, a boon for Tony competition; and basic sets and a handful of characters (four, usually) to help limit costs.
 Among such productions are ''A Behanding in Spokane'' (with Christopher Walken), ''After Miss Julie'' (Sienna Miller), ''Oleanna'' (Julia Stiles), ''Race'' (James Spader), ''Time Stands Still'' (Laura Linney) and ''God of Carnage'' (Lucy Liu). Still to come are ''Fences'' (Denzel Washington) and ''Red'' (Alfred Molina). 
 It is far from certain that star-free ensemble plays would turn a profit in Broadway theaters, which have more seats to fill and higher ticket prices and production costs, like salaries and rents.
 A test case will be ''Next Fall,'' the only play on Broadway this spring that will have transferred from Off Broadway (mounted by Naked Angels) with the same cast. None of the ''Next Fall'' actors are the sort of household names that the Broadway producer David Richenthal declared a necessity in an attention-getting comment in October when he chose the movie star Abigail Breslin to play Helen Keller in his new Broadway revival of ''The Miracle Worker.''
 And even laurels like the Pulitzer Prize for drama could not help the ensemble ''Ruined'' transfer from Off Broadway last year, though producers of ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' said they were hoping to win a Pulitzer for the author, Horton Foote (who died last year), partly to serve as prestige bait for investors to support another attempt to move the play to Broadway.
 James Houghton, founding artistic director of Signature Theater, which is producing ''Orphans' '' with Hartford Stage, said the challenges of transferring a show to Broadway should not overshadow the commitment of Off Broadway theaters to producing expensive or complex ensemble plays in a difficult economic climate.
 '' 'Orphans' Home Cycle' is the largest of the ensemble projects that we've done since our founding 19 years ago,'' Mr. Houghton said, ''and I'm pleased that we've been incredibly fiscally responsible in undertaking the production with Hartford Stage and capturing the imagination of grant-making foundations and individual donors.''
 Directors and theater executives said they were hardly drawn to ensemble plays as a way to save money; every additional actor at Playwrights Horizons costs $10,000 more in salary and benefits, Mr. Sanford said. Rather, prominent Off Broadway executives like Sarah Benson, the artistic director of Soho Rep, said that she believed that large casts of experienced actors led to richer collaborations and greater risk-taking.
 ''Seeing so much talent on a single stage tends to provide a powerful experience for the audience, and it's inspiring for artists too,'' said Ms. Benson, who will direct an ensemble in ''That Face'' for Manhattan Theater Club this spring. ''Casting stars does nothing to nurture this whole generation of theater actors that we have.''
 Several of the ensemble plays this season include actors who have been attached to the work for years, like Deirdre O'Connell, who participated in four workshops of ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' before playing Marty, the acting class teacher, in its production at Playwrights.
 ''The other actors and I had spent so much time together in the workshops, we were able to skip an enormous number of steps in rehearsals and really burrow into these roles,'' Ms. O'Connell said. ''Trust among actors is essential for a good ensemble, and I think our longstanding involvement in this play paid off here.''
 Perhaps the most reliably ensemble-oriented productions in New York each year, the Public Theater's Shakespeare in the Park offerings, are trying a new approach this summer: using the same company of actors to perform ''The Merchant of Venice'' and ''The Winter's Tale'' in repertory. (Al Pacino and Jesse L. Martin are among the actors, but the Public pays the same to both the famous and the unknown.) Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public, said the single acting company working in repertory might become a staple of its summertime ensembles.
 ''There's no question that I'd be delighted to keep doing it in future summers, once we see how the audience responds, and how the actors like it,'' Mr. Eustis said. ''What we're missing in New York are long-term commitments to actors from our major theaters. Working more with actors in an ensemble environment would only benefit the quality of American theater.''

HEADLINE: Senecas See Comeback Over Sale of Cigarettes

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

 BODY:
There is a relatively short list of people who like mail-order cigarettes: teenagers, adults evading sales taxes and the Seneca Nation of Indians of western New York, which dominates the national market. 
 Even the big tobacco companies oppose the practice, in part to stamp out the Senecas' competition. And with the industry's strange-bedfellow backing, a bill to block the shipment of cigarettes passed the House of Representatives last spring by a vote of 397 to 11. A Senate committee approved it unanimously last fall.
 But then the Senecas, who control a gambling and cigarette empire that brings in more than $1 billion a year, began a campaign of back-room lobbying and public political threats. That now appears to have shut down the legislation and kept the tribe in the cigarette business, a case study in the power of a well-financed special interest to thwart what had seemed to be a national consensus. 
 ''Isn't that the way things go in the American system?'' asked Richard Nephew, co-chairman of the Seneca Nation's foreign relations committee. ''It is something new for us to actively get involved in the American political process,'' he said. ''But we are trying to learn what works in America, and I guess making political contributions is something that works.''
 As recently as December, a ban on mail-order cigarettes called the PACT Act -- for Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking -- looked all but certain to become law. After the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the House measure, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, prepared the bill for passage on the floor. No senator has publicly opposed the legislation.
 But at the last minute, two or three Democratic senators told party leaders privately that they might block the bill, according to senior Senate Democratic aides. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 
 The Senecas and their lobbyists said they did not know who their Senate protectors were. Records of the tribe's campaign contributions offered few clues; the only significant donation was a $15,000 check to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
 The Senecas' apparent victory -- at least for now -- is a comeback of sorts. Five years ago, the Indian nation lost much of its business when Eliot Spitzer, then attorney general of New York, pressured private carriers like FedEx and UPS to stop delivering cigarettes in the interest of keeping them away from children. That forced the Senecas to rely on the United States Postal Service, which declined to join the ban. The tribe's sales fell to about 12 million cartons a year from a peak of about 30 million cartons in 2004, according to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. 
 Despite its professed inexperience in Washington, the Seneca Nation is well represented on K Street. Last year, the tribe spent more than $300,000 in reported fees to three lobbying firms: the powerhouse Akin Gump; Holland & Knight, where its lobbyists include Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a former senator and American Indian; and Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, which represents many Indian nations and led the Senecas' side of the cigarette fight. Sonnenschein reported that its fees from the Senecas jumped threefold to $110,000 in the fourth quarter as the battle heated up.
 The Senecas and their lobbyists won the support of other Indian nations and advocacy groups, including the National Congress of American Indians, by attacking the proposed legislation as an intrusion on Indian sovereignty. The Senecas charged that it would give states powers to police Indian land; its Congressional sponsors dispute that. 
 ''Conferring jurisdiction to the states -- that should be very troubling to every Indian tribe,'' Mr. Nephew said. 
 On Capitol Hill, the lobbyists distributed memorandums painting the legislation as a ploy by big tobacco companies to scapegoat American Indians for teenage smoking, beating back low-price competition in the process. (The tribe's online Seneca Smokeshop specializes in Indian-made and other ''economy'' brands.)
 And in hard-pressed western New York, the Senecas warned that the proposed ban could cost 1,000 jobs in the cigarette business. ''An attack on the Seneca Nation is an attack on the economy of western New York,'' J. C. Seneca, who runs a tobacco business and is co-chairman of the tribe's foreign relations committee, told The Buffalo News. With its cigarette sales and casinos, Mr. Seneca said, the Indian nation was ''a $1.1 billion economic engine'' that would use its tobacco profits for new investments and jobs.
 By mid-December, the campaign had won two important converts. Two western New York congressmen, Brian Higgins and Eric Massa, both Democrats, wrote letters to the state's two senators, Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand, also Democrats, urging them to block Senate passage. Mr. Higgins and Mr. Massa had voted for the bill in the House, but they said the Senecas' arguments about the economic impact had changed their minds.
 ''I do not believe that western New York can afford any more job losses,'' Mr. Higgins wrote to the senators. (Mr. Massa, who announced this week that he was retiring, echoed the sentiment.)
 The next month, the Senecas sent a warning in the form of an electronic billboard along an upstate New York highway. ''Don't let the PACT Act destroy western New York's economy,'' the billboard declared. ''Tell Senators Schumer and Gillibrand No.''
 The nation, which has fought off years of New York State efforts to tax its cigarettes, had already dedicated a $1 million war chest for political retaliation against any New York State official who crossed the tribe. Also in January, the Seneca Nation's foreign relations committee approved a proposal to spend $250,000 opposing Ms. Gillibrand's campaign for election this fall; it will be her first statewide race because she was appointed last year to fill the seat left open by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
 Both New York senators are sponsors of the bill, and both said through spokesmen that they had not worked behind the scenes to slow its passage. Matt Canter, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand, said she supported economic development but not at the price of enabling teenage smoking. 
 Seneca officials and their lobbyists said the tribe tried to prevent under-age sales, in some cases by requiring faxed proof of age. Critics said faxed identification was easy to fake or borrow. The Senecas noted that online wine merchants use private carriers like UPS and FedEx that allow them to require the signature of an adult, but the Seneca cigarette dealers must rely on the United States Postal Service, which does not offer that option. 
 ''It seems very discriminatory, as if they were targeting the Seneca Nation,'' Mr. Nephew of the Senecas said of the federal legislation.
 Senate Democratic leaders could still revive the measure, perhaps by attaching it to some other bill. Republicans have talked of pushing forward, possibly to make trouble for Ms. Gillibrand. But even if it did pass, Mr. Nephew said, it would ban only cigarette shipments and not cigars. ''I guess there are a lot of cigar smokers in Washington and places where powerful people hang out,'' Mr. Nephew said. ''It appears that they are protecting their own habit.''

HEADLINE: Mindful of Image, Incensed Icelanders Try to Sort Out Debt

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- After the dust began to settle last year -- after the banks failed, the currency collapsed, the stock market crashed and the government fell -- the dazed inhabitants of Iceland woke up to another unpleasant problem: They owed, it seemed, some $5.3 billion to more than 300,000 angry people in the Netherlands and Britain. 
 These were the customers of Icesave, a now notorious online retail branch of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki, which went bankrupt in October 2008 along with 85 percent of Iceland's banking system. The British and Dutch governments reimbursed their citizens, but then demanded that Iceland repay the money, the equivalent of $65,000 per household here, plus interest. 
 To put it in perspective, it is as if American taxpayers were being forced to pay $5 trillion (plus interest) to reimburse customers of the Japanese branch of a failed private American bank, said Magnus Arni Skulason, the head of InDefence, a group agitating for a better deal. 
 The question of how to pay has convulsed this tiny country of about 319,000 people, severely damaging its international reputation and paralyzing its economic recovery. It has so incensed its residents that on Saturday they are expected to reject overwhelmingly the latest Icesave repayment plan, in the first national referendum ever held here on any subject. 
 The vote raises larger questions about Iceland's place in the world, said Silja B. Omarsdottir, a political scientist at the University of Iceland. ''Are we going to be a country that takes our obligations seriously? Or are we going to say, 'No, we're going to do things our way' and be an international pariah?'' 
 In the scheme of world debt, $5.3 billion is small potatoes. But it represents more than 40 percent of Iceland's gross domestic product. The interest alone would eat up one-fourth of the country's revenues, said Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, who called finding a resolution to the Icesave dispute ''a matter of life and death for the Icelandic economy.'' 
 The referendum was prompted on Jan. 5 by the refusal of Iceland's president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, to sign into law the latest Icesave agreement, arrived at after months of bad-tempered negotiations with Britain and the Netherlands and narrowly passed by a divided and fractious Icelandic Parliament. 
 Mr. Grimsson's move was unexpected but widely popular in a place that feels bullied and ill treated. 
 The crisis spurred a series of demonstrations from usually phlegmatic Icelanders, who recited poetry and tossed yogurt pots and rocks at government buildings to protest what they deemed the greed, ineptitude and spinelessness of the governing elite. Nearly a quarter of the electorate signed an Internet petition against the Icesave deal. 
 The referendum is being closely watched abroad, where the worry is that people in other financially flailing countries might be emboldened to rise up and refuse to honor financial obligations stemming from the failures of their banks. 
 But absurdities abound. For one thing, Icesave negotiations have moved on since January, so the deal being voted on -- which would give Iceland 15 years to repay the money, at 5.5 percent interest -- is not the deal currently on the table. For another thing, many Icelanders appear to believe that they are voting not on the terms of the plan, but on whether to pay at all. 
 Not only that, Ms. Sigurdardottir said, further delays are likely to eat up any savings that might come if all the parties finally agree to a better deal. Iceland has promised to pay up to 20,887 euros per customer (more than $28,000 each), in accordance with European deposit-guarantee regulations, but negotiations are now stalled by arguments over interest rates. 
 Birgitta Jonsdottir, a member of Parliament from the fledgling people-power Civic Movement Party, said that a ''no'' vote would send a strong message to the world. 
 First, she said, ''We don't believe in the socialization of private debt.'' Second: ''It is time for Britain to treat us like a sovereign nation and not a colony.'' And third: ''They can't use the I.M.F. to blackmail us into doing what they want on Icesave.'' 
 But it seems they can. 
 The I.M.F. and a coalition of Nordic countries have delayed the second installment of a $4.85 billion bailout package for Iceland pending the outcome of the Icesave dispute. The rating agency Fitchrecently downgraded Iceland's credit rating to below investment grade, and Moody's and Standard & Poor's both warned that the political and financial turmoil expected to follow if the deal was rejected might make them follow suit. 
 Britain is also threatening to hold up Iceland's entry to the European Union. 
 A ''no'' vote ''would effectively be saying that Iceland doesn't want to be part of the international financial system,'' Lord Myners, financial services secretary to Britain's treasury, warned in January. 
 That some Icelanders seem willing to take the consequences -- to risk becoming ''the Cuba of the north,'' in the words of Mr. Skulason -- speaks to an element embedded deep in the national character. The symbol of this is Bjartur, the protagonist of Iceland's most celebrated work of fiction, ''Independent People,'' by Halldor Laxness (who is also the only person here to have won a Nobel Prize). 
 Bjartur, a sheep farmer, struggles through one disaster after another to survive in the punishing Icelandic countryside and pay off his mortgage. 
 ''He represents the Icelandic soul,'' said Ms. Omarsdottir, the political scientist. ''He'd rather have his kids starve, his wife die -- his two wives die -- and his cow die, and lose almost all of his sheep, than be beholden to anyone.'' 
 Iceland's economy is all but stalled as everyone waits for a resolution. Businesses cannot get loans. Foreign currency movement is severely restricted. Unemployment has increased to about 8 percent from less than 1 percent. The economy contracted by 7 percent last year. 
 Iceland's three McDonald's outlets closed in October, saying that they were losing money because of the collapse of Iceland's currency, the krona, and that to make a profit, they would have had to charge $6.36 for a Big Mac. 
 Many Icelanders see Saturday's vote as an expression of outrage not just against foreign interference but also against Icelandic bankers. These were the so-called Vikings who at the height of the boom ran wild around the world making complicated, house-of-cards deals and encouraging a once prudent population to buy bigger houses and fancy cars in foreign currency. 
 Iceland has foreign debts of $1.36 billion that mature at the end of 2011. No one is predicting, yet, that it could default on those loans, but delays in Icesave will not help matters. 
 ''In the worst case, in 20 years we will be like Cuba, with lots of old cars,'' Elisabet Run Sigurdardottir, 22, a student, said in a downtown coffee shop the other day.
 She was joking, mostly. ''Only our old cars will be Range Rovers.''

HEADLINE: Trading Away Productivity

BYLINE: By ALAN TONELSON and KEVIN L. KEARNS. 
Alan Tonelson, a fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, is the author of ''The Race to the Bottom.'' Kevin L. Kearns is the president of the council, which is an association of small manufacturers.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
FOR a quarter-century, American economic policy has assumed that the keys to durable national prosperity are deregulation, free trade and a swift transition to a post-industrial, services-dominated future.
Such policies, advocates say, drive innovation, which leads to enormous labor productivity and wage gains -- more than enough, supposedly, to make up for the labor disruptions that accompany free trade and de-industrialization. 
 In reality, though, wage gains for the average worker have lagged behind productivity since the early 1980s, a situation that free-traders usually attribute to workers failing to retrain themselves after seeing their jobs outsourced. 
 But what if wages lag because productivity itself is being grossly overstated, especially in the nation's manufacturing sector? Then, suddenly, a cornerstone of American economic policy would begin to crumble.
 Productivity measures how many worker hours are needed for a given unit of output during a given time period; when hours fall relative to output, labor productivity increases. In 2009, the data show, Americans needed 40 percent fewer hours to produce the same unit of output as in 1980.
 But there's a problem: labor productivity figures, which are calculated by the Labor Department, count only worker hours in America, even though American-owned factories and labs have been steadily transplanted overseas, and foreign workers have contributed significantly to the final products counted in productivity measures. 
 The result is an apparent drop in the number of worker hours required to produce goods -- and thus increased productivity. But actually, the total number of worker hours does not necessarily change. 
 This oversight is no secret: as Labor Department officials acknowledged at a 2004 conference, their statistical methods deem any reduction in the work that goes into creating a specific unit of output, whatever the cause, to be a productivity gain. 
 This continuing mismeasurement leads economists and all those who rely on them to assume that recorded productivity gains always signify greater efficiency, rather than simple offshoring-generated cost cuts -- leaving the rest of us scratching our heads over stagnating wages.
 Of course, just because productivity is mismeasured doesn't mean that genuine innovations can't improve living standards. It does mean, however, that Americans are flying blind when it comes to their economy's strengths and weaknesses, and consequently drawing the wrong policy lessons. 
 Above all, if offshoring has been driving much of our supposed productivity gains, then the case for complete free trade begins to erode. If often such policies simply increase corporate profits at the expense of American workers, with no gains in true productivity, then they don't necessarily strengthen the national economy. 
 In this regard, the case for free trade as a stimulus for innovation weakens, too. Because productivity gains in part reflect job offshoring, not just the benefits of technology or better business practices, then the American economy has been much less innovative than widely assumed. 
 How can we actually increase innovation and real productivity? Manufacturing, long slighted by free-market extremists, needs to be promoted, not pushed offshore, since it has historically accounted for the bulk of research and development spending and employs the bulk of American science and technology workers -- who in turn spur further innovation and real productivity. 
 Promoting manufacturing will require major changes in tax and trade policies that currently foster offshoring, including implementing provisions to punish currency manipulation by countries like China and help American producers harmed by discriminatory foreign value-added tax systems. It also means revitalizing government and corporate research and development, which has languished since its heyday in the 1960s. 
 Much of government policy and business strategy rides on false assumptions about innovation, and although the Obama administration acknowledges the problem, it has done nothing to correct it. With the economy still in need of government life support and the future of American manufacturing in doubt, relying on faulty productivity data is a formula for disaster.

TRENTON (AP) -- Bus and rail commuters may soon be digging deeper to ride New Jersey Transit.
 James Weinstein, the transit agency's executive director, said Friday that he would seek approval from New Jersey Transit's board to increase fares by 25 percent systemwide and trim service, based on recent ridership declines. 
 The proposed changes are part of the agency's latest plan to offset a $300 million budget shortfall. The agency's state subsidy was also cut by 11 percent, a drop of about $33 million. Ridership is down 4 percent from last year.
 The plan calls for most of the changes to take effect May 1. New Jersey Transit said that the moves would generate more than $140 million in revenue. It last raised fares in 2007, by about 9 percent.
 ''We recognize that any increase is a burden for our customers, particularly during a recession,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''However, we have worked to keep local bus fares below the regional average and preserved some important discounts for seniors and people with disabilities, as well as for students and others who are among the most transit dependent.''
 New Jersey Transit plans to eliminate 32 of 725 commuter trains, with at least two trains scheduled for elimination on each of its 11 lines.
 Mr. Weinstein said a few lines, primarily those with the most frequent service, would have a handful of trains cut. Five weekday trains would be cut from the Northeast Corridor line. Seven weekday trains would be cut from the Morris and Essex lines to Hoboken -- partly because ridership has declined faster than ridership to New York.
 Bus and light rail customers would also be affected by service reductions.
 Mr. Weinstein said that service would also be cut on about 50 bus routes. Three routes operated by New Jersey Transit would be discontinued, as would several local ones operated by private carriers. The Wheels minibus service would be discontinued in all 21 counties.
 Light rail service frequency would also be reduced.
 The Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a passenger-advocacy group, criticized the agency's plan, saying it would have ''a devastating effect'' on riders. The group also criticized Gov. Christopher J. Christie for cutting the agency's subsidy and what it called ''underfunding'' mass transit.
 The plan ''will force people to pay more for less service and mean longer commutes and more crowded buses and trains,'' said Zoe Baldwin, the organization's New Jersey advocate. It is dedicated to reducing car dependency in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 New Jersey Transit plans to hold public hearings on the plan across the state this month.
 ''I look forward to hearing the feedback personally from our customers,'' Mr. Weinstein said.

HEADLINE: After Jerky Swings, the Economy Begins to Look Nice and Boring

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
A DEEP recession and the credit crisis led to extraordinary falls in the American economy and perhaps even greater disruptions in financial markets.
 Now, both economic and market indicators have returned to what Warren G. Harding called ''normalcy'' when he was elected president in 1920, after the end of World War I and a subsequent recession. 
 A lot of worry about the economy remains, and some economists are forecasting a double-dip recession, as occurred in the early 1980s, or a very slow recovery, as happened after the 1990-91 and 2001 recessions.
 But as the accompanying charts show, three disparate indicators -- covering unemployment, corporate financial distress and stock market volatility -- have gone from very high to a little below historical averages.
 Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman Sachs strategist, told a conference sponsored by George Washington University this week that lessened market volatility was one of the reassuring signs she saw.
 She was referring to the VIX index, which uses index options prices to show how much volatility traders expect. Another way to measure volatility is to look at the range of share prices. The chart here shows the differences between the highs and lows of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during three-month periods.
 There have been some sharp movements on a few days, but the high from December through February was just 10 percent higher than the low, the smallest range since the summer of 2007.
 Similarly, Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, said that only 42,900 firings were announced in February, the lowest for any month since 2006. The chart shows three-month totals, which are down almost three-quarters from the highest levels last year.
 The data ''offers more support to the notion that U.S. employers have stopped aggressively firing workers,'' said Michael Shaoul, the chief executive of Oscar Gruss & Son, a brokerage and money management firm. ''It really is just a matter of time before employers elect to address the fact that their depleted work forces are insufficient to deal with robust and growing order books.''
 Those order books are growing nearly everywhere, with the exception of a few troubled countries like Greece, according to surveys of companies released this week by Markit.
 The February jobs report from the Labor Department was surprisingly good, particularly considering that blizzards in the East almost certainly depressed the numbers. Manufacturing employment rose in both January and February, the first back-to-back increases since 2006.
 After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, companies slashed spending wherever they could, firing workers, canceling orders and reducing or eliminating dividends. Now, they are starting to rebuild those inventories and the trend in dividend changes is turning positive.
 In February, according to S.& P., 135 companies raised dividends, the largest total in nearly two years. Just 11 percent of the announced changes were negative -- eliminations or reductions of payouts. Last March, during the height of the panic, the figure was 82 percent, the highest recorded by S.& P. since it began tallying the figures in 1955.
 Some of those increases reflect the fact that companies overreacted when they feared a cutoff of credit and a new depression. But those very overreactions may have set the stage for a recovery that will turn out to be stronger and faster than those after the two previous downturns. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Return to Normalcy?: After moving to extraordinarily high levels during the recession and credit crisis, many economic and financial indicators have now returned to less exceptional levels, a sign that what President Warren G. Harding called ''normalcy'' is here. The charts, from the top, show the number of job cuts announced by companies, the proportion of corporate dividend changes that reflected bad news for shareholders, and the volatility of stock prices.

HEADLINE: Haitians in U.S. Double Up to Take In Their Own

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
Carmelle Lajoie shared her house in Queens with her husband, their four children, her brother and her mother. That was before she took in her 11-year-old niece, an American citizen who was airlifted from Haiti after the earthquake in January.
 Now she is urging her siblings there to send their other young children -- five of them -- if and when they get visas.
 A few blocks south, Olivia Benoit, a medical technician who recently lost her job, has taken in her pregnant niece -- who narrowly escaped from a collapsing building in Port-au-Prince -- and two grandnephews. The boys are captivated by snow. But they keep thinking that the stairs are shaking, that the earth will heave again.
 Even the women's church, SS. Joachim & Anne, has a resident refugee: a priest who was marooned in Queens, where he was visiting siblings, after the earthquake flattened his apartment. He moved into the rectory in Queens Village, where he earns his keep, in a sense, holding Creole memorial services for the earthquake dead. 
 From the outside, the neat middle-class houses of southeast Queens look the same as ever. But inside, dozens of households are vibrating with relief, worry and claustrophobia as Haitians take refuge with relatives in the United States. These scenes are being repeated from the most familiar Haitian destinations, like Miami, to cities like Chicago, St. Louis and Boston, where one family welcomed 12 Haitian relatives. 
 These families are alive, and their reunions are joyous. But they show up without plans, with few possessions and fewer winter coats. Many lack permission to work. 
 ''This earthquake, in less than one minute, it just shakes down our whole life,'' said Madeline Erlusse, Ms. Benoit's niece. Ms. Erlusse's visa expires in July, a month before her baby is due. 
 Those who make it here are the privileged ones: They had families established here. They had visas or passports or green cards. If they were not American citizens entitled to airlifts, they had enough cash to get to the Dominican Republic and onto a plane. Still, they bear the marks of trauma -- a hopeless shrug when asked about the future, a forced cheeriness. 
 For every Haitian who arrives, there are many more desperate to come. A recent poll found that 59 percent of Haitian-Americans lost a loved one in the earthquake, which killed an estimated quarter-million people. Nearly every Haitian-American seems to have relatives who are homeless, jobless or simply afraid. 
 No one knows how many refugees are living with relatives, but a few numbers hint at the magnitude: By the end of February, 6,942 noncitizens had arrived in the United States from Haiti since the quake on Jan. 12, 1,300 of them on tourist visas, according to the Department of Homeland Security. New York City public schools have taken in 219 Haitian students, and parochial schools have taken in dozens more. 
 In Haiti recently, Yolaine Milfort, a community liaison at the Haitian Consulate in New York, said she saw a tour company loading 200 Haitians a day onto buses to the Dominican Republic; most riders were bound for Miami or New York.
 ''It's an exodus,'' she said.
 More will come as Haitian banks reopen and families get access to cash. One Queens community group, Haitian-Americans United for Progress, helps to process up to 40 visa petitions daily.
 ''There's going to be some stress on the welcoming families,'' said Jocelyn McCalla, an adviser to Haiti's special envoy to the United Nations, adding that it raises the question of ''how long the welcome is going to last.'' 
 Particular strains have emerged for some families in which only the children are American citizens. Relatives were granted visas to accompany them, but not to work, so they have no means of support. The Department of Homeland Security said it was reviewing requests to extend or modify visas case by case, ''consistent with the humanitarian response taken since the earthquake.''
 The earthquake has overlaid new stress onto lives already complicated by the financial and emotional strains of immigrant life. Children who speak only Creole and French are struggling in school. Some, raised in Haiti by relatives, have joined working parents here. Now, parents are scrambling for child care, and children are adjusting to mothers or fathers they barely know.
 One child's wails echoed one recent afternoon through Sacred Heart Roman Catholic School, in Cambria Heights, Queens. The child, 4, raised by her grandparents in Haiti, had come to stay with her mother, who dropped her at prekindergarten and went to work. The child seemed comfortable in the school, not unlike her Catholic school back home. But when her mother came to pick her up, the girl bawled in terror.
 ''She doesn't know Mommy,'' said the principal, Yvonne Smith. ''Mommy,'' she added, ''was heartbroken.''
 A Haitian-American teacher, Danael Couloute, said 12 of her relatives were staying with a cousin in Boston. Her uncle has moved his wife and two children from Haiti to his mother's house in Hollis, Queens. 
 Jacques and Alice Ambroise had a precarious balance before the earthquake: She lived in Cambria Heights, working at a nursing home; he and their sons, Clifford, 7, and Emanuel, 9, lived in Haiti, where he taught school. Now, they cram into her small apartment. With her shifts cut because of the recession, she is not sure how to feed them. Mr. Ambroise could barely talk about the earthquake, which crumbled his school before his eyes, killing many students. 
 ''I would like to work,'' he said. But he speaks little English and has no green card. He has been waiting for years. 
 New in school that day, along with the Ambroise boys, were Ann-Esther and Edel Anderson Delva, 10-year-old twins now living with their aunt, Marie Armand. They were born in the United States. Their mother, Carmite Bretous Delva, has a green card. But their father, without papers, had to stay behind. 
 At Mrs. Armand's house in Rosedale, Queens, the other day, Mrs. Delva was reminiscing about Sunday dinners ''en famille'' -- fish with red beans and rice -- when her cellphone buzzed. It was her husband, texting, ''Everything OK.'' 
 Ann-Esther typed back, ''I love you. Come, I begging you.'' 
 In neighboring Laurelton, at Ms. Benoit's house, Ms. Erlusse's son, Max Oliver, 6, danced hyperactively, throwing himself to the tile floor to show how the quake had knocked him down. He said he did not like New York much because of the cold -- and the static cling. 
 Before they arrived, Ms. Benoit had been struggling to support her sister and brother-in-law, recent immigrants. Two more relatives, including Max's father, arrived on Friday. Ms. Benoit has canceled her cellphone to save money. Neighbors donate food and clothing. Her parish school, SS. Joachim & Anne, took the boys at reduced tuition. 
 Ms. Erlusse hopes schools in Haiti will open by September. ''But,'' she said, ''I know that it's just me dreaming.''
 The Lajoie house is full of contrasting moods. Mrs. Lajoie, 53, a registered nurse, obsesses about the earthquake; her niece Laetitia Leonidas tires of describing it to curious new classmates at SS. Joachim & Anne. Playing ''Assassin's Creed II'' with her cousins, Laetitia speaks in bright, short sentences: Does she want to go home? ''I think I'll stay here.'' Will Haiti recover? ''Maybe.'' 
 Mrs. Lajoie and her husband, who was a doctor in Haiti but works as a nurse here, told relatives in Haiti not to worry about money: Send the children and they would take care of the rest. That means Catholic schooland college. Mrs. Lajoie is determined to treat them the same as her children.
 She expects something in return, and she has a new threat to enforce it. ''If you aren't first in your class,'' she tells Laetitia, ''I'm going to send you to Haiti.''

HEADLINE: Learning How to Hedge Yourself, And Not Just Your Portfolio

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
HOW much are your working years worth? Or put another way, what is the impact of joblessness on your financial future?
 With nearly 10 percent of Americans unemployed and investment portfolios still down from their peak, the value of work has been given new importance. 
 Economists have long debated the difference between human capital (your future earnings) and financial capital (your investments). But there has often been too little emphasis on human capital until it is too late. 
 ''If the stock market goes down, would your income increase, decrease or not change?'' asked Michael Gordon, first vice president for agency-life operations at New York Life Insurance. ''If you're doing bankruptcy consulting, it might increase. If you're a stockbroker, it might decrease. If you're a tenured professor, it might not change.''
 This is the difference between financial capital, which would be affected regardless of your job, and human capital, which is linked to the health of your company and to the health of the industry it's in. And while this discussion used to be an academic exercise, it is now a practical reality for many people. 
 A year after the stock market hit bottom, plenty of people are out of work and spending their retirement savings much sooner than they had planned. This was surely not part of any of their asset allocation strategies.
 Most people used to look at human capital only to imagine what would happen if they died or could no longer work. But now there is another way: what effect will losing your job have on your future financial well-being? Let's look at both of them. 
 IF YOU DIE Typically, people buy life insurance when they have something to protect. They get married, for example, or they have children. But they often buy it arbitrarily -- $1 million sounds like a lot to some people, but if they earn $150,000 a year, that is less than seven years of income. Now imagine if they died at 35 with two children. Their family would lose out on 30 years of earnings. 
 New York Life and Ibbotson Associates, an investment advisory firm, have developed a program to help people calculate the replacement cost of lost earnings. The intent is obviously to determine if someone should buy life insurance. But the process is more illustrative than that. The questions force the respondent to detail all the people and expenses he is responsible for and what he would leave uncovered without enough insurance. 
 In addition, the model calculates the volatility of a person's earnings over his remaining work years. A tenured professor's income would be far more stable than a stockbroker's. If both were 30 and made $120,000 a year, the professor's human capital would be valued at $2,270,000, while the stockbroker's would be $2,110,000. They would rarely make the same amount, of course, but the professor's replacement income is higher because of the stability of his job.
 ''Once I found out how much human capital you have, I have to find a way to hedge it,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''We wanted to find a way to answer that consistently.''
 Put another way, the longer you work, the less the amount of earnings you have to insure. ''As I age and work my way through my career, there's less human capital to replace,'' said Stephen Horan, head of private wealth at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals. ''I would have converted much of it to financial capital.''
 IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB The notion of human capital has become more immediate in light of the high unemployment rate. The loss of your job is often not up to you. But you do have control over not allowing your job and investments to be correlated.
 ''People have learned in the last few years that their human capital is much more sensitive to the financial markets than they thought,'' said Moshe Milevsky, a professor of business at York University in Toronto and the author of the book, ''Are You a Stock or a Bond?'' (FT Press, 2008). 
 The key is to make sure your human and financial capital are not correlated. Mr. Milevsky said he viewed himself as a bond, because as a tenured professor his salary did not fluctuate. So he can take on more risk in his investment portfolio. 
 But he pointed to a midlevel employee at Lehman Brothers as a stark example of a person who would have been a true stock: her earnings were tied to the company, which went bankrupt, and her investments were probably also tied up in Lehman Brothers stock. 
 This, obviously, is what you want to avoid: the perfect correlation between human and financial capital.
 HUMAN CAPITAL IN PRACTICE Unlike financial capital, human capital cannot be monetized. You can sell all of your stocks and sit on the beach, but you cannot cash in the next 10 years of earnings. And that is why it needs to be well managed. 
 ''Everyone has to make the assessment of how marketable their skill set is or how transferable,'' Mr. Horan said. ''My human capital is squarely tied to the financial industry. Other folks can span different industries, like a human resource person.'' 
 This assessment is crucial to calculating your financial capital. Consider these two situations. A real estate developer would have his human capital linked to what he is building but also to the interest rates on the loans for those properties. Fluctuations in either one could affect his earnings. Excluding additional real estate and credit market risk from the developer's portfolio would be smart, but Mr. Horan said the developer might want to go further and short an exchange-traded fund focused on real estate, betting, in other words, that its value would decline. ''This would hedge the exposure that exists in your labor,'' he said. 
 In the second example, Mr. Horan said a high-earning investment banker should have a conservative investment portfolio. ''The value of his labor is going up and down very closely with fluctuations in the market,'' he said. ''And one of the reasons investment bankers get paid a lot is there is a lot of inherent risk -- it's feast or famine, and you're at an organization's beck and call.'' 
 WHERE'S THE RISK? Proponents of counting human capital in any asset allocation like to differentiate it from discussions about risk. In fact, Mr. Milevsky goes so far as to say there is too much emphasis on a person's risk tolerance. 
 ''Before I have had my espresso in the morning, I'm more risk-adverse,'' he said. ''When I turn on CNBC and see the markets are up, I'm more risk-tolerant.'' 
 But his point is a serious one. If you are young and have many working years ahead of you, your human capital is high, and you can take more financial risk. Just how much depends on the person. Are you comfortable taking that risk? 
 That is where the discussion of human capital is supposed to be less emotional. ''Even very risky human capital is more bondlike than stocklike,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''The question is really, are you more like a junk bond or a Treasury?'' Determining that could help you avoid the double whammy of losing both human and financial capital.

HEADLINE: Ambassador of Hope

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
MORAINE, Ohio -- Few places are more emblematic of the rise of American manufacturing, and its gradual decline, than this once-bustling industrial suburb of Dayton -- within sight of the hill from which the Wright Brothers first tried to fly their innovative contraption, even before Kitty Hawk.
 That was a century ago, and in time big stretches of the city were covered in factories. During World War I, more than 3,400 warplanes came off an assembly line in Moraine. The earliest electric refrigerators were mass-produced here, then cars and S.U.V.'s, and then suddenly very little. 
 In the weeks between Barack Obama's election and his inauguration, General Motors closed the last big factory in Moraine, a four-million-square-foot plant that churned out S.U.V.'s. The 4,200 men and women who had worked there before the recession -- representing nearly 2 percent of the work force in Moraine and the surrounding communities -- lost their jobs and their wages, which were north of $20 an hour. 
 The president never sought to reopen the factory, even after the federal government became controlling shareholder in G.M. during the auto bailout. What he has done instead is try to ease some of the pain by sending an ambassador as a salve for the community's wounds.
 The ambassador, Edward B. Montgomery, executive director of the White House Council on Automotive Communities and Workers, has made 23 trips so far to troubled cities like Moraine. In lightning forays, he flies out of Washington in the morning, offers hope and aid, and returns to the capital in the evening. He concedes that he is not bringing jobs, but acting as a facilitator to help pummeled communities gain access to various government funds.
 ''The people are focused on how they can use their assets; they are not trying to capture G.M. coming back, but to go forward and build a new base,'' Mr. Montgomery said in an interview after visiting Moraine last week. 
 During that visit, he told a gathering of local and state officials, ''there may be some nontraditional, untapped sources of federal funds that we can help you tap.'' He travels with an entourage of a dozen top officers from federal agencies, each with money to offer and an explanation of how to tap the funds.
 ''We are a means of coordinating across the agencies,'' Mr. Montgomery explained, ''and improving access to funding.''
 On his travels he has helped to channel millions of dollars from the stimulus package and other government pools. He does not know, he says, just how many millions. At many of the stops, particularly in Ohio, which went for George W. Bush in 2004 and just barely for Obama in the last presidential election, there is an implicit political message in this largess. It goes something like this: Stick with the president and the Democratic Party, and while we cannot bring back mass production with its large-scale employment, we can help you in the transition to other sources of income and jobs.
 ''What they are doing is all well and good,'' said Daniel Luria, research director of the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center. ''But if you are one of the people in distress, what you really want is a national manufacturing strategy that insures that the share of what is made here does not continue to fall.'' 
 Mr. Montgomery describes that thinking as unwarranted interference in the private sector, and counterproductive. ''The question of whether you should order private companies to locate in these communities; that is not a prescription for success,'' he said.
 His approach has produced results that are hard to measure. He has visited Flint, Mich., for example, three times in the last year, and the unemployment rate remains above 25 percent. On the other hand, several hundred additional people are enrolled in job training as a result of stimulus money that Mr. Montgomery steered to Flint, according to the mayor, Dayne Walling. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving more quickly than it otherwise would have, the mayor said, to clear former factory sites for other commercial use.
 ''That was a thicket that Montgomery's people helped us to navigate,'' the mayor said. 
 Mr. Montgomery, 54, a labor economist by training who served as a deputy labor secretary in the Clinton administration, describes Moraine as a particularly good candidate for help because, in response to the G.M. plant closing, the city quickly put together an economic development plan that laid out, in advance of his visit, a transition away from autos. 
 The new target companies are not easy to lure, however. They are frequently sought by other communities in similar straits, including next-door Dayton, which lost NCR's big headquarters last June. Renewable energy (companies that assemble wind turbines or solar panels) is high on the list of preferred industries. So is aerospace. Companies engaged in developing technology for health care would be good. The goal is to house new arrivals in Moraine's vast, empty factories. 
 ''If we are fortunate enough that private investors purchase the factories, we would work with the new owners to parcel out their use,'' said Michael W. Davis, the city's director of economic development.
 Mr. Davis said that the 360-acre G.M. site, which includes the old S.U.V. plant and what's left of an adjoining Delphi auto parts factory, is now drawing offers of $14 million or less, although the property is appraised by the city at $69 million. As for those who would actually occupy the space, leasing or purchasing parcels from new owners, ''we have two nibbles so far,'' Mr. Davis said. One group would ''carve out'' 10 acres for a truck terminal and the other eight acres for a marketing firm.
 ''We have to demonstrate that this is a region worth investing in, and we have to do that soon,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We have taken a 30 percent hit to Moraine's tax revenues just in the last year.''
 The trauma is evident driving through Moraine, a city of 7,000 with a daytime population of 20,000 in its heyday, when the G.M. plant was drawing thousands of workers from surrounding communities. That daytime population is fewer than 13,000 today, and the unemployment rate in the county has risen to 12 percent, from less than 7 percent in 2007.
 The bungalow-style homes are often in disrepair and few are freshly painted. Streets and sidewalks downtown are nearly empty, even in midday. And many of the retail stores in the stately buildings around the town square are vacant, their darkened display windows like windows in mausoleums.
 ''The G.M. factory did not close all at once,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It went from three shifts to two shifts to one shift to none.''

HEADLINE: Private Equity Firm Acquires Broadband Provider

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The broadband service provider RCN said on Friday that it had agreed to be bought by the private equity firm Abry Partners for about $1.2 billion, including debt. 
 The offer of $15 a share in cash is 22 percent more than RCN's closing price on Thursday.
 The deal, expected to be completed in the second half of 2010, includes an option that allows RCN to scout for better offers. The investment firm will assume the company's debt, which was about $730 million as of Sept. 30. 
 The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals by private equity firms. Earlier this year, TPG acquired IMS Health for $4 billion and a consortium of private equity firms bought the software maker SkillSoft for $1.2 billion.
 RCN provides high-speed Internet and voice services to residential and small businesses and competes with companies like AboveNet and Mediacom Communications. It posted a narrower-than-expected loss for the third quarter.
 Abry Partners, which manages about $2.75 billion in cash, is a Boston-based private equity firm specializing in media and information technology companies. RCN provides high-speed Internet and voice services to residential and small business.
 Deutsche Bank Securities and Waller Capital Partners acted as financial advisers to RCN for the deal, while SunTrust Robinson Humphrey acted as financial adviser to Abry.

HEADLINE: China Premier Details Economic Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao crafted a portrait of a China on a steady course toward greatness on Friday, telling his nation's unelected legislature that the government could expand social spending, increase lending, pour money into strategic industries and still meet its traditional 8 percent economic growth target in 2010.
 But he also sounded a cautionary note, warning that the nation faced structural economic and social problems, and that China still confronts ''a very complex situation'' in the wake of last year's global financial collapse. 
 Delivering his annual work report to China's unelected legislature, the National People's Congress, Mr. Wen said that ''destabilizing factors and uncertainties'' in the world economy posed a challenge to China's continued growth. But he affirmed that China's plan to slowly wind down last year's large economic stimulus program, which spared China the worst of the recession, would continue unchanged.
 Economic and political analysts had anticipated little new in Mr. Wen's annual address, given that he and president Hu Jintao will leave power in 2012, and China's opaque politics allow little room for fresh initiatives. 
 ''There's no surprise here,'' Tao Wang, an economist for UBS Securities in Beijing, said in an interview after Mr. Wen's address. ''This has been the working assumption for a long time.''
 Mr. Wen's 35-page speech, the rough equivalent of an American State of the Union address, was a litany of statistics aimed at underscoring the government's successful policies, swathed in boilerplate assertions of arduous struggle and glorious achievement. 
 Like many political documents, the report presents a rosy picture of China's achievements and ambitions, occasionally at odds with conventional wisdom. Mr. Wen pledged, for example, that the government would ''give high priority to protecting the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities and the ecosystems in ethnic minority areas,'' one of many passages dedicated to the need to unite China's 56 ethnic groups under one national banner.
 But government policies toward ethnic Muslims in western Xinjiang region are widely credited with contributing to riots there last year, and the government is currently razing the region's greatest cultural treasure -- the thousand-year-old Silk Road center of Kashgar -- to erect apartment blocks.
 That said, few would contest Mr. Wen's boasts of China's economic achievements. While the rest of the world struggled, China managed an 8.7 percent rise in its gross domestic product last year, capped by 10.7 percent growth in 2009's last quarter. Many economists, including Ms. Wang, predict that China will easily beat its goal of 8 percent growth this year. 
 The impressive numbers. Mr. Wen stated, are testament to the advantages of a government that need not consult with political factions or voters to take sweeping action.
 ''At the same time as we keep our reforms oriented toward a market economy, let market forces play their basic role in allocating resources and stimulate the market's vitality,'' he said, ''we must make best use of the socialist system's advantages, which enable us to make decisions ef 3/5filig 4/5ciently, organize effectively and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings.''
 But Mr. Wen's address also warned of problems in China's booming economy that some experts say could hamstring future growth if they are not quickly addressed. 
 He pledged to clamp down on speculative real-estate purchases that some analysts say are created a bubble in China's housing market, and said the state would take measures to rein in an explosive rise in urban land prices. 
 Speculation is both an economic bane and a political one: soaring land prices in urban areas have made homes unaffordable for many in China's emerging middle class, and low-income residents in big cities have been hit with waves of evictions by both private and government speculators that have bought up their properties.
 Mr. Wen also warned that some Chinese industries, fed a diet of easy money and loose regulation, had developed serious overcapacity problems. 
 And even as he committed to boost the nation's money supply by 17 percent in 2010, increasing lending by $1.1 trillion, Mr. Wen warned that ''latent risks in the banking and public finance sectors are increasing.'' Some more skeptical economists have argued that China's flood of lending during the recession will create a mountain of bad debt that will hamstring future growth. 
 Mr. Wen said the government will run a $154 billion budget deficit in 2010, in line with economists' expectations. As a share of gross domestic product, the projected deficit is unchanged from last year. 
 Over all, spending will rise about 11.4 percent this year, half the increase during last year's recession.
 Beyond economics, Mr. Wen's speech laid out a familiar blueprint for raising China from a developing nation into the top ranks of the developed world. Last year, he said, the government's stimulus measures helped increase auto sales by 46.2 percent, housing by 42.1 percent, as measured in square meters, and retail sales of consumer goods by 16 percent. 
 He recited a series of often-staggering numbers to highlight the country's rapid development: 800,000 aged homes were renovated in 2009; 165,000 miles of power lines were upgraded; 3,450 miles of new rail lines were laid; 2,900 miles of new freeways were opened; 35 airports were either built from scratch or renovated. 
 Mr. Wen said the government had dramatically increased spending on low-income housing, pensions, education and health care, and that the increases would continue in 2010. The government will take new steps to recruit top-level educators to China, to improve teacher training and to direct talented teachers to impoverished rural areas, he said. 
 Mr. Wen also said that China would pour money into strategic industries, boosting research and development and infrastructure spending to ''capture the economic, scientific and technological high ground.'' Among the areas he singled out were biomedicine, energy conservation, information technology and high-end manufacturing. 
 In a bow to China's status as the world's single largest polluter, Mr. Wen also pledged to increase environmental protection measures, planting nearly 23,000 square miles of new forests, expanding sewage treatment and clean drinking-water programs, and retrofitting coal-burning power plants with advanced machinery to cut emissions.

HEADLINE: A Plush Boudoir Welcomes the Curious

BYLINE: By JAMES KINDALL. 
Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park and Coe Hall, 1395 Planting Fields Road, Oyster Bay; (516) 922-8682; plantingfields.org. Coe Hall is open April 1 through Sept. 30; admission, $3.50 (free for children under 12); parking, $6 May through October and on weekends the rest of the year.

 BODY:
OYSTER BAY
 TO find the most imaginative garden at the Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park, one must leave the outdoor plantings to enter the castlelike interior of Coe Hall, climb its gray circular staircase and enter a room at the end of a creaking, half-timbered hallway.
 Inside is a mural depicting a nature scene suited for Alice's Wonderland. Next to a sassafras tree is a wild-looking palm, obviously wrong for the climate. Spreading its brilliant red plumage in the branches is a bird of paradise. In the background, glowing silver lakes found nowhere on Earth surround purple-hazed mountains that could be hiding a Shangri-La. 
 ''It's really quite mad,'' said Polly Wood-Holland, the artist who is recreating the sprawling wall art originally commissioned in 1921 by Mai Rogers Coe for her bedroom. ''But it's so crazy it's fun.''
 The project is part of an effort to restore the second floor of the 65-room manor built nearly a century ago by William Robertson Coe, an English-born insurance and railroad executive, and his second wife, the Standard Oil heiress. The 409-acre estate, with its exquisite gardens, rare flowers and trees, eventually became the arboretum. 
 The room, which will be opened to the public on April 1, is a strange contrast to the rest of the home's interior. Henry B. Joyce, the executive director of Planting Fields Foundation, which runs Coe Hall, gleefully calls it ''startling.''
 ''It is a fantastical landscape with a French Rococo painting influence, along with a bit of American folk art thrown in as well,'' he said. ''It has a luxurious boudoir sensibility.''
 The designer and muralist Robert Winthrop Chanler, a high-society artist known for his idiosyncratic aesthetic, created its ''illusionistic'' elements. He also painted an impressionistic buffalo hunt in the manor's breakfast room downstairs, a nod to the fact that the Coes were friends with Buffalo Bill Cody and bought his ranch in Wyoming. 
 A photo exhibit about Chanler's life and work will be held in William Robertson Coe's bedroom, across the hall from his wife's, starting on the same day her room goes on view to the public. The downstairs of the house is also open seasonally to visitors, and parts of the upstairs and the basement can be visited on guided tours. 
 Mrs. Coe did not have long to enjoy her colorful bedroom. A sickly woman, she died three years after it was finished. The third Mrs. Coe, Caroline, replaced most of the art -- originally painted on canvas -- with more conventional paneling; her son later shipped the remainder to another home the Coes owned in France that was destroyed by fire.
 All that is left of Chanler's mural are two faded color photos taken just after the rooms were completed, of only the largest walls, leaving the rest to the imagination. What is visible is bizarre enough. 
 The room, along with the rest of the manor, was stripped of its Gilded Age ostentation to become a series of libraries, classrooms and lecture halls after the manor was turned over to New York State in 1949. That educational institution later moved and blossomed into what is now Stony Brook University, but while it was at Coe Hall, the home lost most of its luxurious trappings.
 The house has been run by a private foundation since the mid-1970s; the arboretum is operated by New York State. 
 ''This is definitely challenging all my skills,'' said Ms. Wood-Holland, 55, of Tarrytown, who was chosen because of her experience as a Broadway scenic artist on productions including ''The Lion King'' and ''Mary Poppins.'' She has been working on the project for about four months and basically started from scratch, working from the photographs to recreate the original as closely as possible.
 One of Ms. Wood-Holland's most difficult tasks has been to capture the muralist's authentic touches while recreating the fantastical ones that remain unexplained, she said.
 ''I've really been learning a lot about flowers,'' she said, taking a break from her work. ''I wasn't so good at them before this. I have no idea where that weird palm came from.''
 Perhaps the room's most eye-opening element is the luminescent silver hues of the lakes, a glowing effect that extends up to the ceiling. It was achieved by layering on two coats of silver paint and covering them with a glaze, Ms. Wood-Holland said.
 As for anyone who might protest that the reconstruction of an artistic indulgence from the Gilded Age might be inappropriate during such hard economic times, Mr. Joyce has an answer: it is the reconstruction of a unique era, one that visitors can enjoy for a nominal fee. 
 ''It's not real gold and silver,'' he said. ''It's just paint.''
 Ms. Wood-Holland's overriding concern is the fast-approaching April 1 opening. As she knows from facing deadlines on Broadway, the show must go on. ''Opening night is upon us,'' she said with a veteran's confidence. ''It will be done.''

HEADLINE: Signs of a Thaw In the Wardrobe Recession

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
 Many people have moments when, despite a full closet, they truly feel they have nothing to wear. That dress? Out of style. Those pants? A ripped hem. That shirt? Wore it last Thursday. 
 But last year, people were probably more likely to consider that dress ''vintage wear,'' to dig out a needle and thread or to change their rule about not wearing the same thing twice in one week.
 No doubt because of the recession, the apparel market in the United States posted a 5.2 percent decline in 2009 from the year before, according to the market research firm NPD.
 But there are signs that people may soon be back to surveying their wardrobes with a more unforgiving air, followed by a trip to the store. In the fourth quarter, the women's market -- which makes up half of all fashion market sales -- slowed its decline somewhat, NPD said.
 And last week, retailers posting results for February showed their strongest percentage increases since late 2007.

HEADLINE: Indonesia Tries to Recast Rebels as Forest Rangers

BYLINE: By PETER GELLING

 BODY:
BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA -- For decades, the vast jungle interior that blankets the northern Indonesian province of Aceh provided a haven for thousands of rebel foot soldiers fighting a war of independence.
 Now, still marginalized and largely unemployed despite nearly five years of peace, many former separatists have fled back into the forest, this time to chop it down.
 ''I spoke to an old rebel captain recently, and I asked him why he continued to illegally log Aceh's forests,'' said Mohammad Nur Djuli, head of the Aceh Reintegration Body, an organization set up by the provincial government in 2006 to help former combatants rejoin society.
 ''He said, 'O.K., you feed my 200 men and I'll throw this chain saw into the river.' What can I say to that?'' 
 A government program, called Aceh Green, hopes to provide an answer.
 Five years after an earthquake and tsunami laid waste to much of Aceh Province, killing 170,000 people, the provincial government has begun to institute a strategy of economic development. It aims to incorporate sustainable development, integrate former combatants into society and create jobs that fulfill the goal of the former separatist movement: ensuring that revenue from natural resources benefits local people.
 The Aceh Green program, although still in its early stages, has already yielded some results.
 Hundreds of former rebels, who know the Ulu Masen jungle perhaps better than anyone, are being trained and recast as forest rangers by Fauna and Flora International, one of the oldest international environmental groups in Aceh. The new rangers trek through the woods, armed with compasses and climbing rope, on the lookout for illegal loggers and poachers.
 The rangers are picked by their local communities and act as an independent group supplementing an existing but small forest police force -- their former adversaries. The former rebels are trained for 10 days by Fauna and Flora International.
 Their graduation ceremony looks like an episode of ''Survivor.'' Exhausted and dirty, they stand in a river surrounded by flaming torches to receive their diplomas, which come in the form of hugs. As in a baptism, they are dunked one by one in the river by their ''master trainer'' and given a clean uniform to begin their new lives.
 ''A lot of them cry,'' said Matthew Linkie, program manager for Fauna and Flora International's Aceh branch. ''It is amazing to see that among these hardened men. These guys are going from outcasts and criminals to heroes. They are becoming our eyes and ears. They let us know what is going on in very remote parts of the jungle, places that are normally very difficult to monitor.''
 Aceh Green is the brainchild of Gov. Irwandi Yusuf, who is a former rebel as well as an American-trained veterinarian and founder of Fauna and Flora International's Aceh branch. He presented Aceh Green to the world at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali, where, to the applause of the world's environmentalists, he declared that he intended to turn his province into a worldwide model of sustainability.
 Analysts have largely praised the spirit of the program, which hints at a potentially bright future for a region known for disaster and conflict. Several months after the Bali conference, the governor declared a moratorium on all logging in the Ulu Masen forest and began the ranger program with Fauna and Flora.
 In February 2008, Ulu Masen became the first forest to be internationally recognized as protected under the United Nations program called REDD, for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries. The system allows rich countries to offset their carbon output by paying poor countries to preserve their forests. The project could net Aceh an estimated $26 million in carbon credits if it can successfully protect the entire 1.9-million-acre Ulu Masen jungle.
 ''Aceh Green is the articulation of a vision that Pak Irwandi has had for a long time,'' said Lilianne Fan, a former aid worker who is now serving as an adviser to the governor on Aceh Green, using an Indonesian courtesy title before the governor's name.
 Aceh, which covers the northern tip of Sumatra Island and supports a population of more than four million, has some of the world's richest stores of natural wealth, including natural gas, oil, coal, gold, iron, copper, tin and hardwood timber. It was the struggle to control revenue from these natural resources that prompted the long-running separatist rebellion.
 Now, the provincial government, empowered by a 2005 peace agreement that gives it limited autonomy from Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, hopes to extract those resources in a sustainable manner and for the benefit of its residents.
 Critics say that although Aceh Green is a good idea, the province lacks the government infrastructure and overall will power to make it effective.
 Some aid workers jokingly refer to the program as ''Aceh Brown,'' pointing out that in the remote areas where they work, the sounds of chain saws have grown louder than ever in spite of Aceh Green and the logging moratorium. In response, the government says it is not yet capable of monitoring the whole forest.
 One of the forces behind Aceh Green is an urgent need to improve Aceh's economy. Analysts say growth is essential for maintaining peace, but the economy is faltering as the multibillion-dollar reconstruction effort after the 2004 tsunami winds down. Local environmentalists now fear that, in the rush to compensate for the unemployment that has come with the end of international aid projects here, the spirit of Aceh Green will be diluted.
 The governor ''supports the investors, not the environment,'' said Arifsyah Nasution, coordinator for Kuala, an umbrella organization representing 25 local environmental groups. ''The governor says they are doing it in a 'green way,' but we have yet to see any results. To us it is all just jargon, a way to attract large-scale investment.''
 At the heart of Aceh Green's difficulties is the lack of a fully functioning government in much of the region. More than 30 years of conflict and the tsunami have left provincial and local governments in tatters. Corruption, especially at the local level, remains prevalent, according to anticorruption watchdogs like Transparency International.
 ''The Aceh Green team works alone,'' Mr. Nasution said about the governor's team, which works out of Banda Aceh, the provincial capital. ''There is very little coordination or understanding among other sectors of government.''
 ''There are a lot of conflicting regulations coming from various levels of government,'' he added. ''It's a mess.''
 Ms. Fan said that the governor's Aceh Green team planned to spend the next two years strengthening governing skills among local and provincial leaders. They are reviewing forest policy as well as resource extraction. Several projects are in the works, Ms. Fan said, including a partnership between the Indonesian government and the German development bank KfW to develop geothermal resources.
 For some, including the rebels-turned-rangers, Aceh Green has become a new sort of provincial doctrine.
 Kamarullah, 32, a former rebel fighter and illegal logger, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said he now considered himself an environmental activist.
 ''I never knew how to wisely use the forest,'' he said during a recent patrol. ''Now I understand the importance of the forest. I will always protect it, its wildlife and the environment as a whole from now on, even if I am no longer a ranger.''

HEADLINE: Franco-American With an Aftertaste

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEELE

 BODY:
WHAT WAS IT? The 1983-87 Renault Alliance was the Pepe Le Pew of subcompacts, a stinker born of Renault's short-lived alliance -- hence the name -- with American Motors. 
 WHAT WAS THE POINT? The Renault 9 had been successful in Europe, and A.M.C. hoped an American-made version would help to revive its sagging fortunes.
 THE ADS SAID ''European technology, built in America.'' Otherwise, ads for the Alliance trumpeted its mileage (37 city/52 highway) and price ($5,595), as well as its coronation as Motor Trend's 1983 Car of the Year.
 THE CRITICS SAID Motor Trend wasn't the only magazine purring for the Alliance. Car and Driver ranked it among the ''10 best'' of 1983, saying it ''represents a blending of compact dimensions, surprising creature comfort, excellent fuel economy, good looks and very pleasing over-the-road behavior.''
 ON SECOND THOUGHT... Last year, Car and Driver called the Alliance one of the 10 most embarrassing award winners of all time, writing that the car ''proved that Wisconsin workers could assemble a Renault with the same indifference to quality that was a hallmark of the French automotive industry.''
 REALITY CHECK Rusting and head gasket problems were common woes, and recalls were initiated for faulty heater cores, leaky fuel hoses and balky driver's seats. After Chrysler bought A.M.C. in 1987, it gave the Alliance a quick and unceremonious funeral.
 SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE In the halcyon days of '83, my family's metallic-blue Alliance took five of us to Disney World and back to North Carolina in relative comfort, with nary a hiccup from the 56-horsepower engine (though ''it sounded like a sewing machine,'' my mother recalls). The troubles came after I inherited the car in 1987. The clutch linkage snapped twice in two years, and the gearshift handle routinely came off in my hand. Malfunctions aside, it was perhaps not the most impressive vehicle in which to pick up a prom date.
 WHAT'S IT WORTH? A chuckle or two, in retrospect. As for resale value, an online search for Alliances unearthed mostly used parts, though a few models were being offered for sale at prices from $525 to a pie-in-the-sky $4,000. Ours went to a junkyard in 1990 for about $100. We probably got the better end of the deal.

HEADLINE: Nascar's New Season Off to a Bumpy Start

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HAMPTON, Ga. 

 BODY:
The drivers keep saying how much the racing has improved in the opening month of the Nascar season, yet there is all sorts of evidence that defies their optimism.
 Television ratings? Down. Empty seats? Plenty. Potholes and errant caution lights? Those, too.
 And look who has won two of the first three Sprint Cup races: Jimmie Johnson, who has captured an unprecedented four straight Cup championships. His fast start heading into Sunday's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway has perhaps further dampened enthusiasm for a sport that once appeared on the verge of carving out its place among the big three of American sports: the N.F.L., the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball. 
 The four-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon has certainly noticed the warning signs.
 ''Yeah, you recognize it,'' he said Friday before qualifying for the Kobalt Tools 500. ''When you go through driver introductions and wave to all those people, it's hard not to recognize where we're at.''
 The struggling economy had certainly affected all sports at the ticket office, but the drop in Nascar's once-booming TV ratings may be the most troubling trend.
 The rating for the season-opening Daytona 500, the sport's biggest event, dipped more than 16 percent from 2009, hurt by two hours of delays caused by a pothole problem. California's numbers were similarly off (and the actual attendance was even worse). Last week's race at Las Vegas, where the caution lights came on twice for no reason, had a 37 percent plunge.
 Of course, it must be recognized that all three races went up against the Vancouver Olympics, with Las Vegas facing the stiffest competition from a stirring United States-Canada men's gold medal hockey game on the final day of the Olympics. But some major sports have actually had an increase in TV ratings, including a record audience for this year's Super Bowl.
 ''There's a lot more to watch on television,'' Gordon said. ''But then you look at the N.FL.; they have the best ratings they've ever had. Obviously, there's something we can do. We've got to try to tap into that.''
 Maybe it would help if someone could beat Johnson. He has two victories. giving him 49 career wins, and is doing his best to snuff out any hope for his competitors before the weather heats up.
 ''We got into this position by not letting up,'' said Johnson, who is poised to reach his landmark 50th victory faster than all but Gordon, David Pearson and Darrell Waltrip. 
 ''We're keeping our heads down. We don't pay attention to the outside stuff.''
 But his rivals are sure taking note, and they do not seem happy that one driver seems to have such an edge on everyone else.
 ''We all have to work harder,'' Gordon said. ''We all have to get fired up to go out there and try to knock that guy off. You can't blame those guys for wanting to dominate and keep doing the things they're doing.''
 Gordon said the sport needed some riveting rivalries, but it is hard for anyone to be too mad at Johnson. He comes across as a nice guy who goes about his business in a workmanlike fashion, failing to stir over-the-top support or raging animosity.
 ''I just think it depends on the rivalries and the stories,'' Gordon said. ''If you're dominating, but you're battling a Dale Earnhardt Jr. or a Tony Stewart, maybe a Kevin Harvick, then you can build that rivalry. The good guy-bad guy kind of thing, the Ford-Chevy thing, all that stuff.
 ''I think the stories are still there, the interest is still there,'' he added. ''But when you're out there dominating and no one is really you're enemy, then it pulls away from it a little bit.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Ace (Or Deuce)

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Diplomacy and energy are never far apart in the Persian Gulf. So, as American officials seek new international sanctions against Iran this week, it's probably wise for them to remember how much the world's global energy map has changed over the past decade.
 Iran's leaders certainly do, and they've been counting on their increased ties with Asian countries, especially China, as their trump card against efforts to hem in their nuclear program. 
 At the same time, the Iranians may want to reconsider just how much that trump card is worth. A number of experts say it is losing its value with each month that the stalemate over its nuclear program continues.
 The argument that Iran may be much less vulnerable to sanctions than Washington would wish is based largely on the long-term stakes that three powers in the United Nations Security Council -- China, Russia and France -- have in the future of Iran's energy resources, either as customers, investors or potential partners.
 In addition, Iran, which holds the world's second-biggest oil and gas reserves and supplies about 4.5 percent of the world's oil production, recently signaled it could flex its muscles if it felt threatened, by briefly occupying a disputed oil field on the Iraqi border. The move was a reminder of Iran's unhappiness that Iraq is attracting foreign oil investments, and of Iran's ability to stop traffic in the Strait of Hormuz.
 Iran has linked its oil policies to strategic goals for decades. In the 1990s, it tried to court American companies as a step toward political detente with Washington. When that failed, it turned to European and Japanese companies, and later to Chinese and other Asian companies.
 Iran has also outlined plans to build a gas pipeline to India via Pakistan and another to Turkey that might eventually supply Europe. It is already Beijing's second-biggest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia, and last year the China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $4.7 billion contract to further develop one giant Iranian gas field and a memorandum of understanding to develop an oil field, following similar agreements with other Chinese companies.
 ''Iran considers its oil and gas sector as a strategic asset,'' said Flynt Leverett, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a critic of the administration's effort to strengthen sanctions. ''Relations with China also don't come with any baggage. It gives them some leverage.''
 But that strategy is hardly foolproof, and it is already showing some strains.
 For one, the prospect of Iran's achieving the ability to make a nuclear bomb has cooled European enthusiasm for investing. European companies that include Royal Dutch Shell, Repsol of Spain and France's Total have decided that their involvement in Iran was too risky; that is one reason the door was open so wide to China.
 And in recent months, Russia's support for sanctions, though still tenuous, has grown.
 Iran still may be counting on China to use its power in the Security Council and its leverage in Washington to shield it against international sanctions that could really hurt, like a ban on gasoline exports to Iran, as well as unilateral American sanctions. But some analysts believe that would be expecting too much; they point out that China has been reluctant to openly challenge America, especially in the Persian Gulf. ''The Iranians are overconfident in the Chinese reliance on them,'' said Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 Meanwhile, Iran's energy sector has glaring weaknesses. It has few refineries, imports about 40 percent of its gasoline, and struggles to keep oil production from falling. Erica S. Downs of the Brookings Institution in Washington says it is unclear how much money the Chinese have spent so far. ''The Iranians aren't getting all they were hoping for from China,'' she said.
 The global recession isn't helping. Iran needs oil prices to stay up at $90 a barrel to balance its budget, according to PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. Also, unlike a few years ago when the world's oil system could barely keep up with growing demand, there now is ample spare capacity, much of it in Saudi Arabia.
 Cliff Kupchan, a former State Department official and now a director at the New York consulting firm Eurasia Group, said this meant that Iran no longer held a ''trump card'' when it comes to oil.
 That's a point Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made last month in Saudi Arabia, where she asked King Abdullah to guarantee more oil to China to help persuade the Chinese not to block new sanctions. She also suggested that China's Persian Gulf oil supplies could be threatened by a nuclear Iran.
 Given how much it has at stake in Iran's future, China might even find it in its own interest to get Iran to the negotiating table, said Lawrence Goldstein, an energy expert. ''The key is what role China is prepared to play,'' he said. ''The Chinese have a lot to lose if things go wrong in Iran.''

HEADLINE: Dreaming The Possible Dream

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
The thing I love most about America is that there's always somebody who doesn't get the word -- somebody who doesn't understand that in a Great Recession you're supposed to hunker down, downsize and just hold on for dear life. I have a couple of friends who fit that bill, who think a recession is a dandy time to try to discover better and cheaper ways to do things. They both happen to be Indian-Americans -- one a son of the Himalayas, who came to America on a scholarship and went to work for NASA to try to find a way to Mars; the other a son of New Delhi, who came here and found the Sun, Sun Microsystems. Both are serial innovators. Both are now shepherding clean-tech start-ups that have the potential to be disruptive game changers. They don't know from hunkering down. They just didn't get the word. 
 As a result, one has produced a fuel cell that can turn natural gas or natural grass into electricity; the other has a technology that might make coal the cleanest, cheapest energy source by turning its carbon-dioxide emissions into bricks to build your next house. Though our country may be flagging, it's because of innovators like these that you should never -- ever -- write us off.
 Let me introduce Vinod Khosla and K.R. Sridhar. Khosla, the co-founder of Sun, set out several years ago to fund energy start-ups. His favorite baby right now is a company called Calera, which was begun with the Stanford Professor Brent Constantz, who was studying how corals use CO2 to produce their calcium carbonate bones.
 If you combine CO2 with seawater, or any kind of briny water, you produce CaCO3, calcium carbonate. That is not only the stuff of corals. It is also the same white, pasty goop that appears on your shower head from hard (calcium-rich) water. At its demonstration plant near Santa Cruz, Calif., Calera has developed a process that takes CO2 emissions from a coal- or gas-fired power plant and sprays seawater into it and naturally converts most of the CO2 into calcium carbonate, which is then spray-dried into cement or shaped into little pellets that can be used as concrete aggregates for building walls or highways -- instead of letting the CO2 emissions go into the atmosphere and produce climate change.
 If this can scale, it would eliminate the need for expensive carbon-sequestration facilities planned to be built alongside coal-fired power plants -- and it might actually make the heretofore specious notion of ''clean coal'' a possibility.
 In announcing in December an alliance to build more Calera plants, Ian Copeland, president of Bechtel Renewables and New Technology -- a tough-minded engineering company -- said: ''The fundamental chemistry and physics of the Calera process are based on sound scientific principles and its core technology and equipment can be integrated with base power plants very effectively.''
 A source says the huge Peabody coal company will announce an investment in Calera next week. ''If this works,'' said Khosla, ''coal-fired power would become more than 100 percent clean. Not only would it not emit any CO2, but by producing clean water and cement as a byproduct it would also be taking all of the CO2 that goes into making those products out of the atmosphere.''
 John Doerr, the legendary venture capitalist who financed Sun, once said of Khosla: ''The best way to get Vinod to do something is to tell him it is impossible.'' 
 Sridhar's company, Bloom Energy, was featured last week on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' Several months ago, though, Sridhar took me into the parking lot behind Google's Silicon Valley headquarters and showed me the inside of one of his Bloom Boxes, the size of a small shipping container. Inside were stacks of solid oxide fuel cells, stored in cylinders, and all kinds of whiz-bang parts that I did not understand.
 What I did understand, though, was that Google was already getting part of its clean-energy from these fuel cells -- and Wal-Mart, eBay, FedEx and Coca-Cola just announced that they are doing the same. Sridhar, Bloom's co-founder and C.E.O., said his fuel cells, which can run on natural gas or biogas, can generate electricity at 8 to 10 cents a kilowatt hour, with today's subsidies. ''We know we can bring the price down further,'' he said, ''so Bloom power will be affordable in every energy-poor country'' -- Sridhar's real dream.
 Attention: These technologies still have to prove that they are reliable, durable and scalable -- and if you Google both, you will find studies saying they are and studies that are skeptical. All I know is this: If we put a simple price on carbon, these new technologies would have a chance to blossom and thousands more would come out of innovators' garages. America still has the best innovation culture in the world. But we need better policies to nurture it, better infrastructure to enable it and more open doors to bring others here to try it.
 Our politics has gotten so impossible lately, too many Americans have stopped dreaming. Not these two. They just never got the word. As Sridhar says: ''We came to America for the American dream -- to do good and to make good.''

HEADLINE: Channeling Toyota to Beat Toyota

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Milford, Mich.
 JOSH SMITH is a large man with a shaved head, a goatee and a look in his eyes that can only be described as stoked. And he is never more stoked than when he talks about his job, one of the strangest at the General Motors Proving Grounds, here in this suburb 45 miles northwest of Detroit.
 All day, he breaks G.M. parts.
 Not just any parts. Mr. Smith is a member of Red X, a team of 33 engineers who study auto parts that are malfunctioning for reasons that have everyone stumped. The work is a little bit ''CSI'' and a little bit ''MythBusters.'' Red X takes working parts and methodically torments them in controlled experiments, hoping to re-enact the demise of ones that failed. 
 ''Every defective part is like a dead body,'' says Mr. Smith, giving a tour of the premises late last month. ''To figure out what killed it, we need to duplicate the crime.''
 Members of this elite little group say they have gone from fixing major problems that affect hundreds of thousands of vehicles on the road to fine-tuning pre-production models that are not yet on sale. And that change highlights a message that G.M. -- as well as its domestic archrival Ford -- are both pitching hard these days: We're better now. Oh, we made some stinkers in the past, no doubt about it. But that was then. Look at us now.
 It's been a tough sell, particularly at G.M., which has lagged behind Ford in quality ratings, needed a $50 billion taxpayer bailout and just last week announced a recall of 1.3 million vehicles. (Chrysler, which is now controlled by Fiat, is in what could politely be called a ''transition phase'' and has yet to try, let alone pull off, a makeover.)
 But in the last two months, G.M. and Ford have been handed a once-in-a-generation chance to make their case to an American buying public that is listening as never before.
 Perhaps you've heard: Toyota, long considered the industry's king of quality, has stumbled disastrously with a now-infamous ''sudden acceleration'' problem that led to the recall of more than eight million vehicles. The ordeal has included every element of an American-style corporate nightmare, including apologies, class-action lawsuits and, inevitably, Congressional hearings.
 For the first time in decades, shoppers who once would have headed directly to the nearest Toyota dealership are taking a look at American automakers. A rare opportunity has knocked. But are G.M. and Ford ready to answer?
 Absolutely, the companies say, and analysts and consumer surveys suggest that both companies have made substantial, if rather overdue, strides in the last three years in improving vehicle reliability.
 The fuller picture is more complicated, particularly at G.M. Red X engineers may indeed focus on small-bore problems with vehicles that haven't hit showrooms, but the company still deals with the occasional headline-making disaster -- like the power-steering failures in Chevrolets and Pontiacs that spurred the recall last week.
 ''We've had reports of 13 accidents and one injury,'' said Jamie Hresko, the company's vice president for quality, sounding a little weary in a phone interview at the end of the day when the recall was announced.
 ''That's a very small population of vehicles,'' he said. ''But I look at it this way: If we're really all about changing the culture here, we will put the customer first. And by announcing this recall, that's what we're doing.''
 THE history of quality is a slightly sore subject for American automakers. Ford's vice president for global quality, Bennie Fowler, will gladly explain that it now takes just 72 hours for warranty claim information to flow from a dealer's repair shop to the factory floor, where a manufacturing adjustment might be needed. He's less eager to discuss the past, when that same journey took 30 days.
 ''You might say that all of our reforms seem like common sense and we should have been doing all of this a long time ago,'' says Mr. Fowler. ''I wouldn't disagree with that. Suffice it to say, we now understand all the elements of quality, and we're working to ensure that whatever happened in the past doesn't happen again.''
 Ford and G.M. have taken impressive steps over the last five years to improve the performance and durability of their vehicles. But every undertaking raises the same question: What took you so long?
 Part of the answer, academics and industry analysts say, is that for years American carmakers made so much money from high-margin behemoths like pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s that ignoring quality held little financial downside -- at least in the short term.
 Look at what happened in 2000. G.M. sold 8.6 million vehicles and earned profits of $4.45 billion. That same year, Consumer Reports listed 35 ''reliability risks'' in its annual car guide. Fifteen were made by G.M.
 ''You've got to understand, for years, American carmakers derided Toyota for its attention to quality,'' says Susan R. Helper, a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University. ''They wanted just the right amount of quality, just the right amount of styling. U.S. companies didn't need to care.''
 For American makers, the emphasis was on introducing new features -- tilt steering! cup holders! -- and new product categories to their fleets. Toyota made models that were dull by comparison and then spent years furiously refining them. Its cars just ran and ran. American companies were thinking quarter to quarter; Toyota took the long view and turned customers into lifelong fans.
 ''If you spend money on your car in the fourth year, when it's no longer under warranty, you're going to say 'I'll never buy another one of these again,' '' says David Champion, senior director of Consumer Reports' auto test division. ''That happened all the time with American cars. But you talk to people who've had Toyotas and Hondas, and they'll say they can't kill them. They're looking for an excuse to buy a new car, but there's nothing wrong with the one they own. The things are bulletproof.''
 As G.M. and Ford would learn, trying to produce bulletproof products required a top-to-bottom overhaul -- starting with the purchasing department. All vehicles from every manufacturer worldwide are a meticulous assemblage of thousands of parts, as many as three-quarters of which are made by outside suppliers. The first trick in building quality is finding a way to coordinate all these suppliers so that the parts fit together seamlessly.
 Toyota has always done this by treating parts makers as collaborators. Contracts are awarded based not primarily on price but on defect rates. If a manufacturer is fumbling, Toyota will send engineers to help fix the problem. American companies long took a more adversarial approach, analysts say. Cost was the No. 1 concern -- generally, if you were the low bidder, you won -- and when mistakes were made the supplier was fired.
 ''Everything about the old G.M. was about maintaining the integrity of the competitive bidding process,'' Professor Helper says. ''Toyota would say to its suppliers, 'We have the same goal, to make good economical cars, and we'll pressure you to do well, and if all our efforts fail, we might fire you, but that is really a last resort.' ''
 By contrast, she said: ''In the '80s, I had a tire supplier tell me: 'All Detroit cares about is that the tires are round, black and cheap. And if they're cheap, the first two aren't important.' ''
 Even when American carmakers bought well-made parts, they often botched the next challenge: building the vehicle. James Rubenstein, a professor at Miami University in Ohio, says the G.M. workers he lectured as part of a United Automobile Workers educational campaign in the late '80s told him that air-conditioning units they were installing at a plant in Dayton fit just fine -- but only after assemblers shimmed around something already in the dashboard.
 ''Even if the part is made correctly, if you have to remove something to install it, you're losing crucial quality,'' he says. ''These workers would complain to me about it, but if they said if they told their bosses it would have been bad for their careers.''
 Where American workers feared recriminations if they spoke up, Japanese workers feared recriminations if they spotted problems and said nothing. The difference is part of a culture of shared responsibility that Mr. Hresko, the man in charge of G.M.'s current drive for quality, saw up close, courtesy of Toyota.
 MR. HRESKO is a 46-year-old native of Flint, Michigan and when he isn't moving, he looks like he's struggling to stay still. He joined G.M. in 1982 and managed several plants before he was tapped in 2006 to become G.M.'s quality czar for North America. Two years later, he became the global vice president for quality. When you ask why he got the job, he says simply, ''I'm impatient.''
 Before the visit to Red X, over lunch at the Proving Grounds' cafeteria, he recounts how in 1998 he went to work at Nummi -- New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. -- an unusual joint venture of G.M. and Toyota in Fremont, Calif. When Nummi began in 1984, each company had its own reasons for teaming up with a rival. Toyota wanted to see if its management style would work with American workers. G.M. wanted a good look at that management style.
 The workers at Nummi were Americans, but all of its business practices and its structure were straight out of Toyota's playbook. Mr. Hresko was a rising star at G.M. when he was assigned there, but he asked to start on the assembly floor. What he saw amazed him.
 ''Early on, a guy comes up to me and says, 'Hey, one thing I want you to do every day, twice a shift, is leave one of your parts off.' I was working on the front suspension line, making Corollas, and he said, 'Leave a bolt off, or don't run all of your bolts all the way down.' I said I can't do that. He said: 'Oh yeah, that's part of your standard work. Do this once before lunch and once after lunch.' ''
 Mr. Hresko soon learned that this exercise was so integral to Toyota's system that the company had a name for purposefully unfinished cars: rabbits. The rabbits were to test the factories' error-proofing systems.
 ''If the alarms didn't go off or someone didn't come and talk to you, just to say, 'Hey, this bolt is loose,' you had to run and find the car,'' he said. ''But the company's error-proofing systems were so good -- they were all automated, for the most part -- you could not ship a shy part or a loose fastener off your job. It was practically impossible.''
 At the behest of Mr. Hresko, G.M. has reduced the employee-to-foreman ratio to 5 to 1 from 15 to 1, Toyota-style. It has revamped its repair information processing system -- just as Ford did -- and vastly increased the amount of punishment each model is designed to endure.
 ''We've substantially upped the testing,'' says Mr. Hresko. ''We used to build vehicles to a certain mileage requirement. Now, they're built not to fail.''
 Because this is the automobile industry, all of these changes are accompanied by buzzwords and catch phrases. Mr. Hresko and his colleagues talk a lot about ''no-kidding accountability'' and ''playing to win, rather than playing to compete,'' and the ''search for B.O.B.,'' meaning ''best of the best.''
 There is no doubting their sincerity, but at moments Mr. Hresko and his team, as well as Mr. Fowler at Ford, sound a bit like celebrities explaining why their fifth marriage is really, truly, definitely going to last. This time it's different, argue both G.M. and Ford.
 But is it?
 To some extent, yes.
 As it happens, the visit to the Proving Grounds occurred the day after the release of the Consumer Reports annual car guide. For the auto industry, that guide is the ultimate scorecard, a reckoning based on the magazine's own extensive road testing and survey data from more than a million drivers.
 The results offered plenty for G.M. and Ford to both rejoice about and cry over. On the plus side for G.M., the company earned ''top pick'' prizes in two of the magazine's 10 categories: for the Traverse (which won for family S.U.V.'s) and the Silverado (which won for pickup trucks). Neither Ford nor Chrysler won any top picks.
 The magazine also compiles a list of ''recommended buys.'' Here, Ford far outpaced G.M., as it has in recent years. Seventy-five percent of Ford's models were recommended (24 out of 32), compared with 27 percent of G.M.'s (7 of 26). Only one Chrysler model was recommended: the Dodge Ram pickup.
 Consumer Reports also offered an overall report card for 14 automakers. Here, the results for Ford and G.M. looked pretty grim. Ford came in 11th, G.M. was 13th and Chrysler finished last. (The top finishers were Honda, Subaru and Toyota, respectively.)
 The problem for G.M. and Ford is that the magazine includes results from cars that are one, two and three years old, and the older cars are dragging down both companies' scores.
 ''G.M. has some very, very good new vehicles,'' says Mr. Champion of Consumer Reports. ''In terms of style, fit and finish, some of them are leaps and bounds beyond where they were five years ago. Unfortunately their reliability is inconsistent.''
 Ford, on the other hand, is making cars that don't perform quite as well, but they break down less often, according to Mr. Champion. He called the Ford Fusion the most reliable family sedan on the market, surpassing the Toyota Camry.
 ''Ford has reliability, but its products aren't as good,'' Mr. Champion summarizes. ''G.M. cars are good but not as reliable. If you could somehow merge these companies together, you would have something.''
 G.M. and Ford talk a lot about a ''perception gap,'' the American public's supposedly outdated ideas about the quality of their cars. And if your notion of Detroit is borne of that Chevy Impala you owned in the '90s -- the one that needed $1,200 in repairs 10 minutes after its warranty expired -- your image of American cars certainly needs an update.
 But Consumer Reports and a number of analysts will tell you that the doubting American public is onto something, and that Detroit needs a few more years to become as good as it says it is.
 ''The way carmakers develop reputations is in driveways all across the country, when neighbors come by for a sniff of a new vehicle you just bought,'' says James Bell, executive market analyst at Kelley Blue Book, which tracks the value of used cars.
 ''For years, buyers of American cars just said, 'I got a great deal on this.' They're starting to say positive things that have nothing to do with price, which is what will make the perception gap go away.''
 REPUTATION lags behind reality for Toyota, too, experts say. But until recently it had the opposite effect -- slightly overhyping the company's fleet and helping sales. Analysts say Toyotas have declined in quality in the last couple of years, because the company has simply grown too large to maintain standards the way it once did.
 Even its current we-beg-your-pardon P.R. campaign, with its slogan ''Moving Forward,'' seems tin-eared. Everyone knows Toyotas ''move forward.'' The problem is that sometimes they don't stop.
 Nonetheless, this is a golden moment to buy a Toyota, Mr. Champion says: its cars are still terrific, the fixes prompted by the recalls have already been made, and the company has just announced some very aggressive incentive programs to tempt buyers, including zero percent financing on some models for up to 60 months.
 The company will need all the bait it can get. Sales at Toyota were down 9 percent in February compared with the period a year earlier, the company reported last week, and its market share in the United States fell to 12.8 percent, its lowest since 2005, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank. Sales rose 11.5 percent at G.M. and 43 percent at Ford.
 Both American companies know that to turn the gains of the last month into a long-term trend, a national case of Toyotaphobia will not suffice.
 ''We know we can't take our eye off the ball,'' says Mr. Fowler at Ford. ''We need to continue our momentum.''
 Mr. Hresko of G.M. echoed that sentiment, and added some sober self-criticism.
 ''I'm disappointed because I don't want to finish near the bottom in the overall scorecard,'' he says. But ''overall warranty claims are down 50 percent in the last five years. We're going in the right direction, and I know we'll get there.''
 THERE was evidence of progress at Red X on the day of the tour. A handful of parts were undergoing tests, including a seat cushion that was being pounded by a robotic elbow, over and over, and a seat slide bar that was being yanked, every few seconds, by a machine.
 Josh Smith, the engineer, stood near the pummeled seat cushion and recounted a mystery that the team solved not long ago, involving the Cadillac DTS.
 ''Customer is complaining, 'There's a clunk when I steer.' The clunk was because of a tie rod, which turns the wheels of the car,'' he said. ''Now, that tie rod was loose. It was loose because of corrosion, and it was corroded because it leaked, and it leaked because the steel that was stamped on the back of it was leaking.''
 After some tests, Red X concluded that the problem was a machine stamping out the steel, at a supplier in Alabama that wasn't doing enough maintenance on that machine.
 ''We called the company and described the tool to them without even seeing it,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We knew what it was just from the forensics.''
 A decade ago, G.M. would probably have dropped that supplier, because conversations between engineers and parts makers were all but prohibited. They disrupted the ''integrity of the competitive bidding process.'' Of course, they also robbed the company of the chance to refine its vehicles.
 Which is why Mr. Smith's phone call to Alabama was much more than a mere phone call. It was solid evidence of a belated revolution.

Analysts think that Toyota is a victim of its own success in the market. As it grew, its legendary quality control system slipped.
Nonetheless, in Consumer Reports' latest auto issue, G.M. and Ford rank near the bottom in an overall scorecard. That's because the magazine takes into account three years of vehicles, and the older cars are dragging down the ratings of American automakers.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours: Palm Beach, Fla.

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
PALM BEACHERS may have tightened their Gucci belts in the wake of the Bernard Madoff scandal. The Ponzi scheme cleaned out some local bank accounts, and the recession curtailed the lust for Limoges and other such items. Still, judging by the perfectly clipped hedges that envelop the manicured mansions, residents may be doing with less, but not much less. The tiny island, north of Fort Lauderdale on Florida's east coast, still boasts some of the country's dreamiest estates, where the staff lives better than many Americans, cashmere sweaters in trademark pastel greens and pinks go for $800, and Rolls-Royces show up at Publix with regularity in a town where more is never quite enough.
 Friday
 4 p.m. 1)THE BIG GAPE 
 Big money means big house, so rent a nice convertible and stare. For envy-inducing views of these winter palaces, drive south along South Ocean Boulevard for about six miles starting at Barton Avenue. Even those obsessed with privacy relish their ocean views (why pay millions for beachfront if you can't enjoy it?), which means the gates and hedges along these mansions are slightly lower than elsewhere in town. You can catch a glimpse of the Mar-a-Lago Club, Donald Trump's former residence, now a private club owned by Mr. Trump.
 6:30 p.m. 2) GRANDE DAME
 For a sunset cocktail, glide into the Breakers Hotel (1 South County Road; 561-655-6611; thebreakers.com), originally built in 1896. So central is its location that the hotel has been rebuilt twice after fires destroyed it. The Seafood Bar has delightful views of the sea. If you prefer upholstered opulence, head for the Tapestry Bar with its two Flemish tapestries and a grand bar built from a mantel from Caxton Hall in London.
 8:30 p.m. 3)DINER'S CLUB
 Palm Beach dining runs from supremely pretentious to casually simple. Many restaurants survive over decades, and because Palm Beach is a small town, where the same cast shows up frequently, they have the feel of private clubs. The Palm Beach Grill (340 Royal Poinciana Way; 561-835-1077; palmbeachgrill.com) is a darkly wooded, dimly lighted social fixture that is a favorite of the author James Patterson and almost everyone else. If the mobbed dining room is for the island's old guard, the bar seems to attract newcomers: snowbirds deciding whether to move South, city types longing for a slower, more glamorous life and locals who want to have fun. Don't miss American classics like spare ribs and ice cream sundaes. Dinner for two, from $80. Book before you fly.
 Saturday
 8 a.m. 4)EMPTY BEACHES
 Park on South Ocean Boulevard and take a long, languorous walk on the beach. The beaches here are flat, wide, clean and wonderful in the early morning when there are not many people around.
 9 a.m. 5)EARLY SNOWBIRDS
 This may be a party town, but it wakes up early. A clutch of restaurants along Royal Poinciana Way are busy by 8:30 a.m., with diners sitting outside and savoring the sunshine and breakfast. Testa's Palm Beach Restaurant (221 Royal Poinciana Way; 561-832-0992; testasrestaurants.com), a sprawling, relaxed space, serves blueberry, pecan and bran pancakes ($6.25). Around the corner is Green's Pharmacy (151 North County Road; 561-832-4443), which offers breakfast at an old-fashioned lunch counter. Afterward, pick up candy buttons and other long-forgotten stuff.
 10:30 a.m. 6)HISTORY CLASS
 For an authentic sense of Palm Beach in its early days, drop by the Flagler Museum (1 Whitehall Way; 561-655-2833; flaglermuseum.us). It was once the home of Henry Morrison Flagler, one of the founders of Standard Oil, and the man who brought the railroad to southern Florida. He spent millions in 1902 to build the 55-room house that became a hotel and finally a museum. Admission, $18.
 Noon 7)RETAIL STRUT
 On Worth Avenue, where every brand that you've seen in Vogue has a storefront, the real fun is the crowd: women in green cashmere sweaters walking dogs in matching outfits; elderly gents with bow ties and blazers. But the true gems -- Cartier aside -- are the smaller, lesser-known stores that have survived by wit and originality. Maryanna Suzanna (313 Worth Avenue; 561-833-0204) carries colorful jewelry by Monies and the Italian designer Angela Caputi -- some earrings are under $50. Across the street, Sherry Frankel's Melangerie (256 Worth Avenue; 561-655-1996) sells amusing plastic watches for $68. And nearby is Il Sandalo (240 Worth Avenue; 561-805-8674; ilsandalo.com), where the shoemaker Hernan Garcia makes custom sandals starting at $195. For lunch, head to Ta-boo (221 Worth Avenue, 561-835-3500; taboorestaurant.com), with its British colonial decor where women swathed in white linen with enormous straw hats pick carefully at the chopped chef's salad ($15.95).
 3:30 p.m. 8)GILT TRIP
 It's a challenge to fill up those sprawling estates with furniture, but there are armies of antiques merchants poised to try. Antiques enthusiasts can start at the elegant French dealer Cedric Dupont (820 South Dixie Highway; 561-835-1319; cedricdupontantiques.com) and go all the way south to Southern Boulevard to the Elephant's Foot (3800 South Dixie Highway; 561-832-0170; theelephantsfoot.com), which has a range of English. French and Oriental antiques at varying prices. Or for a resale find, try Circa Who (531 Northwood Road; 561-655-5224; circawho.com), with funky faux bamboo, retro and Old Florida furniture.
 8 p.m. 9)MEDITERRANEAN FLAVOR
 For a casual dinner in the heart of town, head to Cucina Dell'Arte (257 Royal Poinciana Way; 561-655-0770; cucinadellarte.com), which is popular with a younger crowd and is open until 3 a.m. It is decorated in the earth tones and mustards and peaches typical of the Mediterranean and seems to be busy all day with families, couples and groups of friends. You can eat outdoors and watch the crowds go by. Try the pollo cacciatore ($25).
 10:30 p.m. 10)PARTY TIME
 There are plenty of big jewels in Palm Beach, but they are generally worn at private parties. The night life for visitors is casual. Stop in for a drink at the very pretty Brazilian Court Hotel (301 Australian Avenue; 561-655-7740; thebraziliancourt.com) where the chef Daniel Boulud runs the restaurants. Order a Bikini Martini, with Sagatiba cachaca and passion fruit puree. On Saturdays a small band or D.J. plays in the lobby until 1 a.m., attracting a preppy crowd. Or head across the bridge to Blue Martini (City Place; 561-835-8601; bluemartinilounge.com) in a trendy shopping mall, where you can sip a martini and hear the music pour out of B. B. King's Blues Club next door.
 Sunday
 10 a.m. 11)HIT THE TRAIL
 A flat and easy bike trail hugs the Intracoastal Waterway, which skirts the west side of Palm Beach, and offers fantastic views of the Marina in West Palm Beach. Rent a bike at Palm Beach Bicycle Trail Shop (223 Sunrise Avenue; 561-659-4583; palmbeachbicycle.com), which has multispeed bikes starting at $15 an hour. If bikes are not your thing, you can jog the route.
 1 p.m. 12)STAYING COOL
 The Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton and others have all staked claims to the beachfront along South Ocean Boulevard. The new hot spot belongs to the Miami chef Michelle Bernstein, who recently opened two restaurants at the Omphoy Ocean Resort (2842 South Ocean Boulevard, 561-540-6450; omphoy.com). The sleekly elegant spaces are furnished in dark woods with views of the sea. Even on cool and overcast days during the winter, the lunch restaurant MB Terrace draws a diverse crowd. Try the seafood ceviche ($14). After all, this is Palm Beach, where a meal on the beach is a must. 
 IF YOU GO
 There are numerous nonstop flights from the New York City area to Palm Beach International Airport. Continental flies from Newark; Delta from La Guardia; and JetBlue out of La Guardia and Kennedy Airport. A recent Web search found fares on JetBlue and Delta starting at $199 for travel in March. A rental car is recommended to get around. 
 The Breakers(1 South County Road; 561-655-6611; thebreakers.com) is a 550-room stunner directly on the beach, with swimming pools, tennis and golf. It also has several restaurants, as well as a spa. Rooms start at $499 with a $100 credit toward activities at the hotel. 
 The Chesterfield(363 Cocoanut Row; 561-659-5800; www.chesterfieldpb.com) is a 52-room boutique hotel within walking distance of Worth Avenue. The rooms are elegantly appointed, some with flowered print wallpaper and upholstery, and the Leopard Lounge, with its leopard print carpet, is popular at night. Rooms start at $319. 
 The Marriott West Palm Beach (1001 Okeechobee Boulevard; 561-833-1234; marriott.com/westpalmbeach) is a safe choice if you want to be close to Palm Beach, with rooms starting at $229.

HEADLINE: A Boxing Overseer Is a Backer Of M.M.A.

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Melvina Lathan, the chairwoman of the New York State Athletic Commission, has a passion for boxing that ''began in vitro,'' she says, and would lead her to be a judge of 83 championship fights around the world.
 But she appreciates mixed martial arts enough to want the State Legislature to legalize the sport it banned. 
 ''It's not something I rush home to see, but I recognize its athleticism,'' she said. ''I like the intelligence needed to get out of holds where so many disciplines are used. When they're grappling, I grab the edge of my chair.''
 Her three grownup sons, one of whom was a ringside doctor for the Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament, and her husband, once the medical director of the athletic commission, gather occasionally to watch mixed martial arts videos. 
 ''My sons know all the guys and their moves,'' she said during a recent interview in the Manhattan office of her boss, Lorraine A. Cortes-Vazquez, New York's secretary of state. ''They say, 'We'll do this in New York, huh?' ''
 Legalization may come soon, 13 years after Gov. George E. Pataki scorned the sport as too dangerous and it was banned by the Legislature. In his proposed 2010-11 budget, which has an April 1 deadline, Gov. David A. Paterson included legislation to repeal the ban, a maneuver that is designed to accelerate approval and help raise tax revenue for the deficit-strapped state.
 Assemblyman Bob Reilly, an upstate Democrat and a vocal critic of repeal, said, ''The question is whether my colleagues who are opposed to M.M.A. on merit will succumb'' to the idea of generating additional revenue. 
 A study for the state said that one mixed martial arts show in Buffalo and one in Manhattan would generate $1.2 million in state and local taxes. Lathan said the study underestimated the economic impact of legalization, which would almost certainly lure New York fans who are attending combat cards held in states where the sport is legal.
 ''Those are our revenues going outside the state,'' she said.
 But she said her enthusiasm for repeal was focused largely on improving safety for the fighters and to limit -- or eliminate -- illicit shows around the state. 
 ''You don't want underground smokers,'' she said. ''There is no pre- and postfight examination or on-site ambulance. They can get knocked out today and fight tomorrow.''
 Ron Scott Stevens, whom Paterson dismissed as the head of the athletic commission two years ago in favor of Lathan, then one of the commissioners, disagreed. ''Over time,'' he said, ''New York will find out that the injuries these people sustain will be very costly, not only financially, but to the human condition.''
 The seriousness of injuries in M.M.A. -- which combines disciplines like karate, judo, jujitsu, boxing, wrestling and tae kwon do -- has long been a subject of debate. The sport has distanced itself from the no-holds-barred bloodlust of its early days and now rivals boxing as a television and spectator attraction.
 Lathan agrees with the sport's proponents, notably the dominant organization in the sport, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, that the worst harm is orthopedic, not neurological, as it is in boxing. She insisted that New York would have the nation's strictest M.M.A. regulation.
 ''It's nice to have an ally in the commissioner,'' said Marc Ratner, the vice president for regulatory affairs for Zuffa, the company that owns the U.F.C. Ratner, who assigned Lathan to judge bouts in Nevada when he was executive director of the state's athletic commission, said he knew she favored repeal ''from our discussions'' before she became the commissioner in 2008.
 Lathan grew up in a family that watched boxing on television together. When she was 4 or 5 years old, she said, her grandmother introduced her to a renowned boxer as they were walking in Harlem. 
 ''This African-American man was leaning on a pink car and said, 'Hi, baby,' '' she said. ''And she said, 'Hi, Sugar, this is my granddaughter.' She later told me it was Sugar Ray Robinson.''
 As a teenager on her way home from a job interview, she said, Sonny Liston invited her into a gym when he saw her wiping away frost from the window to peek at the boxers at work. She said she was less afraid of Liston and his fearsome reputation than her mother's anger for coming home late. 
 ''I have a picture of my hand in Sonny's,'' she said. ''My hand fit into his palm. My father keeps it in his dresser drawer.''
 She would marry, raise her four children (three sons and a daughter), design costumes and work in hospitals as a hematologist. She began judging amateur fights in 1988 and professional bouts in 1991.
 Randy Gordon, a former state athletic commissioner who trained Lathan, called her a great judge ''whose fight cards were hardly ever questioned.'' He said that one standard to assess her effectiveness was that ''she was rarely on the short end of a split decision -- and when she was, she was probably right.''
 Gordon, once a foe of mixed martial arts, is a convert who hosts a Sirius XM radio show on the sport.
 ''I've known for years that she liked M.M.A.,'' he said.
 If the ban on the sport is lifted, it will be in part the result of a long lobbying and public-relations campaign by the U.F.C., which has spent tens of thousands of dollars to convince legislators that mixed martial arts has changed. It is legal in 43 states. 
 Lathan said she has not joined the strategists' efforts. But she is in their corner.
 ''Everyone at some point who was against M.M.A. says it's entirely different now,'' she said. ''People change their minds. Governor Pataki did. Randy did.'' She added: ''We've learned a lot. We're trying to make the law ours. It's a good thing we'd be one of the last ones to join the show.''

HEADLINE: Not Your Banks' Bailouts: Stores Too Loved to Fail

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The bike store had become a wine bar. The new apartments were breathtakingly expensive. Then kids from the neighborhood formed a protective guard around a gnarly old candy store on Avenue A and Seventh Street in Manhattan.
 For the last month, a group of high school and college students has been running volunteer deliveries on Saturday nights for Ray's Candy Store, an all-night chapel of East Village life packed with fond, fervent and freakish memories, but not exactly jammed with customers. With their deliveries -- need an egg cream and Belgian fries at 3 a.m.? -- the kids hope to drum up business for Ray's until the spring, when more people are walking the streets. 
 How do the delivery teams get around? ''Skateboards,'' Arianna Gil, 16, said. ''Scooters, bike and feet. All will be utilized.'' 
 Already, friends and neighbors have run two fund-raisers to help the candy store's owner, Ray Alvarez, pay thousands of dollars in overdue bills; another is planned for Monday night at the Theater for the New City. 
 In the age of bailouts, it turns out that not all rescue operations involve numbers ending in ''illions.'' 
 Last month, Bread Stuy, a coffee house on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn, was padlocked by marshals because it owed back taxes; neighbors helped pay off a $10,000 penalty so it could reopen. 
 When the Pink Teacup, a soul-food fixture in the West Village for more than 50 years (''Take two pork chops at the Pink Teacup and call me in the morning,'' the Newsday critic Sylvia Carter once advised) was collapsing late last year, its fans raised money through social media. Then the filmmaker Lawrence Page agreed to buy it, and he plans to reopen it this spring. 
 In Rockefeller Center, Jerry's Barber Shop was about to close last month after 31 years when a customer -- David Rubin, a real estate lawyer -- volunteered to negotiate a better rent.
 At the other end of the economic food chain, shares were sold last year to rescue the chronically in-hock Vox Pop Cafe, a coffeehouse-art gallery-bookshop on Cortelyou Road in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, making it into a collective.
 Thanks to taxpayer-financed bailouts, big banks and insurance companies were spared the harshest judgment of the marketplace over the last 18 months, exempted under the doctrine of ''too big to fail.'' 
 On that scorecard, places like Bread Stuy and Vox Pop and Ray's would be doomed. Banks in; egg creams out. But when someone has been running a little business for 37 years, as Mr. Alvarez has, he can build up a big head of social momentum.
 One recent blustery night, Maria Musial stood behind the counter at Ray's, where she has worked since arriving from Elk, Poland, in the early 1980s. 
 ''When I came, he was nearly the only store on the block,'' Ms. Musial said. ''The squat people was here. Now it's young customers, new people.''
 A friend, Bozenna, chimed in.
 ''They don't like egg creams,'' Bozenna said.
 In rallying people, some of Mr. Alvarez's supporters have blamed his landlord, but the store's problems are far more complicated than his monthly rent of $3,500. 
 ''The landlord is not trying to throw him out,'' said Bob Arihood, a resident of the area who has been working for the last year to untangle Mr. Alvarez's chaotic financial life and who writes a blog called Neither More Nor Less. ''Ray's on a month-to-month arrangement. The landlord could have thrown him out any time he fell behind, but he doesn't want to do that.'' 
 Although he is 77 and paid Social Security taxes for decades, Mr. Alvarez has not yet drawn any benefits, because, he said, he immigrated from Turkey under a different name. 
 ''They told him to go to a hearing,'' Mr. Arihood said. ''Ray didn't go.'' Mr. Alvarez said that students from Cardozo Law School were working on that problem. Then he recited an impressive catalog of debts. ''The workers' comp insurance is the worst,'' he said, displaying a bill for $84,000 in back premiums.
 Another pressing matter is the vat of boiling oil that he uses to fry potatoes, his best-selling product. The shop has no grease hood and an inadequate exhaust system. ''The insurance company wants to cancel the policy,'' said Barbara Chupa, the building manager. ''But I've heard that Ray has someone willing to do the labor to put it in.''
 The equipment, Mr. Alvarez said, would cost about $20,000.
 His friends see injustice, not debt, and will fight. As the menu for the new delivery project says: ''How could we sit idly while Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks slowly killed everything we cherished about our community?'' 
 And there is a matter of loyalty to someone who was willing to cut kids a break on a plate of fries, said Arianna Gil: ''He's an icon of our childhood.''

HEADLINE: Experienced Hands, Still Valued

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WATERTOWN, Mass.
 IN 1999, Diane Hessan, a longtime marketing executive, secured venture capital for a tech start-up that turned out to be a bad idea.
 Her new company developed software that enabled corporate clients like Chase Manhattan to set up internal, online communities connecting, for example, Chase's human resources workers in offices all over the world. 
 ''We thought the Chase people would use it to share information, talk to each other, develop best practices,'' Ms. Hessan recalled. They didn't. ''At the end of one week, 7 people at Chase had used it,'' she said. ''At the end of two, 14.'' 
 Another client, Tom Brailsford, a market research director for Hallmark, said he doubted his Gold Crown store managers would use it, either, and Ms. Hessan had one of those moments that transforms a life. Instead of bluffing, she said: ''I'm worried, too.'' 
 The Hallmark man suggested an alternative -- using the software to create online communities of consumers that could give companies rapid feedback on their marketing campaigns and products.
 For Hallmark, Ms. Hessan created her first online focus group in December 2000, 150 mothers of young children.
 For Turtle Wax, she created an online focus group of 300 young men who hand-waxed their cars at least six times a year.
 Today, Communispace is booming, right through the Great Recession. One hundred corporate clients like Kraft, Hewlett-Packard, Best Buy and Colgate pay $25,000 a month for personally tailored online networks of consumers who participate in 10 research projects a month. 
 Starting with eight workers, the privately held company now has 260. In 2009, at the height of the recession, 60 were hired. This year, the plan is to hire 80 more. Revenues climbed to $36.8 million in 2009 from $7.7 million in 2005, according to Ms. Hessan, who says the success has actually been fueled by the recession. 
 ''This is a terrible time to be out of touch with customers,'' she said. ''No one wants to be the next Sharper Image, the next Krispy Kreme. No one wants a Jay Leno mess.''
 Recession? ''It feels like 2007 around here,'' said Jackie Wolin, a midlevel manager.
 That's why I traveled here. After writing so many gloomy columns about unemployment and what the downward wage spiral was doing to baby boomers, for my mental health I needed to be reminded of what a cutting edge, thriving company felt like and to see whether there was a place for boomers. Within a minute of my arriving, Charlotte Daher, 25, a marketing associate said, ''We just added this second floor last year, and it's almost filled to capacity.''
 It's also a company that pays a living wage. Communispace's core jobs -- the 104 community managers who oversee the online focus groups -- start at $40,000 fresh from college, with the most experienced approaching six-figure salaries.
 While Ms. Hessan, 55, the president, and several of the eight pioneering members are boomers, the workplace is dominated by tech-savvy 20- and 30-somethings.
 At 45, Ms. Wolin calls herself ''sort of old in this company.'' There are 40 boomers, but there are also 25 who are under 25. And the usual order at established companies -- top layers of management dominated by boomers -- is not so here; 38 employees who are 40 or over report to someone younger.
 Rocky Prozeller, 30, a six-year veteran and employee No. 24, (''I'm the millennial guru here'') was recently promoted from youngest senior community manager to youngest senior consultant. When he interviews job prospects, one of his standard questions is, ''Will you feel comfortable reporting to someone younger?''
 In the company's early years -- when the economy was strong, unemployment for boomers was under 4 percent and middle-aged people were less adept at social networking -- hires skewed young. But that's changed.
 ''It's intentional,'' Ms. Hessan said. ''Last year we had 6,500 applicants for 60 positions. We could hire 3,000 people in their 20s, but our clients don't want to just understand young people.''
 Jobs that were handled piecemeal, like proofreading, have required more experienced supervisors. ''In the early days we had a Jack/Jill of All Trades, and that person probably did proofreading, selling, operations and H.R.,'' Ms. Hessan said. ''As you grow, you just can't wing it anymore.''
 Last summer, Halley Suitt, 54, learned from Ms. Hessan's Twitter feed that the company was looking for a proofreader and came for an interview. 
 ''Diane told me she was going into client meetings with reports full of typos and errors and it was not O.K.,'' recalled Ms. Suitt. ''I came back to her. I said, 'You don't need a proofreader, you need a proofreading department.' ''
 Ms. Suitt, who has had a varied career that includes a master's in fine arts from Columbia, legal proofreading, a stint at LexisNexis, blogging, running her own Internet start-up and working as a personal trainer, has in six months built a department soon to hire its fourth person. 
 ''They hired me as the old-lady school marm,'' Ms. Suitt said. ''The company's growing up and needs the maturity we bring.''
 Two weeks ago, Kirstin Lynde, 48, who had run training and development programs at Digitas and Ropes & Gray, was hired to be an operations director. Her job is to build a system to match the right staff members to the right clients. Often as deadlines loom, teams overseeing new focus-group projects are cobbled together by grabbing available bodies. ''Kirstin's built systems,'' Ms. Hessan said. ''She has the seasoning and experience to get us to a new place.''
 Cindy Trish, 57, who has been with the company three years, was hired as a director of client services, the same position held by Liz Milligan, who is 32 and has been with the company six years. Ms. Trish understood this when she chose the job over four more lucrative offers. 
 ''It's the most junior role I've held in 20 years,'' said Ms. Trish, who's overseen a regional office for Research International and has run her own 20-person marketing firm.
 But she has loved being at a place with so many new people starting at the same time. ''We're all figuring this out together,'' she said. ''It's fun.'' And she's soon to live a dream. Communispace has opened a London office; in April, Ms. Trish will start there as a manager.
 Melanie Seaborn, a vice president who is 35, oversees many older workers, including Ms. Suitt, the proofreading supervisor. 
 ''At first I worried the older workers would be judge-y, because I'm so much younger,'' said Ms. Seaborn. ''Now, I've been doing it so long, I don't even feel it. My job is to recognize what everyone uniquely brings to the table, regardless of age.'' Of Ms. Suitt, she said: ''Halley figured things out herself. I let her do her thing -- that's a big thing with boomers.''
 Ms. Suitt wanders the cubicles, ever on the lookout for teachable moments. After the death of William Safire, the On Language columnist for The Times, she wrote a tribute on the Communispace Web site, calling him ''a five-star general on the rocky road to perfect punctuation and exquisite language.'' 
 On Tuesday, she held one of her Editorial Excellence workouts, on ''Top Ten Grammar Mistakes We Make.'' ''I'm not just here to proofread, I'm here to set a tone about writing,'' Ms. Suitt said, wagging her Associated Press stylebook for emphasis.

HEADLINE: LETTERS: Reining In the Swaps

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Gretchen Morgenson is right in calling on Washington to regulate credit default swaps, which were responsible for a good part of the financial crisis and are still being used with no controls (''It's Time for Swaps to Lose Their Swagger,'' Fair Game, Feb. 28). 
 The question is how best to regulate the swaps. As Ms. Morgenson notes, and as New York urged in 2008, the only practical, effective solution is a holistic one that only the federal government can provide. Credit default swaps must all be traded on an exchange, with transparency and strong reserve requirements.
 There are two benefits to reserve requirements. One, they ensure that the seller of the swap can pay up on its promise. Two, since they will increase the price of swaps, they will tend to limit their use to situations where they serve a real economic purpose.
 We cannot afford any more disruption in the financial markets. It's long past due that Washington act on credit default swaps.
 James Wrynn
 Manhattan, March 4

HEADLINE: New York Isn't Silicon Valley. That's Why They Like It.

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
THE two dozen or so people arranged around wooden tables, warming their hands and bellies with steaming mugs of coffee and plates of homemade biscuits, looked like just another Sunday brunch set in New York. But members of this group had braved knee-deep snow to gab about cutting-edge ideas and as they introduced themselves the roll call sounded like a Who's Who of digital start-ups: Foursquare, Hot Potato, Six Apart, Flickr, Flavorpill, Trust Art, Vimeo. 
 ''There's a lot happening right here in our ZIP code,'' said Dorothy McGivney, a former Google employee who is a co-coordinator of this group, the North Brooklyn Breakfast Club, and runs Jauntsetter, a travel site for women. Like the others, she had come to the brunch to help foster the growth of her little local community of entrepreneurs.
 The group had its inaugural meeting in January and is among a growing cluster of informal meet-and-greets for the local technology and media industries. A recent installment of another monthly event, called the New York Tech Meet-Up and held in Chelsea, drew 700 tech enthusiasts. 
 The buzz surrounding these gatherings is just the latest sign that a decade after the dot-com bust, the Internet economy in New York is springing back to life.
 ''After the crash, New York was a complete wasteland of dead funds and companies,'' says Charlie O'Donnell, an entrepreneur in residence at First Round Capital, which hired him recently when it opened a new office in Manhattan.
 Since then, ''the community has gelled,'' Mr. O'Donnell says. ''We now we have a critical mass of support and financing.''
 New York's flashier industries, including big media and Wall Street, have long dwarfed the tech sector here. And the dot-com implosion only reinforced that reality. The fledgling tech scene that was just beginning to hum in the late 1990s flatlined as dozens of Internet companies folded, pink slips replaced party invitations and venture capital firms took their investments elsewhere.
 During the dot-com boom, ''venture capitalists were just throwing dollars at every Internet idea on every street corner,'' says Owen Davis, a serial entrepreneur and managing director of NYC Seed, an early-stage technology investment fund. ''There was little critical judgment about business models and ideas.'' 
 Since then, Mr. Davis says, the New York technology industry has been steadily coming back on line and has managed to accelerate despite the economic turmoil besieging other industries. 
 Helping to give New York an edge is a broader shift in the types of innovation that are gathering speed in the technology industry, says Dale Jorgenson, an economics professor at Harvard. The infrastructure for mobile communications and computing is now all in place, he says, so the next opportunities lie in developing new services using that technology.
 ''They will be behind the next boom in the industry,'' he says.
 Of course, services can be developed anywhere. But because so many industries now grappling with the Internet are based in New York, the city is finding surer footing among its peers as a thriving tech hub.
 ''Book publishing, advertising, media and even the fashion industry are all located in New York. These are the main industries that are being reshaped and redefined by technology and the Internet,'' says AnnaLee Saxenian, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies regional economics and technology entrepreneurship. 
 To get a vivid snapshot of this new generation of Web innovation, one needs to look no further than the portfolio of Fred Wilson, co-founder of Union Square Ventures and a force within the New York start-up scene. Run through a list of Web darlings here -- Boxee, software that pipes video from the Internet to a television; Tumblr, a microblogging platform; and Foursquare, a mobile social network -- and Union Square is an investor. 
 ''The software business has morphed into the Internet business,'' Mr. Wilson says. ''Ten years ago, maybe 80 percent of software was being built for enterprise. Now, it's being written for consumers and is more media-centric than ever. And, historically, those have been New York's strongest sectors.''
 Champions for New York's continued evolution as a hotbed for digital innovation say that the proximity to industries ripe for innovation helps draw companies in those fields. 
 Kevin Ryan, former chief executive of the ad company DoubleClick and founder of Gilt Groupe, a Web site that offers discounted luxury goods, knows the importance of having prospective customers in his backyard. ''We need to be here because the people we're hiring are coming from Saks and Dolce & Gabbana, and they are all in New York,'' he said.
 To be sure, New York is not unseating its West Coast counterpart, notes Ms. Saxenian. ''Silicon Valley is always leading the cluster, but it goes through booms and busts like everywhere else.'' Nevertheless, she adds, ''this is a moment where New York really has the chance to shine.''
 HELPING to cultivate New York's revival, entrepreneurs and investors say, is the proliferation of early-stage investment firms, start-up incubators and the cadre of successful serial entrepreneurs choosing to set up shop within the five boroughs of the city. 
 Ben Lerer, a co-founder of Thrillist, a popular daily e-mail newsletter aimed at hip urban men, recently raised $7 million for an investment firm he runs with his father, Kenneth. The two men plan to make as many as 25 investments in tech start-ups this year, 80 percent of which will be in New York, they say.
 The elder Mr. Lerer is a co-founder of The Huffington Post. He also is an investor in Betaworks, an incubator housed in the meatpacking district that has helped nurture roughly 25 companies since it started in 2007, including the online tools Bit.ly and Tweetdeck.
 Adding to the momentum are cash infusions from noted venture capitalists based elsewhere. Ron Conway, a San Francisco financier who was one of the earliest investors in Google, Twitter, Facebook and Zappos, says his fund has 25 investments in New York that account for roughly 20 percent of his portfolio.
 ''Just a year ago, it was less than half that,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''New York has become a hotbed of innovation,'' he said. ''Many start-ups there have as much promise as the best start-ups here in Silicon Valley. And the ecosystem of entrepreneurs, engineers, investors and other players is growing at a pace similar to Silicon Valley when it first got started.''
 Another promising sign, experts say, is the number of companies in New York that have attracted investors. According to the National Venture Capital Association, 247 venture capital deals worth $1.4 billion closed in New York in 2009, despite the recession and rocky market.
 New York still ranks third behind Silicon Valley and Boston in the number of deals and overall investment rates, says Emily Mendell, the association's vice president for strategic affairs. ''But New York is holding its own against the other big hubs and possibly beginning to increase its share,'' she says.
 COLLEGES and universities have long helped fuel the dreams of entrepreneurs. An early pillar of Silicon Valley innovation was Stanford's dean of engineering, Frederick Terman, who viewed the university as an incubator for the electronics industry. More recently, Facebook was born in a Harvard student's dorm room and Google first percolated in the heads of two Stanford graduate students. 
 Hoping to replicate those kinds of successes, schools in New York are increasingly collaborating with local start-ups. Chris Wiggins, a professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University, regularly brings start-up founders to campus to speak to students about careers in technology and is establishing an internship program at the school. 
 NYC Seed works closely with the Polytechnic Institute of New York University to help students there translate promising ideas into profit-making ventures.
 Some of the more interesting breeding grounds in the city are technology incubators that nurture and mentor young companies. One example is the new Manhattan arm of Dogpatch Labs, which is backed by Polaris Venture Partners, an investment firm in the Boston area.
 Dogpatch, which opened in January, offers start-ups a place to work, rent-free, for several months, along with the possibility of securing an investment down the line. 
 Socks, crumpled pieces of paper, scribbled-upon white boards and empty beef jerky packages are scattered around Dogpatch's roomy office. ''It's been called a frat house for geeks,'' says Peter Flint, a partner at Polaris who spends several days each week in the New York office. 
 ''There is a lot of excitement and interest budding in New York,'' he says. ''And if we can help convince entrepreneurs to think about staying in New York versus going to Silicon Valley, then that's a huge win.'' 
 Currently, 13 companies are housed in the space, including Postling, the newest spawn of the founders and early employees of Etsy. Locals cite Etsy, an online shopping bazaar specializing in handmade crafts, as one of New York's shining start-up success stories, along with DoubleClick; TheLadders, a jobs search site; and the Gilt Groupe. 
 ''There wasn't anything like this in New York when Etsy started,'' said Chris Maguire, a co-founder of both Postling and Etsy. ''We worked out of our apartments for the first few years.''
 New York has historically lagged Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs and industry experts say, in the latticework of experienced mentors and deep-pocketed early-stage investors who help cultivate young entrepreneurs. 
 ''What we need in New York is our own PayPal mafia,'' says Caterina Fake, referring in jest to the band of early PayPal employees in Palo Alto who went on to found hugely successful ventures after the e-commerce business was sold to eBay in 2002. 
 ''YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, Slide,'' she says, ticking them off on her fingers. ''We need a big company to go public, throw off employees that start their own companies and create a self-propagating, thriving scene like that out here.'' 
 Ms. Fake helped found the photo-sharing site Flickr, which was later sold to Yahoo. Last summer, she and Chris Dixon co-founded Hunch, a recommendation service that helps users make decisions, like what kind of digital camera to buy or what kinds of dishes to make with Thanksgiving leftovers.
 Ms. Fake and Mr. Dixon seem determined to lay as much of that groundwork as they can. They've placed themselves as close as possible to the center of the New York tech reboot. The Hunch offices are in the Flatiron District, on the same street as several up-and-coming tech companies, including Pingg, an online invitation company, and LearnVest, a financial Web site for women.
 In addition to working on Hunch, Mr. Dixon has invested in a host of start-ups, including Skype, BillShrink and OMGpop, and is a founding partner in Founder Collective, a new $40 million investment fund for early-stage technology and media start-ups in New York. Ms. Fake is a member of Etsy's board.
 ''We're very incestuous,'' says Mr. Dixon with a wry laugh. ''We're definitely doing our part to get the ecosystem going.''
 He says the economic collapse that fractured the financial industry could help bring the New York technology sector back online. The dimming of Wall Street's halo, he explains, helps illuminate other career options, like those in the technology industry.
 ''We're helping save the next generation of college grads that would have gone over to Morgan Stanley,'' he says. 
 ''We're pulling them back from the dark side,'' jokes Ms. Fake.
 Mr. Ryan of the Gilt Groupe agrees that the local tech community can now tap a wider pool of talent than it could before. Mr. Ryan estimates that Gilt Groupe, which was founded in 2007, will generate $400 million to $500 million in revenue this year.
 ''It's gotten so much easier to hire people from the West Coast to come to New York, not necessarily because the city is better but because there are now other companies in New York to work for,'' Mr. Ryan says. ''You can make a 25-year bet at being in New York in a way you couldn't before.''
 Talented engineers and start-up hopefuls aren't the only ones being lured to New York.
 Scott Beale, a technology enthusiast who lived in San Francisco for nearly 20 years, says the ebullient spirit sweeping through the start-up scene in New York drew him to Manhattan. 
 Mr. Beale, who runs a Web hosting company as well as a tech and art blog called Laughing Squid, says the accessibility of the New York technology scene, tinged with the grass-roots feel of start-up culture, was reminiscent of the earlier days of Silicon Valley.
 ''I felt that things had plateaued in San Francisco,'' he says. ''There is more to explore and document on the East Coast.'' 
 DESPITE all the buzz, New York will never be able to match Silicon Valley in one crucial area: the weather. 
 It's a notion that Justin Schaffer, one of the organizers of the North Brooklyn Breakfast Club, and the founder of Hot Potato, chewed over as he pulled on a scarf and hat before heading back out into the blustery afternoon. 
 Jerking a thumb toward the window, he flashed a big grin and said, ''Maybe on a day like today, yeah, then I think I should be in San Francisco.'' Pondering that thought a moment, he said ''being here is a no-brainer.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption with an article last Sunday about the growth of Internet start-ups in New York City misattributed a quotation. It was Chris Dixon, a co-founder of the recommendation service Hunch, not Caterina Fake, another co-founder, who said, ''We are definitely doing our part to get the ecosystem going.'' And the article misspelled the surname of the founder of Hot Potato, a social networking start-up focused on live events. He is Justin Shaffer, not Schaffer.

HEADLINE: Amiable Tramp Drifting Through Postwar Japan

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
DO you have to be Japanese to appreciate Tora-san? Evidently not, since that amiable drifter, played by Kiyoshi Atsumi in 48 films (a record for most appearances by an actor in a single role) made between 1969 and 1995, has enough of a following in the West for an American distributor, the admirable independent company AnimEigo, in Wilmington, N.C., to begin issuing the Tora-san films on DVD. The first volume contains the first four features in the series: ''Tora-san, Our Lovable Tramp'' (1969), ''Tora-san's Cherished Mother'' (1969), ''Tora-san, His Tender Love'' (1970) and ''Tora-san's Grand Scheme'' (1970). 
 Like all AnimEigo releases, the Tora-san set comes with extensive supplementary material and color-coded subtitles that offer cultural notes -- brief explanations of customs, historical references or particularly recondite puns -- as well as translations of dialogue. But even with all this documentation it's not always easy for the Western viewer to understand what has made this modest figure so appealing to Japanese audiences and tightly bound to the national identity. 
 There's no exact Western corollary for Tora-san, an itinerant peddler and handyman who hails from a lower-middle-class neighborhood in Tokyo. There is something of Chaplin in his combination of broad physical comedy (some of it far more scatological than Western films of the early 1970s) and heart-tugging pathos (Tora-san has a bad habit of falling in love with women who, as the last reel comes around, turn out to regard him only as a dear friend). And there is something of Jacques Tati in Tora-san's eternal outsider status: the slightly old-fashioned misfit who will never adapt to modern ways of doing things. 
 But where Chaplin and Tati -- and most of the other great egoists of the Western comic tradition -- leave chaos in their wake, upsetting social structures and challenging authority, Tora-san is fundamentally concerned with maintaining order and continuity. He wants nothing more than to be an exemplary older brother to his half-sister Sakura (Chieko Baisho), and invariably proves to be a better matchmaker for others than for himself. He is a creator and protector of families, constantly reconciling quarreling husbands and wives or parents and children, at the expense of remaining alone and homeless himself. The Japanese title of the series, ''Otoko Wa Tsurai Yo,'' is usually translated as ''It's Tough Being a Man,'' which nicely summarizes its sense of ineluctable duty and ineffable sadness. 
 All but two of the 48 Tora-san movies were directed by Yoji Yamada, an extraordinarily prolific filmmaker (IMDB lists 110 titles in his filmography, both as a writer and a director) whose latest feature, ''About Her Brother,'' closed the recent Berlin Film Festival. Production at that pace requires a formula, and the Tora-san films wear theirs proudly: the plots are as predictable as were the annual appearance of two new episodes, one for the summer holidays and one for the New Year.
 The stories almost invariably begin with Tora ''unexpectedly'' returning from his travels to the neighborhood sweet shop owned by his cranky uncle (a role that absorbed three actors: Shin Morikawa, Tatsuo Matsumura and Masami Shimojo) and indulgent aunt (Chieko Mizaki). In his desire to help out, Tora concocts some well-meaning but ill-conceived scheme that ends by embarrassing his family. So he picks up his little brown suitcase and hits the road again, generally to some picturesque part of the country where he meets a beautiful woman in distress. (Known as Tora-san's Madonnas, these roles were played by a variety of actresses, a few of whom made return appearances.) Only when Tora-san has successfully bailed her out of her difficulties does he learn that she has been engaged to someone else all along. Philosophically, he picks up his bag and heads off for a new adventure.
 By the time the first four features were produced, the cozy urban neighborhoods and close-knit villages of the Tora-san films were already receding into a mythic past, if indeed they ever existed in the form the films imagine them. (A possible analogy might be with the ''Andy Hardy'' series produced by MGM in the 1930s and '40s, films set in a small town America more suggestive of the 19th century than the industrialized 20th.) 
 It's hard to reconcile this image of Japan with the fractured, predatory family of Nagisa Oshima's ''Boy'' (1969) or the violently alienated teenagers of Koji Wakamatsu's ''Go, Go, Second Time Virgin'' (1969), which of course is precisely the point. At a moment when Japanese society was experiencing a shake-up perhaps even more radical than the events of 1968 in the West, Tora-san was there to provide continuity with the past, reinforce family structures and social hierarchies, and paper over urban and rural divisions. 
 As Tora-san (an affectionate nickname: his full name is Torajiro Kuruma), Mr. Atsumi projects generosity, enthusiasm and a kind of arrested adolescence; his Hollywood counterpart might be the young Jack Oakie. Unmarried and unemployed (he's the antithesis of the Japanese ''salaryman''), Tora-san suffers the humiliations of eternal childhood but also enjoys its freedoms. In a strictly stratified society his is the privilege of mobility; he can go where he likes, when he likes. 
 The most enduring stars often embody a contradiction: the imperturbable man of violence (Gary Cooper), the insecure man-eater (Joan Crawford). Mr. Atsumi's Tora-san is the man who upholds tradition by living outside of it, who celebrates home by remaining homeless. He will never have the meaning for American audiences that he did for the Japanese. (Mr. Atsumi died in 1996, and Tora-san died with him.) But even at their most conventional and sentimental, his films have a universal poignancy. Tora-san needs to belong as much as he yearns to escape, a paradox by no means limited to the Japanese archipelago. (AnimEigo, $79.98, not rated)

HEADLINE: Old-Fashioned Bulwark In a Tide of Foreclosures

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
TO walk the streets of Brownsville and East New York, Brooklyn, is to see neighborhoods ravaged by foreclosure, homes boarded up and marshals' notices taped to doors. Yet in the midst of this pain sit several swaths of well-tended homes, about 3,000 in all, each with a driveway and statuary and garden. Not one of their owners has lost a home.
 Five miles away in Jamaica, Queens, another neighborhood hammered by foreclosures, there remain blocks where not one house has been put up for auction in the current crisis. 
 Stroll around Soundview in the Bronx, or Windsor Terrace and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and the pattern becomes clear. Of more than 60,000 New York homes built or rehabilitated by the city in partnership with nonprofit groups like Nehemiah and Neighborhood Housing Services over three decades, fewer than 1 percent have fallen into foreclosure. 
 It is a hidden-in-plain-sight success story: these alliances have sidestepped the plague of foreclosure by delivering homes to working-class families in a distinctly traditional manner. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development and nonprofit groups created sturdy, affordable homes. Counselors screened credit histories and required that applicants attend ownership classes, put cash down and obtain prime-loan mortgages.
 ''If you didn't have good credit, you were out -- it was old-fashioned,'' recalled Zandra Brockman, 52, who bought one of the Nehemiah homes in East New York for $68,500 in 1999. ''They didn't want to sell you a home and have you lose everything.'' 
 As Congress debates the causes of the nation's housing calamity, many Republicans have accused Democrats of promoting homeownership at any cost, pressuring banks and federal agencies to issue mortgages, no matter how exotic the lending terms or how shaky the applicants' finances. Even some advocates for moderate-income subsidized housing have acknowledged that ownership mania swept the country in the last 15 years. 
 In these New York neighborhoods, both liberal and some conservative analysts see a model for bringing low- and middle-income workers, many of them black and Latino, back into the housing market. 
 ''They have recapitulated the elements of healthy, working-class neighborhoods -- it's back to the future,'' said Howard Husock, a vice president for social research at the conservative Manhattan Institute. ''Learning to save and building up credit is a prelude to becoming a good homeowner.''
 In their aversion to risk, the city and the nonprofit groups have behaved like small-town bankers. They refuse to let pinched owners overextend with home-equity loans. And the city demands the right to review refinancing requests.
 ''One lady wrote a thousand letters to the mayor complaining about us,'' recalled Denise Scott, managing director of the New York office of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which has financed close to 400 subsidized one- to-four-family homes without a single foreclosure. ''We refused to accept her argument that she could own a house without showing us proof of income. Sorry.'' 
 A tally by the city's housing agency shows that of 20,614 such homes sold since 2004, only 13 have gone through foreclosure auctions. Among 3,900 Nehemiah homes built since the 1980s, organizers know of no foreclosures. ''We continue to see an almost nonexistent default rate,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, whose housing arm has helped finance tens of thousands of one-to-three-family homes. 
 This, despite the fact that the homes are mainly in neighborhoods like East New York, where lenders filed 1,051 foreclosure notices last year, or Jamaica, where 759 houses were scheduled for foreclosure auctions, according to the nonprofit Center for New York Neighborhoods. 
 While New York's commitment over several decades to producing hundreds of thousands of subsidized apartments and houses is without parallel in the nation, other cities have begun similar programs -- with similarly low foreclosure rates.
 Neighborhood Housing Services has produced tens of thousands of affordable homes, scattered among virtually all of the nation's large cities. The group that formed Nehemiah has also built 140 homes in Washington in the last few years. And Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit group based in Columbia, Md., has helped finance 15,000 to 20,000 homes for moderate-income buyers across the country. 
 ''Homeownership is not for everyone,'' said Mark McDermott, an Enterprise vice president. ''We require counseling and down payments -- we want homeowners to have some skin in the game.'' 
 Such housing requires a substantial infusion of public money.
 In East New York, the city donated hundreds of acres of public land to Nehemiah and provided some construction financing. Elsewhere, city officials and large nonprofit agencies extended construction and mortgage financing to thousands of families.
 In return, these projects often create neighborhoods where none have existed for decades, and they can be fiercely independent.
 Organizers at East Brooklyn Congregations declined a state agency's offer to provide low-interest loans for down payments in East New York. They preferred that each buyer scrape up the cash -- usually $7,000 to $12,000, including closing costs. (The first Nehemiah homes in the 1980s sold for about $39,000; more recently built ones have sold for up to $158,000.)
 ''We don't want people who view ownership as a 'mental rental,' '' an obligation too easily discarded, said Michael Gecan, a senior organizer for Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, which did much of the work that led to the Nehemiah homes. 
 New York officials never fell for the romance of homeownership. Sixty percent of city residents rent, compared with 40 percent in the rest of the nation. And that, said Rafael E. Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, allowed the city and nonprofit groups to be picky about who could buy a subsidized home. 
 ''We didn't have this drive to get every single person, no matter their income, no matter their credit, into a house,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We frown upon exotic mortgages.'' 
 Yet New York's nonprofit housing sector cannot stand sheltered from the national economic storm. Unemployment in the city stands at 10.4 percent, and nonprofit counselors report that more and more homeowners have lost their jobs and are at risk of losing their homes. Bank officials who have worked with the nonprofit groups have grown wary, and are reluctant to lend.
 For that reason, sales of new subsidized homes have slowed dramatically, and many stand vacant for months before selling. 
 And the credit scores of working-class New Yorkers have tumbled. Two decades ago, Mr. Gecan said, one in three applicants for a Nehemiah home had a credit score that qualified them for a mortgage; now, it is one in eight.
 None of this came as news to Ms. Brockman, a financial analyst who lives alone and stood at the door of her handsome modest home on Hinsdale Street in East New York. A harsh wind was blowing.
 ''You heard things these past years on TV and radio, where they say income doesn't matter, down payments don't matter,'' she said. ''You say to yourself, 'How could they sell them a home knowing the homeowner could not afford it?' '' 
 She shook her head and unfastened her gate. ''Nehemiah had no time for that here,'' she said. ''We wanted to build a community.''

HEADLINE: Mom, Apple Pie And Mortgages

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
FOR decades, the federal government has subsidized housing -- particularly owner-occupied housing. This has been especially true during the continuing financial crisis, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration propping up the housing market by issuing guarantees for investors on most new mortgages.
 But what is the long-term justification for putting taxpayers on the line to subsidize homeownership? Is this nothing more than a sacred cow in American society -- a political necessity because so many voters own homes and are mindful of their resale value? 
 In fact, there is much more to the history of subsidizing housing. While the crisis in the housing market shows that our current approach is far from perfect, there is a certain wisdom behind it, related not only to economic stimulus but also to the preservation of a sense of national identity. It's important to remember this as we consider re-engineering our institutions as the crisis ebbs. 
 Federal subsidies for housing essentially began in the Great Depression with, among other things, the creation of the F.H.A. in 1934 and Fannie Mae in 1938. It all started for a simple reason: more than a third of all the unemployed were identified, directly or indirectly, with the building trades. At the time, there seemed to be no way to reduce unemployment without stimulating housing, and much the same is true today. 
 But consider what will happen once the economy is again operating at full capacity. Basic economics tells us that when Americans, over all, spend more on housing, they must ultimately spend less on something else. Why should housing consumption be better than other consumption, or investments that people might choose?
 This time, the best answer isn't found in traditional economics but rather in American culture: a long-standing feeling that owning homes in healthy communities is connected to individual liberties that embody our national identity. Historically, homeownership has been associated with freedom, while renting -- often in tenements or mill villages -- has been linked to the oppression of a landlord.
 In his classic 1985 book, ''Crabgrass Frontier,'' Kenneth T. Jackson of Columbia University delineated the complex train of thought that over the last two centuries has produced the American belief that homeownership encourages pride and good citizenship and, ultimately, preservation of liberty. These attitudes are enduring.
 Back in 1899, in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class,'' Thorstein Veblen described homeownership, particularly of large and expensive dwellings, as ''conspicuous consumption.'' By that, he meant that it was undertaken substantially for the purpose of impressing others by showing the amount of money one can afford to waste on space one doesn't need.
 What is specifically American here -- though it's increasingly seen in other countries, too -- may be the modern sense of equal citizenship, engendered by the illusion that we can sustain conspicuous housing consumption even among a majority of the people. 
 In short, this all has a great deal to do with culture, and little to do with financial wisdom. After all, financial theory suggests that people should not own their own homes, at least not in the way that many do today. A cardinal tenet is that people should diversify -- meaning they shouldn't put nearly all of their financial eggs in one basket, which is what homeownership now means for so many people.
 American mortgage institutions encourage people to take a leveraged position in the real estate market, which is quite risky because home prices can and do decline, as we have learned so painfully. Leverage a risky investment 10 to 1 and you can expect trouble -- and we have plenty of it today. More than 16 million homeowners owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, according to Mark Zandi of Economy.com. 
 If we choose to keep subsidizing individual homeownership, we must also commit to adding safeguards so that homeowners are less financially vulnerable. Of course, that will require some creative finance. 
 But first, we should rethink the idea of renting, which could be a viable option for many more Americans and needn't endanger the traditional values of individual liberty and good citizenship. 
 Switzerland, for example, is a country with strong patriotism, a fighting spirit of national defense, a commitment to freedom and tolerance, and a low crime rate. Yet its homeownership rate is just 34.6 percent, versus 66.2 percent for the United States, according to the two countries' 2000 censuses. 
 Swiss national identity doesn't depend on homeownership. Instead, Riccarda Torriani, a historian at the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, links the country's sense of identity to such things as its system of direct democracy, which enforces popular participation in government; the idea that its citizens are frontier people (living in or near the rugged Alps); and a history of collective courage in defense of freedom, even when outnumbered. 
 BUT America isn't Switzerland. Our values and habits of thought are very different. Moreover, our homes are largely scattered in vast suburbs, often with distinct features. If many of these homes needed to be converted to rental units, home prices might well drop.
 A stock of apartment buildings in central cities, of course, makes rental management much easier. This is true in Switzerland, as well as in American cities like New York, which aren't typical of the rest of the United States. We need to consider a gradual transition toward new kinds of housing finance institutions -- entities that may lead us to a different kind of housing, yet preserve our core values. Although such innovation isn't likely to end subsidies, it should refocus them on enhancing the qualities of life that we really value. 
 We need to invent financial institutions that take into account the kinds of communities we want to build. And we need to base this innovation on an approach to economics that captures the richness of human experience -- and not on efficient-market economics, which disregards human psychology and assumes that our basic institutions are already perfect.

HEADLINE: Democrats Need a Rally Monkey

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
''Wake Up and Stand Up.'' So urges the bold motto of a seedling movement calling itself the Coffee Party, a leftish alternative to the Tea Party movement.
 But it's going to take more than a jolt of java, which so far amounts to not much more than a wishful exhortation, to energize the left. The buzz and the intensity for some months now have been on the right, led by Tea Partiers as they've zealously and methodically marched with plans for what Sarah Palin called ''another revolution'' come the fall elections.
 For Democrats paralyzed by their ''party of no'' counterparts and dissension in their own ranks -- and more recently, pecked by scandal -- the currents look much as they did for Republicans in the summer of 2006 or Democrats in the fall of 1994, when a swelling tide swept the other party into power.
 What would it take to get back the intensity Democrats had just a year ago? 
 Some say it can't be done.
 ''When a party's snakebit, it's really snakebit,'' said Charlie Cook, the independent political handicapper, who is predicting a thumpin' for Democrats in November. ''That happened to the Republicans in 2006 and to a certain extent in 2008, and it's true of Democrats now.''
 Others argue that Democrats can get their mojo back only if they understand why it disappeared in the first place.
 Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, noted that the energy behind Democrats in 2006 had been building for a year, beginning with anger over President George W. Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq war. ''The other side got demoralized as they watched our energy,'' Mr. Greenberg said. This time, ''our side is demoralized by the lack of progress. It's almost independent of the energy on the other side.''
 The Democrats have to do two things, he said. They have to show that they can govern successfully -- passing some version of health care reform would be his preference -- and then they have to frame the election as a choice for Democrats: ''Do you want to rally behind your leaders, or do you want to go back to the policies that got us into this trouble in the first place?''
 ''The energy comes in the choice,'' he said.
 Jonathan Alter, whose book ''The Promise: President Obama, Year One,'' comes out in May, goes along with that thinking. ''If the issue is framed right, you could have the intensity against the people who thwarted the will of the majority,'' he said.
 But first, Democrats will need to sharpen the argument that the president began to make in his State of the Union address: that it's not up to him alone.
 ''Obama had that line in his campaign, 'We are the ones we have been waiting for,' '' Mr. Alter said. ''But 'we' didn't show up.'' People believed it was enough to have Democrats controlling both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. They failed to understand that not every Democrat was a liberal, and got hung up on -- or turned off by -- party leaders' unwillingness to push things like the public option as part of health care reform.
 ''You had a damaging combination of sky-high expectations and a certain naivete about how politics really works,'' Mr. Alter said.
 Much of the calculation for November, however, depends on ''we'' showing up again.
 Polls suggest that the public is already on the president's side. In a New York Times/CBS News survey early last month, respondents were twice as likely to say that President Obama was trying to work with Republicans as they were to say that Republicans were trying to work with President Obama (62 percent versus 29 percent). And by overwhelming margins, they said they wanted both sides to compromise some positions ''in order to get things done.''
 Mr. Cook, though, says that for those snakebit Democrats, what might matter more is how the intensity on the right gets channeled.
 If, eight months from now, the Democrats defy his dire prediction and lose ''only'' four or five Senate seats and ''only'' 25 or 30 House seats -- not enough to lose the party its majority in either chamber -- ''it's not that unemployment dropped a point or two, it's not that people suddenly decided to like health care proposals they've disliked for a year,'' he said. In that case, ''my hunch is what happened is that Republicans nominated the wrong candidates.''
 This is where the Tea Party's role in the primaries is so crucial for Democrats. Do Tea Partiers push the Republicans to nominate conservatives who can't win in the general election? In the Senate races, Mr. Cook said, this could mean choosing Rand Paul over Trey Grayson in Kentucky; John Hostettler over Dan Coats in Indiana; or Ovide Lamontagne over Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire.
 ''If they nominate a whack job, their odds go way down,'' Mr. Cook said of Republicans.
 To rev up their own voters, the Democrats' best hope might just be that very intensity on the other side.
 ''The rhetoric from the right is so over the top, I think it does have the ability to create a reaction on the Democratic side,'' Mr. Greenberg said.
 According to that script, there will come a day when Ms. Palin asks, ''How's that hopey changey thing workin' out for ya?'' and Democrats feel strong enough to stand up and yell, ''Just fine, thanks!'' But therein lies another problem. Just what is the snappy retort to the kind of taunt Ms. Palin tosses at wary Democrats like so many upside-down horseshoes? The left has never been as good as the right when it comes to messaging. ''Wake up and stand up''? It's not bad, but it's no ''death panel.''
 ''The bigger problem,'' Mr. Alter said, ''is not finding a coherent message.'' He paraphrases how Senator Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat, describes the Democrats' problem promoting health care: ''Their bumper sticker is 'No'; our bumper sticker is a lot of words plus 'continued on the next bumper sticker.' ''
 In 2006, House Democrats ran against the ''culture of corruption.'' That's a little harder for them now, with Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York stepping down as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee pending the completion of an ethics investigation, and another member of the state's Democratic delegation, Eric J. Massa, resigning Friday after accusations that he sexually harassed a staff member. New revelations seem to weaken New York's Democratic governor, David A. Paterson, more each day. And this summer, with elections ever nearer, will bring the criminal trial of Rod Blagojevich, the Democrat deposed as Illinois governor after he allegedly tried to sell Mr. Obama's former Senate seat to the highest bidder.
 Robert B. Reich, who served as secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, took up the message drumbeat in a blog post last week called ''The Enthusiasm Gap.'' He argued that Democrats needed to counter the anti-big-government slogan coming from the Tea Party. Voters, he wrote, are just as angry at banks like Goldman Sachs and insurers like WellPoint. ''If there was ever a time to connect the dots and make the case for government as the singular means of protecting the public from these forces,'' he wrote, ''it is now.''
 There are other things Democrats can do to energize the base. Bringing up immigration reform, Mr. Alter says, tends to draw Hispanic voters on their behalf. Pushing the Employee Free Choice Act could rally labor. Republicans campaign against it as ''card check,'' but their voters don't tend to go to the polls on it.
 And even rancorous primaries -- like the ones for Senate in Colorado and Arkansas challenging the incumbents Michael Bennet and Blanche Lincoln -- can stoke voters (just ask the Democrats who came out in record numbers in 2008 -- if you can stir them).
 There are those who say that the Democrats' woes are overblown.
 ''The mistake people are making is reading into this Tea Party as some kind of pro-Republican thing,'' said Joe Trippi, the Democratic strategist behind the Howard Dean campaign in 2004. ''It's anti-establishment and anti-elite.''
 As President Obama himself noted, the energy that got him elected helped elect a Republican, Scott Brown, to a Massachusetts Senate seat held by a Kennedy for nearly 50 years. ''That same energy could knock out a lot of Republican incumbents who are doing cartwheels down K Street right now thinking that they are safe,'' Mr. Trippi said.
 In polls, Americans show more frustration with Republicans than Democrats. In the New York Times/CBS poll last month, 51 percent said they view the Democrats unfavorably, the highest since November 1994, when the Republicans swept into office. But 57 percent said they view the Republicans the same way, near the all-time high of 60 percent.
 Then there is that ever-important variable, time.
 In the scenario best for the Democrats, the Tea Party peaked with Mr. Brown's election, and Democrats have time to recover. ''We've had our '94 wake-up call,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''We may look back and say they played this out a year early.''
 It was just over a year ago that the CNBC correspondent Rick Santelli first used the words ''tea party'' in a rant that led to the nationwide protests. ''Think about how much mobilization there's been since then,'' Mr. Alter said.
 The number of Coffee Party fans on the social networking Web site Facebook went to 87,000 on Friday, from 27,000 on Monday. Mr. Alter notes that the Obama campaign still has 13 million e-mail addresses on its list -- more than any Tea Party group.
 And then there is the skeptical view, which, like Mr. Cook, sees only the mounting problems: stubborn unemployment, a paralyzed Washington, the drip-drip of scandal and high unfavorability ratings.
 ''There's more time for things to change,'' he said, ''but there's more time for things to snowball.''

HEADLINE: A Farewell to Europe? Not So Fast

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN 2008, during the worst of the financial crisis, portfolio diversification was of little help to stock investors as equity markets fell almost in lock step around the world.
 Today, it's a different story. For the first time since the global credit crisis, spreading one's bets across different geographic regions is proving worthwhile. For example, while European equities have fallen around 5 percent so far this year -- resulting from concerns over the ability of Greece, Portugal and other nations to manage their debt -- domestic shares and Japanese stocks have gained more than 2 percent. 
 But what should investors make of this? Should they continue to diversify their portfolios -- or simply reduce exposure to lackluster European equities? 
 It may be tempting to ditch European stocks. After all, Europe is expected to be one of the slowest-growing areas of the world in the next several years. (Its economy is expected to grow just 1 percent in 2010, compared with 3 percent for that of the United States.) 
 Moreover, stock markets in that region have become highly correlated with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, thanks to the increasingly interconnected global economy. That means European stocks aren't likely to zig when domestic stocks zag. 
 Nevertheless, many market strategists warn that jettisoning stocks from such a big chunk of the world, which represents more than a quarter of global stock market value, would be a big mistake.
 For starters, doing so now would simply be locking in losses that have already occurred. ''If you have extraordinary predictive capabilities and can see which regions will zig and which will zag, then yes, you don't have to be fully diversified,'' said Greg Schultz, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors, a financial planning firm in Walnut Creek, Calif. 
 But without that ability to see into the future, it's risky to make decisions by looking in the rear-view mirror, he said.
 What's more, as painful as it is to see some portion of your portfolio lose value, it's actually a good sign when different asset classes move in opposite directions. 
 ''I don't want everything I own to go up all at once, because it stands to reason that if everything goes up at the same time, then the reverse can be true and everything can lose value at once,'' said Mike Scarborough, president of Scarborough Capital Management, an investment advisory service in Annapolis, Md. 
 Remember that it wasn't so long ago that European shares helped keep investors' portfolios above water in a lousy decade for stocks. Between Dec. 31, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2009, when domestic shares were largely flat over all, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe index returned around 7 percent annually.
 While this trend has reversed this year, there are other ways that European equities can help diversify a portfolio.
 Betting on European stocks is a way to hedge one's currency exposure. To be sure, there's little appetite to bet on the euro now, after it has lost 6 percent of its value against the dollar since the start of the year. 
 But Mr. Schultz asks: ''Can you tell me that you really know for sure that the euro will be stronger or weaker a year from now? How many people saw this year's rally in the dollar coming?''
 And by diversifying their exposure to Europe, investors can mix up the way they earn their money. European stocks are currently paying among the highest yields in the world -- more than 3 percent, versus around 2 percent for the S.& P. 500 -- which means they generate a greater percentage of their overall returns through dividends.
 ''Dividends are as important a driver as price movement,'' said Alec B. Young, international equity strategist at Standard & Poor's. 
 Indeed, between Dec. 31, 1969, and the end of last year, domestic and European shares appreciated by nearly the same amount, but European stocks enjoyed a total cumulative return, including reinvested dividends, of 6,016 percent, versus 4,258 percent for domestic equities, according to S.& P. 
 Ben Inker, director of asset allocation at GMO, a money management firm in Boston, added that yet another reason ''you need Europe is that the valuation cycles are different.''
 In other words, European stocks and American equities are considered cheap at different times. For example, at the beginning of 2001, European equities were trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18, versus 25 for the S.& P. 500. Not surprisingly, European shares wound up outgaining domestic stocks, 53 percent to 11 percent, from 2001 through 2007. Similarly, in 1995, the S.& P. 500 was trading at a cheaper level, a P/E ratio of 16 versus 19 for European stocks, and wound up trouncing that region's market for a six-year stretch.
 After this most recent sell-off, Mr. Inker said, ''Europe is again cheaper.''
 ''The reason to have Europe in your portfolio is certainly not because there's any reason to expect its economy to do better than the U.S. economy,'' he added. ''It's because you're getting things at a discount compared to the U.S. And I like getting deals.''

HEADLINE: The Swaps That Swallowed Your Town

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AS more details surface about how derivatives helped Greece and perhaps other countries mask their debt loads, let's not forget that the wonders of these complex products aren't on display only overseas. Across our very own country, municipalities, school districts, sewer systems and other tax-exempt debt issuers are ensnared in the derivatives mess. 
 Like the credit default swaps that hid Greece's obligations, the instruments weighing on our municipalities were brought to us by the creative minds of Wall Street. The rocket scientists crafting the products got backup from swap advisers, a group of conflicted promoters who consulted municipalities and other issuers. Both of these camps peddled swaps as a way for tax-exempt debt issuers to reduce their financing costs.
 Now, however, the promised benefits of these swaps have mutated into enormous, and sometimes smothering, expenses. Making matters worse, issuers who want out of the arrangements -- swap contracts typically run for 30 years -- must pay up in order to escape. 
 That's right. Issuers are essentially paying twice for flawed deals that bestowed great riches on the bankers and advisers who sold them. Taxpayers should be outraged, but to be angry you have to be informed -- and few taxpayers may even know that the complicated arrangements exist. 
 Here's how municipal swaps worked (in theory): Say an issuer needed to raise money and prevailing rates for fixed-rate debt were 5 percent. A swap allowed issuers to reduce the interest rate they paid on their debt to, say, 4.5 percent, while still paying what was effectively a fixed rate. 
 Nothing wrong with that, right? 
 Sales presentations for these instruments, no surprise, accentuated the positives in them. ''Derivative products are unique in the history of financial innovation,'' gushed a pitch from Citigroup in November 2007 about a deal entered into by the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority. Another selling point: ''Swaps have become widely accepted by the rating agencies as an appropriate financial tool.'' And, the presentation said, they can be easily unwound (for a fee, of course).
 But these arrangements were riddled with risks, as issuers are finding out. The swaps were structured to generate a stream of income to the issuer -- like your hometown -- that was tethered to a variable interest rate. Variable rates can rise or fall wildly if economic circumstances change. Banks that executed the swaps received fixed payments from the issuers. 
 The contracts, however, assumed that economic and financial circumstances would be relatively stable and that interest rates used in the deals would stay in a narrow range. The exact opposite occurred: the financial system went into a tailspin two years ago, and rates plummeted. The auction-rate securities market, used by issuers to set their interest payments to bondholders, froze up. As a result, these rates rose.
 For municipalities, that meant they were stuck with contracts that forced them to pay out a much higher interest rate than they were receiving in return. Sure, the rate plunge was unforeseen, but it was not an impossibility. And the impact of such a possible decline was rarely highlighted in sales presentations, municipal experts say. 
 Another aspect to these swaps' designs made them especially ill-suited for municipal issuers. Almost all tax-exempt debt is structured so that after 10 years, it can be called or retired by the city, school district or highway authority that floated it. But by locking in the swap for 30 years, the municipality or school district is essentially giving up the option to call its debt and issue lower-cost bonds, without penalty, if interest rates have declined. 
 Imagine a homeowner who has a mortgage allowing her to refinance without a penalty if interest rates drop, as many do. Then she inexplicably agrees to give up that opportunity and not be compensated for doing so. Well, some towns did exactly that when they signed derivatives contracts that locked them in for 30 years.
 Then there are the counterparty risks associated with municipal swaps. If the banks in the midst of these deals falter, the municipality is at peril, because getting out of a contract with a failed bank is also costly. For example, closing out swaps in which Lehman Brothers was the counterparty cost various New York State debt issuers $12 million, according to state filings. 
 Termination fees also kick in when a municipal issuer wants out of its swap agreement. They can be significant. 
 New York State provides a good example. An Oct. 30, 2009, filing describing its swaps shows that for the most recent fiscal year, April 2008 to March 2009, the state paid $103 million to terminate roughly $2 billion worth of swaps -- more than a quarter of which resulted from the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008.
 (You can find this report online at bit.ly/cS8ZFV.)
 As of Nov. 30, 2009, New York had $3.74 billion worth of swaps outstanding. Even so, New York doesn't have as much of a problem with swaps as other jurisdictions. Still, New York could have spent that $103 million on many other things that the state needs. 
 The prime example, of course, of a swap-imperiled issuer is Jefferson County, Ala. Its swaps were supposed to lower the county's costs, but instead they wound up increasing its indebtedness. Groaning under a $3 billion debt load, the county is facing the possibility of bankruptcy. 
 Critics of swaps hope that increased taxpayer awareness of these souring deals will force municipalities to think twice. ''When municipalities enter into these swaps they end up paying more and receiving much less,'' said Andy Kalotay, an expert in fixed income.
 Why is that? One reason, Mr. Kalotay said, is the use of swap advisers. 
 ''The basic problem is the swap adviser gets paid only if there is a transaction -- an unbelievable conflict of interest,'' he said. ''It's the adviser who is supposed to protect you, but the swap adviser has a vested interest in seeing something happen.'' 
 WHAT is especially maddening to many in the municipal securities market is that issuers are now relying on the same investment banks that put them into swaps-embedded debt to restructure their obligations. According to those who travel this world, issuers are afraid to upset their relationships with their bankers and are not holding them accountable for placing them in these costly trades. 
 ''We need transparency where Wall Street discloses not only the risks but also calculates the potential costs associated with those risks,'' said Joseph Fichera, chief executive at Saber Partners, an advisory firm. ''If you just ask issuers to disclose, even in a footnote, the maximum possible loss or gain from the swap they probably wouldn't do it. And if they did that, then investors and taxpayers would know what the risks are, in plain English.'' 
 Mr. Fichera is right. At this intersection of two huge and extremely opaque arenas -- the municipal debt market and derivatives trading -- sunlight is sorely needed.

HEADLINE: With Turturro, Italy Knows No Bounds

BYLINE: By FRANZ LIDZ

DATELINE: Milan 

 BODY:
 FROM a stony redoubt on a stage in the Piccolo Teatro Strehler, John Turturro smiles faintly and presses the palms of his hands together between his knees. Mr. Turturro -- born in Queens, living in Brooklyn -- is playing an unscrupulous innkeeper in ''Fiabe italiane'' (''Italian Folk Tales''), a powerfully imagined parable he also directs and has freely adapted from fables collected by Italo Calvino, Giambattista Basile and Giuseppe Pitre. 
 Mr. Turturro studies a fool (Max Casella) who has just arrived at the inn with a magical donkey. The fool asks him to give the beast food and fresh water and cautions him not to say ''ass dump'' in its presence.
 Though the innkeeper instructs his wife not to utter the phrase, she blurts it out anyway, causing the donkey to bray, raise its tail and shower the ground with jewels. 
 While upbraiding her for repeating the incantation, the innkeeper repeats it himself. Which prompts a second cascade.
 ''O.K., everyone!'' says the fool, at which point he invokes the magical words. Presto: Another shimmering load.
 The donkey dung scene derives from Basile's ''Racconto dell'Orco'' and ''Ari-ari, Ciuco Mio, Butta Danari!,'' No. 127 of the 200 yarns in Calvino's popular folklore anthology, published in 1956. In the book's introduction, Calvino quotes a Tuscan proverb: ''The tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it.''
 Mr. Turturro, a veteran of dozens of Off Broadway plays and scores of Hollywood movies, added elements that would not be out of place in commedia dell'arte, the ancient Italian improv theater. His production, which last month concluded a sold-out tour of Turin, Naples and Milan, featured minstrels, two overlapping stories, layers of language (English, Italian, Western Lombardian, Sicilian, Neapolitan, Piedmontese, Abruzzese) and characters blissfully free of self-consciousness.
 Bathed in a palette of unlikely yet sumptuous color combinations, ogresses posed as lovely maidens, ghouls vanished into enchanted sacks, and princes sprang from giant talking crabs. As often happens in tales of transformation, power is eventually tempered with responsibility, and the cruel realities of existence cede to purity, virtue and rectitude.
 ''Calvino said that folk tales are a general representation of life,'' Mr. Turturro, 53, said over plates of osso bucco and risotto Milanese at a trattoria near the Duomo. ''I find the economy and beauty of these stories quite irresistible. They're full of grace and humility and reflect an Italy without borders, an Italy more of a continent.''
 Like one of Mr. Turturro's favorite films, Vittorio De Sica's neo-Realist fairy tale ''Miracle in Milan'' (1951), the stories wed fantasy to the everyday. ''They're the naive tales of peasants trying to make sense of their lives,'' he said. ''They attempt to give hope to those who have none.'' And despite their age, the fables remain remarkably fresh. ''Bernie Madoff -- greedy, irresponsible, only out for himself -- is an echo of some of the tricksters and deceivers,'' he said.
 Mr. Turturro grows lyrical discussing the ''continuous quiver of love'' that runs through the stories. He loves Italy with a passion that perhaps only the children of immigrants are capable of. ''Many great Italian authors have never even been translated into English,'' he lamented. ''In the United States being of Italian descent is not a broadening experience. It's narrowing, in that you're rarely exposed to the depth and diversity of Italian culture. American culture is so flattened. I'm not so interested in being made into a pancake anymore.''
 He is interested in having his production of ''Italian Folk Tales'' restaged in a New York theater, however. ''It would be nice to present this aspect of Italy that isn't seen very often in the states,'' he said. 
 The play is just the latest expedition in Mr. Turturro's midlife exploration of his ancestral land. The journey began in 1986 during the filming of ''The Sicilian,'' Michael Cimino's murky meditation on the life of the notorious outlaw Salvatore Giuliano. ''I had studied Italian for three months,'' Mr. Turturro recalled, ''and when I got to Sicily, I was completely lost.''
 A half century ago Mr. Giuliano was the subject of a groundbreaking piece of political filmmaking by Francesco Rosi, the acclaimed Neapolitan director. Mr. Rosi was so taken by Mr. Turturro's turn as a throttled playwright in the Coen brothers' ''Barton Fink'' (1991) that he asked him to play the lead in ''La Tregua'' (''The Truce'').
 ''The film is ironic and grotesque,'' Mr. Rosi told him, ''and I feel you have both.'' Six years in the making, ''La Tregua'' was based on Primo Levi's account of his postwar odyssey back to Turin from Auschwitz.
 Mr. Rosi, in turn, gave Mr. Turturro a translation of Eduardo De Filippo's sentimental comedy ''Questi Fantasmi.'' In 2005 Mr. Turturro brought the play -- retitled ''Souls of Naples'' and directed by Roman Paska -- to New York and Naples. He has since written a screenplay and is on track to direct and act in an English-language feature, which is being produced by Domenico Procacci, who also produced ''Gomorrah.'' 
 Mr. Turturro is in the midst of editing ''Passione,'' a documentary on Neapolitan song that's reminiscent of ''Buena Vista Social Club.'' He calls the movie an endless jukebox of past and present-day musicians.
 Last September another documentary he appears in and helped produce, ''Rehearsal for a Sicilian Tragedy,'' had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival. ''Rehearsal,'' also directed by Mr. Paska, is a Pirandello-esque film within a film that examines the island's rich history of puppetry, ponders the Sicilian preoccupation with death and follows Mr. Turturro to the home of his maternal grandmother in Aragona. At the convent across the street he launches into an impromptu duet with a nun, who like his father, who died in 1988, is from the Apulia region of southeastern Italy.
 He remembers his parents, Katherine and Nicholas, as splendid raconteurs with a fund of stories that seemed bottomless and memories that seemed infinite. ''My mother was dry and precise and could hold your attention for hours with details that were sometimes shocking, sometimes funny,'' he said. ''My father liked to exaggerate and embellish and push an anecdote to its limits. He never told jokes. He didn't like jokes. I don't, either. I prefer revealing stories that make me laugh.''
 ''Italian Folk Tales'' has amused him since 1981, when he was given a copy by his future wife, Katherine Borowitz. They had met at Yale Drama School, and the book was her first gift to him. The inscription: ''For John. To adapt or just to read. Kathie.''
 In 2007 Mr. Turturro, trolling for a play to mount in Naples, was encouraged by Ms. Borowitz to rework the classic tales. They collaborated on the script with Mr. Casella and Carl Capotorto, the author of the recent memoir ''Twisted Head.'' (Mr. Turturro later learned that in the early 1980s, Mr. Calvino and fellow fabulist Federico Fellini had talked about distilling the fables into a film about prophetic dreams. Alas, Mr. Calvino died in 1985 and the project never got off the ground.)
 To stage ''Italian Folk Tales,'' Mr. Turturro enlisted the aid of the Teatro Stabile di Torino and obtained the permission of Mr. Calvino's widow, Chiquita. As it turned out,Ms. Calvino, a genial and youthful octogenarian, had loved his comic turn as a pedophile bowler in ''The Big Lebowski.'' Casting was a family affair: among the American actors in the troupe, Ms. Borowitz, the couple's 9-year-old son Diego and Mr. Turturro's cousin Aida Turturro all juggled multiple roles. 
 One of Mr. Turturro's biggest technical questions involved the magical donkey. Dare he trust a mechanical one? Fortunately a crew member from Sicily who had grown up with mules volunteered to wear a donkey suit. And rather than raining actual jewels on the set, Mr. Turturro opted for a beam of green flickering light. ''It's cool,'' told young Diego. ''But you have to use your imagination.''

HEADLINE: LETTERS: An Airwave Auction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Buried Treasure in Your TV Dial'' (Economic View, Feb. 28), in which Richard H. Thaler cites an estimate that the government could reap $100 billion by auctioning the portion of the radio spectrum used for over-the-air television: 
 How long would such a sum last, however, in an era of military adventures and over 700 foreign military bases? What would be permanent is the loss of both choice and the free reception of radio and television programming. Ownership of electronic media, and access to the privatized airwaves, would be as concentrated as cable and satellite systems are today.
 The column says that such an auction would have many national benefits. But virtually all them, like faster broadband connections for schools, could be obtained by federal policy, not a fire sale. Lawrence Budner
 Manhattan, March 1
 To the Editor:
 When cable or satellite television goes down because of a technical issue, the weather or some other local or systemic problem (like a contract dispute between a network and cable provider) over-the-air broadcasting instantly switches from so-called obsolete status to a simple, brilliant idea -- and a lifeline to the outside world. 
 I, for one, would not be without a rooftop antenna, both as emergency backup and for times when I want the absolute best in HDTV picture quality and sound from broadcast sources. A sale of this lifeline may make economic sense, but adding a backup roof antenna makes more sense. Money isn't everything.

HEADLINE: Talking to a Graffiti Artist: From the Street to the Museum

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Each week on the City Room blog, editors select a New Yorker to answer reader questions. Here are excerpts from last week's Q. and A. with Lee Quinones, a graffiti artist born in Ponce, P.R., in 1960 and raised on New York's Lower East Side. 
 Next week, Jack Nyman, a professor at Baruch College, will take questions about the development, economics and future of the Gowanus Canal.Q. What does it feel like to be honored by a show like ''How to Make It in America,'' even though some people would argue that your canvases are slightly unethical? Mike L. 
 A. It felt great to work alongside a host of talented characters representing the hustle and bustle of New York's center stage. The HBO series ''How to Make It in America'' aligns itself with the daily grind of elated breakthroughs and fallbacks that reflect life itself, but it also strives to achieve authenticity, relying on New York's iconic symbols and personalities. They approached me to deliver a dynamic piece that moves -- the truck driven by Luis Guzman's character -- even when it is standing still.
 Unethical? ''Unorthobox'' is my own slang to describe how my work has made its transition to canvas and helped preserve one of the most important American-led movements -- rapid enamelism. Originally, my work reconfigured how art should be presented, using the public space. Now that the early public works were inevitably eradicated from review, something has to survive to cement the movement. What mattered all along to me was the message, the expression and reaching an audience -- what most artists crave. My canvas work as well as my earlier public works have always been and still are well thought out to achieve some kind of conversation with the viewer. 
 Q. With the growing popularity of street art -- whether wheatpastes, figure-based painting or site-specific sculpture -- do you think graffiti's time has passed? Katie
 A. Under the circumstances of the time, I think that the earlier works staged a great show that would be a tough act to follow (literally). Trains were always moving away and keeping the viewer perplexed, making for great, romantic mystery. Now artists have to focus on the fact that their work will be subjected to scrutiny by a broader and critical circle of observers. As it's been suggested to me: Learn how to suffer with your own identity.
 Q. Is it still graffiti if you get paid for it? Or if you don't have to worry about running from the cops? BETNYC
 A. The transition was a long and difficult path for me. The romance I had with anonymous night painting was at odds with the critical aspects of formal studio painting -- and both stared me in the face, after I had my first major exhibition in 1979 in Rome until 1984, when I finally cut my ties with the IRT No. 5. An emotional hard place and a rock for sure it was. 
 One comfort I have while painting in the studio is that the subject matter contains a dynamic rhythm or attitude that has bled over from the train works. It's always self-evident in the under painting, which has made the transition more forgiving. 
 Q. How much have you spent in actual jail time?Perley J. Thibodeau
 A. I've never been to jail. 
 Q. When someone scrawls their name onto a mailbox or stop sign, or scratches their initials into a store window, do you consider that to be art? If someone vandalized your front door or car by putting their tag on it, how would you feel? Julie
 A. I do not advocate senseless scrawling, scratching and tagging as representative of the art form itself. Everything has its beginnings, some humble and some in the rumble. It just depends how and when you take it from where it has been. I do understand hopelessness and confusion in society. 
 Q. Where do you live? I'm sure you won't mind if we come to your house and paint all over your walls ... it's cool, right? Nolane
 A. Sure, you can come over any time with some great art and interior design my home walls to hang along the likes of Futura, Basquiat, Haze, Swoon, Os Gemeos, Martin Wong and others.
 Q. So everyone starts to ask the ''vandal'' questions, the ''public property'' questions, typical. My question for you is, have you thought about writing an autobiography? What is your view on graffiti as a component of expression versus outlaw art? Bonafide Rojas
 A. I have been writing my memoirs and collecting photos for a bio book since 1979. It is a large feat to cover that I did not realize back then, but it is coming together.
 I don't see graffiti as outlaw art, but I do see it as a form of self-expression. Just go back to 79 A.D. Pompei and see the love and political triangles that were scratched onto the mud-walled alleys throughout the whole city. Graffiti artists practice their work with due diligence focusing on such elements as letter construction, deconstruction and visual commentary. As they perform their tasks repeatedly, they refine their skills, and new discoveries and exchanges in art become feasible.
 Q. Mr. Quinones, in your mind, what constitutes art?Casey
 A. ''Silent Thunder''!
 Q. Do you think your 1982 ''Allen Boys'' piece should have been preserved? Anna
 A. The ''Allen Boys'' mural was the last standing mural in Manhattan from the early '80s, but I think that the handball wall murals in the schoolyard of Corlears Junior High School 56 on Madison Street should have also been preserved. ''Howard the Duck'' (1978) and the ''Lion's Den'' (1980) were entirely spray-painted murals -- essentially the first large standing pieces of street art, measuring 30 feet by 25 feet. ''Howard the Duck'' was illegal, the first of its kind, and it also spearheaded my fine arts career above ground. Due to the positive outpouring of kudos in the community, the school principal gave me a handwritten permission slip to complete the second side of the handball wall in 1980 with the ''Lion's Den.''

HEADLINE: Getting Older Without Getting Old

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FACEBOOK now has more than 400 million active users, up from only 50 million as recently as 2007. If social networking still resembled a young, hip downtown nightclub scene -- one day a site is hot, the next it's not -- we might expect the crowds to decamp soon. Facebook would become another Friendster, still around but ghostly, forgotten by most.
 Facebook, however, isn't likely to have such a fate. For one thing, it has attracted many ''olds,'' and they tend to stay put. (Consider AOL.) More than 50 percent of Facebook's members in the United States are 35 or older, and only 26.8 percent are 24 or under, according to an analysis of December visitors by comScore Media Metrix. 
 More than demographic stability favors Facebook. The site has shrewdly emulated the ''network effects'' strategy used by another brand that has long held a dominant position in the computer industry: Microsoft Windows. 
 Economists use the term network effects to refer to the way the value of a product or service increases in tandem with the number of people who use it. If you're one of only 10 people in the world with an e-mail account, its usefulness is limited; add a billion more, and the practical value of yours increases apace. 
 A Facebook member enjoys immediate benefits when each friend joins -- these are direct network effects. But the average user already has 130 friends, so unless the user is unusually gregarious, the direct effects won't increase drastically beyond a certain point.
 For an individual member, the most powerful network effects may be indirect ones that come from the huge number of unknown other people in the Facebook world. Their mass attracts, in turn, suppliers of complementary products and services. 
 For Windows, the enormous installed base attracted third-party software developers, which in turn drew more users. Apple's iPhone has had a similar virtuous cycle. So, too, on Facebook, developers of applications like FamilyLink, Marketplace and iLike's Music create a software universe with seemingly infinite choices. And that attracts more users -- and still more developers. 
 Facebook's decision to open its site to outside developers in May 2007 was a ''transformative moment,'' said Charlene Li,founder of the Altimeter Group, a strategy consulting firm. 
 ''Because Facebook allows developers on their site, the people who would have developed the next social networking site are now working with Facebook,'' she said.
 Nick O'Neill, founder of AllFacebook.com, a site with Facebook-related news and statistics, said, ''Games are the killer app for Facebook.'' Because of their social nature, popular Facebook games produce direct network effects. The dedicated farmers of the FarmVille game -- it attracts 83 million users a month -- nudge friends to play and become virtual neighbors, enhancing their own game experience. (That pull gives Facebook an advantage Windows lacked; its signature game was Solitaire.) 
 Businesses, nonprofits, government offices and celebrities use Facebook pages to disseminate information, thus forming an ever-growing simulacrum of the Web within Facebook's walls. Network effects are at work here, too: users attract well-known names, which, in turn, draw more users to Facebook. 
 The White House, for example, has its own Facebook page, one of three million active pages that have an aggregate of 5.3 billion fans, the company says.
 Facebook members in the United States, on average, spent more than seven hours on the site in January, according to the Nielsen Company. That is more than three times the average time spent on Google's Web sites. Facebook's average number of minutes per visitor grew almost 10 percent from the previous month, while the average at sites for every other company in the top 10 fell -- Google, by 14.3 percent; Yahoo, 27 percent; and Microsoft, 26.9 percent. 
 Google does not reap the benefits of significant network effects because its search algorithms are centered on the analysis of links, and operate essentially the same way whether one person or six billion are using it. Google has tried to add new services as quickly as it can -- or more quickly than it is ready to, as shown by the less-than-smooth introduction last month of Buzz, which gives Gmail some social network features. 
 Network effects, if powerful enough, can push a platform past the tipping point, accelerating its growth. ''As the Windows example shows, once a market with network effects tips to one dominant platform, then it is very hard to tip back,'' said Andrei Hagiu, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. 
 But network effects alone don't necessarily produce tipping, he cautioned. Users must also perceive a high switching cost --in this case, in time and inconvenience -- if they were to move to another social networking site. 
 Facebook increasingly makes it easy for its members to remain loyal. Outside sites can become Facebook Connect partners, offering visitors the ability to log on with their Facebook username and continue to interact with their Facebook friends even when they aren't at the Facebook site. More than 60 million Facebook members use Facebook Connect each month, the company says.
 YET Facebook Connect introduces a strategic risk for the company. As its adoption spreads, Facebook members may spend less time at the home site, with possibly negative implications for Facebook's business model. The company says that more than half its users now log on to Facebook daily. But that share might drop significantly as more outside sites incorporate Facebook Connect.
 ''It could turn out that taking your network with you is more powerful than having all of the activity around your network happening in a central place,'' said Noah Brier, head of strategic planning at the Barbarian Group, a digital marketing firm. 
 Industry watchers constantly scan the horizon for a challenger that could displace Facebook, and Mr. Brier thinks he has a sighting: ''Who will be the next Facebook?'' he asks. ''Facebook Connect.''

HEADLINE: Help for First-Time Buyers

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
LOOKING for a fixed-rate mortgage with a competitively low interest rate, but armed with only 3 percent for a down payment, a low credit score and a modest annual income? 
 Thanks to an infusion of federal support late last year through the economic stimulus package, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, or Sonyma, is now offering 30-year affordable-housing loans at 4.75 percent, down from an average rate of 5.25 to 5.75 percent last year and well below the 5 percent or so being offered by mainstream lenders to their best customers. 
 The program is for first-time buyers, though buyers who have not owned a home in the last three years would also qualify. 
 Connecticut, too, has dropped its rates on a similar mortgage program for first-time buyers, while New Jersey plans to lower its rates this spring. 
 George Leocata, a senior vice president at Sonyma, says demand for the Low Interest Rate Program has been the highest in 12 years, which is hardly surprising given the difficulty in qualifying for conventional loans in recent months. 
 In sharp contrast to all the mortgages out there with stiff underwriting guidelines, New York's Low Interest Rate mortgages have no minimum credit score. Borrowers can also qualify for a Sonyma mortgage if their total monthly debt payments reach 45 percent of their monthly income -- and sometimes more. That's about 5 percent higher than the amount allowed by conventional lenders, and higher than the threshold recommended by many financial counselors.
 Still, Mr. Leocata maintains that borrowers default on these loans less frequently than those with conventional mortgages. Borrowers must pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums. For a 3 percent down payment, the monthly premium is 0.8 percent of the loan amount; for 5 percent, it's 0.67 percent; and for 10 percent, 0.42 percent.
 Borrowers must also fall within the household income limits -- $107,520 in Manhattan, $142,520 in Long Island and $146,420 in Westchester -- and the purchase price cannot exceed $637,640.
 Few brokers offer the mortgages, because lenders must split New York's commission payment with brokers, so interested borrowers should contact lenders directly. The major banks and many regional banks participate in the program.
 Mr. Leocata says mortgage rates in this program will most likely rise, if interest rates on conventional mortgages rise (as is widely expected). But he also says the program's rates will probably remain about half a percentage point lower than the rest of the market.
 Meanwhile, Jerry Keelen, the director of single-family programs at the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, said that in early April the state would probably begin offering mortgages for first-time buyers in the range of 5 percent, versus the program's current rates of 5.75 percent.
 Most loans in the program with down payments of less than 20 percent are insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and as such, are subject to F.H.A.'s mortgage insurance premiums. Income limits and home-price limits apply. Most borrowers, Mr. Keelen said, also qualify for an average of $7,500 in down payment and closing cost assistance.
 The first-time homebuyer program in Connecticut has the lowest rates, at 4.375 percent. 
 Carol DeRosa, the administrator of residential mortgage programs at Connecticut's Housing Finance Authority, said that as with the affordable-housing programs of other states, borrowers need not be first-time buyers if the home they want to buy is in federally targeted urban areas like Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk.
 Even in areas where borrowers must meet the first-time-buyer qualifications, though, Ms. DeRosa says demand for these mortgages has been strong.
 She said lower values were ''creating good buying opportunities.''

HEADLINE: Optics

BYLINE: By BEN ZIMMER. 
Ben Zimmer is executive producer of visualthesaurus.com.

 BODY:
When President Obama responded to the failed Christmas airliner bombing while on vacation in his native state of Hawaii, some Republicans claimed it was ''bad optics.'' ''Hawaii to many Americans seems like a foreign place,'' the Republican strategist Kevin Madden told CNN. ''And I think those images, the optics, hurt President Obama very badly.''
 A month later, the shoe was on the other foot when the Republican National Committee held its winter meeting in, yes, Hawaii. Then it was the party's chairman, Michael Steele, who had to answer questions about the ''optics'' of gathering the party faithful at a beachfront resort in Waikiki. 
 How did optics achieve buzzword status in American politics? In his final On Language column last September, William Safire noted the trend: '' 'Optics' is hot, rivaling content.'' When politicians fret about the public perception of a decision more than the substance of the decision itself, we're living in a world of optics. Of course, elected officials have worried about outward appearances since time immemorial, but optics puts a new spin on things, giving a scientific-sounding gloss to P.R. and image-making.
 Though the metaphorical expansion of optics into the political arena feels novel, it has actually been brewing for a few decades. On May 31, 1978, The Wall Street Journal quoted Jimmy Carter's special counselor on inflation, Robert Strauss, as saying that business leaders who went along with Carter's anti-inflation measures might be invited to the White House as a token of appreciation. ''It would be a nice optical step,'' Strauss said. The Journal was not impressed by the idea: the following day, an editorial rebuffed Strauss's overtures with the line ''Optics will not cure inflation.''
 Over the course of the 1980s, optics gained a foothold in political discussions -- not in the United States but in Canada. An April 7, 1983, Toronto Globe and Mail article headlined ''Optics Is Name of Game'' explained: ''They say in Larry Grossman's health ministry, it's all a matter of optics. This has nothing to do with the eyes, but it has everything to do with the way the public sees things.'' In 1986, The Globe and Mail reported that ''Industry minister Hugh O'Neil showed up to get the premier's 'guidance' on how to handle the political 'optics' of a series of massive layoffs at Algoma Steel.'' And in Greg Weston's book ''Reign of Error,'' about John Turner's brief stint as prime minister in 1984, Senator Keith Davey of Canada is quoted as declining an offer to run Turner's campaign with the excuse, ''the optics would be all wrong.''
 Even now, optics in the sense of political appearances is far more prevalent in Canada than stateside. I asked Stefan Dollinger, a lexicographer at the University of British Columbia who is leading a revision of the Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles, why this might be. Dollinger pointed out that bilingual Canadians would be familiar with a similar French term, optique. In standard French, optique can refer to the science of optics or it can mean ''perspective, point of view.'' Beyond those core meanings, optique has been extended to visual appearances in general (much like the German equivalent Optik). Canadian-French usage adds a more politically focused angle, which seems to have been imported across the bilingual divide.
 The interplay of English optics and French optique on Canada's political scene has long fascinated Beryl Wajsman, president of the Montreal-based Institute for Public Affairs and editor of The Suburban, Quebec's largest English-language weekly. ''The 'optique,' as it is called in very politically savvy Quebec, is everything,'' he wrote in a 2007 column for Canada Free Press. Wajsman told me that optics and optique may have first commingled in Montreal around the time of the 1980 referendum on Quebec's sovereignty. Independence for the province was voted down, with the ''No'' side bolstered by a stirring speech from Pierre Trudeau at Montreal's Paul Sauve Arena just days before the referendum. Trudeau's bold intervention, Wajsman recalls, created some powerful optics.
 Not long after Canadian political insiders got caught up in optics, some American business leaders began finding the term useful, too. In a December 1985 Wall Street Journal profile, the Allied Signal executive Michael D. Dingman dismissed speculation over clashes with his company's C.E.O. as ''a matter of 'optics,' a word he uses frequently to mean 'perception.' '' Then in May 1987, the Ohio Edison Company president Justin T. Rogers Jr. defended the construction of more electrical power plants by saying: ''Optically, we've got all the energy we want in this country. Energy policies are being set today more on the optics of the situation than they are on the realities.''
 Were these corporate titans influenced by political goings-on north of the border? Possibly, but the fact that optics showed up in relation to Carter's inflation czar back in 1978 shows that this wasn't an entirely Canadian invention. Rather, as is the case with so many buzzwords, we most likely can't trace a tidy linear path from a single original source to subsequent adopters. 
 Optics has many sources of appeal: for bilingual Canadians it resonates with optique; for monolingual Americans it brings to mind a panoply of other associations. As Jan Freeman wrote in The Boston Globe, the word ''invokes a whole set of tech-and-science terms like 'physics,' 'statistics' and 'tectonics,' as well as Greek-derived high-concept nouns like 'hermeneutics,' 'aesthetics' and 'pragmatics,' all with an aura of brainy precision.'' Fittingly enough, the beauty of optics is in the eye of the beholder.

HEADLINE: Arabia: Inshallah, Obama

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
 With two little words, Barack Hussein Obama thrilled the Muslim world.
 ''Salaam aleikum,'' he said, offering the traditional Arabic greeting ''Peace be upon you'' at the start of his Cairo speech last year.
 The address of the first American president with Muslim roots was a bravura attempt to leech out the poison between the Islamic and Western worlds, and revive the moribund Middle East peace talks. But now, many disillusioned Muslims are echoing the all-talk, no-action refrain first popularized by the woman who became secretary of state. 
 ''He said all the right words in his speech,'' said Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister. ''But the implementation took traditional roads.''
 Privately, other highly placed princes in the family oil business groused louder. ''Things are worse now than before,'' asserted one, ''because our hopes were so high after Cairo.''
 Actually, the president didn't say all the right words in his speech. He created an obstacle for himself by demanding that Israel stop expanding settlements when it was not going to do so -- even though it should -- and when that wasn't the most important condition to Arabs.
 Now Obama seems ineffectual, as Israel pushes ahead on 600 more new homes in East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want their capital, despite the White House protest in November about 900 other houses that Israel plans to put up there.
 I asked Prince Saud if he thinks America has less influence over Israel than it used to.
 ''You're asking me about something that has tickled our imagination,'' he replied. ''If the settlements are illegitimate, the least you would expect is that the aid the United States gives to Israel would cut that part that is going to build settlements. Israel is getting away without implementing the Geneva Convention as an occupying authority. Now if it were somewhere else, in Burma or somewhere like that, hell would be raised.''
 It's probably a sign of progress that Prince Saud calls it ''a border dispute.'' Unless it's just his understated way. He also refers to ''the 9/11 incident'' and alludes to the Holocaust obliquely as ''World War II.''
 Despite repeated attacks by Arab states and Arab and Iranian-backed militant groups, and a call for Israel's destruction by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, Prince Saud suggested that Israel might be overreacting about security because of ''World War II'' and that this prevented a peace deal.
 ''There are no troops arrayed on the border of Israel waiting for the moment to say, 'Attack Israel,' '' the prince said. ''Nobody is going to fight them and threaten their peace. But they didn't accept that. So it makes one wonder, what does Israel want?''
 If anyone deserves to be paranoid, of course, it's Israel. But Israel can't be paranoid because paranoia is the mistaken perception that people are out to get you.
 Asked about the possibility that Israel could attack Iran with its new drones, Prince Saud said dryly: ''Talk about changing lifestyle. I think this would change lifestyles at once, forcibly.''
 Hillary Clinton was in the region recently, warning that Iran was ''moving toward a military dictatorship'' and could trigger a nuclear arms race.
 ''God help us if we see countries with atomic weapons in the Middle East,'' said Prince Saud. ''The way to resolve this is through the United Nations.'' Good luck.
 Clinton's request that Syria begin to move away from the relationship with Iran and stop supporting Hezbollah was rebuffed 10 days ago when Ahmadinejad and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad held a news conference underscoring their ties.
 Ahmadinejad advised America to stop interfering, pack up and leave the region.
 The blustery Iranian president has threatened to bar airlines that use the term ''Arabian Gulf'' instead of ''Persian Gulf'' from Iranian airspace. He stamped ''Persian Gulf'' on the Islamic Solidarity Games' logo and medals, spurring the Arab states to call off the Muslim Olympics.
 Prince Saud had been frank enough to confess to Hillary that camels were ugly, so I wondered if he'd say the same about Ahmadinejad's crazy rants.
 ''It achieves no objective,'' he agreed, ''and just creates tensions.''
 He said America would have to focus on social and economic problems in Afghanistan, since the war cannot be won only militarily -- ''unless you want to bring down the Himalayas.''
 He opened the door to the possibility that the kingdom might help the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, persuade Taliban militants to switch sides.
 I wondered how he felt about Senator Russ Feingold's contention that America needs to treat Al Qaeda as an international network rather than striving for a country-by-country eradication.
 He demurred, saying, ''There is nothing wrong with keeping the terrorists on the run.''

HEADLINE: The Up-or-Down Vote on Obama's Presidency

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WEDNESDAY'S health care rally was one of President Obama's finest hours. It was so fine it couldn't be blighted even by his preposterous backdrop, a cohort of white-jacketed medical workers large enough to staff a hospital in one of the daytime soaps that refused to be pre-empted by the White House show. 
 Obama's urgent script didn't need such cheesy theatrics. At last he took ownership of what he called ''my proposal,'' stating concisely three concrete ways the bill would improve America's broken health care system. At last he pushed for a majority-rule, up-or-down vote in Congress. At last he conceded that bipartisan agreement between two parties with ''honest and substantial differences'' on fundamental principles wasn't happening. At last he mobilized his rhetoric against a villain everyone could hiss -- insurance companies. In a brief address, he mentioned these malefactors of great greed 13 times. 
 There was only one problem. This finest hour arrived hastily and tardily. At 1:45 p.m. Eastern time, who was watching? Of those who did watch or caught up later, how many bought the president's vow to finish the job ''in the next few weeks''? We've heard this too many times before. Last May Obama said he would have a bill by late July. In July he said he wanted it ''done by the fall.'' The White House's new date for final House action -- specified as March 18 by Robert Gibbs, the press secretary -- is already in jeopardy.
 ''They are waiting for us to act,'' Obama said on Wednesday of the American people. ''They are waiting for us to lead.'' Actually, they have given up waiting. Some 80 percent of the country believes that ''nothing can be accomplished'' in Washington, according to an Ipsos/McClatchy poll conducted a week ago. The percentage is just as high among Democrats, many of whom admire the president but have a sinking sense of disillusionment about his ability to exercise power. 
 Now that we have finally arrived at the do-or-die moment for Obama's signature issue, we face the alarming prospect that his presidency could be toast if he doesn't make good on a year's worth of false starts. And it won't even be the opposition's fault. If too many Democrats in the House defect, health care will be dead. The G.O.P. would be able to argue this fall, not without reason, that the party holding the White House and both houses of Congress cannot govern. 
 For the sake of argument, let's say that Obama does eke out his victory. Republicans claim that if he does so by ''ramming through'' the bill with the Congressional reconciliation process, they will have another winning issue for November. On this, they are wrong. Their problem is not just their own hypocritical record on reconciliation, which they embraced gladly to ram through the budget-busting Bush tax cuts. They'd also have to contend with this country's congenitally short attention span. Once the health care fight is over and out of sight, it will be out of mind to most Americans. We've already forgotten about Afghanistan -- until the next bloodbath.
 The 2010 election will instead be fought about the economy, as most elections are, especially in a recession whose fallout remains severe. But that battle may be even tougher for this president and his party -- and not just because of the unemployment numbers. The leadership shortfall we've witnessed during Obama's yearlong health care march -- typified by the missed deadlines, the foggy identification of his priorities, the sometimes abrupt shifts in political tone and strategy -- won't go away once the bill does. This weakness will remain unless and until the president himself corrects it.
 Those who are unsympathetic or outright hostile to Obama frame his failures as an attempt to impose ''socialism'' on a conservative nation. The truth is that the Fox News right would believe this about any Democratic president no matter who he was and what his policies were. Obama, who has expanded the war in Afghanistan and proved reluctant to reverse extra-constitutional Bush-Cheney jurisprudence, is a radical mainly to those who believe a conservative Republican senator like Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas is a closet commie.
 The more serious debate about Obama is being conducted by neutral or sympathetic observers. There are many hypotheses. In Newsweek, Jon Meacham has written about an ''inspiration gap.'' He sees the professorial president as ''sometimes seeming to be running the Brookings Institution, not the country.'' In The New Yorker, Ken Auletta has raised the perils of Obama's overexposure in our fractionalized media. (As if to prove the point, the president was scheduled to appear on Fox's ''America's Most Wanted'' to celebrate its 1,000th episode this weekend.) In the Beltway, the hottest conversations center on the competence of Obama's team. Washington Post columnistsare now dueling over whether Rahm Emanuel is an underutilized genius whose political savvy the president has foolishly ignored -- or a bull in the capital china shop who should be replaced before he brings Obama down.
 But the buck stops with the president, not his chief of staff. And if there's one note that runs through many of the theories as to why Obama has disappointed in Year One, it cuts to the heart of what had been his major strength: his ability to communicate a compelling narrative. In the campaign, that narrative, of change and hope, was powerful -- both about his own youth, biography and talent, and about a country that had gone wildly off track during the failed presidency of his predecessor. In governing, Obama has yet to find a theme that is remotely as arresting to the majority of Americans who still like him and are desperate for him to succeed.
 The problem is not necessarily that Obama is trying to do too much, but that there is no consistent, clear message to unite all that he is trying to do. He has variously argued that health care reform is a moral imperative to protect the uninsured, a long-term fiscal fix for the American economy and an attempt to curb insurers' abuses. It may be all of these, but between the multitude of motives and the blurriness (until now) of Obama's own specific must-have provisions, the bill became a mash-up that baffled or defeated those Americans on his side and was easily caricatured as a big-government catastrophe by his adversaries. 
 Obama prides himself on not being ideological or partisan -- of following, as he put it in his first prime-time presidential press conference, a ''pragmatic agenda.'' But pragmatism is about process, not principle. Pragmatism is hardly a rallying cry for a nation in this much distress, and it's not a credible or attainable goal in a Washington as dysfunctional as the one Americans watch in real time on cable. Yes, the Bush administration was incompetent, but we need more than a brilliant mediator, manager or technocrat to move us beyond the wreckage it left behind. To galvanize the nation, Obama needs to articulate a substantive belief system that's built from his bedrock convictions. His presidency cannot be about the cool equanimity and intellectual command of his management style.
 That he hasn't done so can be attributed to his ingrained distrust of appearing partisan or, worse, a knee-jerk ''liberal.'' That is admirable in intellectual theory, but without a powerful vision to knit together his vision of America's future, he comes off as a doctrinaire Democrat anyway. His domestic policies, whether on climate change or health care or regulatory reform, are reduced to items on a standard liberal wish list. If F.D.R. or Reagan could distill, coin and convey a credo ''nonideological'' enough to serve as an umbrella for all their goals and to attract lasting majority coalitions of disparate American constituencies, so can this gifted president.
 He cannot wait much longer. The rise in credit-card rates, as well as the drop in consumer confidence, home sales and bank lending, all foretell more suffering ahead for those who don't work on Wall Street. But on these issues the president, too timid to confront the financial industry backers of his own campaign (or their tribunes in his own administration) and too fearful of sounding like a vulgar partisan populist, has taken to repeating his health care performance. 
 And so leadership on financial reform, as with health care, has been delegated to bipartisan Congressional negotiators poised to neuter it. The protracted debate that now seems imminent -- over whether a consumer protection agency will be in the Fed or outside it -- is again about the arcana of process and bureaucratic machinery, not substance. Since Obama offers no overarching narrative of what financial reform might really mean to Americans in their daily lives, Americans understandably assume the reforms will be too compromised or marginal to alter a system that leaves their incomes stagnant (at best) while bailed-out bankers return to partying like it's 2007. Even an unimpeachable capitalist titan like Warren Buffett, venting in his annual letter to investors last month, sounds more fired up about unregulated derivatives and more outraged about unpunished finance-industry executives than the president does. 
 This time Obama doesn't have a year to arrive at his finest hour. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the clock runs out on Nov. 2.

HEADLINE: Official Says China to Keep Ties to Dollar

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's central bank governor indicated Saturday that the government was unlikely to detach the value of China's currency from that of the dollar anytime soon, echoing Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's statement on Friday that exchange rates would remain ''basically stable'' for now. 
 Many Western economists and leaders, including President Obama, have called for China to let its currency, the renminbi, appreciate against the dollar, arguing that an artificially cheap renminbi increases Chinese exports at the expense of the rest of the world's economies.
 At a Saturday news conference, the central bank head, Zhou Xiaochuan, said China should be ''very cautious'' about revaluing its currency, also known as the yuan, as long as major economies remained mired in slow growth. 
 He called China's practice of pegging the renminbi to the dollar a ''special foreign exchange mechanism'' made to respond to the world financial crisis. Such mechanisms will be abandoned ''sooner or later,'' he said, but ''we must be very cautious and discreet in choosing the timing.''
 China had allowed its currency to slowly appreciate against the dollar until late 2008, when world economies sagged under the weight of the United States banking and securities collapse. Most economists say the Beijing government acted to maintain the price advantage of Chinese manufactured goods, a linchpin of the Chinese economy, at a time when exports were drying up.
 A slowdown in exports did shave roughly four percentage points off the growth rate of China's gross domestic product last year, economists say. But the currency stabilization and a large stimulus program kept China's economy on track, so that it exceeded the 8 percent target that the government had set for economic growth in 2009.
 Now that China's economy remains robust and its exports are recovering, Western governments have pressed Beijing to stop keeping the renminbi artificially low. President Obama and others say the Chinese currency policy helps keep Chinese exports cheap but depresses competing economies that cannot match the artificially low prices.
 On Saturday, Mr. Zhou offered no timetable for allowing the renminbi to resume its rise against the dollar, but he noted that it could take two or three years for global export markets to recover from the financial collapse.
 China's decision to fix its exchange rate has been criticized by global financial institutions in recent months, and some economists echoed them on Saturday.
 ''Maintaining an undervalued exchange rate certainly benefits China, but at the expense of other countries that lose their relative competitiveness in foreign trade,'' Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell University economist and former head of the International Monetary Fund's China branch, said in an e-mail message. 
 ''It is encouraging that Governor Zhou's statement suggests that the move to a managed float of the renminbi will be resumed once the global recovery firms up,'' he added. ''It would be even more helpful if, given its economic strength and solid recovery prospects, China's exchange rate policy could make a contribution to the global recovery rather than being frozen in place while other economies tend to their recoveries.''

HEADLINE: Tarnishing Hockey's Golden Moment

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
Enjoy hockey's Olympic moment while it's still aglow because its luster is beginning to fade. Instead of looking forward to the splendor of the world's best players again representing their nations in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, the N.H.L. is leaning toward secession from the Winter Games.
 Sochi is too far away for its fans to care, the N.H.L. argues. With an eight-hour time difference between Sochi and the Eastern time zone, some games there would be played when most American viewers are working or asleep. 
 Television money is involved. When the rights to the Sochi Olympics and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro are up for bid late this year, the two expected bidders, NBC and ESPN, will need to know whether the N.H.L., which supplied 140 players for the Vancouver Games, will play again. If not, the bids will probably be lower.
 Another factor for NBC is that its N.H.L. contract for Sunday afternoon and postseason games ends after the 2011 playoffs. If N.H.L. players are not promised for Sochi, a new NBC deal could be jeopardized. If the N.H.L. does not pause its season for the Olympics, another complication is that many of its European players may insist on joining their national teams anyway. Especially the Russians, who were co-favorites with Canada but failed miserably in Vancouver.
 Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, the former Russian president who successfully campaigned for Sochi before the International Olympic Committee, asked last week for what he described as ''serious critical analysis'' of Russia's weak performance in earning only three gold medals in Vancouver. Its acclaimed hockey team didn't even qualify for the semifinals.
 Putin demanded the creation of ''the necessary conditions for the preparations and successful performance of our team'' in Sochi. 
 And who's to say that Putin, knowing what Canada's hockey gold medal in Vancouver meant to that nation, would not demand that his country's best players, like Alex Ovechkin and Ilya Kovalchuk, interrupt their obligations to the N.H.L. to compete for Mother Russia in Sochi. 
 Would those Russian players defy Putin's orders? If they did depart, how would the N.H.L. respond? If they didn't, how would Putin respond?
 If the Russians jumped their N.H.L. contracts for two weeks to join their national team in Sochi, why wouldn't at least some N.H.L. players from Canada (hoping to defend their gold medal), the United States, and especially other European nations -- Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland and Slovakia -- want to go to Sochi, too? If that happened, N.H.L. teams would need to fill out their rosters with several minor leaguers until the Olympic rebels returned.
 N.H.L. players stocked the Canadian and United States teams in Vancouver. But if those teams were to send only college or amateur players to Sochi, the Russians would surely accuse them of conceding the Olympic tournament. The N.H.L. teams could fine players who leave for more than two weeks to play in Sochi, perhaps suspend them. But that would be like cutting off their hockey sticks to spite their hockey gloves.
 Questions about the Sochi site add to the situation. The Winter Games there would be an ''economic and ecological catastrophe,'' Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former Russian deputy prime minister, told Foreign Policy magazine last week.
 ''He,'' Nemtsov said, referring to Putin, ''has found one of the only places in Russia where there is no snow in the winter. He has decided to build these ice rinks in the warmest part of the warmest region. Sochi is subtropical. There is no tradition of snow or hockey there. In Sochi, we prefer football, volleyball and swimming. Other parts of Russia need ice palaces. We don't. Sometimes, it seems like God doesn't even want the Olympics in Sochi.''
 Nemtsov said the ''bigger concerns are organized crime, which is very active there, and government corruption.'' 
 He added that ''roughly 5,000 people were forced out'' of their homes to create room for Olympic facilities but that ''thanks to the corruption and incompetence of authorities,'' those people have not been ''adequately compensated for their property or been given equivalent housing elsewhere, as they were promised.''
 So instead of basking in the Olympic glow created by virtual competitive purity -- no fights, no enforcers, no timeouts for commercials, few penalties -- the future of hockey at its best is now at the mercy of the N.H.L.'s concern about a Russian time zone during an interruption to its season, the price of television rights to both the Olympics and the N.H.L., and the possibility of European players, notably Russians, defecting for two weeks.
 Just when the N.H.L. struck gold and silver, it seems to prefer ice. Thin ice.

HEADLINE: White House Message Maven Finds Fingers Pointing at Him

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- David Axelrod was sitting at his desk on a recent afternoon -- tie crooked, eyes droopy and looking more burdened than usual. He had just been watching some genius on MSNBC insist that he and President Obama's other top aides were failing miserably and should be replaced. 
 ''Typical Washington junk we have to deal with,'' Mr. Axelrod said in an interview. The president is deft at blocking out such noise, he added, suddenly brightening. ''I love the guy,'' he said, and in the space of five minutes, repeated the sentiment twice.
 Critics, pointing to the administration's stalled legislative agenda, falling poll numbers and muddled messaging, suggest that kind of devotion is part of the problem at the White House. Recent news reports have cast the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, as the administration's chief pragmatist, and Mr. Axelrod, by implication, as something of a swooning loyalist. ''I've heard him be called a 'Moonie,' '' dismissed Mr. Axelrod's close friend, former Commerce Secretary William Daley. Or as the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, joked, ''the guy who walks in front of the president with rose petals.'' 
 Still, it is a charge that infuriates Mr. Axelrod, the president's closest aide, longest-serving adviser and political alter ego. ''I guess I have been castigated for believing too deeply in the president,'' he said, lapsing into the sarcasm he tends to deploy when playing defense.
 No one has taken the perceived failings of the administration more personally or shown the strain as plainly as Mr. Axelrod, who as White House senior adviser oversees every aspect of how Mr. Obama is presented. As such, Mr. Axelrod, the president's mustachioed message maven, has felt the brunt of criticism over what many view as the administration's failure to clearly define and disseminate Mr. Obama's agenda and accomplishments for the country.
 ''The Obama White House has lost the narrative in the way that the Obama campaign never did,'' said James Morone, a political scientist at Brown University. ''They essentially took the president's great strength as a messenger and failed to use it smartly.'' 
 Mr. Axelrod said he accepts some blame for what he called ''communication failures,'' though he acknowledges bafflement that the administration's efforts to stimulate the economy in a crisis, overhaul health care and prosecute two wars have been so routinely framed by opponents as the handiwork of a big-government, soft-on-terrorism, politics-of-the-past ideologue.
 ''For me, the question is, why haven't we broken through more than we have?'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''Why haven't we broken through?''
 That question has dogged Mr. Axelrod in recent months and has preoccupied Mr. Obama's inner circle, fueling speculation that the vaunted ''No Drama Obama'' team might be fracturing. Not surprisingly, the White House has no patience for this. 
 ''You guys want to fit people into boxes and categories that are just not accurate,'' Mr. Emanuel said. 
 Mr. Axelrod would not discuss what counsel he offered to Mr. Obama, though he denies any ''fissure with my buddy Rahm'' and any charge that he is too infatuated with the president to recognize the political risks of his ambitious agenda. 
 ''Believe me, if we were charting this administration as a political exercise, the first thing we would have done would not have been a massive recovery act, stabilizing the banks and helping to keep the auto companies from collapsing,'' he said. ''Those would not even be the first hundred things he would want to do.''
 But Mr. Axelrod argued that the president, confronted with ''breathtaking challenges,'' did not have the luxury of moving more slowly or methodically.
 In an interview in his office, Mr. Axelrod was often defiant, saying he did not give a ''flying'' expletive ''about what the peanut gallery thinks'' and did not live for the approval ''of the political community.'' He denounced the ''rampant lack of responsibility'' of people in Washington who refuse to solve problems, and cited the difficulty of trying to communicate through what he calls ''the dirty filter'' of a city suffused with the ''every day is Election Day sort of mentality.''
 When asked how he would assess his performance, Mr. Axelrod shrugged. ''I'm not going to judge myself on that score,'' he said. But then he shot back: ''Have I succeeded in reversing a 30-year trend of skepticism and cynicism about government? I confess that I have not. Maybe next year.''
 The criticism of the administration's communication strategy -- leveled by impatient Democrats, gleeful Republicans, bloggers and cable chatterers -- clearly stings Mr. Axelrod, as well as the circle of family, friends and fans he has acquired over three decades in politics as a consultant and, before that, a reporter for The Chicago Tribune.
 ''Every time I hear that the White House is getting the message wrong, it breaks my heart,'' said Mr. Axelrod's sister, Joan, an educational therapist in Boston. 
 Ms. Axelrod says that while her brother is devoted to Mr. Obama, he is not a sycophant. She paused when asked whether he admired the president too much. ''He is very, very loyal, sometimes to a fault,'' she said. 
 Added Mr. Gibbs: ''The list of people who have to deliver bad news to the president is very small, and David is first on that list. I'm probably second.'' 
 Mr. Axelrod's friends worry about the toll of his job -- citing his diet (cold-cut-enriched), his weight (20 pounds heavier than at the start of the presidential campaign), sleep deprivation (five fitful hours a night), separation from family (most back home in Chicago) and the fact that at 55, he is considerably older than many of the wunderkind workaholics of the West Wing. He wakes at 6 in his rented condominium just blocks from the White House and typically returns around 11.
 Unlike other presidential alter egos, Mr. Axelrod is not viewed as a surrogate ''brain'' (like Karl Rove), a suspicious outsider (like Dick Morris in the Clinton White House) or a co-president (James Baker in the first Bush White House). Sometimes portrayed as a bare-knuckled Chicago operative, he is also a bantering walrus of a man in mustard-stained sleeves who describes himself as a ''kibbitzer,'' not a ''policy guy.'' 
 Sitting at his desk next door to the Oval Office last week, he was tearing into a five-inch corned beef sandwich on rye with a Flintstone-size turkey drumstick waiting on deck. ''I am the poster child for the president's obesity program,'' he said.
 A few minutes later, Mr. Obama walked in unannounced, scattering two aides like startled pigeons. ''Hey,'' Mr. Axelrod said by way of greeting (no ''sir'' or ''Mr. President.'') Mr. Obama surveyed the spread on Mr. Axelrod's desk with a slight smirk. 
 ''What is this, King Arthur's court?'' he asked, then pulled Mr. Axelrod aside to talk about a health care speech he was about to deliver.
 Mr. Axelrod is often at the president's side; he sits in on policy and national security meetings and is routinely the last person he talks to before making a decision. He directs the administration's external presentation, overseeing polls, focus groups and speeches and appearing on the Sunday shows. Mr. Emanuel describes Mr. Axelrod as ''an integrator of the three P's'' -- press, policy and politics -- ''and how they make a whole.''
 White House officials describe Mr. Axelrod's focus as big themes rather than day-to-day sound bites. There has been no shortage of Democrats willing to second-guess his messaging approach.
 ''They made a big mistake right out of the box with the Inaugural Address,'' said former Senator Bob Kerrey, adding that a president pledging bipartisanship should not have disparaged the previous administration in his speech, as many listeners believed Mr. Obama did.
 Chris Lehane, a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore, says the administration should tell a clearer story. ''They have been enormously capable in dealing with the day-to-day challenges of the government,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''But they don't seem to get the credit they deserve for that because they've communicated no overarching big idea or philosophical framework of where they want to take the country.'' 
 Others question what happened to the Mr. Axelrod who so effectively marketed Mr. Obama, the candidate, as a change agent. He and some defenders, though, say that trying to explain a president who is dealing with a fusillade of difficult governing issues is far different.
 ''In a campaign, you're not held to the same standard of actually doing what you say you're going to do,'' said Anita Dunn, a former White House communications director and Obama campaign adviser. Mr. Axelrod can still sound like the self-described idealist who developed Mr. Obama's campaign message, expressing impatience with what he calls ''the gritty pragmatist school that says you have just got to accept the system'' in Washington. ''I'm not surprised that there are people who never liked us in the first place trying to have a big 'I told you so' about how you really can't change the system,'' he said. 
 Mr. Axelrod has never lived in Washington before and has come to loathe what he calls ''the palace intrigue pathology of Washington.'' 
 ''I know I'm not cut out for this town,'' though he has respect for the people who work there, said Mr. Axelrod, who tries to spend one week a month with his wife, Susan, who lives in Chicago, as do two of his three children.
 Mr. Axelrod is tired, but he says that is nothing new. ''I have dealt with a lot of 'real stuff' in my life,'' he said, referring to his daughter's long struggle with epilepsy, his father's suicide and his wife's bout with breast cancer. ''The disapprobation of some folks in Washington doesn't seem very meaningful.''
 His friends still worry. ''I think he's getting close to a burnout kind of thing,'' said Sam Smith, a former Chicago Tribune sports writer, basing this not on anything Mr. Axelrod told him. Mr. Smith added that he speaks only sporadically to his friend these days, mainly about sports, and that Mr. Axelrod has always driven himself exceedingly hard.
 As Mr. Obama began his term, Mr. Axelrod told him he would stay at the White House for a finite period -- believed to be about two years -- and that time frame remains unchanged. ''I've learned more things in the last year than I will ever learn in my life,'' he said. ''It's just something you can't do forever, or it will kill you.''

HEADLINE: Obama Wields Analysis of Insurers in Health Battle

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To bolster the case for a far-reaching overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, because insurance rates are up sharply and competition is down.
 White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman Sachs analysis would be a ''centerpiece'' of their closing argument in the push for major health care legislation. The president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess. Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill. 
 The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the White House said. And officials will point to a finding that rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in ''the low- to mid-teens'' -- far higher than overall inflation. 
 The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans already have through employers. 
 Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding coverage to the uninsured.
 The research brief is largely based on a recent conference call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a major insurance broker. 
 In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that ''price competition is down from a year ago'' and explained that his clients -- mostly midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their employees -- were facing a tough market, in which insurance carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing customers to improve their profit margins. 
 ''We feel this is the most challenging environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the business,'' Mr. Lewis said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman brief. ''Not only is price competition down from a year ago,'' he added, ''but trend or (health care) inflation is also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem more willing than ever to walk away from existing business resulting in some carrier changes.'' 
 The report also indicated that employers are reducing benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual premiums and employee contributions to them. 
 Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two Sunday television talk shows, ''Meet the Press'' on NBC and ''This Week'' on ABC. 
 In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies. ''Visually to employees, they're fairly significant,'' he said.
 But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the administration will probably not want to highlight. 
 Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers experiencing increases in their insurance costs were nonetheless apprehensive about the president's proposal. 
 ''They're very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly consistent with what we're seeing in the polling numbers by party lines,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''I think most people would acknowledge that there's a need for health care reform; employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that message and have much of that frustration and anger at our lack of solutions.'' 
 And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from employers for the Democrats' proposals. 
 ''Many of them still view the legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the medicine worse than the disease,'' he said. ''So many employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe nothing is better than something in this current environment.''

HEADLINE: Rising Coalition Takes On Entrenched Parties in Iraq's Kurdish Zone

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

 BODY:
KIRKUK, Iraq -- A third political movement is waging a surprisingly strong challenge in Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, threatening decades of domination here by two entrenched and, many say, corrupt parties.
 Its name in Kurdish, Gorran, means change, and officially it is not a party yet. If successful in this Sunday's parliamentary elections, it could redefine relations with the Iraqi central government, which are fraught with issues that include how to share oil wealth and where to draw the borders of the Kurdistan region. 
 Leaders of the two Kurdish ruling families are taking the threat seriously, especially Jalal Talabani, Iraq's president, a wily political survivor close to the United States. He is waging an intense campaign that has included violence and intimidation.
 While the elections have focused largely on the fate of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, the results in Kurdistan could be essential to what kind of government emerges after the voting. 
 Since 2003, Kurds have been kingmakers in Iraq's central government, extracting the maximum political and economic concessions from Baghdad in a way that sustains the rule of the two main parties.
 Gorran's ascendancy could upend that balance; some analysts believe it could win as many seats as Mr. Talabani's party. 
 ''At minimum, the election results will further blur the lines between Kurdish nationalism, political expediency and economic opportunism,'' Denise Natali, the dean and a scholar at the American University of Iraq in Sulaimaniya, wrote in a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
 Gorran's appeal has gone beyond Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaimaniya, the three provinces that constitute the Kurdish region. It has spilled into disputed territories in Diyala, Kirkuk, Nineveh and Salahuddin, provinces claimed by both Kurds and the central government.
 The movement has taken particular aim at Mr. Talabani and his party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, at a time when its relations are warming with the other ruling party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani, Mr. Talabani's old nemesis turned ''strategic partner'' after 2003. 
 Mr. Barzani, the region's president, who is also close to the Americans, has used Mr. Talabani's weakness and presence in Baghdad to consolidate his power. 
 Although Mr. Barzani's and Mr. Talabani's parties are running jointly in the elections under the Kurdistan Alliance slate, they have been feverishly campaigning separately. Voters this time can choose individual candidates instead of just closed election lists, as they did in 2005, and this will determine the weight of each party within any prospective coalition.
 Campaigning among all Kurdish factions has been perilously provocative in disputed places like Kirkuk, which Kurds want annexed to their region amid strong objections by Arabs, Turkmens and other groups.
 Emotions are so high in Kirkuk and other contested border areas that in January the American military established a three-way security arrangement with the Iraqi Army and Kurdish forces to protect the elections and ease tensions there.
 Two weeks ago, hundreds of vehicles plastered with Mr. Barzani's posters roamed the streets of Kirkuk waving yellow flags symbolizing his party. 
 The convoy was filled with security force members, including a man in a military uniform brandishing an assault rifle with a yellow ribbon tied to its barrel.
 Leading Gorran's campaign in Kirkuk is Hassan Hamid Rahim, a former commander with the Kurdish pesh merga fighters who charged into the city with American troops in 2003 to claim it for Kurds before he was ordered to leave.
 Like most Gorran leaders, the former commander, Mr. Rahim, better known as Uncle Rostam, was until recently a member of Mr. Talabani's party and his comrade in the Kurdish struggle during Saddam Hussein's rule. 
 But in an interview in Kirkuk he called Mr. Talabani ''a dictator just like Saddam'' for blocking all attempts at party reform.
 Ala Talabani, a Parliament member who is Mr. Talabani's niece, acknowledged her party's shortcomings but said Mr. Talabani's opposition to Mr. Hussein before 2003 and his efforts to safeguard Kurdish interests should never be forgotten.
 ''In Europe you always talk about the future,'' Ms. Talabani said in an interview. ''Here you have to mention the past, our martyrs.'' 
 It is inside his traditional base of Sulaimaniya where Mr. Talabani faces the severest threat to his party's existence from Gorran, which emerged last year and did unexpectedly well in July's regional parliamentary elections. Gorran called for an end to corruption and the stifling patronage system associated with the two dominant parties.
 At a recent pro-Talabani rally in Koi Sanjaq, near Sulaimaniya, children chanted, ''We would starve to death without you.''
 Mr. Talabani's wife, Hero Ibrahim Ahmed, is in charge of the campaign in Sulaimaniya, where security forces loyal to their party openly take part in rallies while violently clamping down on Gorran's supporters.
 In one recent instance, security force members in white sport utility vehicles covered with pro-Talabani posters broke up a Gorran election gathering made up largely of young men.
 In a speech to hundreds of supporters in Sulaimaniya on Thursday, Mr. Talabani was clearly referring to Gorran's threat to his party when he said, ''The enemies of Kurds and the union who dream of destroying the union will be entombed along with their dreams.''
 Tensions have reached a boiling point in a society awash with weapons. Last month, a scuffle between supporters from each camp spiraled into a brief firefight that left three people wounded.
 Kurdo Qasim, another Gorran leader, vowed to drive Mr. Talabani out of Sulaimaniya on Election Day, near the anniversary of the Kurdish uprising during the first Persian Gulf war.
 ''It will be a double celebration,'' Mr. Qasim boasted during an interview in Khanaqin, a town south of Sulaimaniya mired in the land dispute between Kurds and Baghdad.
 Mr. Barzani has watched all of this with apprehension. In a speech two weeks ago in the regional capital, Erbil, he lambasted Gorran officials for oratory that crossed ''the reddest of lines.'' 
 He said that if they persisted they would be ''taught a lesson'' and kicked out of the region.
 Mr. Barzani's party is expected to carry Dohuk and win seats in neighboring Nineveh, but it does face competition from Gorran in Erbil, where the Barzanis have had ironclad control.
 Some public servants in Erbil claim they are being threatened with dismissal unless they vote for his party's candidates.
 ''I will vote Gorran if I can get away with it,'' said a police officer on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.
 But the young are the real wild card. About 60 percent of the region's estimated 4.5 million people are under 25 and have no memory of the old struggles: what they see are corruption and a lack of democracy. 
 Many acknowledge that Gorran, essentially a splinter group from one of the ruling parties, may not be an ideal vehicle for their aspirations but believe that it is, for now, the best choice.
 ''This is a country not worth living in,'' said Peshawa Khalid, 22, a resident of Piramagroon, a suburb of Sulaimaniya that was the scene of violent demonstrations in December over poor public services. ''We want to change it,'' he added, echoing one of Gorran's popular election refrains.

HEADLINE: If Reform Fails

 BODY:
As the fierce debate on President Obama's plan for health care reform comes to a head, Americans should be thinking carefully about what happens if Congress fails to enact legislation. 
 Are they really satisfied with the status quo? And is the status quo really sustainable? 
 Here are some basic facts Americans need to know as Congress decides whether to approve comprehensive reform or continue with what we have: 
 HOW REFORM WOULD WORK: Let's be clear, the changes Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress are proposing are significant. But, despite what the critics charge, this is not a government takeover. And the program is not only fully paid for, it should actually reduce the deficit over the next two decades. 
 Under the new system, all people would be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty. If you are poor or middle class you would also get significant help through Medicaid coverage or tax credits to pay the premiums. 
 The legislation would create exchanges on which small businesses and people who buy their own coverage directly from insurers could choose from an array of private plans that would compete for their business. It would also require insurance companies to accept all applicants, even those with a pre-existing condition. And it would make a start at reforming the medical care system to improve quality and lower costs. 
 46 MILLION AND RISING: If nothing is done, the number of uninsured people -- 46 million in 2008 -- is sure to spike upward as rising medical costs and soaring premiums make policies less affordable and employers continue to drop coverage to save money. 
 The Congressional Budget Office projects 54 million uninsured people in 2019; the actuary for the federal government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects 57 million. 
 It should be no surprise that people without insurance often postpone needed care, and many get much sicker as a result. That is morally unsustainable. It is also fiscally unsustainable for safety net hospitals -- which foist much of the cost on the American taxpayer when the uninsured end up in the emergency room. As the number of uninsured rises, that bill will rise. 
 The Senate's reform bill would reduce the number of uninsured by an estimated 31 million in 2019. The Republicans' paltry proposals would cut the number by only three million.
 BUT I HAVE INSURANCE: While most Americans have insurance, many pay exorbitant rates because they have no bargaining power with insurers.
 That includes many of the tens of millions who buy their own insurance -- the unemployed, the self-employed, and those whose employers do not offer insurance. The recently announced plan by Anthem Blue Cross in California to raise annual premiums by 35 to 39 percent for nearly a quarter of its individual subscribers is a chilling harbinger of what is to come if reform fails. 
 There are another 48 million people who work in relatively small firms that often cannot get the better rates of large-group coverage. All of these groups should be able to get a better deal if they can buy their insurance through new, competitive exchanges. 
 If current trends continue, the number of underinsured Americans -- those who have coverage too skimpy to pay substantial medical bills or protect them from high out-of-pocket spending -- will also rise from an estimated 25 million in 2007 to 35 million in 2011, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a respected research organization. 
 That will increase the risk that this group will forgo needed care and will expose many more of them to potential bankruptcy if they cannot pay huge medical bills. Some 72 million adults currently have medical debt or problems paying their bills even though most of them have insurance. Reform would help them by setting minimum standards of coverage and providing subsidies to tens of millions of low- and middle-income people to help pay their premiums.
 BUT I LIKE MY INSURANCE: Most Americans get their insurance through large companies, with large group bargaining power. While they complain about premiums and paperwork, most seem satisfied with their coverage.
 For them the real fear is what happens if they lose their jobs or decide to change jobs. Will they be shut out of coverage because of a pre-existing condition or forced to pay high rates to buy their own insurance? 
 For this group, the real advantage of reform is security. If they get laid off, decide to be self-employed or switch to a smaller employer that offers no insurance, they will still be guaranteed coverage -- even if they are a cancer survivor or have heart trouble or any other pre-existing condition. And they will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges. 
 I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT COSTS: You should be. The cost of medical care is rising far faster than wages or inflation. And despite all of the talk about reform ''bending the curve,'' no one is yet sure how to do that. 
 Many reforms that people instinctively believe should cut costs -- computerization of medical records, paying doctors for quality not quantity of services, and prevention programs to promote healthy living and head off costly illnesses -- cannot yet be shown to lower costs. 
 Pending reform legislation, specifically the Senate bill, would launch an array of pilot projects to test reforms in delivering and paying for care. It would also create a special board to accelerate the adoption of anything that seemed to work. That seems a reasonable way to go and a lot better than standing by as costs continue to spiral out of control. The Republicans' proposals -- including their call to cap malpractice awards -- would make only a small dent in the problem. 
 WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT?: Republican critics of health care reform have done an especially good job of frightening Americans with their talk of bankrupting the Treasury. The truth of the matter is that the pending reform legislation has been designed to generate enough revenue and savings to more than offset the substantial cost of expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies to the middle class. 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate bill would reduce deficits over the first 10 years by $132 billion and even more in the second decade. 
 What critics certainly do not talk about is what happens to the deficit if Medicare costs continue their relentless rise. That is something that should keep Americans up at night. 
 The pending reforms would cut the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary in half -- from 4 percent a year to 2 percent -- by demanding productivity savings from Medicare providers and cutting unjustified subsidies to the private plans in Medicare. 
 There is some skepticism that Congress will stick to its guns if health care providers say they cannot survive on the reduced rations. But Congress has stood by most previous Medicare cuts (physicians excepted) and should have its spine stiffened by new pay-go rules requiring that any Medicare increases be offset by other savings or taxes. 
 If reform is defeated, it seems likely that most of the proposed experiments designed to cut costs -- first within Medicare and then throughout the rest of the health care system -- will die as well. The legislation needs to be passed to establish a structure to force continuing improvement over the years. That is the best chance of restraining soaring medical costs that threaten the solvency of families, businesses and the federal government. 
 Any change as big as this is bound to cause anxiety. Republicans have happily fanned those fears with talk of ''dangerous experiments'' on the ''best health care system in the world.'' The fact is that thehealth care system is broken for far too many Americans. And the country cannot afford the status quo.

HEADLINE: U.S. Enriches Companies Defying Its Policy on Iran

BYLINE: By JO BECKER and RON NIXON; Eric Owles contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The federal government has awarded more than $107 billion in contract payments, grants and other benefits over the past decade to foreign and multinational American companies while they were doing business in Iran, despite Washington's efforts to discourage investment there, records show. 
 That includes nearly $15 billion paid to companies that defied American sanctions law by making large investments that helped Iran develop its vast oil and gas reserves. 
 For years, the United States has been pressing other nations to join its efforts to squeeze the Iranian economy, in hopes of reining in Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Now, with the nuclear standoff hardening and Iran rebuffing American diplomatic outreach, the Obama administration is trying to win a tough new round of United Nations sanctions. 
 But a New York Times analysis of federal records, company reports and other documents shows that both the Obama and Bush administrations have sent mixed messages to the corporate world when it comes to doing business in Iran, rewarding companies whose commercial interests conflict with American security goals. 
 Many of those companies are enmeshed in the most vital elements of Iran's economy. More than two-thirds of the government money went to companies doing business in Iran's energy industry -- a huge source of revenue for the Iranian government and a stronghold of the increasingly powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a primary focus of the Obama administration's proposed sanctions because it oversees Iran's nuclear and missile programs. 
 Other companies are involved in auto manufacturing and distribution, another important sector of the Iranian economy with links to the Revolutionary Guards. One supplied container ship motors to IRISL, a government-owned shipping line that was subsequently blacklisted by the United States for concealing military cargo. 
 Beyond $102 billion in United States government contract payments since 2000 -- to do everything from building military housing to providing platinum to the United States Mint -- the companies and their subsidiaries have reaped a variety of benefits. They include nearly $4.5 billion in loans and loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that underwrites the export of American goods and services, and more than $500 million in grants for work that includes cancer research and the turning of agricultural byproducts into fuel. 
 In addition, oil and gas companies that have done business in Iran have over the years won lucrative drilling leases for close to 14 million acres of offshore and onshore federal land. 
 In recent months, a number of companies have decided to pull out of Iran, because of a combination of pressure by the United States and other Western governments, ''terrorism free'' divestment campaigns by shareholders and the difficulty of doing business with Iran's government. And several oil and gas companies are holding off on new investment, waiting to see what shape new sanctions may assume. 
 The Obama administration points to that record, saying that it has successfully pressed allied governments and even reached out directly to corporate officials to dissuade investment in Iran, particularly in the energy industry. In addition, an American effort over many years to persuade banks to leave the country has isolated Iran from much of the international financial system, making it more difficult to do deals there. 
 ''We are very aggressive, using a range of tools,'' said Denis McDonough, chief of staff to the National Security Council. 
 The government can, and does, bar American companies from most types of trade with Iran, under a broad embargo that has been in place since the 1990s. But as The Times's analysis illustrates, multiple administrations have struggled diplomatically, politically and practically to exert American authority over companies outside the embargo's reach -- foreign companies and the foreign subsidiaries of American ones. 
 Indeed, of the 74 companies The Times identified as doing business with both the United States government and Iran, 49 continue to do business there with no announced plans to leave.
 One of the government's most powerful tools, at least on paper, to influence the behavior of companies beyond the jurisdiction of the embargo is the Iran Sanctions Act, devised to punish foreign companies that invest more than $20 million in a given year to develop Iran's oil and gas fields. But in the 14 years since the law was passed, the government has never enforced it, in part for fear of angering America's allies. 
 That has given rise to situations like the one involving the South Korean engineering giant Daelim Industrial, which in 2007 won a $700 million contract to upgrade an Iranian oil refinery. 
 According to the Congressional Research Service, the deal appeared to violate the Iran Sanctions Act, meaning Daelim could have faced a range of punishments, including denial of federal contracts. That is because the law covers not only direct investments, such as the purchase of shares and deals that yield royalties, but also contracts similar to Daelim's to manage oil and gas development projects. 
 But in 2009 the United States Army awarded the company a $111 million contract to build housing in a military base in South Korea. Just months later, Daelim, which disputes that its contracts violated the letter of the law, announced a new $600 million deal to help develop the South Pars gas field in Iran. 
 Now, though, frustration over Iran's intransigence has spawned a growing, if still piecemeal, movement to more effectively use the power of the government purse to turn companies away from investing there. 
 Nineteen states -- including New York, California and Florida -- have rules that bar or discourage their pension funds from investing in companies that do certain types of business in Iran. Congress is considering legislation that would have the federal government follow suit, by mandating that companies that invest in Iran's energy industry be denied federal contracts. The provision is modeled on an existing law dealing with war-torn Sudan.
 Obama administration officials, while indicating that they were open to the idea, called it only one variable in a complex equation. Right now, the president's priority is on breaking down Chinese resistance to the new United Nations sanctions, which apply across borders and are aimed squarely at entities that support Iran's nuclear program. 
 But Representative Ron Klein, a Florida Democrat who wrote the contracting provision moving through Congress with the help of a lobbying group called United Against Nuclear Iran, said it offered a way forward with or without international agreement. 
 ''We need to send a strong message to corporations that we're not going to continue to allow them to economically enable the Iranian government to continue to do what they have been doing,'' Mr. Klein said.
 An Unused Tool
 Sending a strong message was Congress's intention when it passed the Iran Sanctions Act in 1996.
 The law gives the president a menu of possible punishments he can choose to levy against offending companies. Not only do they risk losing federal contracts, but they can also be prevented from receiving Export-Import Bank loans, obtaining American bank loans over $10 million in a given year, exporting their goods to the United States, purchasing licensed American military technology and, in the case of financial firms, serving as a primary dealer in United States government bonds or as a repository for government funds. 
 Congress is now considering expanding its purview to a broader array of energy-related activities, including selling gasoline to Iran, which despite its vast oil and gas reserves has antiquated refineries that leave it heavily dependent on imports. 
 From the beginning, though, the law proved difficult to enforce. 
 European allies howled that it constituted an improper attempt to apply American law in other countries. Exercising an option to waive the law in the name of national security, the Clinton administration in 1998 declined to penalize the first violator -- a consortium led by the French oil company TotalFina, now known as Total. 
 The administration also indicated that it would waive future penalties against European companies, winning in return tougher European export controls on technology that Iran could convert to military use.
 Stuart E. Eizenstat, who as the deputy Treasury secretary handled those negotiations, said the law let Iran ''exploit divisions between the U.S. and our European allies.'' 
 Waiving it, though, was followed by additional investments in Iran -- and more government largesse for the companies making them. 
 In 1999, for instance, Royal Dutch Shell signed an $800 million deal to develop two Iranian oil fields. Since then, Shell has won federal contract payments and grants totaling more than $11 billion, mostly for providing fuel to the American military, as well as $200 million in Export-Import loan guarantee and drilling rights to federal lands, records show. 
 Shell has a second Iranian development deal pending, but officials say they are awaiting the results of a feasibility study. In the meantime, the company continues to receive payments from Iran for its 1999 investment and sells gasoline and lubricants there. 
 Records show Shell is one of seven companies that challenged the Iran Sanctions Act and received federal benefits.
 John R. Bolton, who dealt with Iran as an under secretary of state and United Nations ambassador in the Bush administration, said failing to enforce the law by punishing such companies both sent ''a signal to the Iranians that we're not serious'' and undercut Washington's credibility when it did threaten action. 
 Mr. Bolton recalled what happened in 2004 when he suggested to the Japanese ambassador that Japan's state-controlled oil exploration company, Inpex, might be penalized for a $2 billion investment in the Azadegan field in Iran. ''The Japanese ambassador said, 'Well, that's interesting. How come you've never sanctioned a European Union company?' '' Mr. Bolton recounted. 
 Inpex was never penalized, though several years later it decided to reduce its stake in the Iranian project. And to Mr. Bolton's chagrin, the Bush administration did not act on reports about other such investments, neither waiving the law nor penalizing violators. 
 Recently, after 50 lawmakers from both parties complained to President Obama about the lack of enforcement and sent him a list of companies that apparently violated the law, the State Department announced a preliminary investigation. Officials said that they were looking at 27 deals, and that while some appeared to have been ''carefully constructed'' to get around the letter of the law, they had identified a number of problematic cases and were focusing on companies still active in Iran. 
 Competing Interests
 Among the companies on the list Congress sent to the State Department is the Brazilian state-controlled energy conglomerate Petrobras, which last year received a $2 billion Export-Import Bank loan to develop an oil reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The loan offers a case study in the competing interests officials must confront when it comes to the Iran Sanctions Act. 
 Despite repeated American entreaties, Petrobras had previously invested $100 million to explore Iran's offshore oil prospects in the Persian Gulf. 
 But the Export-Import Bank loan could help create American jobs, since Petrobras would use the money to buy goods and services from American companies. Perhaps more important, it could help develop a source of oil outside the Middle East. 
 After The Times inquired about the loan, bank officials said that they asked for and received a letter of assurance from Petrobras that it had finished its work in Iran. A senior White House official, in a Nov. 13 e-mail message, said that while it was the administration's policy to warn companies against such investments, ''Brazil is an important U.S. trading partner and our discussions with them are ongoing.'' 
 But if the administration hoped that the loan would bring Brazil in line with its objectives in Iran, it would soon prove mistaken. 
 On Nov. 23, Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, visited Brazil, and the two countries agreed to share technical expertise on energy projects. Iranian officials said they might offer Petrobras additional incentives for further investment. 
 The visit infuriated American officials, who felt it undercut efforts to press Iran on its nuclear program while lending international legitimacy to the Iranian president. Brazil's relationship with Iran has also complicated American maneuvering at the United Nations, where Brazil holds a rotating seat on the Security Council. Just last week, Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, restated his opposition to the administration's sanctions proposal, warning, ''It is not prudent to push Iran against a wall.'' 
 Carter Lawson, the Export-Import Bank's deputy general counsel, acknowledged that Mr. Ahmadinejad's visit was ''problematic for us, and it raised our antenna.'' He said that since December the bank had been operating under a new budget rule requiring borrowers to certify that they had no continuing operations in Iran's energy industry, and was carefully monitoring Petrobras's activities. 
 In the meantime, Petrobras's Tehran office remains open. And Diogo Almeida, the acting economic attache at the Brazilian Embassy in Iran, said that while Petrobras was currently assessing how much it could invest in Iran, given the huge discovery off Rio de Janeiro, company officials were in active discussions with the Iranian government and were interested in pursuing new business. 
 Opportunities for Profit
 For all the American rules and focus, there is still plenty of room for companies to profit in crucial areas of Iran's economy without fear of reprisal or loss of United States government business. 
 Auto companies doing business in Iran, for instance, received $7.3 billion in federal contracts over the past 10 years. Among them was Mazda, whose cars in Iran are assembled by a company called the Bahman Group. A 45 percent share in Bahman is held by the Sepah Cooperative Foundation, a large investment fund linked to the Revolutionary Guards, according to Iranian news accounts and a 2009 RAND Corporation report prepared for the Defense Department.
 A Mazda spokesman declined to comment, saying the company was unaware of the links.
 Even companies based in the United States, including some of the biggest federal contractors, can invest in Iran through foreign subsidiaries run independently by non-Americans. 
 Honeywell, the aviation and aerospace company, has received nearly $13 billion in federal contracts since 2005. That year it acquired Universal Oil Products, whose British subsidiary is working on a project to expand gasoline production at the Arak refinery in Iran. Universal recently received a $25 million federal grant for a clean-energy project in Hawaii. 
 In a statement, Honeywell said it had told the State Department in January that while it was fulfilling its Arak contract, it would not undertake new projects in Iran.
 Ingersoll Rand, another American company with foreign subsidiaries, says it is evaluating its ''minor'' business in Iran in light of the political climate. But for now, according to a spokesman, Paul Dickard, it continues to sell air-compression systems with a ''wide variety of applications,'' including in the oil and gas industries and in nuclear power plants.
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, tried to close the foreign subsidiary loophole after a furor erupted in 2004 over Halliburton, former Vice President Dick Cheney's old company, which had used a Cayman Islands subsidiary to sell oil-field services to Iran. But he said he was unable to overcome business opposition.
 William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, lobbied against Mr. Dorgan's bill and has opposed other unilateral sanctions. He argues that their futility can be seen in the intransigence of the Iranian government and the way American oil companies have simply been replaced by foreign competitors. Moreover, many foreign companies with business interests in Iran are also large American employers; deny them federal contracts and other benefits, Mr. Reinsch said, ''and it's those workers who will pay the price.''
 But Hans Sandberg, senior vice president of Atlas Copco, which is based in Sweden, offered a different perspective. Atlas Copco's sales of mining and construction equipment to Iran are dwarfed by its American business, including military contracts. If forced to choose, he said: ''It would be no problem. We wouldn't trade with Iran.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about United States government contracts and other benefits received by companies doing business in Iran misstated the date Honeywell, the aviation and aerospace company, notified the State Department that, while a British subsidiary would finish a refinery project in Iran, it would not undertake new projects there. It was January 2009, not last January.

Others, not included here, have decided to leave the country altogether. (Sources: Securities and Exchange Commission

 It would be nice to say that GILBERTO GIL, the Brazilian singer-songwriter, has been exemplary, except that his example isn't easy to follow, even for himself. He's often best performing alone, singing brilliant words in a soft and spirited voice about language, love, philosophy and technology in clear Portuguese diction, putting a heavy samba-swing thumb into his bossa-nova fingerpicking. Even by himself he can overdo it, breaking the spell by having almost too much fun, or overinvesting in Beatles or Bob Marley covers for American audiences. Still, I'll take it: I've seen him generate more joy, and more spookily beautiful, time-freezing moments than most other performers of any kind, without any inflation of persona. (As well as everything else, he's one of the most sensible pop stars you will encounter from a distance.) His latest record, ''Bandadois,'' just released in the United States, is a live career retrospective, mostly solo voice and guitar, and it's excellent. He'll be casting a similarly wide trawl across the last 40 years or so of his work at Nokia Theater, accompanied by only two other musicians: his son, the guitarist Bem Gil, and the cellist Jaques Morelenbaum. Thursday at 8 p.m., 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street,nokiatheatrenyc.com; $50 to $80.

HEADLINE: Carp Solution Could Provide Financial Benefits

BYLINE: By DAVID GREISING and DANIEL LIBIT

 BODY:
Proposals to block Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes have largely focused on the costs and inconvenience of closing off Chicago-area waterways into Lake Michigan. But now business and environmental groups are exploring a possible upside: a broadly based infrastructure investment that would benefit much of northern Illinois. 
 Construction, jobs in the freight sector and money-saving improvements in transportation networks could be among the results of efforts to create what environmentalists call ''ecological separation'' between Lake Michigan and the rivers and canals leading to the Mississippi River, the source of the voracious carp that have made their way nearly to the lake.
Other Great Lakes states estimate if the carp established itself in the lakes it would cause billions in economic damage. They have sued Illinois to prevent that from happening. . 
 Tour-boat companies, barge operators, recreational boaters and others have cried out against one proposal: the intermittent closing of two locks that connect the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal to Lake Michigan. The Illinois attorney general has argued in a court filing that such closings would threaten a system that carries $16 billion in goods through the state each year. The Illinois Chamber of Commerce is expected to release a report next month putting a price tag on what a lock closing could cost. 
 But an unlikely alignment of environmental and business interests is looking beyond such claims toward the longer-term benefits of a permanent solution to the carp problem. Some of them say separating Lake Michigan and the Mississippi watersheds would lead to construction of shipping and terminal facilities that could bring hundreds of millions of dollars in investment as well as thousands of new jobs. 
 ''People get all worked up about the carp when the large-scale stuff is just not getting attention,'' said George A. Ranney Jr., chief executive of Chicago Metropolis 2020, a business group that advocates for regional transportation planning. ''The issue is, can we build a consensus on something bigger than just stopping that fish?'' 
 In a 2005 report, Chicago Metropolis 2020 called for building major terminals where freight could be transferred easily among different modes of transportation, like rail cars, trucks and river barges. The terminals would allow shippers to load their goods onto the most efficient means of transport. Construction of five such terminals in key locations on the outskirts of Chicago, along with other efficiencies and infrastructure improvements, could save $5 billion a year in trucking costs alone, the report said. 
 The report has drawn little attention, but proposals for intermodal transit facilities and other far-reaching measures are beginning to emerge now that Congress, the Obama administration and state governments are trying to find ways to contain the carp.
 ''The real debate needs to be on how to separate the Illinois waterways from the Great Lakes in ways that benefit the entire region,'' said Joel Brammeier, president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes, an environmental group. 
 Creating a permanent, ecological barrier between Lake Michigan and Illinois waterways would require, at a minimum, building a water treatment facility that would eliminate the possibility that any aquatic creature could move between the lake and Mississippi River watersheds. Backers of such a project liken its potential ecological impact to the reversal of the Chicago River's flow nearly a century ago. That historic engineering feat kept the city's waste out of the lake while this one would keep out marauding fish. 
 The water treatment plant would be part of a larger transportation complex that would enable shipments to move efficiently and quickly up and down the Illinois River and other waterways. The complex might include cranes capable of hoisting boats from the water, railroad sidings and truck bays -- and possibly massive conveyor belts to move cargo or even boats. 
 While the federal government would most likely cover at least part of the construction cost, private industry has already demonstrated a capacity to build such facilities without massive government aid. The railroad company Union Pacific is building a $370 million intermodal facility on 3,900 acres outside Peoria that is set to open this year. 
 The debate over how best to stop the carp has intensified along with the invasive fish's seemingly irresistible progress toward Lake Michigan. Illinois has battled other Great Lakes states in a war of words about the costs and risks associated with Asian carp. When a Michigan-sponsored study that was released last month claimed that the closing of two key locks leading into Lake Michigan would cost the Illinois economy only $70 million, the Illinois Chamber of Commerce began a new research effort intended to counter what it saw as an outrageously low estimate. 
 The Michigan study, by Prof. John Taylor of Wayne State University, is ''so far removed from science I don't know how to comment'' on it, said James Farrell, executive director of the Illinois Chamber. 
 Professor Taylor has defended his study, which makes a case that the Illinois waterway running into Lake Michigan is hardly the vital economic lifeline that the Illinois Chamber and other defenders insist it is. Using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data, he showed that the O'Brien Lock, the key barge channel into Lake Michigan, saw barge traffic drop by half from 1994 to 2008, to 7,063 total barges. In addition, trips by tour boats and other recreational and commercial vessels, which principally use the Chicago Lock near Navy Pier, fell 39 percent during the period, to 34,249 total trips, Professor Taylor wrote. 
 The alternative to permanent separation -- temporary and stopgap measures -- has its costs, too.
 Despite electronic barriers and other efforts to contain the carp, a recent University of Notre Dame study found traces of carp DNA in Calumet Harbor, near Navy Pier and at the Wilmette pumping station. 
 Because two electronic barriers have not completely stopped the advance of the carp, the Obama administration set aside $78.5 million this year for building a third electronic barrier.
 The Corps of Engineers' proposal to close two key locks intermittently this summer, one near Navy Pier and the other near Calumet Harbor, could cost shipping, recreation, tourism and other companies millions of dollars. 
 Ozinga Brothers, a concrete producer based in Evanston, ships the equivalent of 100,000 truckloads of material by barge from downstate into Chicago each year, the company said. If a lock closing forced the company to ship by truck, freight costs would jump as much as 40 percent, said Aaron Ozinga, president of the company's material handling division. 
 At Shoreline Sightseeing, whose tour boats ply waters from the Chicago River into Lake Michigan, uncertainties about the lock at Navy Pier are causing difficulty at the worst time -- when the company typically is hiring 40 captains and more than 250 crew members even as its cash flow is at its ebb tide. This year, hiring plans may have to be delayed. 
 ''One of the big unknowns is whether this is a temporary, one-season thing, a one-month thing, or a bigger-picture thing that could be even more devastating,'' said Chip Collopy, president of Shoreline Sightseeing. 
 A permanent separation of Lake Michigan from the rivers and canals that connect it with the Mississippi would not cause significant dislocation of commercial waterway traffic, according to data from the Waterways Council, which lobbies on behalf of inland shippers.
 The two systems are already essentially separate commercial entities. 
 In 2005, some 7,568 kilotons shipped through the O'Brien Lock, in the Cal-Sag Channel on the far South Side, which is the key transit point for cargo traffic between the lake and the Illinois waterway system. That amounted to less than 1 percent of the tonnage through all Illinois locks that year. 
 Indeed, most of the river and canal traffic in Illinois originates below the O'Brien Lock and involves grains, ore and other commodities that do not travel through the Great Lakes. 
 Jeffrey Adkisson, executive vice president of the Grain & Feed Association of Illinois, said the debate over proposals to stop the Asian carp had prompted less alarm among the group's members than he had expected. 
 ''Our members are largely going down the river to the gulf,'' Mr. Adkisson said. 
 Within weeks, the Army Corps is expected to propose a solution for containing the carp. 
 Henry Henderson, director of the Midwest Program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, is pushing for a permanent solution. 
 ''We think the longer-term, permanent solutions can actually enhance the transport and movement of goods throughout the region,'' Mr. Henderson said.

 BODY:
THE NEWS Cash-strapped states that have tried to reduce prison costs by releasing more convicts early have scaled back or reconsidered those plans in the face of mounting public opposition. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS In Michigan, for instance, the parole rate is the highest in 16 years. But critics there and elsewhere say that often the wrong kinds of convicts -- violent criminals and sex offenders -- are being released, and are committing new crimes at alarming rates. Officials in some states said their prison cost-cutting efforts fell short when they found far fewer prisoners to be wise release risks. 
 THE NEWS Angered by increases in tuition and cuts in state aid, thousands of California students, parents and faculty members staged protests at public schools, colleges and universities.
 BEHIND THE NEWS California's public education system has been racked by spending cuts because of the state's financial problems, which include a looming $20 billion budget deficit. Schools and colleges have had to lay off teachers and other workers, drop course offerings, increase class sizes and reduce aid grants, while sharply raising fees. The protests, along with similar ones in other states, were held Thursday. 
 THE NEWS Faced with steep declines in tax revenue, a growing number of states and localities are considering taking away the exemptions that charities and other nonprofit groups have from sales tax, property tax and other levies.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Officials said that in such tough economic times, state and local governments could no longer exempt nonprofit groups from carrying a share of the tax burden. Nonprofit groups called the plans ''looking under the sofa cushions'' and said that extracting taxes from them would lead to cutbacks in the services they provide, often on behalf of local governments.
 THE NEWS Arizonans deluged elected officials and newspaper letters columns with complaints after 13 of the state's 18 toilet-equipped highway rest stops were closed in a cost-cutting move.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Other states have closed rest areas, too, but taking away toilets provoked particular ire in Arizona, with its long drives between towns. As a proportion of Arizona's total budget, the looming state deficit is the largest in the country, and officials have had to cut spending on a host of services. A bill pending in the Legislature would let localities or other entities reopen rest areas at their own expense.
 THE NEWS Household debt grew in January as consumers spent more without a commensurate increase in their incomes, the Commerce Department reported. The trend pushed the household savings rate down to 3.3 percent, the lowest in two years.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The increase in consumer spending was far short of what would be needed for a consumer-led economic recovery to take hold, analysts said. And the rise looked unsustainable without solid gains in income or employment, signs of which were hard to find in the tepid report on February employment.

HEADLINE: Colleges and Schools Try to Do More With Less

BYLINE: By CHLOE VELTMAN

 BODY:
When San Francisco State University's theater arts department commissioned Mark Jackson to adapt and direct a production of ''Romeo and Juliet,'' he came up with the unusual idea of creating a version of the tragedy for 14 actors, all cast in the role of Juliet. But because of budget cuts at the university, less money is available for items that affect the look of a production, like sets, lights and costumes. So to save on wardrobe, Mr. Jackson has had to readjust his core creative concept: now he has just eight actors for his new show, ''Juliet.'' 
 San Francisco State University is among several Bay Area academic institutions whose resources have been vastly reduced amid California's fiscal crisis and the recession. A recent rehearsal there was one stop on a survey of artistic endeavors at local schools and universities. Taken as a whole, these works reveal that budget cuts have hardly dampened creative output. Even though the disastrous belt-tightening measures have put tremendous strain on teachers and students, these institutions are continuing to produce remarkable work. 
San Francisco State University's College of Creative Arts is typical of a performing arts institution grappling with reduced finances. Its operating budget has been cut by 15 percent over the last 18 months, and its staff has been thinned because of widespread furloughs, a hiring freeze and the dismissal of most of its temporary teaching staff, said Kurt Daw, dean of the College of Creative Arts. 
 Even Mr. Jackson, who graduated from San Francisco State in 1993, lost his salaried adjunct professor position in 2008 after a year and half in the job, and is now freelancing as a guest artist -- at lower pay.
 But you wouldn't know it based on the quality of his work. Mr. Jackson's 2008 productions of ''Don Juan'' (which he adapted from Moliere and Pushkin) and Sophie Treadwell's ''Machinal'' remain among the highlights of my theatergoing career. They have eclipsed many professional productions I've seen, including those directed by Mr. Jackson at spaces like the Aurora Theater and the Ashby Stage. 
 The way the young cast handled the physically demanding and grotesquely witty sex scenes in ''Don Juan'' was particularly engaging: one hilarious moment involved the title character dueling with an enemy while enjoying a romantic tryst. And the student actors brought a canny 21st-century sensibility to Ms. Treadwell's 1920s agitprop drama. The actors sent up the overblown mannerisms of expressionist theater through their physically extreme approach to mundane tasks like washing the dishes. The dehumanizing effect of their actions was at once chilling and comical. 
 Word has clearly been getting out about the high quality of performances at San Francisco State, where tickets range from free to about $15. So far, in the 2009-10 academic year, the College of Creative Arts has had a 46 percent increase in attendance at its performances over the previous year. Recent productions of ''Twelfth Night,'' directed by William Peters, and ''High Fidelity the Musical,'' directed by Stephen Brookins, had capacity audiences. 
 The Bay Area's public schools show similar artistic excellence. The San Francisco School of the Arts produced a memorable Christmas concert last December in the face of falling budgets and run-down premises, where classrooms often lack basic supplies.
 Parents are helping to keep the high school afloat by donating an average of $300 per year per student, said the principal, Carmelo Sgarlato, who added that some of that money helps to pay for guest artists. 
 Like many school concerts, the Christmas program was rather long. But the school's music ensembles gave a polished and spirited performance of a diverse range of work. I was especially moved by the chamber choral ensemble's spectral approach to plainsong during the opening candlelit processional, and the vocal jazz ensemble's take on the Sting song ''Fragile,'' complete with a silken-toned 14-year-old male soloist. The full house responded enthusiastically. 
 Dynamic performances and creatively inspiring rehearsals are equally evident in Bay Area institutions that don't specialize in the arts. A recent dance show at Berkeley High School featured a variety of genres, including hip-hop and contemporary ballet. The dancers executed the steps with passion and an engaging sense of ensemble.
 The state now provides less money per student, and the school is facing potential cuts in the next academic year that may adversely affect two art courses. But many students have met the arts education shortfall by taking private classes. 
 The challenging financial climate is certainly forcing educators in the Bay Area to be more resourceful about creating art in schools. What our educational institutions are able to achieve in a time of financial disarray makes me look forward to the dizzy heights of artistic excellence that will be possible in a more prosperous climate. 
 But I can't help wishing that the money were around right now to enable artists like Mr. Jackson to channel their entire creative energy into making art. He -- and discerning audiences -- deserve to see his original vision of 14 Juliets, rather than making do with 8. 
 ''Juliet'' runs from Thursday through March 21 at the Creative Arts Building, San Francisco State University, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco; (415) 338-2467, creativearts.sfsu.edu/events/1412/juliet.

HEADLINE: Can Good Teaching Be Learned?

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH GREEN. 
Elizabeth Green is a Spencer fellow in education reporting at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and the editor of GothamSchools.org. This is her first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
ON A WINTER DAY five years ago, Doug Lemov realized he had a problem. After a successful career as a teacher, a principal and a charter-school founder, he was working as a consultant, hired by troubled schools eager -- desperate, in some cases -- for Lemov to tell them what to do to get better. There was no shortage of prescriptions at the time for how to cure the poor performance that plagued so many American schools. Proponents of No Child Left Behind saw standardized testing as a solution. President Bush also championed a billion-dollar program to encourage schools to adopt reading curriculums with an emphasis on phonics. Others argued for smaller classes or more parental involvement or more state financing. 
 Lemov himself pushed for data-driven programs that would diagnose individual students' strengths and weaknesses. But as he went from school to school that winter, he was getting the sinking feeling that there was something deeper he wasn't reaching. On that particular day, he made a depressing visit to a school in Syracuse, N.Y., that was like so many he'd seen before: ''a dispiriting exercise in good people failing,'' as he described it to me recently. Sometimes Lemov could diagnose problems as soon as he walked in the door. But not here. Student test scores had dipped so low that administrators worried the state might close down the school. But the teachers seemed to care about their students. They sat down with them on the floor to read and picked activities that should have engaged them. The classes were small. The school had rigorous academic standards and state-of-the-art curriculums and used a software program to analyze test results for each student, pinpointing which skills she still needed to work on.
But when it came to actual teaching, the daily task of getting students to learn, the school floundered. Students disobeyed teachers' instructions, and class discussions veered away from the lesson plans. In one class Lemov observed, the teacher spent several minutes debating a student about why he didn't have a pencil. Another divided her students into two groups to practice multiplication together, only to watch them turn to the more interesting work of chatting. A single quiet student soldiered on with the problems. As Lemov drove from Syracuse back to his home in Albany, he tried to figure out what he could do to help. He knew how to advise schools to adopt a better curriculum or raise standards or develop better communication channels between teachers and principals. But he realized that he had no clue how to advise schools about their main event: how to teach. 
 Around the country, education researchers were beginning to address similar questions. The testing mandates in No Child Left Behind had generated a sea of data, and researchers were now able to parse student achievement in ways they never had before. A new generation of economists devised statistical methods to measure the ''value added'' to a student's performance by almost every factor imaginable: class size versus per-pupil funding versus curriculum. When researchers ran the numbers in dozens of different studies, every factor under a school's control produced just a tiny impact, except for one: which teacher the student had been assigned to. Some teachers could regularly lift their students' test scores above the average for children of the same race, class and ability level. Others' students left with below-average results year after year. William Sanders, a statistician studying Tennessee teachers with a colleague, found that a student with a weak teacher for three straight years would score, on average, 50 percentile points behind a similar student with a strong teacher for those years. Teachers working in the same building, teaching the same grade, produced very different outcomes. And the gaps were huge. Eric Hanushek, a Stanford economist, found that while the top 5 percent of teachers were able to impart a year and a half's worth of learning to students in one school year, as judged by standardized tests, the weakest 5 percent advanced their students only half a year of material each year. 
 This record encouraged a belief in some people that good teaching must be purely instinctive, a kind of magic performed by born superstars. As Jane Hannaway, the director of the Education Policy Center at the Urban Institute and a former teacher, put it to me, successful teaching depends in part on a certain inimitable ''voodoo.'' You either have it or you don't. ''I think that there is an innate drive or innate ability for teaching,'' Sylvia Gist, the dean of the college of education at Chicago State University, said when I visited her campus last year. 
 That belief has spawned a nationwide movement to improve the quality of the teaching corps by firing the bad teachers and hiring better ones. ''Creating a New Teaching Profession,'' a new collection of academic papers, politely calls this idea ''deselection''; Joel Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, put it more bluntly when he gave a talk in Manhattan recently. ''If we don't change the personnel,'' he said, ''all we're doing is changing the chairs.'' 
 The reformers are also trying to create incentives to bring what Michelle Rhee, the schools chancellor in Washington, calls a ''different caliber of person'' into the profession. Rhee has proposed giving cash bonuses to those teachers whose students learn the most, as measured by factors that include standardized tests -- and firing those who don't measure up. Under her suggested compensation system, the city's best teachers could earn as much as $130,000 a year. (The average pay for a teacher in Washington is now $65,000.) A new charter school in New York City called the Equity Project offers starting salaries of $125,000. ''Merit pay,'' a once-obscure free-market notion of handing cash bonuses to the best teachers, has lately become a litmus test for seriousness about improving schools. The Obama administration's education department has embraced merit pay; the federal Teacher Incentive Fund, which finances experimental merit-pay programs across the country, rose from $97 million to $400 million this year. And states interested in competing for a piece of the $4.3 billion discretionary fund called the Race to the Top were required to change their laws to give principals and superintendents the right to judge teachers based on their students' academic performance. 
 Incentives are intuitively appealing: if a teacher could make real money, maybe more people would choose teaching over finance or engineering or law, expanding the labor pool. And no one wants incompetent teachers in the classroom. Yet so far, both merit-pay efforts and programs that recruit a more-elite teaching corps, like Teach for America, have thin records of reliably improving student learning. Even if competition could coax better performance, would it be enough? Consider a bar graph presented at a recent talk on teaching, displaying the number of Americans in different professions. The shortest bar, all the way on the right, represented architects: 180,000. Farther over, slightly higher, came psychologists (185,000) and then lawyers (952,000), followed by engineers (1.3 million) and waiters (1.8 million). On the left side of the graph, the top three: janitors, maids and household cleaners (3.3 million); secretaries (3.6 million); and, finally, teachers (3.7 million). Moreover, a coming swell of baby-boomer retirements is expected to force school systems to hire up to a million new teachers between now and 2014. Expanding the pool of potential teachers is clearly important, but in a profession as large as teaching, can financial incentives alone make an impact?
 Lemov spent his early career putting his faith in market forces, building accountability systems meant to reward high-performing charter schools and force the lower-performing ones to either improve or go out of business. The incentives did shock some schools into recognizing their shortcomings. But most of them were like the one in Syracuse: they knew they had to change, but they didn't know how. ''There was an implementation gap,'' Lemov told me. ''Incentives by themselves were not going to be enough.'' Lemov calls this the Edison Parable, after the for-profit company Edison Schools, which in the 1990s tried to create a group of accountable schools but ultimately failed to outperform even the troubled Cleveland public schools. 
 Lemov doesn't reject incentives. In fact, at Uncommon Schools, the network of 16 charter schools in the Northeast that he helped found and continues to help run today, he takes performance into account when setting teacher pay. Yet he has come to the conclusion that simply dangling better pay will not improve student performance on its own. And the stakes are too high: while student scores on national assessments across demographic groups have risen, the percentage of students at proficiency -- just 39 percent of fourth graders in math and 33 percent in reading -- is still disturbingly low. And there is still a wide gap between black and white students in reading and math. The smarter path to boosting student performance, Lemov maintains, is to improve the quality of the teachers who are already teaching.
 But what makes a good teacher? There have been many quests for the one essential trait, and they have all come up empty-handed. Among the factors that do not predict whether a teacher will succeed: a graduate-school degree, a high score on the SAT, an extroverted personality, politeness, confidence, warmth, enthusiasm and having passed the teacher-certification exam on the first try. When Bill Gates announced recently that his foundation was investing millions in a project to improve teaching quality in the United States, he added a rueful caveat. ''Unfortunately, it seems the field doesn't have a clear view of what characterizes good teaching,'' Gates said. ''I'm personally very curious.'' 
 When Doug Lemov conducted his own search for those magical ingredients, he noticed something about most successful teachers that he hadn't expected to find: what looked like natural-born genius was often deliberate technique in disguise. ''Stand still when you're giving directions,'' a teacher at a Boston school told him. In other words, don't do two things at once. Lemov tried it, and suddenly, he had to ask students to take out their homework only once. 
 It was the tiniest decision, but what was teaching if not a series of bite-size moves just like that?
 Lemov thought about soccer, another passion. If his teammates wanted him to play better, they didn't just say, ''Get better.'' They told him to ''mark tighter'' or ''close the space.'' Maybe the reason he and others were struggling so mightily to talk and even to think about teaching was that the right words didn't exist -- or at least, they hadn't been collected. And so he set out to assemble the hidden wisdom of the best teachers in America.
 LEMOV WAS NOT the first educator to come to the conclusion that teachers need better training. In the spring of 1986, a group of university deans sat in an apartment near the University of Illinois at Chicago, tossing bets into a hat. They had come together to put the final touches on a manifesto that would denounce their own institutions -- the more than 1,200 schools of education -- for failing to adequately train the country's teachers. 
 They planned to mail the document to about 100 universities, along with an invitation to join their crusade, a coalition they named the Holmes Group, after a Harvard education-school dean from the 1920s and '30s who pushed to prioritize teacher training. The bets they scribbled on pieces of paper were their guesses as to how many of their colleagues might agree to join them.
 ''People were saying, 'Well, you're lucky to get 30,' '' Frank Murray, the dean of the University of Delaware's school of education, and one of those present, recalled recently. 
 By the end of the year, nearly every invited dean had signed on. The process of studying their own sins was ''painful,'' Judith Lanier, the chairwoman of the Holmes Group and then the dean of Michigan State University's education school, wrote in an introduction to the final report. But the consensus was inescapable. Three years before, a report from a presidential commission declared the nation to be ''at risk'' because of underperforming schools, citing dipping test scores and frightening illiteracy. ''Our own professional schools are part of the problem,'' the Holmes Group's report declared. 
 Though the Holmes report stirred controversy in some quarters -- the dean of the College of Education at the University of Cincinnati denounced it as ''divisive'' and ''exclusionary'' -- almost nobody denied the need for change. Yet reform proved difficult to implement. The most damning testimony comes from the graduates of education schools. No professional feels completely prepared on her first day of work, but while a new lawyer might work under the tutelage of a seasoned partner, a first-year teacher usually takes charge of her classroom from the very first day. One survivor of this trial by fire is Amy Treadwell, a teacher for 10 years who received her master's degree in education from DePaul University, a small private university in Chicago. She took courses in children's literature and on ''Race, Culture and Class''; one on the history of education, another on research, several on teaching methods. She even spent one semester as a student teacher at a Chicago elementary school. But when she walked into her first job, teaching first graders on the city's South Side, she discovered a major shortcoming: She had no idea how to teach children to read. ''I was certified and stamped with a mark of approval, and I couldn't teach them the one thing they most needed to know how to do,'' she told me. 
 The mechanics of teaching were not always overlooked in education schools. Modern-day teacher-educators look back admiringly to Cyrus Peirce, creator of one of the first ''normal'' schools (as teacher training schools were called in the 1800s), who aimed to deduce ''the true methods of teaching.'' Another favorite model is the Cook County Normal School, run for years by John Dewey's precursor Francis Parker. The school graduated future teachers only if they demonstrated an ability to control a classroom at an adjacent ''practice school'' attended by real children; faculty members, meanwhile, used the practice school as a laboratory to hone what Parker proudly called a new ''science'' of education. But Peirce and Parker's ambitions were foiled by a race to prepare teachers en masse. Between 1870 and 1900, as the country's population surged and school became compulsory, the number of public schoolteachers in America shot from 200,000 to 400,000. Normal schools had to turn out graduates quickly; teaching students how to teach was an afterthought to getting them out the door. Thirty years later, the number was almost 850,000. 
 In the 20th century, as normal schools were brought under the umbrella of the modern university, other imperatives took over. Measured against the glamorous fields of history, economics and psychology, classroom technique began to look downright mundane. Many education professors adopted the tools of social science and took on schools as their subject. Others flew the banner of progressivism or its contemporary cousin constructivism: a theory of learning that emphasizes the importance of students' taking ownership of their own work above all else. 
 At the same time, well-educated women and racial minorities who once made up a core of teachers began to see that they had other career options, and in increasing numbers, they took them. That left the ever-growing number of teaching jobs to a cohort with weaker academic backgrounds. The labor pool was especially shallow in cities, which, abandoned by the middle class, faced perpetual teacher shortages. Nancy Slavin, the head of teacher recruitment for the Chicago public schools, described to me a phone call in 2001 that particularly alarmed her. A prospective substitute teacher wanted to know why she hadn't been selected for an assignment. Slavin explained that her conviction for prostitution made her ineligible. ''Well,'' the woman replied, a bit indignant, ''I'm in a teacher-training program.'' 
 Traditionally, education schools divide their curriculums into three parts: regular academic subjects, to make sure teachers know the basics of what they are assigned to teach; ''foundations'' courses that give them a sense of the history and philosophy of education; and finally ''methods'' courses that are supposed to offer ideas for how to teach particular subjects. Many schools add a required stint as a student teacher in a more-experienced teacher's class. Yet schools can't always control for the quality of the experienced teacher, and education-school professors often have little contact with actual schools. A 2006 report found that 12 percent of education-school faculty members never taught in elementary or secondary schools themselves. Even some methods professors have never set foot in a classroom or have not done so recently. 
 Nearly 80 percent of classroom teachers received their bachelor's degrees in education, according to the U.S. Department of Education. Yet a 2006 report written by Arthur Levine, the former president of Teachers College, the esteemed institution at Columbia University, assessed the state of teacher education this way: ''Today, the teacher-education curriculum is a confusing patchwork. Academic instruction and clinical instruction are disconnected. Graduates are insufficiently prepared for the classroom.'' By emphasizing broad theories of learning rather than the particular work of the teacher, methods classes and the rest of the future teacher's coursework often become what the historian Diane Ravitch called ''the contentless curriculum.'' 
 When Doug Lemov, who is 42, set out to become a teacher of teachers, he was painfully aware of his own limitations. A large, shy man with a Doogie Howser face, he recalls how he limped through his first year in the classroom, at a private day school in Princeton, N.J. His heartfelt lesson plans -- write in your journal while listening to music; analyze Beatles songs like poems -- received blank stares. ''I still remember thinking: Oh, my God. I still have 45 minutes left to go,'' he told me recently. Things improved over time, but very slowly. At the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a Boston charter school he helped found, he was the dean of students, a job title that is school code for chief disciplinarian, and later principal. Lemov fit the bill physically -- he's 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds -- but he struggled to get students to follow his directions on the first try.
 After his disappointing visit to Syracuse, he decided to seek out the best teachers he could find -- as defined partly by their students' test scores -- and learn from them. A self-described data geek, he went about this task methodically, collecting test-score results and demographic information from states around the country. He plotted each school's poverty level on one axis and its performance on state tests on the other. Each chart had a few outliers blinking in the upper-right-hand corner -- schools that managed to squeeze high performance out of the poorest students. He broke those schools' scores down by grade level and subject. If a school scored especially high on, say, sixth-grade English, he would track down the people who taught sixth graders English. 
 He called a wedding videographer he knew through a friend and asked him if he'd like to tag along on some school visits. Their first trip to North Star Academy, a charter school in Newark, turned into a five-year project to record teachers across the country. At first, Lemov financed the trip out of his consulting budget; later, Uncommon Schools paid for it. The odyssey produced a 357-page treatise known among its hundreds of underground fans as Lemov's Taxonomy. (The official title, attached to a book version being released in April, is ''Teach Like a Champion: The 49 Techniques That Put Students on the Path to College.'')
 I first encountered the taxonomy this winter in Boston at a training workshop, one of the dozens Lemov gives each year to teachers. Central to Lemov's argument is a belief that students can't learn unless the teacher succeeds in capturing their attention and getting them to follow instructions. Educators refer to this art, sometimes derisively, as ''classroom management.'' The romantic objection to emphasizing it is that a class too focused on rules and order will only replicate the power structure; a more common view is that classroom management is essential but somewhat boring and certainly less interesting than creating lesson plans. While some education schools offer courses in classroom management, they often address only abstract ideas, like the importance of writing up systems of rules, rather than the rules themselves. Other education schools do not teach the subject at all. Lemov's view is that getting students to pay attention is not only crucial but also a skill as specialized, intricate and learnable as playing guitar. 
 At the Boston seminar, Lemov played a video of a class taught by one of his teaching virtuosos, a slim man named Bob Zimmerli. Lemov used it to introduce one of the 49 techniques in his taxonomy, one he calls What to Do. The clip opens at the start of class, which Zimmerli was teaching for the first time, with children -- fifth graders, all of them black, mostly boys -- looking everywhere but at the board. One is playing with a pair of headphones; another is slowly paging through a giant three-ring binder. Zimmerli stands at the front of the class in a neat tie. ''O.K., guys, before I get started today, here's what I need from you,'' he says. ''I need that piece of paper turned over and a pencil out.'' Almost no one is following his directions, but he is undeterred. ''So if there's anything else on your desk right now, please put that inside your desk.'' He mimics what he wants the students to do with a neat underhand pitch. A few students in the front put papers away. ''Just like you're doing, thank you very much,'' Zimmerli says, pointing to one of them. Another desk emerges neat; Zimmerli targets it. ''Thank you, sir.'' ''I appreciate it,'' he says, pointing to another. By the time he points to one last student -- ''Nice . . . nice'' -- the headphones are gone, the binder has clicked shut and everyone is paying attention.
 Lemov switched off the video. ''Imagine if his first direction had been, 'Please get your things out for class,' '' he said. Zimmerli got the students to pay attention not because of some inborn charisma, Lemov explained, but simply by being direct and specific. Children often fail to follow directions because they really don't know what they are supposed to do. There were other tricks Zimmerli used too. Lemov pointed to technique No. 43: Positive Framing, by which teachers correct misbehavior not by chiding students for what they're doing wrong but by offering what Lemov calls ''a vision of a positive outcome.'' Zimmerli's thank-yous and just-like-you're-doings were a perfect execution of one of Positive Framing's sub-categories, Build Momentum/Narrate the Positive. 
 ''It's this positive wave; you can almost see it going across the classroom from right to left,'' Lemov said. He restarted the clip and asked us to watch the boy with the binder. At the start his head is down and he is paging slowly through his binder. Ten seconds in, he looks to his left, where another boy has his paper and pencil out and is staring at Zimmerli. For the first time, he looks up at the teacher. He stops paging. ''He's like, 'O.K., what's this?' '' Lemov narrated. '' 'I guess I'm going to go with it.' '' After 30 seconds, his binder is closed, and he's stowing it under his desk.
 All Lemov's techniques depend on his close reading of the students' point of view, which he is constantly imagining. In Boston, he declared himself on a personal quest to eliminate the saying of ''shh'' in classrooms, citing what he called ''the fundamental ambiguity of 'shh.' Are you asking the kids not to talk, or are you asking kids to talk more quietly?'' A teacher's control, he said repeatedly, should be ''an exercise in purpose, not in power.'' So there is Warm/Strict, technique No. 45, in which a correction comes with a smile and an explanation for its cause -- ''Sweetheart, we don't do that in this classroom because it keeps us from making the most of our learning time.''
 The J-Factor, No. 46, is a list of ways to inject a classroom with joy, from giving students nicknames to handing out vocabulary words in sealed envelopes to build suspense. In Cold Call, No. 22, stolen from Harvard Business School, which Lemov attended, the students don't raise their hands -- the teacher picks the one who will answer the question. Lemov's favorite variety has the teacher ask the question first, and then say the student's name, forcing every single student to do the work of figuring out an answer.
 All the techniques are meant to be adaptable by anyone. To illustrate cold-calling in Boston, he showed clips of four very different teachers: Mr. Rector, whose seventh graders stand up next to their chairs as he paces among them, lobbing increasingly difficult geometry problems; Ms. Lofthus, who leans back in a chair, supercasual, and smiles warmly when she surprises one second grader by calling on him twice in a row; Ms. Payne, whose kindergartners jump in their seats, clap and sing along when she introduces ''in-di-vid-u-al tuu-urrns, listen for your na-aame''; and Ms. Driggs, a petite blonde with a high voice who calls the process ''hot calling'' and tells her fifth graders that the hardest part will be that they are not allowed to raise their hands.
 But perhaps the greatest master of the techniques in the taxonomy is Lemov himself. When I first met him during the lunch break at the Boston workshop, he spent most of our conversation staring at the floor. He was perched on a windowsill in a small side room, hugging his large body close to him. ''I'm a huge introvert,'' he told me, explaining how, at Harvard Business School, he took a Myers-Briggs personality test that labeled him more introverted than all his other classmates. ''It's strange to me that I do what I do and that I like it as much as I do,'' he said.
 After lunch he returned to the main room to teach, and it was as if he had left the shy Lemov on the windowsill. A different man stood up tall and square-shouldered, with a presence that made all 30 of the teachers crane their necks toward him. When he told a joke, they laughed; when he pointed to the screen, their eyes raced after his finger. One teacher at my table, Zeke Phillips, from Harlem's Democracy Prep Charter School, raised his eyebrows at a colleague and whispered, ''This stuff is good.''
 When Lemov began his project, he was working in the relative obscurity of Uncommon Schools. His decision to spend half his time building the taxonomy meant he had less time to carry out the network's main business, opening schools. But his fellow managing directors made a calculation that the time spent building a vocabulary for teachers would be worth the slower pace. They were beginning to expand beyond their handful of schools, and they needed a hiring plan. Their first schools often relied on experienced teachers like Zimmerli, plucked from other public schools. They could continue to buy the best talent away from other schools, but as more charter-school networks emerged, the competition for the obviously great teachers was growing fierce. 
 They decided that rather than buy talent, they would try to build it. Today, Lemov's taxonomy is one part of a complex training regime at Uncommon Schools that starts with new hires and continues throughout their careers. Lemov began expanding the taxonomy beyond Uncommon Schools only recently, offering workshops, like the one I attended in Boston, to a wider audience. His main clients are other charter schools, but they also include Teach for America and an immersive training program in Boston called the Match Teacher Residency that uses medical school as the model for preparing educators. His methods are also used at Teacher U, a new teacher-training program in which Uncommon Schools is a partner. Lemov is interested in offering teachers what he describes as an incentive just as powerful as cash: the chance to get better. ''If it's just a big pie, then it's just a question of who's getting the good teachers,'' Lemov told me. ''The really good question is, can you get people to improve really fast and at scale?''
 ANOTHER QUESTION IS THIS: Is good classroom management enough to ensure good instruction? Heather Hill, an associate professor at Harvard University, showed me a video of a teacher called by the pseudonym Wilma. Wilma has charisma; every eye in the classroom is on her as she moves back and forth across the blackboard. But Hill saw something else. ''If you look at it from a pedagogical lens, Wilma is actually a good teacher,'' Hill told me. ''But when you look at the math, things begin to fall apart.''
 In the lesson I watched, Wilma is using a word problem to teach her class a concept called ''unit rate.'' The problem has to do with a boy named Dario who buys seven boxes of pasta for $6. How expensive is a box of pasta? The correct answer, 86 cents, is found by dividing six by seven, but in the quickness of the moment, Wilma wrongly divides seven by six. This produces the number of boxes Dario can buy for a dollar, not how much money it takes to buy a box. As a result, students spend the rest of the class with the wrong impression that the pasta costs $1.17, as well as the wrong idea of how to think about the problem. 
 Hill is a member of a group of educators, who, like Lemov, are studying great teachers. But whereas Lemov came out of the practical world of the classroom, this group is based in university research centers. And rather than focus on universal teaching techniques that can be applied across subjects and grade levels, Hill and her colleagues ask what good teachers should know about the specific subjects they teach. 
 The wellspring of this movement was Michigan State's school of education, which, under the direction of Judith Lanier, one of the original Holmes Group members, took the lead in rethinking teacher education. Lanier overhauled Michigan State's teacher-preparation program and helped open two research institutes dedicated to the study of teaching and teacher education. She recruited innovative scholars from around the country, and almost overnight East Lansing became a hotbed of education research. 
 One of those researchers was Deborah Loewenberg Ball, an assistant professor who also taught math part time at an East Lansing elementary school and whose classroom was a model for teachers in training. In 1990, Ball filmed her third-grade math class at the Spartan Village Elementary School, and those videos became the foundation for a great deal of teacher-training research. 
 On one tape from that year, Ball started her day by calling on a boy known to the researchers as Sean. 
 ''I was just thinking about six,'' Sean began. ''I'm just thinking, it can be an odd number, too.'' Ball did not shake her head no. Sean went on, speaking faster. ''Cause there could be two, four, six, and two -- three twos, that'd make six!''
 ''Uh-huh,'' Ball said.
 ''And two threes,'' Sean said, gaining steam. ''It could be an odd and an even number. Both!''
 He looked up at Ball, who was sitting in a chair among the students, wearing a black-and-red jumper and oversize eyeglasses. She continued not to contradict him, and he went on not making sense. Then Ball looked to the class. ''Other people's comments?'' she asked calmly.
 At this point, the class came to a pause. I was watching the video at the University of Michigan's school of education, where Ball, who has traded in her grandma glasses for black cat's-eye frames, is now the dean -- and one of the country's foremost experts on effective teaching. (She is also on the board of the Spencer Foundation, which administers my fellowship.) Her goal in filming her class was to capture and then study, categorize and describe the work of teaching -- the knowledge and skills involved in getting a class of 8-year-olds to understand a year's worth of math. Her somewhat surprising conclusion: Teaching, even teaching third-grade math, is extraordinarily specialized, requiring both intricate skills and complex knowledge about math. 
 The Sean video is a case in point. Ball had a goal for that day's lesson, and it was not to investigate the special properties of the number six. Yet by entertaining Sean's odd idea, Ball was able to teach the class far more than if she had stuck to her lesson plan. By the end of the day, a girl from Nigeria had led the class in deriving precise definitions of even and odd; everyone -- even Sean -- had agreed that a number could not be both odd and even; and the class had coined a new, special type of number, one that happens to be the product of an odd number and two. They called them Sean numbers. Other memorable moments from the year include a day when they derived the concept of infinity (''You would die before you counted all the numbers!'' one girl said) and another when an 8-year-old girl proved that an odd number plus an odd number will always equal an even number.
 Dropping a lesson plan and fruitfully improvising requires a certain kind of knowledge -- knowledge that Ball, a college French major, did not always have. In fact, she told me that math was the subject she felt least confident teaching at the beginning of her career. Frustrated, she decided to sign up for math classes at a local community college and then at Michigan State. She worked her way from calculus to number theory. ''Pretty much right away,'' she told me, ''I saw that studying math was helping.'' Suddenly, she could explain why one isn't a prime number and why you can't divide by zero. Most important, she finally understood math's secret language: the kinds of questions it involves and the way ideas become proofs. But still, the effect on her teaching was fairly random. Much of the math she never used at all, while other parts of teaching still challenged her.
 Working with Hyman Bass, a mathematician at the University of Michigan, Ball began to theorize that while teaching math obviously required subject knowledge, the knowledge seemed to be something distinct from what she had learned in math class. It's one thing to know that 307 minus 168 equals 139; it is another thing to be able understand why a third grader might think that 261 is the right answer. Mathematicians need to understand a problem only for themselves; math teachers need both to know the math and to know how 30 different minds might understand (or misunderstand) it. Then they need to take each mind from not getting it to mastery. And they need to do this in 45 minutes or less. This was neither pure content knowledge nor what educators call pedagogical knowledge, a set of facts independent of subject matter, like Lemov's techniques. It was a different animal altogether. Ball named it Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching, or M.K.T. She theorized that it included everything from the ''common'' math understood by most adults to math that only teachers need to know, like which visual tools to use to represent fractions (sticks? blocks? a picture of a pizza?) or a sense of the everyday errors students tend to make when they start learning about negative numbers. At the heart of M.K.T., she thought, was an ability to step outside of your own head. ''Teaching depends on what other people think,'' Ball told me, ''not what you think.''
 The idea that just knowing math was not enough to teach it seemed legitimate, but Ball wanted to test her theory. Working with Hill, the Harvard professor, and another colleague, she developed a multiple-choice test for teachers. The test included questions about common math, like whether zero is odd or even (it's even), as well as questions evaluating the part of M.K.T. that is special to teachers. Hill then cross-referenced teachers' results with their students' test scores. The results were impressive: students whose teacher got an above-average M.K.T. score learned about three more weeks of material over the course of a year than those whose teacher had an average score, a boost equivalent to that of coming from a middle-class family rather than a working-class one. The finding is especially powerful given how few properties of teachers can be shown to directly affect student learning. Looking at data from New York City teachers in 2006 and 2007, a team of economists found many factors that did not predict whether their students learned successfully. One of two that were more promising: the teacher's score on the M.K.T. test, which they took as part of a survey compiled for the study. (Another, slightly less powerful factor was the selectivity of the college a teacher attended as an undergraduate.) 
 Ball also administered a similar test to a group of mathematicians, 60 percent of whom bombed on the same few key questions. Wilma, incidentally, scored near the bottom on the M.K.T. test, in the 12th percentile. 
 Inspired by Ball, other researchers have been busily excavating parallel sets of knowledge for other subject areas. A Stanford professor named Pam Grossman is now trying to articulate a similar body of knowledge for English teachers, discerning what kinds of questions to ask about literature and how to lead a group discussion about a book. 
 Ball is very clear that she doesn't think knowledge alone can make a teacher effective, and as part of her efforts to transform the University of Michigan's teacher-training program, she has begun to classify the particular classroom actions that are also crucial. She and the faculty have settled on 19 practices they want every student to master before graduation. These include some skills related to special knowledge for teaching, but they also include some broader skills, even some that seem to belong in the classroom-management arena, like an ability to ''establish norms and routines for classroom discourse.'' 
 Ball and Lemov have never met, and Ball had not heard of Lemov's taxonomy until I told her about it over a late dinner last December in Ann Arbor. We were joined by Bass, the mathematician, and Francesca Forzani, an alumnus of Teach for America who is managing the university's teacher-training overhaul. Ball had just declared that teaching ''is decidedly not about being yourself,'' but the other two were having trouble articulating just how teachers should behave. ''That's one thing our program doesn't address right now,'' Forzani said. ''How to get and hold the floor.'' To answer that question, they began to dissect Ball's methods. What did she do to capture her audience's attention? Bass mimicked how Ball brings order at faculty meetings. ''Oh, I notice Deborah is paying attention, and Francesca, and Elizabeth,'' he said, going through our names. Ball laughed. ''That's a joke!'' she said, explaining that she is mocking a common classroom technique that she finds manipulative -- a way of embarrassing talkers by not addressing them. Her preferred approach, she said, is to say something like, ''Elizabeth, I'm a little worried you might not have heard what Hy is saying.'' Bass shook his head, still thinking about the faculty meetings. ''But it works!'' he said.
 Watching their conversation was like witnessing Lemov's taxonomy in the act of creation. The slightly manipulative narration of this-person-is-paying-attention is a version of something Lemov calls Narrate the Positive; Ball's preferred approach, acting as if the distracted student was actually just not able to hear was Lemov's Assume the Best; and getting and holding the floor by adopting a different persona -- that was what Lemov calls Strong Voice. The more I talked about the taxonomy with Ball and her colleagues, the more it became clear that she was just as much a master of the 49 techniques as Bob Zimmerli. There were just two small differences. First, whereas Lemov's taxonomy is content-neutral, Ball connects hers to math. The second difference was that, while these practices were so ingrained they seemed imprinted on Ball's soul, when it came to talking about them, to passing them onto her students, she had no words.
 THESE DAYS LEMOV is almost single-mindedly focused on the mechanics of teaching, the secret steps behind getting and holding the floor whether you're teaching fractions or the American Revolution. The subject-free focus is a deliberate decision. ''I believe in content-based professional development, obviously,'' he told me. ''But I feel like it's insufficient. . . . It doesn't matter what questions you're asking if the kids are running the classroom.''
 But of course, content comes up for every teacher that uses the taxonomy. I met one such teacher, Katie Bellucci, this winter when I visited Troy Prep in Troy, N.Y., just outside Albany. She had been teaching for only two months, yet her fifth-grade math class was both completely focused on her and completely quiet. Pacing happily in front of a projector screen, she showed none of the false, scripted manner so common among first-year teachers. She moved confidently from introducing the day's material -- how to calculate the mean for a set of numbers -- to a quick cold-call session to review what they had already learned and finally to helping students as they tackled sample problems on their own. She even sent a disobedient student to the dean's office without a single turned head or giggle interrupting the flow of her lesson. Her cold calls perfectly satisfied Lemov's ideal. First, she asked the question. Then she paused a slightly uncomfortable second. And only then did she name the student destined to answer. 
 Bellucci, the daughter of two teachers, is a slim brunette with natural presence and a calm confidence. But her control of the classroom, she says, is thanks to the taxonomy, which she began to learn last summer, practicing different techniques in classroom simulations with her fellow teachers. The simulations were specific and practical; Bellucci told me she spent several hours practicing how to tell a student he was off task. ''Without it, I'd be completely on my own,'' she said. ''I'd be in the dark.''
 Like a good lesson, the taxonomy includes both basic and advanced material. Lately Bellucci and her mentor teacher, Eli Kramer, a dean of curriculum and instruction at Troy who also splits fifth-grade math responsibilities with Bellucci, have advanced to a technique called No Opt Out. The concept is deceptively simple: A teacher should never allow her students to avoid answering a question, however tough. ''If I'm asking my students a question, and I call on somebody, and they get it wrong, I need to work on how to address that,'' Bellucci explained in February. ''It's easy to be like, 'No,' and move on to the next person. But the hard part is to be like: 'O.K., well, that's your thought. Does anybody disagree? . . . I have to work on going from the student who gets it wrong to students who get it right, then back to the student who gets it wrong and ask a follow-up question to make sure they understand why they got it wrong and understood why the right answer is right.''
 Part of the challenge with the higher-level techniques is that they involve not just universal teaching practices but actual math. Bellucci doesn't just have to remember to return to the student who made the mistake; she has to figure out some way to correct that mistake in the student's brain. For these kinds of challenges, Bellucci leans on Kramer's seven years of experience teaching math, plus her own applied math degree from nearby Union College. She also improvises.
 In other words, she could use help explaining content -- the kind of thinking Ball is trying to teach education students with Math Knowledge for Teaching. Lemov and other Uncommon Schools administrators are unfamiliar with M.K.T., but some are recognizing that content can't be completely divorced from mechanics. This fall, Uncommon Schools administrators began building new taxonomy-like tools around specific content areas. Among the subjects under analysis are elementary- and middle-school reading, upper-grade math and all levels of science. 
 Lemov and Ball focus on different problems, yet in another way they are compatriots in the same vanguard, arguing that great teachers are not born but made. (The Obama administration has also signaled its hopes by doubling the budget for teacher training in the 2011 budget to $235 million.) A more typical education expert is Jonah Rockoff, an economist at Columbia University, who favors policies like rewarding teachers whose students perform well and removing those who don't but looks skeptically upon teacher training. He has an understandable reason: While study after study shows that teachers who once boosted student test scores are very likely to do so in the future, no research he can think of has shown a teacher-training program to boost student achievement. So why invest in training when, as he told me recently, ''you could be throwing your money away''?
 Indeed, while Ball has proved that teachers with M.K.T. help students learn more, she has not yet been able to find the best way to teach it. And while Lemov has faith in his taxonomy because he chose his champions based on their students' test scores, this is far from scientific proof. The best evidence Lemov has now is anecdotal -- the testimony of teachers like Bellucci and the impressive test scores of their students. (Among the taxonomy's users are a New Orleans charter school that last year had the third-highest ninth-grade English scores in the city behind two selective public schools; the highest-rated middle school on New York City's school report card; and top schools in Boston, Milwaukee, Denver and Newark.)
 THOMAS KANE, a Harvard economist who studies education, used to belong to Rockoff's skeptical camp. But he is one of several researchers who told me recently that he now has a more open mind. ''I still think tenure review is important,'' he said. ''It's just, I don't think we should throw in our towel on the other things.'' There is simply too much potential in improving the vast number of teachers who neither drag their students down nor pull them ahead. 
 By figuring out what makes the great teachers great, and passing that on to the mass of teachers in the middle, he said, ''we could ensure that the average classroom tomorrow was seeing the types of gains that the top quarter of our classrooms see today.''

 Kane is serious about finding the answers. He took a leave from Harvard in 2008 to work on a $335 million Gates Foundation project that will identify and support effective teaching practices.

HEADLINE: An Adagio for Strings, and for the Ages

BYLINE: By JOHANNA KELLER

 BODY:
SAMUEL BARBER'S Adagio for Strings begins softly, with a single note, a B flat, played by the violins. Two beats later the lower strings enter, creating an uneasy, shifting suspension as the melody begins a stepwise motion, like the hesitant climbing of stairs. In around eight minutes the piece is over, harmonically unresolved, never coming to rest. If any music can come close to conveying the effect of a sigh, or courage in the face of tragedy, or hope, or abiding love, it is this.
 Barber's centenary year (he was born on March 9, 1910, and died in 1981) is being celebrated by performances of his works, including the Adagio, his most famous composition and arguably the most often-heard work of classical music written in the last century.
 The Adagio is a shape shifter, widely appropriated in film and television. In recent years it has also become an unexpected hit for a number of pop musicians and remix artists, including the Dutch mixer and producer DJ Tiesto. His 2003 version of the Adagio is still on his set list, he said, because audiences expect him to play it. 
 ''The reaction is phenomenal,'' he said recently by phone. ''When I play the Adagio, and they hear the bass line and the high sounds, people start screaming. Then at the first break of the track, people scream again. The reactions are the same, all around the world.''
 Could we be talking about the same piece?
 In the quieter classical realm this week Barber's anniversary will be marked by two New York performances of the Adagio in its original form as the slow movement of his string quartet, Opus 11. (After writing the quartet in 1936, Barber later adapted it for string orchestra and created a choral setting, Agnus Dei.) The Ying Quartet, resident ensemble of the Eastman School of Music, performs the chamber version at the Morgan Library & Museum on Tuesday. The next evening an ensemble of students and faculty members from the Curtis Institute of Music (Barber's alma mater) will play the string quartet at the Allen Room in Frederick P. Rose Hall.
 ''You have to be a rock in the middle of nowhere not to have your gut wrenched out by this music,'' said Ida Kavafian, a violinist and a Curtis Institute faculty member, who is participating in the performance. ''There are tremendous suspensions over the bar line, places where Barber creates a great tension by changing harmonies, staggered in such a way that the dissonances form and then resolve. It's all about tension.''
 Given its premiere by Arturo Toscanini in 1938 with the NBC Orchestra, the Adagio leapt the bounds of the concert hall early on. After it was broadcast over the radio in 1945 at the announcement of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it became associated with state and celebrity funerals. It was used as the soundtrack to an intimate scene in the gay film drama ''A Very Natural Thing'' in 1974 (Barber himself was gay), as well as being heard in the movies ''Platoon,'' ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Lorenzo's Oil.'' On television it has been in both ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park.'' 
 It has been sampled, synthesized, and arranged for clarinet choir, electric guitar, marimbas and brass band. It appears as a track on ''Body Burn: 18 Classics to Get Yourself in Shape.'' In addition to DJ Tiesto, William Orbit, Paul Oakenfold, Ferry Corsten and Future Breeze have made it a hit. It has become so popularized -- many might say bowdlerized -- that it may be difficult to hear with fresh ears.
 ''But it's pure magic,'' the director David Lynch said recently by phone of the piece, which he used in the final tragic scene of ''The Elephant Man'' in 1980. ''It's deeply spiritual and simply beautiful.''
 Mr. Lynch was in the midst of shooting his film, lying on the sofa on an off day, when the Adagio came on the radio. ''Within a few milliseconds,'' he said, ''the whole final scene of 'The Elephant Man' unfolded inside my head.''
 For his 1986 film about the Vietnam War, Oliver Stone juxtaposed the transcendent music with images of war, and it became widely known as ''the music from 'Platoon.' ''
 Marin Alsop, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and a champion of American music, who has recorded Barber's complete orchestral works for Naxos, remembered encountering the Adagio in her early days working as a studio violinist for film scores.
 Ms. Alsop arrived for a session in Manhattan to find the familiar score on the music stand. As she began to play, she glanced past the conductor to the screen showing the film for synchronization. ''I saw all these dead bodies,'' she said. ''The film was 'Platoon,' and my first thought was, ugh, this doesn't fit at all. But of course now I think it fits to perfection, because I've been conditioned by the power of those visuals to associate Adagio with traumatic events.''
 The Adagio has since been recorded and performed often by ensembles of the Army. The Army will host its own Barber centennial celebration, honoring Barber's service as a corporal during World War II. Beginning April 25 the U.S. Army Strings will present a series of concerts featuring Barber's School for Scandal Overture and some of his songs. However, the ensemble will not be performing the Adagio, said Maj. Paul Bamonte, director of the U.S. Army Strings.
 ''The tessitura are very high and very low,'' Major Bamonte said, referring to the extreme ranges for the string instruments. ''We have 21 players on a good day, when everyone is here, and the piece really requires 45 to give that full sound. The players just feel too exposed. But we wanted to celebrate this great American composer, especially since Barber was a veteran himself.''
 Beginning around 1990 in pop music the work seemed to crop up everywhere. The D.J. Paul Oakenfold included a snippet of the Adagio -- accompanied by sounds of explosions and thunder -- on his 1996 album, ''Fluoro.'' The rapper Sean Combs sampled it on his album ''No Way Out,'' and a British techno duo, the Skip Raiders, followed suit, sampling the Adagio for a dance track called ''Another Day'' that was used as background music for a campaign advertisement for the Green Party in Britain.
 Its popularity soared when William Orbit, musician and producer of Madonna's album ''Ray of Light,'' released it as a single and included it on his influential album ''Pieces in a Modern Style'' in 2000. The album, which hit No. 2 on the British pop charts and sold a half-million copies worldwide, consisted of classical works played on the synthesizer. He presents the Adagio almost straight, with the addition of a bass pedal an octave lower. In a phone conversation Mr. Orbit recalled playing the track on a morning radio show in Los Angeles.
 ''When we aired it for the first time, the switchboard just lit up,'' he said. ''People just want to hear music like this.'' Mr. Orbit's version of the Adagio climbed the British singles chart to No. 4 by the close of 1999.
 There have been many remixes of Mr. Orbit's version, and he pointed approvingly to one by the Dutch D.J. Ferry Corsten that transforms the Adagio into an upbeat disco track, incorporating arpeggios that speed the tempo. DJ Tiesto created his 2003 version on the album ''Just Be'' and followed it with a remix called ''Parade of the Athletes,'' which he performed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. When he created the mix, he said, he was ''thinking of big stadiums full of people.''
 ''I used nice, distorted sounds to make it very dramatic, so I made the strings sound huge and the bass line very large,'' he said. ''I was thinking in big terms.''
 With its sampled electronic instrumentation, pumped-up volume and driving beat, DJ Tiesto's version is far from the Adagio written by Barber. Only in the most basic sense -- the melodic and harmonic patterns -- could it be called the same work. Subtle it's not. For many classical musicians who perform it, that aspect is why it is such an enduring masterpiece.
 ''The score looks so clear, like a counterpoint exercise,'' said Phillip Ying, first violinist of the Ying Quartet, ''and the power of it is in the economy of means.'' Of interest to connoisseurs of Barber's original music is that the Ying Quartet's performance will include the first hearing in many decades of a third movement that Barber wrote and later suppressed. The quartet is usually performed with a short coda that Barber substituted as the finale of the work.
 The members of the Ying Quartet, in residence at the Eastman School in Rochester, learned about the unpublished movement when they spent time with the cellist Orlando Cole, who had been a friend of Barber's since their student days at Curtis. Cole, who died in January at 101, was a longtime faculty member at Curtis who performed many of Barber's works, including the string quartet in its full three-movement version.
 Barber composed the Adagio movement during a summer in Europe with a fellow composer and Curtis student, Gian Carlo Menotti, with whom Barber had a lifelong professional and personal relationship. Barber sent a letter to Cole that read in part, ''I have just finished the slow movement and it's a knockout!'' Mr. Ying said he believed that Barber, after composing the Adagio, found it impossible to write a movement that could follow it. ''From the depths of the Adagio,'' he said, ''it was evident he was struggling to find some kind of uplifting resolution. It's striking that he couldn't do it.''
 While the Adagio has been a favorite work in concert halls, Barber wrote a number of other works just as worthy of attention. Ms. Alsop is among the many musicians who advocate that more of his work be performed. She will conduct the Adagio in a series of concerts with the Baltimore Symphony beginning June 6 and is programming Barber's Second Essay for Orchestra when she brings her orchestra to Carnegie Hall next season.
 ''The archetypical Barber we know from the Adagio,'' Ms. Alsop said, ''is a melodic, lyrical long-line composer. But that only captures one dimension of his work. Because he's also concise, angular, rhythmic and witty.''
 Another centenary tribute will arrive next month in the form of a collection of interviews of Barber's friends, critics and colleagues. Edited by the British composer and pianist Peter Dickinson and published by the University of Rochester Press, ''Samuel Barber Remembered'' illuminates many facets of his life and work. One issue dealt with is Barber's discomfort -- bordering on irritation -- at the Adagio's ubiquity.
 Yet the Adagio has always found serious listeners who continue to affirm its inherent quality. The critic and composer Virgil Thomson, interviewed by Mr. Dickinson in 1981, couldn't stay off the topic of the Adagio. And the composer William Schuman, interviewed the same year, said of it: ''Every time you hear a world-class performance, it's quite an experience. For me, it's never a war horse. I'm always moved by it.''

HEADLINE: After Rough Years, Job Market Stabilizes for Business Students

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- For two years in a row, Kwame Yankson, a business school student at the University of Virginia, has sent a flurry of resumes to investment banks. He has cold-called Wall Street recruiters. And he has landed coveted interview slots.
 But the difference in the outcome each year was stark. Last year, Mr. Yankson was turned down for summer internships by about 15 recession-plagued banks and ended up working for an education nonprofit organization. This year, as he sought a full-time job, Wells Fargo quickly gave him the response he wanted: When can you start? 
 ''The banks this year kept saying, 'It's a good year,' 'We just approved a lot of hiring,' 'The market is clearing up,' '' Mr. Yankson said. ''It was a completely different experience.''
 With banks climbing out of the recession, more business students across the country are finding banking jobs and internships, enrolling in finance clubs and going on class trips to Wall Street, universities say. 
 Unemployment is plaguing millions of families, and the public may still be seething about bank bailouts and eight-figure bonuses. But business students and career advisers see a job market that is quickly stabilizing.
 Aspiring bankers know their career choice comes at an awkward time. Ben Phelps, an M.B.A. student at Duke who is going to work for Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch after graduation, was shouted at by a stranger on Wall Street during a summer internship. He and his classmates joke that they would sooner describe themselves as ''bank tellers'' than ''investment bankers.''
 ''A lot of people lost their savings, and I can understand those people being angry,'' Mr. Phelps said. ''But I wish sometimes that their anger wasn't directed just at bankers.''
 Still, he said, the public perception of banking was not a factor when he accepted the job that he calls ''the reason I came to business school,'' in the bank's mergers and acquisitions division. He expects the work to be fast-paced, intellectually challenging, financially rewarding and helpful in building a career -- the same reasons given by many aspiring bankers.
 On a recent interview day at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business, students in pinstriped suits and polished shoes waited anxiously for meetings with representatives from J. P. Morgan and BB&T Capital Markets. 
 The competition would be steep -- with dozens of students applying for each internship -- but less selective than in 2009. The number of banks interviewing at Darden this year increased 20 percent, and the number of job offers so far has risen 33 percent, the school said.
 ''There's reason for students to be optimistic,'' said Tracy Handler, a spokeswoman for the M.B.A. Career Services Council, an association of business school career advisers. ''Any signs of recovery are modest. But business schools are looking ahead and seeing a light at the end of what is now a pretty short tunnel.''
 A survey by the career council in December found that 39 percent of business schools expected internship opportunities to increase this summer, while 26 percent expected them to decrease. 
 At Duke University, for instance, the business school career office reported last month that the number of students with investment banking internships had doubled compared with last year. Four new banks went to Duke this year to interview, and the number of Duke students submitting resumes to banks increased 37 percent. The number of students participating in the school's Week on Wall Street trip also rose, to 90 from 60 last year.
 ''Ironically, this can be a superb time to enter banking,'' said Jeff Fischer, the director of career management at the business school at the University of North Carolina, where the number of investment bankers visiting campus has risen 67 percent since last year. ''The M.B.A. population is like the end of a whip. When cycles swing up and down, students are the ones who swing up and down the most in terms of employment.'' 
 Though some banks are still cautious, business school counselors are telling students to be persistent. Banks under-hired during the market collapse, the counselors say, and will soon be creating more full-time positions than former interns can fill.
 Top banks declined to release hiring statistics for this article, and many business schools said it was too early to predict hiring results because job offers can continue through the spring. But in interviews with two dozen students and administrators at several business schools across the country, there was growing optimism about banking jobs. Many students said Wall Street remained a dream destination, even if they occasionally had to explain their dream to friends.
 ''The answer is the level of knowledge that can be gained at such a young age,'' said P. J. Martin, a first-year M.B.A. student at the University of North Carolina who is interning at Barclays Capital next summer, explaining his interest in investment banking. ''You have access to top-level management, to the top minds in the finance field.''
 But many students admitted a twinge of guilt about landing jobs and internships while so many classmates -- and much of the country -- remain unemployed. 
 ''I feel lucky,'' said Mr. Phelps, from Duke. ''My timing ended up being perfect, and it could easily have not been. Lots of friends are struggling and not finding jobs.''
 The speed of the turnaround in banking has not surprised Ben Bloomfield, a first-year M.B.A. student at Darden. Business students, he said, expect cyclical markets, but know that banking will remain prestigious.
 ''I don't think any business school student was disillusioned enough to think, 'Oh, Goldman Sachs on my resume is not going to be valuable,' '' Mr. Bloomfield said. ''It was more, 'Goldman Sachs is going to come to campus, and I'm not even sure they're going to hire anybody.' ''
 That patience seems to have been rewarded. After a tough round of interviews, Mr. Bloomfield just received an internship at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: Absorbing The Blows That Buffet Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Nadim Audi contributed reporting.

 BODY:
QUIMPER, France -- HB-Henriot is one of the oldest companies in France, an artisanal producer of faience -- hand-painted glazed earthenware -- since 1690. The company was founded here in Brittany for its waterpower and riverbed clay.
 The salting of the River Odet has rendered local clay unusable, because the salt causes the earthenware to crack in the kilns. But the company remains, having absorbed a rival in 1968, as one of two faienceries in the region, and holds a plaque from the government as an ''enterprise du patrimoine vivant'' -- a company of the living heritage of France.
 That designation brings HB-Henriot no money, said its director general, Michel Merle, and it has been hit hard by Asian competition, a weak dollar and the economic crisis in its main export markets in the United States and Japan. 
 Still, the French government stepped up early, helping to save the company and its 54 jobs, Mr. Merle said. Paris accelerated payments and tax reimbursements to small and medium-size companies; it deferred tax payments and accepted deductions immediately, auditing them later; it gave subsidies equal to almost a month's salary per worker so firms could reduce labor costs and inventory without losing employees. And Paris provided some credit guarantees, so that shell-shocked banks were more willing to make loans to small companies like this one.
 HB-Henriot is a prime example of how France is not only weathering the economic storm, but has emerged as one of the most stable economies in Europe, the first to pull out of recession and with unexpectedly large growth in the last quarter of 2009, while the German recovery stalled.
 France moved early. It concentrated on saving companies and jobs, sometimes to the annoyance of its European Union partners; emphasized investment in job-creating infrastructure; propped up its banks and pressed them to lend; and decided to let its budget deficit expand further for a few years, but in moderation.
 As Greece struggles to avoid default or bailout, Spain and Portugal watch anxiously, Sweden falls back into recession, Germany argues about historically high budget deficits and Britain grapples with deficits and debt of Greek proportions while France looks both solid and even wise.
 But France was also lucky, neither as export-oriented as Germany nor as go-go as Britain and the United States. Alexandre Delaigue, an economist with a popular blog, econoclaste, said simply: ''France was hit less because its real estate was less important than Ireland and Spain, its finance less important than the U.K., and it was less exposed to Eastern Europe than Germany.''
 France's recession was not nearly as deep as Germany's, let alone that of the United States. Growth for this year is forecast to be positive but modest at about 1.2 percent, about the same as in Germany, compared with 0.7 percent for Europe as a whole and with 2.2 percent in the United States. But French banks are in better condition than those in Germany, and France is far less dependent than Germany on finding markets for manufactured and luxury goods.
 French policy is far from perfect, with unemployment increasing, especially among youth, along with the budget deficit and the already high national debt, issues that will outlast the crisis. The government now promises to cut growth in total public spending to less than 1 percent a year from 2011 and get the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, although its growth forecasts seem too high and tax increases may be necessary, despite steady denials.
 But in general the verdict is positive for President Nicolas Sarkozy and his government, which moved quickly to recognize a crisis and exercise state powers.
 ''France resisted the crisis better than most of her European partners and got out of recession first,'' said Prime Minister Francois Fillon.
 Mr. Fillon, Patrick Devedjian, the minister in charge of implementing the recovery plan, and Christine Lagarde, the minister of economic affairs, industry and employment, are given a lot of the credit.
 In an interview, Ms. Lagarde said: ''I think we've done relatively and reasonably well. We applied the three 't's': timely, temporary and targeted.'' France decided to put half its package into investment and half into stimulus, she said, concentrating on small and medium enterprises, since they are ''more agile'' and represent 95 percent of the two million registered French companies.
 A key decision, she said, was to accelerate state payments. ''We swamped companies with cash, with whatever was due them, because we knew the cash and credit situations were difficult,'' she said. Credit insurance was extended to exporters, a government agency guaranteed loans and shared them with banks, and the government created a sovereign fund to invest in companies.
 Mr. Sarkozy created a ''credit mediator'' to intervene between companies and banks upon appeal and push the banks to reconsider, a process Ms. Lagarde said worked in 65 percent of cases, involving 16,000 companies and 150,000 jobs.
 A year ago, he had announced a $34 billion stimulus plan over two years that propped up the car industry and went to infrastructure projects. Then in December, he announced a $52 billion investment package, called ''the Big Loan,'' supposedly aimed at the future, to put money into universities, renewable energy and electric cars. More than 60 percent of the money will be borrowed by the government, and the rest is supposed to come from bank repayments of capital the state pushed on them a year ago.
 Jacques Mistral, an economist at the French Institute for International Relations, said that ''what Sarkozy did for the recovery has been pretty well designed and managed -- he had a good early view of the seriousness of the crisis, earlier than most of his counterparts.'' Mr. Sarkozy was quick with a stimulus package, but modest with it, too, given the already large French debt.
 But for some critics, the French success is hardly surprising, and has more to do with the structure of the economy than with government policy. The size of the state sector -- the sheer number of state employees, protected in their jobs and salaries -- went some way to cushion the recession and keep up consumption. About a quarter of the labor force works for government, and more than half of gross domestic product is due to stems from state spending, including pensions and health care.
 The main reason France did well was that its economy was ''neither virtuous nor vicious,'' said Daniel Cohen, professor of economics at the Ecole Normale Superieure. France was never as virtuous as Germany with its competitive, export-driven economy, which suffered badly when consumption dropped worldwide. In fact, France has long been losing market share in world trade.
 ''France was not dependent on a bubble of credit like the British or on a bubble of housing like the Spanish or on both of them together, like the Americans,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''So we suffered less than the others.''
 Economists worry about cumulative French debt, nearing $2 trillion, and rising fast as a percentage of gross domestic product. G.D.P. It has gone from 22 percent of G.D.P. in 1981, when Francois Mitterrand took power, to 63.8 percent in 2007, when Mr. Sarkozy took over. Insee, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, projects it could reach 81.5 percent in 2012.
 But what really sets France apart is the size of its high debt combined with high levels of public spending, with the government deficit in 2010 expected to be 8.2 percent of G.D.P. Mr. Delaigue says that given the crisis, ''it would be suicidal now to try to balance the budget. For the time being, there is no other way than debt.''
 But the economists point out that both Mr. Sarkozy and his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, men of the right, have for years been cutting taxes while increasing government spending, which is why the budget deficit rose so quickly, even before the crisis.
 The stimulus program is only a small part of the projected budget deficit, Mr. Cohen said. Nearly half represents structural deficit, given tax cuts and increased social spending on an aging population, with a generous pension system that Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Fillon say must be reformed. Over the last 10 years, income from taxes has fallen $80 billion a year, representing a third of next year's deficit.
 ''After the crisis there will have to be a moment of truth on how much structural deficit you can live with,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''The government is saying, 'No tax increase,' but how long will this last?''
 As for HB-Henriot, with a new owner and new American distributor, it is trying to raise exports from 10 percent of its business to 30 percent, through ties to specialty stores like Pierre Deux.
 ''We're an artisanal product in a niche market,'' said Mr. Merle, the director general. ''We try to develop a market of the 'coup de coeur,' where the heart speaks before the wallet.''
 But the company will only survive if exports reach 50 percent of sales, he said. So its representatives are traveling to trade fairs in the United States, with French government advice and aid for travel, and it is also exploring collaboration with larger chains with online catalogs, like Williams-Sonoma in the United States.
 ''You have to go and get your clients,'' Mr. Merle said. ''It's necessary to be there, to occupy the terrain.''
 Otherwise despite all the state aid, and all the rhetoric about national identity and patrimony from French politicians, HB-Henriot too, like the auto companies, will have to consider outsourcing French jobs to compete with cheap Asian imports.

HEADLINE: 'The Hurt Locker' Wins Big in Split Night at Oscars

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES. 
Melena Ryzik contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
''The Hurt Locker,'' a little-seen war film with big backing from the critics, pushed past ''Avatar'' and other crowd-pleasers to win the best picture Oscar at a Sunday night ceremony here, while its director, Kathryn Bigelow, became the first woman to win the directing award.
 ''Avatar'' and ''The Hurt Locker'' had come into the night as favorites, but the smaller film took the prize from the bigger in the end. 
 ''There's no other way to describe it, it's the moment of a lifetime,'' said Ms. Bigelow in accepting her award. It was presented by Barbra Streisand, who announced it with the words, ''Well, the time has come.'' 
 Mark Boal, a producer of ''The Hurt Locker,'' said of his modest expectations when the movie was shot back in 2007, ''Hopefully, we would find a distributor and somebody might even like the movie.'' 
 There was no mention of a last-minute embarrassment in which a fellow producer of the film, Nicolas Chartier, had been banned from the show for violating Oscar rules by urging academy members by e-mail messages to vote against a film assumed to be ''Avatar,'' which had the advantage of a vast budget and enormous popularity.
 In a sense, the awards season had shaped up into a showdown between James Cameron, who directed ''Avatar,'' and Ms. Bigelow, who was previously married to Mr. Cameron. 
 Among other winners, Christoph Waltz took best supporting actor at the start of a sluggishly paced ceremony for his bilingual performance as a Jew-hunting Nazi officer in ''Inglourious Basterds.'' And also, as expected, Mo'Nique won for best supporting actress for her portrait of a terrifying mother in ''Precious: Based on the Novel 'Push' by Sapphire.'' With no excess of modesty, Mo'Nique thanked the academy's members for showing that ''it can be about the performance, not the politics.'' The remark was a reference not just to her considerable talent, but to the fact that she had refused to spend time playing the usual Oscar campaign game. Backstage, she blamed the media for trying to stir up a controversy. 
 Jeff Bridges, a multiple nominee and now first-time winner, took best actor for his gritty portrayal of a broken-down country singer in ''Crazy Heart.'' A darling of the Hollywood crowd, Mr. Bridges had been seen as the designated winner almost from the moment Fox Searchlight made a last-minute decision to drop the low-budget movie into the Oscar race. ''Thank you, Mom and Dad, for turning me on to such a groovy profession,'' said the gray-bearded Mr. Bridges, who brought the crowd to its feet in a prolonged ovation as he whooped, hollered and showed obvious joy in the moment.
 ''Crazy Heart,'' one of the evening's smaller contenders, also took an Oscar for its theme song, ''The Weary Kind,'' by Ryan Bingham and T Bone Burnett.
 Sandra Bullock, who had been pointed toward an Oscar since winning a bellwether Screen Actors Guild award, won best actress for her performance as a tough and loving contemporary Southern mother in ''The Blind Side.'' Like Mr. Bridges, she was clearly a favorite of those in the auditorium, though she had never been nominated before and had been best known for romantic comedies like ''The Proposal'' and the occasional action film, like ''Speed.''
 ''Did I really earn this, or did I just wear you all down?'' Ms. Bullock asked her cheering peers.
 ''Up in the Air'' was shut out, although the movie, about a corporate operative who specializes in firing people, had propped up the long awards season with appearances at various prize ceremonies on both coasts and in England by George Clooney, its star, and Jason Reitman, the writer-director. 
 The show clocked in at a relatively long three hours and 32 minutes, but at times it felt longer than it actually was. That was mostly because the first half was loaded with clip samples and retrospectives, while the latter part moved along with the speed that one of its producers, Bill Mechanic, had promised in advance.
 Before the bigger awards were announced, there was a trip back to ''The Dark Knight,'' as Morgan Freeman explained how sound editors handled a movie from an earlier year, and a lengthy string of excerpts from horror movies, in an effort to reach fans who do not find movies like the ''Twilight'' series on the show.
 The pace had already slowed with the screening of highlights -- and the introduction of two recipients, Roger Corman and Lauren Bacall -- from an honorary-awards ceremony that had been moved off-camera to a November date, precisely to keep the show from slowing. 
 This came only a few minutes after a narrator took time to read chunks of script over clips from the best adapted screenplay nominees. But Geoffrey Fletcher, a first-time nominee who won for ''Precious,'' put some heart in the proceedings as he gasped and seemed to weep in accepting. ''I thank everyone,'' Mr. Fletcher said simply.
 Going into the evening, Mr. Cameron's 3-D blockbuster, ''Avatar,'' was expected to dominate the evening along with the smaller, intense film ''The Hurt Locker.'' 
 But it was not until nearly halfway through that ''Avatar'' won its first award, for art direction. It was presented by Sigourney Weaver, one of the film's stars, who sounded relieved as she opened the envelope and spoke the film's title. Awards for cinematography and visual effects followed. But ''The Hurt Locker'' had already won for its original screenplay, sound editing and sound mixing, and later added one for film editing, ending any thought that Hollywood's behind-the-scenes types might have rallied behind ''Avatar.''
 For most of the night the ceremony put in sharp relief a split between the 5,777 voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who in many categories continued a recent tradition of honoring small, independent-style movies, and their own broadcast, which played heavily into the big movies.
 Ms. Bullock, from a crowd-pleaser, ''The Blind Side,'' took the stage as a presenter and was the subject of congenial jokes about her career, which has been heavier on commerce than art, with movies like ''The Proposal'' and ''Miss Congeniality.''
 ''Avatar,'' meanwhile, was a constant presence. Ms. Weaver, Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington, the film's stars, were all presenters. From an Oscar stage that was bathed in blue for most of the night, presenters and hosts aimed quips at Mr. Cameron, who had a Na'vi blue kerchief (a reference to characters in ''Avatar'') in the pocket of his tuxedo and generally traded on the film's vast popularity in a clear bid to hold viewers, even as the prizes were sprinkled among other films, many of which had made only a small mark at the box office.
 The best documentary feature award, presented by Matt Damon, went to ''The Cove,'' a film that exposed the slaughter of dolphins in a Japanese village. The best foreign language feature, presented by Pedro Almodovar and Quentin Tarantino, went to ''The Secret in Their Eyes'' (''El Secreto de Sus Ojos'') from Argentina.
 Mr. Boal's original screenplay for ''The Hurt Locker'' made an expected mark for that film. In accepting the prize Mr. Boal talked of his experience as a war correspondent, and dedicated the Oscar to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 In more of a surprise, Geoffrey Fletcher won the award for best adapted screenplay for ''Precious.'' 
 The Walt Disney Company's ''Up,'' about a septuagenarian's wild balloon ride, won for best animated feature. The prize for ''Up'' was very much according to the script: it was the fifth computer-animated blockbuster from Disney's Pixar unit to win the animation Oscar since the category was created for the pictures released in 2001.
 In keeping with the straight-ahead nature of the proceedings, clips from the 10 best-picture nominees were shown throughout the show, while another set of clips honored the movies of John Hughes, the comic filmmaker of movies like ''Pretty in Pink'' and ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' who died last year without ever having been nominated for an Oscar during his prolific career.
 The ceremony seemed to drag a bit as a result, and, less than an hour in, was already drawing complaints about pacing from a bevy of second-guessers who expressed their opinions online.
 As the show opened at the Kodak Theater, the Oscar co-hosts, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, dropped onto the stage from above, holding hands. The two traded quips in a monologue that tweaked a whole string of nominees.
 ''Over here is the 'Inglourious Basterds' section,'' Mr. Martin said. 
 ''And over here are the people who made the movie,'' joined Mr. Baldwin, Martin-and-Lewis style. The two donned 3-D glasses to peer at Mr. Cameron, director of ''Avatar.''
 It was a comfortable, by-the-numbers beginning for a show that promised to pit Hollywood's Davids against some movie Goliaths before it ended. 
 With the sun finally peeking through the clouds after an off-and-on drizzle on Sunday afternoon, celebrities began to swarm the red carpet outside the theater, where the Academy Awards would be presented. Many first-time nominees still seemed surprised that they had actually made it to the end of what had been a longer-than-usual awards season. 
 Mr. Clooney, nominated for best actor for ''Up in the Air,'' said he was not sure whether the decision to expand this year's field of best-picture nominees from 5 to 10 would benefit filmmaking, but he thought it would be good for the Oscar telecast. ''You can get more people on it,'' he said. ''I think it's sort of like making the basket bigger in the basketball court so more points get scored.''
 In the gown parade before the ceremony began, Suzy Amis, who is married to Mr. Cameron, made something more than a fashion statement by wearing the movie's signature Na'vi blue, as did several actresses and other women on hand. But Ms. Weaver apparently did not get the memo: she showed up in bright red.
 During the ceremony, Ben Stiller appeared in Na'vi blueface and tail to present the make-up award, which went to ''Star Trek.'' (''Avatar'' was not nominated in the category.) He sputtered nonsense lines in what mimicked an alien language that had been created for ''Avatar,'' and said, ''That means, 'This seemed like a better idea at the time.' '' 
 Adam Shankman, a producer of the telecast and a judge on the Fox reality show ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' choreographed an aggressive dance number to open the show that was marked by a Las Vegas sensibility. Participating in the ceremony were 36 ''opening dancers'' and 33 ''score suite'' dancers.
 Even before the show began, the year's awards had made some bits of Oscar history. Lee Daniels, with ''Precious,'' became the first black director to have a best-picture nominee, while Ms. Bigelow (''The Hurt Locker'') was only the fourth woman -- along with Jane Campion, Sofia Coppola and Lina Wertmuller -- to have been nominated for best director. 
 The Oscar season was stretched by two weeks to make room for the Winter Olympics, but managed to culminate with renewed frivolity. The expanded best-picture field meant more cocktail parties, and there was little holding back the flow of Champagne, unlike the last two years when a threatened actors' strike and then the global recession made the bacchanal take on a more somber tone (at least publicly).
 On Friday ''Precious'' dominated Film Independent's Spirit Awards at a tent show in downtown Los Angeles, taking prizes for best picture and director, among others. On Saturday Harvey Weinstein presided over a party in West Hollywood for nominees from ''Inglourious Basterds,'' ''Nine'' and ''A Single Man,'' all distributed by his Weinstein Company. 
 Outside the theater before the ceremony, the acres of red carpet came alive with a stronger turnout of stars and executives than in years past, when many had been staying home in silent protest of the Academy's turn away from splashy, big-budget pictures in favor of the arty and small. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday referred imprecisely to the character in ''Inglourious Basterds'' played by Christoph Waltz, who won the award for best supporting actor. The Nazi officer he plays speaks four languages, not two. In some copies the article also misstated part of a comment by Ben Stiller, who wore makeup to appear like a Na'vi in ''Avatar'' when he presented the award for best makeup. He said that it seemed like a better idea ''in rehearsal,'' not ''at the time.''

HEADLINE: Sure-Fire Crowd Pleaser: Reining In Wall Street

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
For President Obama and Congressional Democrats, public opinion this past year has mostly gone in the wrong direction -- on his job performance, on health care and economic stimulus, on midterm elections.
 But there's one conspicuous exception: the president's call for reining in Wall Street. The nation's continuing angst over bailouts, bonuses and bad mortgages has made sure of that. 
 Three-fifths of Americans supported tougher regulation of Wall Street in April 2009, according to Pew Research Center polling. Despite rising disaffection with government, three fifths still supported it last month. 
 That explains why Senate Republicans, after throwing up a wall of opposition on health care, continue negotiating with their Democratic counterparts on financial regulation. It also explains why the White House, Democratic leaders and liberal activists believe they hold the upper hand -- and an issue that could limit their expected November losses.
 ''The anger is much greater at the financial industry than it is at the health care industry,'' said Steve Hildebrand, a Democratic consultant who helped run Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. ''Once health care is over, this will be given a lot of attention by the president and by Democrats.''
 Big Finance in Action
 Regulatory details on derivative investments, systemic risk and capital requirements can be so arcane as to make the sprawling health care system appear simple by comparison. That's normally a circumstance in which affected industries exercise maximum influence on lawmaking.
 Big Finance is trying. Banks, insurance, securities and other financial firms spent some $382 million on lobbying in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The finance, insurance and real estate sectors have given $102 million to 2010 election campaigns, a majority to the Democrats who control Congress.
 So far industry lobbyists have wielded their influence quietly, as health care dominates the public dialogue. Republicans believe the issue's obscurity has minimized Democrats' ability to turn the politics of Wall Street against them, even as the minority party resists tax and regulatory elements of the administration's agenda.
 ''I have been most struck by how invisible the issue has been as part of the public debate,'' said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster. Unless voters ''understand what it is and why it matters,'' he added, ''it's unlikely to have much consequence in the campaign.''
 But the issue may soon assume a higher profile. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, plans to send a bill to the floor for debate later this month.
 If health care has commanded winter political headlines, Democratic leaders see financial regulation as a chance for springtime renewal. Their goal is Senate passage, and a compromise with the already-passed House version, by July 4.
 G.O.P. Uncertainty
 Frank Luntz, the Republican political wordsmith, assured opponents of financial regulation legislation in a recent strategy memo that ''Washington's incompetence'' represents ''your critical advantage.'' By linking Mr. Obama's effort to financial industry bailouts, he argued, opponents can leverage public anger against Democrats. In that effort, the left may prove to have been an unwitting ally of Republicans with its repeated complaints that Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, the White House economic adviser, are themselves too close to Wall Street.
 Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant, pointed to another edge: with Americans most anxious about unemployment, calling for stricter regulation of Wall Street is ''not a growth argument, it's a punishment argument.''
 But the actions of Senate Republicans suggest they are not so sure. The ranking Banking Committee Republican, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, has returned to discussions with Mr. Dodd, after earlier reaching an impasse and watching his junior colleague, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, step up as Mr. Dodd's Republican interlocutor.
 And the reaction of key Democrats to those talks suggests that they agree with a Democratic pollster, Celinda Lake, that ''the fight over financial reform is one that progressives absolutely want to have.'' 
 Negotiations have largely revolved around the location and authority of a new consumer protection unit. After the industry objected to Mr. Obama's idea for a new agency, Mr. Dodd entertained Republican suggestions that it be housed in the Treasury Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and, most recently, the Federal Reserve.
 Democratic activists and influential legislators like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York balked at the last idea, citing the Fed's weak reputation as a regulator. Some industry lobbyists now expect that bipartisan negotiations will break down -- but that a bill drafted by Democrats will be enacted anyway with a few Republican defections.
 If so, that may be because financial regulation gives Democrats a rare opportunity to tap the Tea Party populism that Republicans have exploited on health care. In an otherwise polarized environment, two-thirds of Democrats, Republicans and independents share an unfavorable view of major banks and financial institutions, the Pew Research Center found last month.
 ''In this environment,'' concluded Andrew Kohut, the center's director, ''Wall Street is pretty inflammatory.''

HEADLINE: Why Does JPMorgan Trade at Book Value?

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
 Jamie Dimon needs an even better postcrisis. The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase runs one of the only major banks in the United States that did not post a quarterly loss during the crash. And he has maneuvered his firm into a strong position to grow as the economy rebounds. But investors don't yet seem convinced that it will.
 The shares have been stuck trading around book value, or assets less liabilities, since last summer. Put in perspective, that's not all bad. They had tumbled to less than half that in the depths of the crisis. But to price the bank now at only a fraction more than breakup value seems overly cautious. Another crisis outperformer, Wells Fargo, by comparison, trades at 1.4 times book. 
 The two lenders are more equal using another measure. Investors value Wells at 14.8 times this year's expected earnings, and JPMorgan at a multiple of 13.9. This still means, however, that Mr. Dimon's bank is getting no credit for a faster growth rate. Analysts reckon its net income should jump by a third this year compared with just 8 percent at Wells. Moreover, by 2011 JPMorgan could be earning twice what it did in 2009, and Wells 65 percent more.
 At first glance, JPMorgan looks unfairly penalized. After all, both banks are heavily exposed to consumer loans. JPMorgan expects its credit card unit will lose as much as $2 billion in the first half of this year and that quarterly losses on its mortgage loans may be still higher than last year. Both banks will also lose income from legislation limiting credit card and overdraft charges, perhaps as much as $1.25 billion for JPMorgan. And Mr. Dimon still sees a chance of a double-dip recession.
 The difference is that JPMorgan has a much larger investment bank. It accounted for nearly three-fifths of last year's profit as the consumer arm suffered. When equilibrium eventually returns, it should represent less than a third of the bank's earnings. Mr. Dimon's fortress balance sheet and solid risk management helped the investment bank solidify its position as a top-tier adviser and underwriter.
 The investment bank faces numerous uncertainties. Sure, it generated some $2 billion of revenue from or for JPMorgan's commercial bank and treasury services last year. But the unit requires more capital than any other business and has the lowest return on equity target, at 17 percent.
 And investment bank trading desks will need to perform without higher leverage as bid-offer spreads narrow further. New regulation looms, and only some of the costs can be estimated so far.
 Shifting derivatives trading onto exchanges could shave $300 million off JPMorgan's revenue. The proposed bank levy to help the federal government recoup losses on the Troubled Asset Relief Program could cost JPMorgan more than $1 billion a year. The Volcker Rule, if enacted, would ban proprietary trading and some other businesses, curbing trading income. And there's no guarantee Washington is finished changing the rules on Wall Street.
 JPMorgan will have more than regulation to contend with. Most of its competitors stumbled -- or disappeared -- in the crisis. That allowed the House of Dimon to become the best bank for credit. It proudly boasts it lent or underwrote $824 billion last year, $250 billion more than any one of its rivals. But the liquidity advantage is waning. Bank of America, for one, is in a better position to put its balance sheet, and consequently its bankers at Merrill Lynch, to work.
 There may still be a Bill Winters effect too. The ousted but admired co-head of JPMorgan's investment bank has yet to land elsewhere. When he does, and depending on where, former colleagues may be inclined to join him. While hardly a threat to the franchise, losing even a few top deal makers could be enough to dent revenue and morale.
 Mr. Dimon may have more carrots for shareholders though. He's one of the few chief executives who can credibly dangle the prospect of raising the dividend this year. And JPMorgan has enough excess capital -- perhaps as much as $20 billion in reserves alone -- which, once deployed, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, could add at least 16 percent to earnings.
 For JPMorgan to trade at book value appears overly harsh. But the three-year rough ride in the banking sector -- and investment banking in particular -- is keeping investors cautious. Having a good crisis, it seems, just isn't good enough.

HEADLINE: China Blames U.S. for Strained Relations

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The blame for friction in Chinese-United States relations ''does not lie with China,'' and it is up to the United States to take steps to repair the frayed ties, China's foreign minister repeated Sunday. 
 The minister, Yang Jiechi, said at a news conference that the administration of President Obama had seriously disrupted the relationship by announcing the sale of weapons to Taiwan and holding a White House meeting with the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, in a three-week period this year. 
 China suspended military exchanges with Washington and threatened other reprisals after the American moves. American officials have expressed frustration with China's trade policies, including its refusal to revalue its currency, and with Beijing's reluctance to press Iran to open its nuclear program to international inspection.
 Mr. Yang restated that reluctance on Sunday, saying that diplomacy with Iran was a better path than sanctions.
 Two top American officials visited Beijing for talks on the relationship last week in what a State Department spokesman had called an attempt to ''get back to business as quickly as possible.'' But Chinese officials have yet to temper their public criticisms of American policies. 
 Speaking to journalists at the National People's Congress, China's unelected legislature, Mr. Yang did not say whether the visit had made progress toward better relations. He said Chinese officials had complained that American actions had violated the terms of communiques and a joint statement that the two nations issued when Mr. Obama visited Beijing last November. 
 After decades of comparatively quiet diplomacy, China has taken increasingly muscular stances in the past year on relations with the United States and on global economic and environmental matters. Many analysts say the shift is due not only to China's sudden arrival as a global economic power after the financial crisis, but also to domestic political issues. 
 The ruling Communist Party will select successors to President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in 2012. In the jockeying to choose new leaders, some analysts say, there is scant incentive to take positions that rivals could criticize as weak. 
 Mr. Yang said, however, that China was not being unnecessarily tough, but was merely protecting its core interests. ''We stick to our principles, which is totally different from being tough,'' the official news agency, Xinhua, quoted Mr. Yang as saying. 
 Mr. Yang reiterated China's longstanding opposition to imposing further economic sanctions against Iran's government for its refusal to allow international inspectors to monitor its nuclear program. China is considered the main holdout against sanctions among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. 
 ''We don't think diplomatic efforts have been exhausted,'' Mr. Yang said.

HEADLINE: Adjusting to Reality

BYLINE: By ALICIA H. MUNNELL and ANDREW G. BIGGS. 
Alicia H. Munnell is a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers and the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Andrew G. Biggs is a former deputy commissioner of Social Security and a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

 BODY:
THE danger of having the government regularly disperse hundreds of billions of dollars is that we can grow careless about how we spend a mere $14 billion. A case in point is a plan to pay out checks to everyone receiving Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and disabled veteran benefits. The reason? To compensate them for not receiving a cost-of-living adjustment this year. 
 Though the Senate recently rejected an amendment that would give each recipient $250, President Obama has signaled support for the idea, and an identical bill in the House is gaining support. 
 This is a mistake. With the deficit expected to reach 10.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2010, it's important that we spend every dollar wisely. 
 Such one-time payments are a bad idea on two fronts. First, they suggest that Social Security recipients are being treated unfairly with respect to the program's cost-of-living adjustments. They are not. Second, the payments would give money to those who are relatively unaffected by the financial crisis. 
 The Social Security adjustment is intended to maintain the purchasing power of benefits once recipients retire. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments are calculated every October by comparing the third-quarter Consumer Price Index for Urban Workers with the previous year's numbers; if an adjustment is needed, it's made the following January. 
 But in 2008, this time lag led to an unnecessary adjustment: rising energy prices in the fall of 2008 called for a 5.8 percent increase in benefits to be paid starting in January 2009; however, before the adjustment went into effect, prices plummeted by nearly 5 percent. As a result, Social Security recipients got a benefit increase to compensate for a price increase that no longer existed. 
 Social Security never reduces benefits when prices decline. This is perfectly equitable and does not disadvantage Social Security recipients in any way. In fact, they come out a little bit ahead because the real value of their benefits has increased, at least for a while -- a fact that many recipients and lawmakers don't seem to understand, hence the political push to dispense one-time payments. 
 True, Medicare premiums could rise in the meantime, but that affects only the richest beneficiaries; for everyone else, Medicare premiums are not allowed to increase in a year without a cost-of-living adjustment. Moreover, some have argued that the Consumer Price Index for urban workers, which is based on the spending habits of working-age Americans, doesn't capture the larger role of health care expenses for retirees. 
 But price declines were so large this time that even if the adjustments had been calculated using an experimental index focused on spending by the elderly, there would still have been no adjustment. Why? While elderly people spend more on health care, they also spend a lot on gasoline and heating oil, where prices dropped precipitously. 
 If the payments can't be justified on equity grounds, how about the stimulus argument? After all, in a recession it always helps to have consumers with more pocket money. But retirees did all right over the last few years. Social Security checks went out on schedule. Those with financial assets suffered, but the market has recovered substantially. The real burden has landed on those who have lost their jobs, so money to the unemployed would pack more punch than money to those with a steady income. 
 Even if we had a spare $14 billion, there's no case for giving it to Social Security recipients on either equity or stimulus grounds. But we don't -- we face large and growing deficits for the foreseeable future. The economy may still require additional stimulus to help reduce the atrocious level of unemployment. But we need to spend that money intelligently -- and every $14 billion counts.

HEADLINE: Turkey and the Army

 BODY:
The recent arrest or detention of dozens of Turkish military officers for alleged coup plotting could signal a significant shift in power from the tarnished army to civilian leadership. These cases could help strengthen Turkish democracy -- provided the government and the judiciary scrupulously apply the rule of law. 
 For most of modern Turkey's history, the army has been dominant, and far too willing to use any means to keep Turkey a secular, Western-oriented state. That included overthrowing four democratically elected governments since 1960. As recently as 2007, the military tried to block the selection of Abdullah Gul of the Islamic-influenced Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.) as president largely on the ground that his wife wore an Islamic headscarf. 
 The military's hold on political life has weakened steadily under A.K.P. rule and pressure from the European Union, which has insisted that as part of Ankara's bid for membership, the military must become more accountable to civilian leaders.
 The recent detentions and arrests came after a small independent newspaper, Taraf, published what it said were military documents from a 2003 meeting describing preparations for a coup. The military acknowledged the meeting but said it was focused only on protecting the country from external, not domestic, threats. Since the arrests, the military's top leaders have shown welcome restraint. 
 Meanwhile, relations with the United States hit a new rut on Thursday when the House Foreign Affairs Committee denounced the World War I mass killings of Armenians as genocide. We think the resolution was unnecessary, just as Ankara's denial of that tragedy is self-destructive. Instead of threatening Washington with retaliation for the vote, Ankara should focus on getting a normalization deal with Armenia back on track.
 The United States and other Western countries need to keep nudging Turkey forward while keeping the hope of E.U. membership alive and credible. 
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan needs to curb his own autocratic tendencies and push for replacing the military-imposed constitution with one that enshrines rights for Kurds and other minorities, religious and press freedoms, a commitment to secular rule and a law-based judiciary. And Turkey's military leaders need to continue exercising restraint.

HEADLINE: The Anti-Abortion Message to Blacks

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''To Court Blacks, Foes of Abortion Make Racial Case'' (front page, Feb. 27):
 Abortion within the African-American community should be discussed in its proper context. Disproportionately high abortion rates among black women are a direct result of their higher rates of unintended pregnancy, which in turn reflect economic and social inequalities that are widespread and pervasive. 
 A result is stark disparities not only on various reproductive health outcomes, but also on a broad range of health indicators, including high rates of diabetes, heart disease, AIDS and cancer. Anti-abortion activists ignore these systemic inequities and instead -- falsely and cynically -- accuse abortion providers of targeting minority communities. 
 Rather than promoting bogus conspiracy theories, let's focus on making comprehensive sex education and affordable contraceptive services universally available to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion. And let's get serious about providing better health care and more educational and economic opportunities for black women.
 Sharon L. Camp President and Chief Executive Guttmacher Institute New York, March 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As one who sees the so-called woman's right to choose as an assault on constitutional protections that endangers all Americans, I am particularly saddened by the devastation that legalized abortion has unleashed on unborn African-Americans. How many more George Washington Carvers will America destroy before it realizes that abortion is not only tragic but also nationally destructive?
 We now know that there is a link between abortion legalization and the increases in the rates of some sexually transmitted diseases. That link has been established statistically as ''causal.'' 
 The title of the book by the reformed abortionist Dr. Bernard Nathanson summarizes well what we are doing as a nation. We are ''aborting America,'' along with, of course, the constitutional protections of persons that made this nation great.
 Mr. President, as important as universal health care certainly is, the protection of unborn Americans of all races from the ravages of elective abortion is an even more urgent national priority. 
 Richard H. Escobales Jr.
 Buffalo, March 1, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Assuming that all black women who obtain abortions are victims of racism rather than willing recipients of a medical procedure they deem necessary is truly racist.
 Jeremiah D. Braunlin Wyckoff, N.J., Feb. 28, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Too often, the effects of becoming a mother too soon include an interrupted education, curtailed career opportunities and greater likelihood of a lifetime of poverty for the both the mother and the child. The best tools to combat this include comprehensive sex education, empowerment and the means for young women to control their own reproductive lives.
 On the other hand, if one wanted to inflict harm on the black community, it seems to me that fomenting paranoid fantasies about genocide and restricting women's choices might be exactly the way to go.

HEADLINE: An Irish Mirror

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Everyone has a theory about the financial crisis. These theories range from the absurd to the plausible -- from claims that liberal Democrats somehow forced banks to lend to the undeserving poor (even though Republicans controlled Congress) to the belief that exotic financial instruments fostered confusion and fraud. But what do we really know?
 Well, in a way the sheer scale of the crisis -- the way it affected much, though not all, of the world -- is helpful, for research if nothing else. We can look at countries that avoided the worst, like Canada, and ask what they did right -- such as limiting leverage, protecting consumers and, above all, avoiding getting caught up in an ideology that denies any need for regulation. We can also look at countries whose financial institutions and policies seemed very different from those in the United States, yet which cracked up just as badly, and try to discern common causes. 
 So let's talk about Ireland.
 As a new research paper by the Irish economists Gregory Connor, Thomas Flavin and Brian O'Kelly points out, ''Almost all the apparent causal factors of the U.S. crisis are missing in the Irish case,'' and vice versa. Yet the shape of Ireland's crisis was very similar: a huge real estate bubble -- prices rose more in Dublin than in Los Angeles or Miami -- followed by a severe banking bust that was contained only via an expensive bailout. 
 Ireland had none of the American right's favorite villains: there was no Community Reinvestment Act, no Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. More surprising, perhaps, was the unimportance of exotic finance: Ireland's bust wasn't a tale of collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps; it was an old-fashioned, plain-vanilla case of excess, in which banks made big loans to questionable borrowers, and taxpayers ended up holding the bag.
 So what did we have in common? The authors of the new study suggest four '' 'deep' causal factors.''
 First, there was irrational exuberance: in both countries buyers and lenders convinced themselves that real estate prices, although sky-high by historical standards, would continue to rise.
 Second, there was a huge inflow of cheap money. In America's case, much of the cheap money came from China; in Ireland's case, it came mainly from the rest of the euro zone, where Germany became a gigantic capital exporter. 
 Third, key players had an incentive to take big risks, because it was heads they win, tails someone else loses. In Ireland this moral hazard was largely personal: ''Rogue-bank heads retired with their large fortunes intact.'' There was a lot of this in the United States, too: as Harvard's Lucian Bebchuk and others have pointed out, top executives at failed U.S. financial companies received billions in ''performance related'' pay before their firms went belly-up. 
 But the most striking similarity between Ireland and America was ''regulatory imprudence'': the people charged with keeping banks safe didn't do their jobs. In Ireland, regulators looked the other way in part because the country was trying to attract foreign business, in part because of cronyism: bankers and property developers had close ties to the ruling party. 
 There was a lot of that here too, but the bigger issue was ideology. Actually, the authors of the Irish paper get this wrong, stressing the way U.S. politicians celebrated the ideal of homeownership; yes, they made speeches along those lines, but this didn't have much effect on lenders' incentives. 
 What really mattered was free-market fundamentalism. This is what led Ronald Reagan to declare that deregulation would solve the problems of thrift institutions -- the actual result was huge losses, followed by a gigantic taxpayer bailout -- and Alan Greenspan to insist that the proliferation of derivatives had actually strengthened the financial system. It was largely thanks to this ideology that regulators ignored the mounting risks.
 So what can we learn from the way Ireland had a U.S.-type financial crisis with very different institutions? Mainly, that we have to focus as much on the regulators as on the regulations. By all means, let's limit both leverage and the use of securitization -- which were part of what Canada did right. But such measures won't matter unless they're enforced by people who see it as their duty to say no to powerful bankers. 
 That's why we need an independent agency protecting financial consumers -- again, something Canada did right -- rather than leaving the job to agencies that have other priorities. And beyond that, we need a sea change in attitudes, a recognition that letting bankers do what they want is a recipe for disaster. If that doesn't happen, we will have failed to learn from recent history -- and we'll be doomed to repeat it.
