HEADLINE: Hydropower Under Review In Albany Bill

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 16

 BODY:
Making a highly unusual foray into foreign policy that New York power officials denounced as unconstitutional, the state Assembly today approved a bill that would require an exhaustive environmental review before New York State could buy power from a enormous hydroelectric complex that Quebec wants to build in the Canadian subarctic.
The bill, which would aid environmentalists seeking to scuttle or at least delay the project, has generated fierce opposition from the Quebec Government and equally fervent support from Cree Indians who live in the affected region and whose leaders have traveled to Albany to urge its passage. 
 The fight now moves to the Republican-controlled State Senate, where officials said the measure's fate is uncertain.
New York has been intricately drawn into the controversy over Hydro-Quebec's planned expansion of hydroelectric plants in the remote James Bay region because the state is by far the largest foreign customer for the power and because, several Canadian analysts said, its payments would represent a critical part of the capital Quebec needs for the expansion.
 
Delayed Decision
 Last summer, in the face of environmental complaints and projections of an electricity glut, New York put off until this November a final decision on whether to go ahead with a $19 billion, 20-year contract it signed in 1989 to buy 1,800 megawatts of hydropower a year, roughly enough to supply 10 percent of the state's demand.
The bill passed by the Democratic-led Assembly today, on a vote of 122 to 17, would require the state to delay the decision again, because the review it calls for could not be completed within a few months.
Quebec officials denounced the measure as unwarranted because Canada has already begun at least five different sets of environmental hearings. They say these hearings will help insure that the project, despite warnings from the Cree and many environmental groups, will not destroy the taiga, the wildlife or the Cree way of life in the James Bay area.
The main sponsor of the bill, William B. Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat and the chairman of the Assembly's Energy Committee, argued during a debate in the chamber that the state should back out of the purchase entirely because Hydro-Quebec's plans, which include flooding an area the size of New Jersey and damming parts of 20 wild rivers, will be "an environmental, human rights and economic disaster."
But an opponent of the bill, Chris Ortloff, a Republican of northern New York, countered that by passing it New York was in danger of "throwing away" an opportunity to buy significant amounts of power that would be far cleaner for New Yorkers than generating electricity with oil or coal.
 
'Illegal Intrusion'
 Richard M. Flynn, chairman of the New York Power Authority said that the bill would violate the United States Constitution by giving New York the power to regulate international trade.
"The Assembly unfortunately has passed legislation that calls for an unwarranted and illegal intrusion into the affairs of a foreign country," he said, "and could seriously jeopardize New York's ability to secure low-cost energy supplies from out-of-state sources in the future."
New York already buys 800 megawatts of power during the spring and summer months from Hydro-Quebec, under a contract signed in 1978.
But the new contract has led to far more controversy both because it substantially increases the state's commitment to the power and because the environmental effects of the hydroelectric projects in James Bay have come under increasing scrutiny.
In addition to raising questions about how the flooding and rerouting of rivers will alter the James Bay ecosystem, the Cree have denounced the projects because methyl mercury poisoning caused by decomposition in flooded areas has led Quebec officials to place strict limits on the consumption of fish, a Cree staple.
The ultimate decision on the James Bay power will be up to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has asked his state agencies to conduct their own review of both environmental and economic questions surrounding the contract.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
CLINTON FOES PUSH ELECTABILITY ISSUE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 16

 BODY:
The Michigan and Illinois primary campaigns roared to an angry close today with former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas struggling to raise doubts about Gov. Bill Clinton's ability to win in a general election.
Mr. Brown, who some Democrats believe could knock Mr. Tsongas out of second place in Michigan, pressed a fierce new attack on the ethics of Hillary Clinton's working for a law firm that does business with the State of Arkansas. 
 "There is only one issue," he told reporters outside Detroit today, pushing accusations that he raised at fever pitch in Sunday night's debate. "It's Mr. Clinton and his electability and what are we going to do about this scandal a week."
 
Tsongas Looks to Northeast
 Mr. Tsongas, trying to take the edge off expected losses to the Governor from Arkansas in both states on Tuesday, told reporters in Moline, Ill., today that he would stay in the race until the Democratic National Convention.
"At the convention, there will be one question: Who can beat George Bush?" said Mr. Tsongas, who is already trying to redirect attention to the next major contests in the Northeast, the March 24 primary in Connecticut and the April 7 vote in New York. "Who has an economic message that can attract Republicans and independents?That is the question; you are looking at the answer."
Mr. Clinton, whose aides seem at once flustered by the latest attacks and euphoric over the prospect of taking a major step toward the nomination on Tuesday, fought back today against Mr. Brown, as Mr. Clinton did in the debate on Sunday night in the most venomous exchange of the campaign.
Campaigning in Chicago, Mr. Clinton asserted, "If somebody jumps on my wife, I'm going to jump them back."
Hillary Clinton, with more of a new age appeal, sought to make it an issue of women's rights. "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas," she said. "But what I decided to do was pursue my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life."
Mr. Brown's attack, stemming from a Washington Post article on Sunday, revolves around Mrs. Clinton's position as a partner with the Rose law firm, a major institution in Little Rock, Ark., that represents numerous business clients with potential interests before the state, as well as, on occasion, the state government itself.
Mr. Brown maintained that Mr. Clinton "funnels" state business to his wife's law firm and that the fact of her being a partner is an inherent conflict of interest.
The Clintons flatly dismiss the accusation that the state funnels business to the firm and maintain that there is nothing wrong with Mrs. Clinton's position because she accepts no income from the firm's direct representation of state agencies. They also maintain that Mrs. Clinton does not lobby the state or its agencies, although she was listed on one occasion as representing a friend's savings and loan that was subject to state regulation. Clinton campaign officials say she did not play an active role in the case.
The bitterness of today's exchange reflects the intense struggle under way to slow Mr. Clinton, who had a double-digit lead in both states in polls released this past weekend. There are 295 pledged delegates up for grabs on Tuesday, and Mr. Clinton enters the contest with an already formidable lead from his Super Tuesday sweep: According to a compilation by The New York Times, he has 728 delegates to Mr. Brown's 89 and Mr. Tsongas's 343.
The Clinton campaign manager, David Wilhelm, said Mr. Clinton could emerge from Tuesday with nearly half the 2,145 delegates needed to win the nomination and, because of Democratic primary rules, would be hard to overtake. The rules of proportional representation make it difficult for a candidate to catch fire late in the game, win several big states and catch up with the front-runner, Mr. Wilhelm and several other analysts said.
Many Democrats agree that twin victories for Mr. Clinton on Tuesday will begin a new phase of the campaign. "We're at a transition point in the campaign," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, "where the process becomes much more of a referendum on Bill Clinton than a choice among candidates."
Mr. Clinton's rivals are trying to make "electability" an important part of this referendum. Mr. Brown, in particular, argues that Mr. Clinton has been embroiled in far too many controversies to be a strong opponent against President Bush. "What are we supposed to do?" Mr. Brown demanded. "Wait for George Bush to bring it up?"
The Clinton campaign counters that it has shown, again and again, its ability to take punches and keep on winning. For example, Mr. Wilhelm asserted that Mr. Clinton's angry defense of his wife on Sunday night, when he seemed close to veering from finger-jabbing to actual contact with Mr. Brown, would serve Mr. Clinton well with the voters. "Here's a guy who at the 11th hour does a cheap shot of going after Bill Clinton's wife, and Bill Clinton forthrightly defends her," Mr. Wilhelm said. "He certainly does not have Mike Dukakis's problem."
In a 1988 debate, Michael S. Dukakis was thought to be badly hurt by his cerebral response to a hypothetical question about how he would react to the rape and murder of his wife, Kitty.
The sniping among the candidates today took place at a distance, as all three embarked on a final swing of the industrial Midwest. Mr. Tsongas, whose campaign faltered badly last week on Super Tuesday and had hoped to right itself here, began his day in Chicago, then headed on to Moline and Ann Arbor, Mich. He reiterated his call for a leadership willing to make "hard choices" on the economy, and once again assailed the idea of a middle class tax cut, a pet proposal of Mr. Clinton's.
"I don't want to buy your vote," he told a rally at Moline. "I want to build your future."
Mr. Brown, who has sought to harvest the discontent of many blue-collar voters in Michigan, campaigned around Hamtramck today. If he finishes strongly in that state, some analysts said, he could be a wild card yet again in the New York primray and a vehicle for those who want to stop Mr. Clinton.
"If Brown has a solid second in one of the two, then just like 1976, Brown becomes the un-Clinton," said Sam Popkin, a professor of political science at the University of California at San Diego. That year, Mr. Brown ran strongly in the later primaries, although not strongly enough to stop another Southern front-runner, Jimmy Carter.
John A. Marino, chairman of the New York Democratic Party, said today, "If Brown shows some strength tomorrow, he'll come into New York with a little head of steam."
Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, was poised for passing a major threshold. "It's not conclusive," said Ronald H. Brown Jr., chairman of the Democratic Party. "But certainly if Bill Clinton does what has been predicted by a number of those polls, it would be a giant step toward the nomination."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Why Hasn't G.M. Switched Even One Agency Since '58?

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE auto makers are perhaps the best illustration of advertisers' tendency to dismiss their agencies more frequently during a recession. Since last summer, Isuzu, Mercedes-Benz and Subaru have changed shops, while Jaguar's account has gone into review.
One car maker that is certainly troubled is the largest, General Motors, which plans to close 21 plants and eliminate 74,000 jobs by 1995. Yet, the last time G.M. dismissed one of its national agencies, Dwight D. Eisenhower was President: In 1958, G.M. switched its Buick division from the Kudner agency to McCann-Erickson, where it has remained. 
 Of course, there is no proof of an inverse relationship between the length of time an agency handles an account and the effectiveness or creativity of its work. But in a period when G.M., which spends more than $1 billion a year on advertising, is radically revamping its operations and when critics have intensified complaints about prosaic, uninspiring advertising, will it take seven more Presidential administrations before G.M. dismisses an agency?
"I don't know why they haven't entertained the idea of going to smaller, more creative shops," said Christopher Cedergren, senior vice president at the Auto Pacific Group, an automotive marketing and product consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif. "If I were having problems in a marketplace, I would look at all possible avenues to develop ways of increasing my business."
(Ford last changed an agency in 1979, and Chrysler in 1987.)
In a telephone interview, Philip Guarascio, G.M.'s executive in charge of corporate marketing and advertising in Detroit, passionately supported the penchant of the giant auto maker for decades-long relationships with its agencies.
And in a separate interview, Richard D. O'Connor, chairman and chief executive of Lintas Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., which has created Chevrolet campaigns since 1914, said that his agency worked on that account as if every day could be its last, rather than its 28,500th or so.
"I don't think we have to fire an agency to send a signal," Mr. Guara scio said. "We feel we're able to resolve issues without resorting to that."
He added, "You need to think about our relationships with our agencies as living, as opposed to relationships that are static." For instance, he continued, in recent years, G.M. has begun "to call upon agencies' entire worldwide resources for what we do in the States, rather than working with one isolated parent agency."
As a result, he said, "you've seen tremendous changes at agencies in how they are staffed and who does the staffing. When we think we need a fresh point of view, we can get our agencies to bring in people who can give a point of view that's different."
G.M.'s agencies also "know we're talking with other agencies all the time," Mr. Guarascio added. "In the last three months," he continued, "we had meetings with at least two non-G.M. agencies, to make sure there are no silver bullets out there we're not aware of."
G.M. will occasionally hire other agencies for special projects, he continued, as well as consult with executives like Stephen O. Frankfurt, chairman of Frankfurt Gips Balkind, a small New York advertising, communications and design shop.
As for critics of G.M.'s advertising, Mr. Guarascio said, "A third are agencies looking for car accounts, a third are agencies that had car accounts and lost them, and a third are people who've never written advertising for a living."
"I think, generally speaking, while we're not home yet," he said, "we've turned the corner on some issues more than people give us credit for." He praised campaigns by Lintas Campbell-Ewald for Chevrolet and Geo, McCann for Buick and D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles for Cadillac.
At Lintas Campbell-Ewald, Mr. O'Connor said he was "well aware of the critics of the associations that have existed between the Detroit auto makers and their agencies."
He continued: "It's easy to sit on the outside and pick apart individual ads. All they have to do is come in and demonstrate they can do the job better."
The fact that his agency's 78-year relationship with Chevrolet "looks permanent doesn't permeate our relationship," he said. "I started at this agency in 1956 and I've lived constantly, for almost 36 years, in fear Chevrolet would say, 'We want a new agency,' " he added. "Anybody who feels the account couldn't move tomorrow morning is living with a sense of false security."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Week;
Top Candidates Duck And Hope Nothing Hits

BYLINE: By HOWELL RAINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 16

 BODY:
With the voting here and in Michigan on Tuesday, the first wave of big primaries will be over, and the big news is that the backwash has left both parties with cold feet. Indeed, the front-runners look more like shipwreck victims who have washed up on the beach than sure-handed captains of the ship of state. As a result, a make-the-best-of-it mood has gripped Democrats and Republicans alike.
The rolling psychodrama of Gov. Bill Clinton's campaign has been a blessing for President Bush because it has diverted attention from an equally striking spectacle of the early primaries -- the tattering of a reputation for political competence that he had spent three decades building. 
 Mr. Bush's image of rudderlessness now seems as rooted in the public mind as President Ronald Reagan's out-to-lunchness or President Jimmy Carter's vacillation. To prevent further damage, the Republican hierarchy has signaled Patrick J. Buchanan that enough is enough. After a few face-saving growls, Mr. Buchanan must strike the tent of his medicine show or risk permanent labeling in his own party as the G.O.P.'s snake-oil salesman.
With Mr. Buchanan tamped down, the White House could drag Mr. Bush back to the dressing room, give the public time to forget his squeakiness and try to bring him back at convention time with one of speechwriter Peggy Noonan's patented paeans to manly politics. The political pros still bet that Mr. Bush will be bailed out by the economy and Democratic crashes, but the dispirited Bushies all know that the magic is gone.
If the members of the Washington Democratic establishment could say publicly what they say privately today, it would be this: Even if Clinton wins big in Illinois and Michigan, let's keep Paul E. Tsongas alive. There is near universal agreement that the party has to maintain a fallback candidate in case the Clinton campaign collapses. A smaller number of Democrats keep clinging to the hope that they can inflate the former Senator from Massachusetts into a credible national candidate.
So far, Mr. Tsongas has not managed to convert an image for honesty and his civic-club economics into a salable mainstream campaign message. At this point, future political scientists can credit him with proving that it is hard to win a plurality of Rustbelt Democrats by advocating tax cuts for top contributors to the Republican National Committee. If former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California nicks Mr. Tsongas for second place in Michigan on Tuesday, the Beltway Democrats will look toward the New York primary on April 7 and keep chanting "More time for Paul." But they will begin thinking, "Get the hook."
The party leadership does not have the stomach to take Mr. Brown seriously and, as was the case with Mr. Carter in 1976, will do so only if the voters demand it. Should Mr. Brown do well in Michigan, look for a major effort later in the week to discredit him as the champion of Wallaceite grumps, tree-huggers, latter-day hippies and wealthy trend-heads.
Showing the way, Mr. Clinton reached into his Southern trick bag in the debate Sunday night to club Mr. Brown as the candidate of "family money and $1,500 suits." But the more telling line came when he denounced Mr. Brown as the mouthpiece for Patrick H. Caddell, the former Carter poll taker who is widely regarded in Democratic circles as a Svengali wannabee.
If nothing else, Mr. Clinton has enlivened the campaign season by emerging as the political equivalent of Hank Williams Sr. -- that is, a son of the South whose flaws are as large and fascinating as his talents. Big margins for Clinton here and in Michigan would deepen the admiration that set in last week among professionals in both parties for the Clinton campaign's three-pronged plan for damage control.
One element is to label any inquiry into Mr. Clinton's veracity, finances or performance as Governor of Arkansas as "an attack by the press." Prong 2 is to depict the ordeals brought on by Mr. Clinton's youthful indiscretions as character-building exercises that have prepared him for the Presidency. Prong 3, which has emerged as a major theme in Mr. Clinton's speeches, is to depict "perfection" in personal conduct as a prudish and ultimately disqualifying personality tic in his opponents.
Four weeks ago, no political consultant in Washington thought those lines would sell. Now they are tipping their hats to the Clinton team. But these people are realists. After Tuesday, their gossip du jour will switch to discussion of what the Republicans have on Mr. Clinton in the way of an October Surprise. That is because everyone believes that the minute Mr. Clinton becomes the nominee, the Democratic Party will have the same motto as a 12-step program: One day at a time.
Anticipating this, Clinton supporters are already stepping up their pressure on the press to look searchingly into President Bush's past in an effort to give their man a level playing field on the character issue. That is the kind of elevating year it has been so far. If Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton are the winners tomorrow, they will leave the Rust Belt carrying the kind of cuts and bruises that normally show up on the losers.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Clinton Speeches Echo Messages of His Rivals

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 16

 BODY:
The apparent success of Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign stems, at least in part, from his skill in appropriating the best ideas of his opponents and incorporating them into his plans and promises.
It is not wholesale thievery, and it is a technique used by other candidates. By making a deft selection of emphasis, the Arkansas Governor sharpens his message in areas that have proved popular for other Democrats and presents himself as the best of every candidate -- an effort to win over his opponents' former supporters. Especially in Michigan and Illinois, this approach is a way to woo traditional, mainstream Democrats and to cast his rival, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, as conservative. 
 Mr. Clinton has taken a cue, for instance, from Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who dropped out of the Presidential race two weeks ago, and increased the number of times he now refers to himself as the candidate who can bring the most change to Washington. At a Texas debate last week, Mr. Clinton even borrowed Mr. Kerrey's most-used phrase to say he is for "fundamental change."
Mr. Clinton's portrayal of himself as an outsider owes a debt as well to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who has won the Colorado primary and who could manage a strong finish in Michigan with an outsider's message that rails against the monied and the powerful. Speaking to an audience in Macomb County, Mich., on Thursday, Mr. Clinton picked up that theme.
"The executives continue to raise their pay and their perks while the workers got the shaft," he said.
 
Borrowing From Harkin
 Echoes of Senator Tom Harkin, who dropped out of the campaign a week ago, also turn up in Mr. Clinton's speeches and debate appearances. When he spoke at a rally in the Southern Illinois city of Carbondale last week, Mr. Clinton, like the Senator from Iowa, praised ethanol, a grain byproduct that is touted by farmers as a substitute for gasoline.
Mr. Harkin's exit from the race has also provided Mr. Clinton with an opportunity to redefine Mr. Tsongas. Early in the campaign, it was Mr. Clinton who had to defend himself against attacks from Mr. Harkin, who campaigned as a voice for liberalism. Mr. Harkin asked whether the Governor's centrist views made him a "real Democrat." Now it is Mr. Clinton who is making the argument, this time over whether Mr. Tsongas is a "real Democrat," in an apparent effort to push Mr. Tsongas to the right on social issues.
Mr. Clinton's aides resist the notion that the Governor is using anybody else's ideas, though they concede that when a useful distinction is made by another candidate, it is not a bad idea to keep it in mind.
"The point of distinction changes as the field changes," said Paul Begala, a top Clinton adviser. "That's true."
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager, asserted that the essentials of his candidate's message have not changed, and disavowed any notion that Mr. Clinton was unfairly borrowing from Mr. Tsongas. The former Senator, he said, "stole the 'new idea' mantle from us. We're snatching it back."
 
Renewed Focus on Economics
 That is especially true of Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, which got lost in all the attention to the character question in New Hampshire. But beginning in Georgia, as Mr. Clinton regained his footing, he has been able to focus the economic discussion on three or four issues.
Instead of relying on the booklet containing his economic plan, which was distributed widely to the detail-oriented New Hampshire voters, the Clinton campaign is now attacking Mr. Tsongas's economic ideas, painting the former Senator in a 30-second television advertisement as a friend of business, a foe of the elderly and a fan of nuclear power.
Many of Mr. Clinton's strongest statements, of course, remain exclusive to him. No other candidate speaks in as much detail about social issues like the need for racial unity, child support enforcement and welfare reform. And he is not alone in the game of appropriating ideas.
Mr. Brown, for instance, in a Friday night debate here, used a line borrowed from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to say that building enterprise zones in poor neighborhoods would curb the drug trade and make "hope blossom and dope decline."
And in Mr. Tsongas's new advertising, he has claimed Mr. Kerrey's call for "fundamental change" as well.
Mr. Clinton and his aides say the true test of their constantly evolving message is in the truth of their words.
"I think thay it's pretty hard to turn reality into unreality if there's any factual basis, anything for the voters to tie it to," Mr. Clinton said recently.
He was talking about negative advertising at the time, but his observation could apply to his front-runner's message as well.

HEADLINE: Trenton Vote Splits Raise in Wage Law

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 16

 BODY:
The Republican-led Assembly today approved legislation spreading out over two years an 80-cent-an-hour increase that would have made New Jersey's minimum wage the highest of any state in the country on April 1.
That bill and another one approved today, which would deny farm workers a rise in the $4.25-an-hour minimum, drew unexpected opposition from some Assembly Republicans. 
 The two bills also face an uncertain future in the State Senate, where the Republican leadership has suggested that they may not even be brought up for a vote. A constitutional quirk gives Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, the power to ignore action by the Legislature and allow the 80-cent raise to take effect as planned.
Under a bill that passed with bipartisan support in 1990, when the Democrats controlled the Legislature, all minimum-wage workers were to receive the 80-cent raise on April 1. But in a 49-to-26 vote today, the Assembly approved a 40-cent raise to take effect on April 1, bringing the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour, and a second 40-cent increase on April 1, 1993, raising the wage to $5.05 an hour.
"Many New Jersey businesses and industry already face an uncertain future because of the dire economic straits we are in as a result of the current recession," said Assemblyman Scott Garrett, the Republican who sponsored the legislation to postpone the increase. "Increasing the state minimum wage the full 80 cents at this time will only serve to inhibit our economic recovery."
 
'Competitive Disadvantage'
 Two Republican Assemblymen, Frank LoBiondo and Robert Shinn, sponsored the bill exempting farm workers from any increase in the federally mandated $4.25 an hour minimum, saying that a raise would put the state's farmers at "a dangerous competitive disadvantage."
"Forcing New Jersey farmers to pay employees 80 cents per hour more than neighboring states will take away their ability to compete fairly," Mr. Shinn said.
The bill was passed, 44 to 28. The Republicans hold a 58-to-22 majority in the Assembly.
"By voting to cut the minimum wage, the Republicans have told the citizens of New Jersey that it is too generous for businesses to pay working men and women wages that are above the poverty level," said Assemblywoman Stephanie R. Bush, a Democrat from East Orange who two years ago sponsored the measure to raise the minimum wage to $5.05. "This is a mean-spirited bill. I urge Governor Florio to make sure that it never sees the light of law."
The Republicans have enough votes to override a veto by Mr. Florio. But the State Constitution gives the Governor 45 days to act on a bill. That means Mr. Florio could refuse to act on one or both of the minimum-wage bills for the next two weeks, allowing the 80-cent raise to take effect on April 1 and putting the Republicans in the uncomfortable position of having to take the money back.
Mr. Florio has not said how he will deal with the matter, but a spokeswoman for the Governor suggested he was opposed to both bills. "He's hard pressed to see how somebody earning $200 a week is a drain on the economy," said the spokeswoman, Jo Glading.
At $5.05, New Jersey's minimum wage would be higher than that of any other state and second only to the minimum in Washington, D.C., which is as high as $5.25 an hour.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Mixed in Negative Market

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in fairly active trading yesterday. Traders said market sentiment remained very negative, despite the rise in interest rates over the last two months.
"I like the market, particularly securities with maturities of four years or less," one government securities trader said. "But it is hard to fight what is going on." 
 Many market participants seem convinced that recent strong economic reports are signaling an upturn in the extremely sluggish economy, and they have pushed up short-term and long-term market interest rates accordingly.
 
More Statistics Today
 Most analysts expect those data to be released today, including industrial production and housing starts for February, will tend to support that view. At the same time, they added that recent figures overstate the rebound's strength.
"Some of the changes to cash flow taking place in the first quarter, from mortgage refinancing to a speedup in payments of tax refunds and the change in payroll tax deductions, are sort of what pump-priming is all about," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation.
"Those factors may have pushed us to a 2 percent growth path, up from 1 percent or less," he continued. "That accleration is palpable: when you increase speed to 20 miles an hour from 5 miles an hour, you feel it. But after a while, you recognize that 20 miles an hour is not so fast."
And Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montague Economics, said, "The market is way ahead of the economy."
 
Treasury Bill Auction
 A reminder of the rise in interest rates was provided yesterday at the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, as rates on the new securities rose to their highest levels since December.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.09 percent, up from an average rate of 4.02 percent a week ago. The latest rate is the highest on three-month bills since the auction on Dec. 16, when the average rate was 4.14 percent.
Bids on the new six-month securities generated an average discount rate of 4.27 percent, up sharply from the 4.13 percent average rate at last week's sale. The rate is the highest on a new six-month bill since it averaged 4.39 percent on Dec. 2.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of long-term notes and bonds weakened slightly while prices of short- and intermediate-term issues firmed a bit.
By late in the day, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 997/32 , down 2/32 , to yield 8.06 percent, unchanged from late Friday.
Among outstanding note issues, the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 94 5/8, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.38 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 996/32 up 1/32 , to yield 5.82 percent.
 
Corporate Offerings
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, ICI Wilmington, the American subsidiary of the British giant Imperial Chemical Industries, offered $225 million of five-year notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 7 5/8 percent securities, which mature on March 15, 1997, were priced at $99.81 to yield 7.671 percent, 55 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing. The securities are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Separately, J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as lead manager on a $100 million offering of 12-year securities for the Crane Company.
The 8 1/2 percent notes were priced at $99 to yield 8.636 percent, 96 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing. The issue is rated Baa-2 by Moody's and A- by Standard & Poor's.
 
New York City Bonds
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, New York City priced $99 million of variable-rate bonds through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation.
The bonds were initially priced to yield 2.20 percent on securities maturing in 2020. Rates on the securities will be reset daily.
A guarantee of repayment of principal and interest on the bonds is being provided by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, a subsidiary of GE Capital. It is the first time a non-bank financial company has provided such a liquidity guarantee in the municipal bond market.
Because of the credit enhancement provided by the guarantee, the securities are rated MIG-1 by Moody's and SP-1 by Standard & Poor's.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of the most widely quoted securities rose by about 1/8 point in sluggish trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	 	 	Average Price	98.966	97.841	Discounted Rate	4.09%	4.27%	Coupon Yield	4.19%	4.43%	High Price	98.974	97.846	Discounted Rate	4.06%	4.26%	Coupon Yield	4.16%	4.41%	Low Price	98.964	97.841	Discounted Rate	4.10%	4.27%	Coupon Yield	4.20%	4.43%	Accepted at low price	12%	69%	Total applied for	$34,085,810	$29,755,085	Accepted	$11,434,475	$11,430,400	N.Y. applied for	$30,933,010	$27,093,190	N.Y. accepted	$10,314,915	$10,505,675	Noncompetitive	$1,337,705	$885,965	
 
Both issues are dated March 19. The three months bills mature June 18,1992, and the six months bills mature Sept.17, 1992.

HEADLINE: Archbishop's New House Raises Eyebrows

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, March 15

 BODY:
As the new Archbishop of Hartford, one of Daniel A. Cronin's first decisions was where to live.
But his choice -- a $430,000 house with a swimming pool in this upscale Hartford suburb -- has put the archdiocese on the defensive just as it is beginning a major fund-raising drive. 
 The archdiocese insists that it is quite common for bishops and archbishops to live in single-family homes and argues that the money to buy the house will come from a special fund set aside for such expenses, not from parishioners' donations.
But officials of the archdiocese fear that the purchase, at a time of widespread layoffs and general economic malaise, may upset some of the state's 800,000 Catholics. They are so concerned about the potential impact on the Archbishop's Annual Appeal, which raised more than $4 million last year, that they have sent out a fact sheet on the purchase to individual priests.
 
Send in Those Contributions
 In a cover letter, the Rev. Charles W. Daly, fiscal officer of the archdiocese, wrote "Your presentation from the pulpit will be the major factor in helping to clarify any misperceptions of the house purchase, which misperceptions could prove to be a negative factor surrounding Appeal '92."
The fund drive began over the weekend, and a mailing will go out this week. Parishioners have until after Easter to send in contributions, and those making a long-term pledge can do so from May until November.
The Rev. Douglas A. Clancy, the director of the appeal, said most parishioners have read about the purchase and were aware of the facts.
At services over the weekend, he said: "Most said nothing. Others said everything from 'I don't see what the problem is, Father,' to 'Gee, this is something that should be brought up.' "
Archbishop Cronin, who was installed in January, did not return repeated calls today and over the weekend. But Father Daly said in a telephone interview: "What Archbishop Cronin proposes to do is reasonable and rather universally done. For people who are worried about the money, it's a good investment."
The purchase of the six-bedroom house, which has an in-ground swimming pool, is contingent on approval of a zoning permit which would allow more than three unrelated people to live in a single home.
Father Daly said in the fact sheet that the house's size suited the Archbishop's needs.
"The swimming pool is not a requirement of the archdiocese," he said. "It happens to come with the house. The pool was installed for the benefit of the present owners' seven children and their friends."
Father Daly said that one of the six bedrooms in the house in West Hartford would be divided into two bedrooms. Diocesan officials have said the seven bedrooms are needed for the Archbishop, his secretary, three nuns who will staff the residence, and to allow for two guest rooms.
The oversized white and brick colonial is at 36 Braintree Road, a quiet, residential neighborhood of neat, well-kept homes. The street is a short distance from a busy shopping and office district known as Bishop's Corner.
Archbishop Cronin is now living in the rectory at St. Joseph's Cathedral in Hartford.
The former Archbishop, John F. Whealon, who died in August, had sold his predecessor's mansion in 1974 for $288,000, and had chosen to live in two rooms at a retirement home in West Hartford.
Father Daly said the money from the sale of the mansion had been invested and would cover the current proposed house purchase. Buying, he said, was preferable to renting.
"Even though the cost of a house remains fixed, the rentals would be going up," Father Daly said. He said the original asking price for the house was $560,000.
He said it was unclear how many people objected to the proposed purchase, but said he doubted it was a significant number when considering the 47,000 parishoners who contributed to last year's fund-raising appeal.
"I don't know for how many people this is an important issue," Father Daly said, "but for the benefit of those for whom it is an issue, we thought that we should explain the matter, primarily because the impression was given that the house was going to be purchased with the money from the Archbishop's Annual Appeal."
He said the Archbishop "wishes that it were a non-issue, and is probably surprised that it is an issue, because practically every bishop in the country lives in a separate residence."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Slow Session; Traders Awaiting New Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was marginally lower against most major currencies yesterday as many traders chose to stay out of the market until today's release of statistics on housing starts, industrial production and consumer prices.
"There was no incentive for heavy trading," said Mike Faust, an analyst with MMS International. 
 It remains unclear, however, how much the new data would move the dollar. The dollar's recent advance has come amid increased optimism that the economy is regaining strength. But improvement in the economy has now been factored into the market, Mr. Faust said, and traders may need more than numbers to move the dollar higher.
With a stronger economy, investors see a possibility that interest rates might rise, which would make American investments more attractive to overseas buyers and increase their demand for dollars.
Ronald Holzer, vice president and chief trader with the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said activity in other currencies dominated the markets yesterday.
In Japan, stock prices plunged yesterday, with the Nikkei average falling below the 20,000 level. But the yen stayed relatively steady because the foreign exchange markets expected a drop in stocks, Mr. Faust said.
The British pound put in a strong performance in response to a pre-election opinion poll showing the incumbent Conservative Party leading the Labor Party; the voting in Britain is April 9.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 133.90 yen, up from 133.625 on Friday. In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.75 Japanese yen, to 134.30 yen; in London, it was quoted at 133.90. The dollar fell to 1.6620 marks in New York, from 1.6685 Friday. In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6650 German marks from 1.6660.
The pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7220 in New York, from $1.7085 Friday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7170 from $1.7120.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.5070 Swiss francs, down from 1.5100; 5.6425 French francs, down from 5.6660; 1,249.75 Italian lire, down from 1,253.00, and 1.19875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19735.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 1.6650 German marks, down from 1.6660; 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5113; 5.6560 French francs, down from 5.6565; 1,252.00 Italian lire, up from 1,250.00, and 1.1988 Canadian dollars, unchanged 1.1988.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Drops $3.40 an Ounce As Australia Producers Sell

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices dropped to their lowest level in more than five and a half years yesterday as Australian producers sold large quantities and American investors stayed on the sidelines.
Gold for spot delivery fell $3.40 an ounce, to $343.30 on the Commodity Exchange, the lowest daily settlement for a spot gold contract since June 24, 1986. The active April gold contract fell $3.40, to $343.90 a troy ounce. 
 Silver futures also retreated on New York's Commodity Exchange while platinum ended barely changed on the New York Mercantile Exchange. March silver fell 3.7 cents, to $4.06 a troy ounce; March platinum ended unchanged at $358.50 a troy ounce.
On other commodity markets, energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mostly lower, and livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
 
Reasons for Selling
 Analysts said the selling in gold came from three sectors: Australian mining companies, Japanese investors who needed cash to meet margin calls in the weakening Tokyo stock markets, and commodity fund managers who read the price drop as a forecast of further declines.
The price drop nearly matched the cumulative loss of the two previous sessions but stopped short of the collapse that some experts had predicted after last week's slip below the $350 level.
Experts said losses were limited by jitters about today's referendum in South Africa, where whites are voting on whether to share power with the country's black majority. South Africa is a major producer of gold and platinum.
Stirrings of unrest in Russia, another major gold-producing country, also kept prices from collapsing, said Randy Donney, chief of commodity research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Crude oil futures were little changed on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and other energy futures ended mixed. The crude market shrugged off a Middle East newsletter's report that OPEC was approaching its output-reduction goal.
Light sweet crude oil for April delivery fell 3 cents, to $19.15 a barrel. April heating oil rose 0.29 cent, to 53.65 cents a gallon. April unleaded gasoline rose 0.67 cent, to 60.02 cents a gallon, and April natural gas rose 1.5 cents, to $1.227 for 1,000 cubic feet.

Public pension funds in many states are increasingly being viewed by elected officials not just as sources of retirement income for millions of state and local employees, but as potentially powerful tools for creating jobs, promoting economic growth and meeting social needs.
With political pressure mounting to create or save jobs and provide more social services, cash-short state and local governments are pushing their pension funds to invest in local businesses, housing and other ventures in ways intended to bolster the economy. 
 These so-called economically targeted investments have picked up in size and number in the last several years. And although many fund managers have gone along with the trend, some of them have reservations about the prudence of investments selected for economic and political reasons. And they are concerned about the increasing overt pressure from elected officials to rethink their investment policies.
"Economically targeted investments will be more and more in the forefront as states and municipalities continue to feel the impact of fiscal strain," said Francisco L. Borges, Connecticut's State Treasurer. "The trick will be to structure economically targeted investments in such a way that they will be able to generate a market rate of return at the same level of risk as other assets within the portfolio."
In New York City, public pension funds, under the direction of Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, have doubled their investments in affordable housing, small business loans and other targeted investments in the last two years, to $850 million. In Alabama, the state retirement system has invested in steel and pulp mills. Colorado has invested in car washes and biotechnology companies.
In the largest single economically targeted investment to date, California's main public pension fund voted recently to invest up to $375 million in building single-family houses in the state, a move that could create thousands of new jobs in the state's dormant construction industry.
The decision by the California Public Employees Retirement System came just a month after Gov. Pete Wilson asked the fund if its money could be safely invested "in ways that would stimulate California's economy to a greater degree than is already the case."
Officials of the retirement system said their investment decision had not been prompted by pressure from Governor Wilson, a Republican who has previously clashed with the fund's board. Indeed, the investment has been supported not just by Mr. Wilson, but by prominent Democrats who are board members, including Kathleen Brown, the State Treasurer.
"We're in a period of great financial transition and I think pension funds have a role to play," Ms. Brown said. "It's not a role that should provide risk-capital financing for the entirety of the marketplace. But certainly where sound fiduciary decisions can be made and where the pension funds can make a contribution to the overall economy or the state economy, that's entirely appropriate."
Still, some pension fund managers worry about whether, in the rush to benefit the residents of their cities and states, they are losing sight of their responsibility to millions of retirees. Muddying up investment decisions by factoring in job creation or economic benefits could lead to below-market returns or losses on the investments, they say.
"I see political motivation to encourage these types of investments in an effort to stimulate the economy," said Carlos Resendez, the executive secretary of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems. "But public pension funds across the board are being very cautious because they recognize that while it could stimulate the economy, the overall investment risk is most definitely increased by dabbling in these sorts of investments."
 
Some Big Losers
 In a number of cases, economically targeted investments have proved to be big losers. The most notable example occurred several years ago in Kansas, where the public pension fund invested heavily in a number of Kansas-based companies, including a savings and loan association that later failed and left the fund with a loss of $65 million.
"It's a slippery slope," said Edward V. Regan, who as New York State's Comptroller oversees the state's pension funds. Mr. Regan said pension funds in too many states were making investments without researching the risks.
"The money doesn't belong to the public," Mr. Regan said. "You don't just set up a new asset class and make a new kind of investment without studies and research and background, and that's exactly what's happened."
Mr. Regan also cautioned that economically targeted investments could risk politicizing the function of public pension funds. That is especially true, Mr. Regan said, at a time when fund trustees in many states are feuding with their governors and legislatures over whether cash-short governments should be able to reclaim surplus pension fund assets or reduce their contributions to the funds.
 
Wringing More Benefits
 "If we -- the trustees and fiduciaries -- use assets for purposes that are not directly related to the benefit of our beneficiaries, then governors, mayors and legislators have a perfect right to do the same," Mr. Regan said.
Still, many officials believe that cities and states can wring more benefits from their pension funds without putting retirees at risk.
A survey of the nation's largest state and local pension funds conducted in 1989 by the Institute for Fiduciary Education, a research group based in Sacramento, Calif., found that 41 of the 99 retirement systems that responded had economically targeted investment programs. Bob Toigo, the institute's president, said that the group was conducting a follow-up study and that he expected to find the number of targeted investment programs had grown.
Advocates of the practice said many opportunities existed for targeted investments that served the public good and also generated solid returns for pensioners. The New York City Employees Retirement System said its targeted investment program yielded an average return of 13 percent over the last five years, compared with 12.1 percent for the overall portfolio.
 
California's Expectations
 In California, officials believe that the investment by the retirement system in building single-family homes within the state will generate returns of up to 22 percent while creating jobs and increasing the supply of moderately priced homes. They said the investment would help ease a credit crunch that has left developers unable to start projects despite a growing population and mounting demand for new homes.
"There's no question that there's some political appeal to it," said DeWitt Bowman, the chief investment officer for the California retirement system. "But we do feel there's a very sound investment basis."
In other cases, though, what seemed to be sound investments have run into unexpected trouble. Mr. Borges, the Connecticut Treasurer and one of the strongest proponents of targeted investing, decided two years ago to help the state save 1,000 jobs by investing $25 million from the state's pension funds in the Colt's Manufacturing Company, which makes Colt firearms. The investment was the linchpin of a deal that allowed investors, managers and workers from the Hartford-based company to buy Colt from Colt Industries.
 
State Changes Its Plans
 The $25 million was originally intended to serve as a "bridge loan," a temporary financing package. Mr. Borges intended to sell the state's 47 percent interest in the new company within a year or so. But the company's sales have been hurt by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting decline in military spending, Mr. Borges said. The company has also had to replace outdated equipment, necessitating larger- than-planned capital expenditures.
"At this point, our plans for an early exit have been modified, based on our unanticipated difficulties," Mr. Borges said. It is impossible to say what the state's 47 percent stake in Colt is currently worth. But Mr. Borges said that in the case of Colt, as in other investments, he took a patient, long-term approach, and that the performance of the overall portfolio was ultimately the most important factor.
Mr. Borges is pushing ahead with plans to invest as much as $300 million, or 3 percent of the state's public pension fund assets of $10 billion, in Connecticut-based enterprises. Like funds in a number of other states, the Connecticut funds are also providing financing for a mortgage program that offers in-state home buyers more generous terms than those offered by traditional lenders.
"I look at economically targeted investments as a separate asset class," Mr. Borges said. "We want to create a mini-portfolio that performs no better and no worse than the rest of the portfolio."

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. to Cut Rate on Card

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 16

 BODY:
A.T.& T. Universal Card Services said today that it planned to drop its annual percentage rate by one percentage point, to 15.4 percent, for a certain group of card holders.
The lower rate will become effective April 1. The card's introduction of a variable annual percentage rate in March 1990 has been a reason for the card's popularity and a catalyst for other large credit card issuers to revise their policies and offer cheaper rates. 
 The Universal Card's variable annual percentage rate, which is pegged to the banking industry's prime lending rate, has dropped a total of three and a half percentage points since April 1991. Credit card interest rates average about 19 percent nationwide.
"As our costs decline, the right thing to do is pass the savings along to consumers," Paul Kahn, president of A.T.& T. Universal Card Services, said in a statement from the company's headquarters in Jacksonville.
A.T.& T. Universal plans to lower the rate for its so-called 8.5 million charter members, or customers who signed up during an introductory period for the card. The current rate is 16.4 percent and the new one will be 15.4 percent.
In addition, more than four million card holders who signed up after the charter membership period will also see their rate drop a percentage point, to 16.4 percent from 17.4 percent.
The A.T.& T. Universal Card now ranks third in the country with nearly $4 billion in receivables and $13.2 billion charged on the card last year, the company said.

Stepping Up The Training In Ecology

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
WITH corporations increasingly being held responsible for the impact of their products and manufacturing processes on the environment, more colleges and universities are offering courses in environmental science.
One of the newest such academic programs, at the University of Rochester, is expected to begin this fall. The program will offer two degrees: a bachelor of science and a bachelor of arts, both with majors in environmental science. 
 "We have not publicized the new program yet," said Dr. Udo Fehn, associate professor of geological science and head of the program, "but at least 10 students have signed to take it next fall."
Dr. Fehn said students seeking the bachelor of science degree are expected to have a background in the basic sciences of biology, chemistry, physics, geology and mathematics.
Graduates with such a degree, he said, might work as scientists for corporations, the Government or other organizations, doing research and providing the science background to help solve environmental problems.
He said the bachelor of arts program was for students who might go on to law school or medical school or enter areas like education, public policy or journalism. For this program, students must have strong backgrounds in public policy, with courses like economics, political science and sociology, as well as some science courses.
He said environmental studies were definitely a growth industry because companies were now often held accountable when ecological damage occurred. As examples from recent years he pointed to the huge oil spill in Alaskan waters by an Exxon Corporation tanker and the deadly gas leak in Bhopal, India, from a factory affiliated with the Union Carbide Corporation. Both companies were held liable for millions of dollars in damages.
Other colleges have undergraduate programs in environmental science, including Columbia University, the University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But there has been less success in persuading graduate schools of business to add environmental courses or to integrate such knowledge into existing courses like economics and management.
Educators say that many top corporate managers are concerned that business faculty members do not appear to understand the need.
Indeed, Richard Mahoney, the chief executive officer of the Monsanto Company, a chemical manufacturer, recently told a group of business school students at Washington University in St. Louis that environmental knowledge "is not just a matter of interest, but of genuine survival" for business.
In the latest issue of Newsline, a publication of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, an article stated that business school faculty often had misgivings about adding environmental courses to an already crowded academic curriculum. In many cases, the article said, graduate business schools lack the professors to do such teaching.
To deal with that obstacle, Tufts University in Medford, Mass., two years ago began a program to train educators to teach environmental science.
The program, headed by Dr. Anthony Cortese, dean of environmental programs at Tufts and the first to hold such a title at the university, is supported by a group of corporations. Called the Tufts Environmental Institute, it helps educators introduce environmental studies into existing courses or start new courses.
So far, according to Dr. Cortese, more than 75 educators have taken the program, including about 5 from business schools.
"Educators have to do a better job of integrating issues across the curriculum," he said.

HEADLINE: Russians Seeking U.S. Tours Don't Wait Patiently in Line

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! But in the rush for hard currency, they are stepping on each other's toes. And the impresarios who are bringing them over are getting mighty upset.
A case in point is the battle of the St. Petersburg opera companies, two of which are about to make their American debuts. Tonight, the St. Petersburg National Opera, a descendant of the experimental Maly Theater, begins a three-week run at the New York State Theater. It is offering productions of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," Tchaikovsky's "Pique Dame" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Coq d'Or." 
 In July, the better-known Kirov Opera, also based in St. Petersburg and as internationally renowned as the Bolshoi, arrives at the Metropolitan Opera House with nearly identical repertory: "Boris Godunov," "Pique Dame" and Prokofiev's "Fiery Angel."
The presenters of the competing tours are not amused by the companies' repertory intersections. Indeed, they are charging each other with parasitical opportunism, predatory competitiveness and other varieties of unfair competition.
 
A Last-Minute Plan
 John Cripton, the executive director of the Satra Entertainment Corporation, the company that brought over the Bolshoi last year and is importing the Kirov this season, complained that the St. Petersburg National's visit was arranged at the last minute to pre-empt the Kirov's series.
"We have been planning this visit for 18 months," he said. "The other company knew what we were doing, including our programs, because we had discussions with them in October. They saw an opportunity to jump in first. All's fair in art and war, I guess."
Kazuko Hillyer, who runs International Festivals and Events, a presentation company that is importing the St. Petersburg National, confirmed that the company's tour was planned hastily but said it was a matter of humanitarian urgency. In November, when she was presenting a Japanese tour by Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic, she was approached by the Acting Russian Minister of Culture, Anatoly F. Kostakovich, who had accompanied the St. Petersburg troupe on a Japanese tour.
"He begged me to bring the company to the United States," she said, and promised that the tour would have the ministry's imprimatur. "I could have waited a year or two. But right now, the company hardly has money for light bulbs. They really have nothing, but they are so eager to perform. And who knows what the situation would have been two years from now?"
 
Answering Some Charges
 Ms. Hillyer said she liked what she saw of the company's performances in Japan and went to St. Petersburg to hear more around Christmas. She said she was touched by the desperate conditions in which it has been working since the collapse of the Soviet Union ended Government subsidies. And she said that if the company knew anything about the Kirov's plans, it didn't mention them to her.
"If I knew the Kirov was coming," Ms. Hillyer said, "I might not have done this. Although, I might have anyway, because I was really moved by the company's situation."
"They have been trying to bash us, and doing terrible bad-mouthing," Ms. Hillyer said of Satra. "First they tried to stop us from using the word National in the company's name. But that's its name. Now they are telling everyone, even my own friends, that this is a fake company. And that's not true. They performed in Paris two seasons in a row and in England. I saw them in Japan last November and in St. Petersburg in December, and I thought their productions were wonderful."
Both Mr. Cripton and Marcus Ticotin, Satra's director of operations, said that to their knowledge no one at Satra had called the St. Petersburg company fake.
Mr. Cripton did say the company "has changed its name in order to capitalize on the name St. Petersburg," adding: "They are certainly an old company, no question about that. But I've seen some of their productions, and they're not in the form one would hope they would be in to come to New York City."
Both presenters have plenty of money at stake. Given the expense of importing elaborate productions and hundreds of singers and musicians, such tours are frequently lucky to break even. Mr. Cripton said the Kirov Opera's visit would cost about $4 million, some of which is to be underwritten by corporate sponsors, including Baltia, a new American airline that flies to Russia and the Baltics, which is providing free transporation.
The St. Petersburg National is touring with fewer performers and smaller sets, but Ms. Hillyer estimated the cost of the visit at $2 million, which she is guaranteeing herself. She also runs a concert management business and an art gallery, and has put up some of her artworks as collateral. But her decision to bring the company over on three months' notice cost her the possibility of finding corporate support.
Clashes like the one between the St. Petersburg National and the Kirov are likely to become more frequent as orchestras, ballet and opera troupes, choruses and soloists of the former Soviet Union, suddenly able to tour without special Government dispensation and facing economic disarray at home, raid the West in a quest for hard currency, durable goods and, almost as an afterthought, international artistic recognition.
"This is just one altercation we're involved in," Mr. Cripton said. Another involves the Aleksandrov Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble. Calling it by its more familiar name, he said: "We brought over the Aleksandrov Red Army Chorus in 1989, and we scheduled another tour for this year. We have an ironclad agreement with the Ministry of Defense that no other group would tour under the ministry's auspices. Lo and behold, another group billing itself as the Red Army Chorus is touring right on top of our group. And now we've learned that a third Red Army Chorus is going to tour the West Coast."
Ms. Hillyer and Mr. Cripton have different notions of their companies' merits.
"The sense I have, as a regular visitor to Russia since 1974," Mr. Cripton said, "is that the Kirov is at an all-time high in its ability to put together a production that represents the best of what Russian opera can be. The tradition in Russia is to build massive, wonderful sets that absolutely take over the stage, and there are lots of changes so that there's never a boring moment. A production like 'Boris' involves the equivalent of 17 40-foot containers of material, and there are 385 people in that production alone."
For Ms. Hillyer, one attraction of the St. Petersburg National is that it avoids all that. Only 250 singers and musicians are taking part in the entire tour. In its earlier incarnation, as the Maly Theater, founded in 1918, the company was known for productions that were small scale and often adventurous. It was at the Maly that Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk" and "The Nose" and Prokofiev's "War and Peace" first came to life. And the theater has long maintained its ties with the St. Petersburg Conservatory, where its current director, Stanislav Gaudasinsky, is a professor.
"The point about this company is that its productions are closer to the musical theater than to the big Russian productions I have seen at the Bolshoi and the Kirov," she said. "The traditional companies overwhelm you with the number of people on stage and with glittery costumes and sets. This company's tradition is to concentrate on stage direction. The characters are more important than the spectacle, and there is a real sense of ensemble."
Financially, the two companies are at opposite ends of the scale. The Kirov, a well-known international troupe with an even more famous ballet company, has in Mr. Cripton's words "anticipated certain things" and has earned a great deal of hard currency through its recordings and tours. The St. Petersburg National Opera, though it has been touring lately, has not done so well.
 
Other Hard-Luck Cases
 Ms. Hillyer has a history of taking on such hard-luck cases. In the late 1970's, she led a successful battle to save the Beacon Theater in Manhattan from the wrecker's ball. She has presented exhibits of Soviet emigre art at her Gallery International 57. She founded Save the Boat People to aid Southeast Asian refugees and has presented benefit concerts for other causes, from Unicef to the homeless in New York.
In that spirit, she has arranged "From Russia With Love," an art show to benefit the St. Petersburg company. Fourteen screens, prints, lithographs and watercolors, including works by Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg, Alex Katz, Roberto Mirotte and David Salle, will be displayed on the promenade at the New York State Theater during the company's run. The proceeds from a silent auction of the works will go to the company.
The Kirov, while comparatively well off, will be doing some charity work of its own during its tour.
"The money they bring back from their tours is shared by everyone in the company, including those who are not coming on the tour," Mr. Cripton said. "They also bring back tons of food, which they will make available to people who did not tour. I've seen this myself. When I have to bring over 10 containers for sets that I know can fit into 8, I know what the extra 2 are for."

Trying to Tickle the Liberal Pulse of America

Reclaiming the Politics of America

Two current books on the nature of liberalism in this Presidential election year owe a debt of gratitude -- albeit one that is dripping with sarcasm and despair -- to Presidents Reagan and Bush. "The L Word," by David P. Barash, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, and "God and Other Famous Liberals" by F. Forrester Church, the Unitarian pastor of All Souls Church in New York City, may not revive the liberal impulse in this country, but it won't be for lack of trying. Opposing the anti-liberal sound bites that have played so well in middle America, they want to remind the Democratic candidates of the party's proud liberal past. 
 At the Republican national convention in 1988, Mr. Reagan said that the "masquerade" was over and that it was time to mention "the dreaded L word, to say the policies of our opposition" were "liberal, liberal, liberal." The phrase by the former Great Communicator stuck; it doesn't seem to be heard too loudly on the Democratic hustings in 1992. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who espoused some of the old liberal New Deal ideas early in the primaries, has since dropped out of the race.
Picking up the L-word theme in his first Presidential campaign, Mr. Bush attacked the liberals as "remnants of the 1960's, the New Left, campus radicals grown old, the peace marchers and the nuclear-freeze activists." In response, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic standard-bearer, retreated from identifying himself as a liberal, saying the election was about competence, not ideology.
Professor Barash writes that by denying his liberal political heritage, Governor Dukakis caused many voters to question their own liberalism. "The L Word" wanders all over the place as the author offers his "unapologetic, thoroughly biased, long-overdue explication and celebration of liberalism." He writes in an anecdotal style that must go over well in the classroom, but given the complex history of liberalism on the American scene is not always compelling on paper.
His book is sprinkled with familiar aphorisms by Ambrose Bierce (a conservative is "a statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the liberal, who wishes to replace them with others"), by Will Rogers ("I don't belong to any organized political party. I'm a Democrat") and by a number of modern journalists and historians.
Professor Barash is most original when writing about the "cold-war liberalism" practiced by Democrats, which matched the Republicans in jingoism and military adventurism. He reminds readers of the split personalities of some liberals in domestic and foreign affairs and deplores the fact that "it was J. F. K. and Lyndon Johnson -- two notable liberals -- who got us most deeply involved" in Vietnam.
"Cold-war liberalism has been, in part, an effort to give the lie to Heywood Broun's criticism that a liberal is someone who leaves the room whenever a fight begins," he writes. "In its origins, cold-war liberalism was also energized by the Keynesian recognition that Federal spending was good for the economy."
For the 1990's, Professor Barash suggests that liberals don't need new ideas nearly as much as they need faith and confidence in their old ones. The future of liberalism, he says, is essentially to put "old wine in new bottles, so long as the wine is of good vintage."
In "God and Other Famous Liberals," Dr. Church arrives at his liberalism from a different direction. Rooted in personal experiences, his book is a compelling blend of religion, humanism and, yes, politics. Like his father, the late Frank Church, who was an outstanding liberal Senator from Idaho, Dr. Church was an early opponent of the Vietnam War and of keeping secrets from the American people. Like many students who lived through the 1960's, Vietnam was a turning point in the author's thinking.
The reader learns that Dr. Church's political and religious heritage fortify his liberal stands. He challenges military and religious icons with equal fervor. For instance, he criticizes Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North for his hawkish flag-waving during the Iran-contra hearings and scorns Jerry Falwell, the evangelist, for writing that God is in favor of "property ownership, competition, diligence, work and acquisition."
The author wonders whether he and the evangelist are reading the same Bible, "the one in which the last worker to arrive in the vineyard receives the same pay as the first, and the rich man is told to give away everything he has to the poor if he wants to go to heaven." As for the flag, he wonders whether Colonel North and he are "talking about the same country, when he (convicted felon or not) calls on us to 'be faithful to those ideas and values that made this country what it is.' "
At the heart of both books is President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Dr. Church writes that anyone looking for a new liberal agenda need look no further than his Presidential papers and, specifically, the conclusion of his message to Congress on Jan. 6, 1941.
In that address, Roosevelt said there was nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy. The basic things expected by the American people were simple. He said those included equality of opportunity for youth and others; jobs for those who can work; security for those who need it; the ending of special privilege for the few; the preservation of civil liberties for all, and the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living.
Dr. Church's "God and Other Famous Liberals" leaves the distinct impression that a half-century after F. D. R. expressed these thoughts, neither liberals nor conservatives would dare to speak this openly during the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Any candidate who did so might be accused of using the "dangerous" L word.

HEADLINE: New Studies Predict Profits In Heading Off Warming

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
FAR from being ruinously expensive, efforts to head off a feared global warming could actually save money or even turn a profit in the long run, environmentalists, government analysts and even some business leaders and economists say.
The view is contrary to that of the Bush Administration, which in international talks has resisted placing limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas. The Administration has found support from studies indicating that the costs of ultimately reducing emissions could run to tens of billions of dollars a year. 
 But now the opposite view is being pressed with increasing insistence. Citing studies of their own, advocates argue that reducing the emissions would force the economy to use energy more efficiently and at less cost in the long run, would free up large amounts of capital for expansion if the right governmental policies were followed, and would make American business more competitive internationally.
"To ignore the economic opportunities is to fail to seize the moment, to become paralyzed by exclusive focus on one side of the economic ledger," Dr. Robert N. Stavins, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said at a recent conference on the subject at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
A recent study by four environmental groups, coordinated by the Union of Concerned Scientists, concluded that aggressive action to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 70 percent over the next 40 years could cost the economy about $2.7 trillion. But it could also save consumers and industry $5 trillion in fuel and electricity bills, the study found, for a net saving of $2.3 trillion.
And unofficial studies by Environmental Protection Agency analysts conclude that the gross national product would rise, not fall, over the next 20 years if emissions were reduced through a "carbon tax" on the extraction of coal, oil and natural gas -- and the tax revenues were "recycled" back into the economy through investment tax credits for industry, thus spurring capital investment.
Competing studies consider different factors and operate on different assumptions, and no consensus on the net economic effect of reducing carbon dioxide emissions has emerged. But the economic debate has been joined, and its outcome could be critical in the attempt to deal with a global environmental concern of the first magnitude.
Carbon dioxide and other gases, chiefly methane, trap heat in the atmosphere much as glass panes trap it in a greenhouse. An international panel of scientists convened by the United Nations has predicted that if current emission rates continue, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the next century. Many scientists believe this could have a catastrophic effect on climate.
Global warming and energy are inextricably linked because carbon dioxide, the most abundant and important greenhouse gas emitted by industrial society, is produced by burning fossil fuels like coal and oil. The United States, which lags behind other industrialized countries like Japan and Germany in energy efficiency, is the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide. Thus, greater efficiency of energy use in this country is viewed as essential in trying to stabilize or reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency suggests that modest energy-efficiency measures already under way will allow American per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide to stabilize at 1990 levels by the year 2000, at little or no cost to the economy. The European Community has called for overall emissions to be stabilized at 1990 levels by 2000; although the United States has opposed such a target and timetable, the E.P.A.'s analysis suggests that as a practical matter, it will be close to compliance anyway.
Nevertheless, an American-European impasse on emission ceilings has held up agreement on a climate treaty, which would be signed at a United Nations-sponsored summit meeting on the environment in Rio de Janeiro in June. The final round of talks will start April 30 in New York.
But even if an agreement is reached, it may be only a first step.
 
Sharp Reductions Urged
 Many scientists believe that sharp reductions in carbon dioxide emissions -- not just a stabilization -- will ultimately be necessary. They say that at 1990 rates of emission, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would still grow. And in this context, the debate on the economic effects of reducing emissions takes on even greater importance. Answers will be needed if it becomes clearer in the next few years that the threat of warming is indeed serious.
One major study made public last December, commissioned by Congress and carried out by the Department of Energy, concluded that reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels would cost $95 billion a year in 2000. In general, its conclusions are consistent with those of a number of other Government and private studies.
But the study is based on the assumption that the economy is already using energy in the most efficient way possible, said Alden Meyer, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "That assumption is flat-out false," Mr. Meyer said.
He said the market contained many barriers to the adoption of more efficient practices and technologies. For instance, a landlord may have no incentive to install more energy-efficient appliances or windows because tenants pay electricity bills. If the landlord was offered a subsidy to do so, the barrier could be overcome.
 
Incentives for Efficiency
 Electric companies in a few states are indeed paying customers to install more efficient lighting, cooling and heating systems, for example, in lieu of building new emission-producing power plants. The companies are allowed to recover the money by increasing rates. The saving to the economy comes in the form of lower electric bills for the building owner. The restraint on emissions comes both from lower energy use and not having to build a new power plant.
The study, coordinated by Mr. Meyer, found that if an aggressive policy to expand energy efficiency and switch to clean, renewable energy sources were pursued, the economy would reap a net saving of $2.3 trillion over the next 40 years and carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced by 70 percent.
Participating in the study along with the Union of Concerned Scientists were the Alliance to Save Energy, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and the Natural Resources Defense Council, all nonprofit organizations that advocate greater efficiency of energy use.
But an analyst at the Department of Energy, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while the department favored the removal of barriers to greater efficiency, consumer behavior was more complicated than the environmentalists' study assumes. That could make the barriers more difficult to remove, he said.
He said the environmentalists' study assumed that the economy would continue to shift away from manufacturing as it has in the past, which he called a questionable assumption. He said the study also assumed a lower basic growth rate for the economy: 2.5 percent a year as compared with 3 percent in the Department of Energy study. A higher growth rate means emission reductions are more difficult and costly to achieve.
Mr. Meyer criticized the Administration's projected 3 percent growth rate as unrealistically high, a view that is shared by many private economists.
Analysts for the Environmental Protection Agency say the Energy Department study does not reflect the ways in which, according to the unofficial study by their agency, the proceeds of a carbon tax could be recycled through the tax system to spur economic growth. The analysts found that if the tax revenues were used to reduce personal income taxes or the Federal budget deficit, this would barely offset, if at all, the negative effect of the tax.
That negative impact would come when the coal and oil industries passed on the carbon tax to their customers in the form of higher prices. But if the revenue was used to encourage business investment through tax credits, they found, the effect of the carbon tax would be more than offset, producing a net gain for the national economy.
A combination of investment tax credits and personal income-tax reductions -- to make the tax more acceptable to consumers -- could achieve substantial reductions in carbon emissions at no cost, according to the analysis.
Market-based solutions of this sort could also make the price of American goods and services more competitive with those of the more energy-efficient economies of Europe and Japan, said Dr. Stavins.
While the current anti-tax mood of the United States discourages the adoption of a carbon tax, at least for now, the European Community is seriously considering it as the centerpiece of its efforts to reduce emissions.
Relatively cheap energy in the United States has made this country less efficient and therefore less competitive worldwide, Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss industrialist, told the Smithsonian conference. Mr. Schmidneiny is the principal adviser for business and industry to Maurice F. Strong, the secretary general of the U.N. environment meeting.
Shakeouts are painful, and the move to an energy-efficient market would undoubtedly produce some transitional pain, even if the end result is a more robust economy. Coal and oil producers and their employees, for example, could be heavily hit by a carbon tax, even if other sectors benefited from the recycling of the tax.
 
The Ultimate Cost
 Beyond all this, another question arises: What would be the cost of not taking action if serious global warming occurs?
Few economists have addressed it. One, Dr. William D. Nordhaus of Yale University, has published a "best guess" estimate that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would reduce this country's gross national product by one-fourth of 1 percent. But Dr. Nordhaus notes that many important factors are not included in economic accounts. These include "human health, biological diversity, amenity values of everyday life and leisure, and environmental quality," he wrote in a 1990 monograph.
It may be impossible to place monetary values on some of these big factors, even though they are clearly valuable. Biologists, for instance, fear that global warming will catastrophically speed a steady loss of biological species that is now occurring worldworld. They also believe that the world's forests harbor untold billions of dollars worth of biological riches that could be exploited for pharmaceuticals and other products without harming the environment. But their worth has not been gauged.
The effort to do so is "low on the totem pole of what is of interest to our discipline," Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company Inc., said recently at a debate on development and the environment held in Cambridge, Mass., under the sponsorship of Earthwatch, a Boston-based scientific research and education organization.
Some scientists believe economists should refrain from even making the attempt until more is known about the biological world. The tropical forests, for example, are mostly unexplored and only a fraction of species with economic value have been identified. Pending more knowledge, Dr. E. O. Wilson, a conservation biologist at Harvard University, said at the Cambridge debate, economists "should avoid fruitless and dangerous exercises in cost-benefit analysis which is far beyond their reach and join in the ethic of saving every scrap of biological diversity possible."

HEADLINE: ON HORSE RACING;
There's Still Some Unfinished Business in Florida

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

DATELINE: HALLANDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
The winter racing season in Florida produced some stirrings of economic revival, a slight gain in attendance and record betting despite a one-day boycott of Gulfstream Park by the local trainers.
But it failed to produce its two main goals: an agreement on racing dates among the three contending tracks in the Miami area, and a dominant horse to challenge Arazi for the Kentucky Derby and beyond. 
 An agreement on racing dates is essential to keep the business from deteriorating into a free-for-all. A dominant horse is essential to keep the Triple Crown from dwindling into a one-man show.
Neither goal was in sight when Gulfstream Park ended its two-month meeting on Sunday; neither will be in sight when Calder opens its six-month season today. The only sure thing is that both issues will have been resolved, for better or worse, by the time Hialeah opens in the fall.
The leading jockey at Gulfstream this winter was Julie Krone, who switched her act here from New York for the first time and rode 72 winners in 371 races. The leading jockey in terms of quality performance was Jerry Bailey, who rode nine stakes winners, including D. J. Cat in the Swale Stakes on Saturday and Technology in the Florida Derby four races later. The leading trainer was Sonny Hine, who saddled 22 winners, including Technology.
But none of the winners in Florida's winter will head for Kentucky or New York with a loud and clear challenge to Arazi, who races and wins and trains in France for flying visits to America. He made his debut in this country last Nov. 2 by circling the field of 14 and winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in a smashing performance. He will try to make a smashing return on May 2 when he runs in the Kentucky Derby. No horse in history has commuted from Europe and swept America's championships.
But then, no horse in Florida has raced to the top of the heap this winter the way Fly So Free did last year when he opened the season as the juvenile champion and then won Gulfstream's three classics for 3-year-olds and established himself as the horse to beat in Kentucky. He was not alone.
Strike the Gold stalked him in the Florida Derby and finally outran him in the Blue Grass Stakes and the Kentucky Derby in Kentucky. And Hansel, who ran third in the Florida Derby, later outran everybody in both the Preakness and the Belmont.
Even the filly Meadow Star was undefeated at this time last year and seemed ready to challenge colts for the Triple Crown. She didn't, but she was another symbol of the depth of the 3-year-old division. However, nobody in last season's 2-year-old division developed into the same sort of superstar, except Arazi.
"You wonder about last year's 2-year-olds," said Leroy Jolley, who trains Meadow Star. "You have to wonder if they were just an exceptionally mediocre bunch. None of them seems to have stayed at the top all year. So, now you have Arazi on top, and a lot of others trying to work their way up to that level. And he hasn't even raced yet this year."
You don't have to remind D. Wayne Lukas, who has saddled more winners than any other trainer in the country in the last 10 years. He trains Dance Floor, who came out of California as a hotshot spoiling for a fight with Arazi. He even imitated Arazi by flying into town, winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream and then flying home to rest on his laurels. Then he flew back to Gulfstream, ran second in the Florida Derby, suffered some pulmonary bleeding and flew home one more time to California as a bowed and maybe beaten candidate.
Lukas, putting it into terms that might be best understood by his friend Bobby Knight of Indiana University, said: "The senior division of racing, the handicap division, is like the N.B.A. with its stars already established. The 3-year-old division is like the N.C.A.A. tournament: The horses are still sorting themselves out for the Triple Crown."
So, Arazi reigns in France these days while the opposition tries to get sorted out. Bertrando won his 1992 debut in California on Sunday, and Lure won his debut in New York on Sunday. But nobody mounted the challenge in Florida.
On the business side of the business, Gulfstream counted 11,062 customers on the average, a gain of nearly 2 percent over last year. And betting, both at the track and at a widening number of offtrack sites, rose by nearly 25 percent to a daily average of $2.5 million. But then, the average may have been higher because the season was 30 days shorter, and the bettors had to act fast.
Next for Gulfstream Park: the Breeders' Cup championships on Oct. 31. But some answers to the steepening problems of racing in Florida had better be found long before.

HEADLINE: Invest in Venezuelan Democracy

 BODY:
A month after dodging assassination during a military coup attempt, President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela still fights for survival. He has struck back with political reforms meant to revitalize one of Latin America's oldest democracies. The U.S., with a strong interest in his success, can help. No economic bailouts are needed, just more consistent political engagement and follow-through on existing initiatives.
The coup attempt revealed deep fractures behind Venezuela's democratic facade. Government patronage and consumer subsidies financed by oil surpluses had helped build a broad consensus. When oil prices fell and world markets became more competitive, Venezuela had to retrench. 
 President Perez deserves credit for pushing through needed reforms. But the new policies alienated poor and middle-class Venezuelans who felt that the rich and the politically connected evaded a fair share of sacrifice. Mr. Perez has now moved to ease pressures on the middle class and reduce the influence of party machines. A wider range of political forces has been invited into the Government, and a constitutional assembly summoned.
Foreign commitments are not a high priority with U.S. voters this year. But middle-income countries like Venezuela are not looking for handouts. They seek commercial investments and free access for their goods in world markets. Washington can encourage investment by more adequately financing the seed money projects of the Enterprise for the Americas program. And it can help Venezuela reduce its dependency on oil by successfully concluding the Uruguay Round trade negotiations.
Even more important, Washington can help restore confidence in Venezuela's political stability by consistently standing behind the hemisphere's beleaguered democracies. The recent military challenges in Haiti and Venezuela make strengthening the collective security mechanisms of the Organization of American States an urgent priority.
Such measures cost relatively little and promise high dividends. President Perez is taking brave risks. He deserves Washington's support.

HEADLINE: Can Democrats Do Better on Race?

 BODY:
The issue of race has long divided American society and does so today. Republican exploitation of the issue simply made matters worse. Yet the Democrats who aspire to the White House, with one exception, have paid little attention to race. Bill Clinton has addressed the issue more shrewdly and boldly than his opponents, but even he focuses mainly on cures for the sagging economy.
That's an understandable preoccupation: the economy is Topic A. But while the dangerous racial climate may not be as corrosive as the recession, it surely runs a close second. And it surely deserves far more attention than the people who aspire to lead a united nation give it. 
 When not wholly ignoring the issue, Republicans from Ronald Reagan on have often exploited it for partisan advantage. President Bush's stubborn opposition to the civil rights bill, which he falsely labeled a quota bill, is a recent case in point. And Mr. Bush has hardly responded at all to the divisive fulminations of Patrick Buchanan.
Among the Democrats, Mr. Clinton was first to recognize the need for a message of conciliation that would apply equally to worried whites and blacks. On Super Tuesday, poor blacks and blue-collar white voters supported him, suggesting that Americans can transcend racial divisions and look to their mutual interests.
By contrast, race has hardly been mentioned in Paul Tsongas's campaign. Though he has long demonstrated a personal commitment to racial harmony and justice, he has chosen now to stress his program for economic growth instead. Jerry Brown also has excellent credentials as a conciliator, but he too has emphasized economics.
In Chicago, even Mr. Clinton seemed to dodge. The Windy City is the most segregated of America's major cities. Demographers call it "hypersegregation." The city's dismal race relations could well become the norm across the nation. Mayor Richard M. Daley inflames matters further by promoting a redistricting plan that's brazenly aimed at diminishing black political power.
The three Democrats waltzed through Chicago, oblivious to the circumstances around them. Apart from Mr. Brown's brief criticism of Mayor Daley's plan, race scarcely came up at all. Mr. Clinton closed the first debate by underscoring efforts he had made in Michigan to bring white and black communities together. Those efforts were laudable. But his comments in the debate ignored dramatic racial divisions right before his eyes.
The Democrats are correct to assume that the recession is topic A. But they are terribly wrong if they've decided to soft-pedal race. The nation's racial climate has deteriorated in the last 10 years. That damage will only grow worse if the Democrats shrink from the task of repairing it.

BYLINE: By William Julius Wilson; William Julius Wilson is professor of sociology and public policy at the University of Chicago.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Three years ago on this page I argued that the promotion of programs to unite, not divide, racial minorities and whites would strengthen the Democratic Party's position in the 1992 Presidential election. Bill Clinton's campaign provides an interesting test case for this strategy. He drew a clear majority of lower- and middle-income white and Hispanic voters and an overwhelming majority of black voters across the South. Recent opinion polls indicate a similar pattern for today's Illinois and Michigan primaries.
Many point to the modest success of Jesse Jackson's "rainbow coalition" four years ago to argue against the idea that race can be removed as an obstacle in a political campaign. But the Arkansas Governor built this biracial coalition during a time of intense racial tension in this country. The media, more concerned about his personal past than with substantive issues, are only beginning to grasp the significance of this accomplishment. 
 If Mr. Clinton is able to hold this coalition together in the remaining primaries, he will pose a far more serious challenge to President Bush than anyone thought possible before the campaign. Why has he been able to bring together antagonistic racial groups even in Louisiana where a majority of white voters supported David Duke in last year's gubernatorial election?
I first got a clue to the answer while watching a televised speech Mr. Clinton gave in a church in Houston this month. His message to the all-black audience could have been delivered to a solely white one. It included two important aspects: an explicit acknowledgment of the racial tension in America and the need for leadership to unite, not divide, the races; and a discussion of programs intended for all low- to moderate-income groups, not just minorities.
It is important that leaders channel the frustrations of citizens in positive or constructive directions when times are hard. But just the opposite has been more likely to occur in the last few years: the negative populist appeals of a David Duke and the black solidarity oratory of an Al Sharpton have exacerbated racial tensions.
The Clinton message has been a sharp contrast for those who have grown weary of destructive racial rhetoric. In his campaign speeches, he argues that demogogy forces us to turn on each other -- race against race -- instead of associating our declining real incomes, increasing job insecurity and growing pessimism with the failed policies of the White House. He points out that people who are employed are working more hours for less money and people who are unemployed are looking harder for work with less satisfactory results. Americans are paying more for housing, education, health care and taxes while services have been cut. Mr. Clinton's success in the primaries makes it clear that both whites and blacks of low to moderate incomes relate to this approach.
They also relate to his proposed solutions that include job creation and training, education, support for the working poor, tax relief for lower- and middle-income groups and affordable health care for all. Other candidates have stressed these issues and have proposed similar solutions. But only Mr. Clinton has integrated them into a vision to promote racial unity.
Mr. Clinton has destroyed the myth that blacks will only respond if a candidate highlights race-specific issues and programs. African Americans, devastated by unemployment and concerned about adequate health-care coverage and education, have reacted favorably to his approach. It has allowed blacks to display their political sophistication and show their willingness to identify with a candidate who addresses them without narrowly focusing his message on race. Likewise, Governor Clinton's interaction with black voters reflects respect for their judgment and an understanding of the depth and breadth of their concerns.
This is not to suggest that he does not boast about his own civil rights record and equal opportunity accomplishments in Arkansas -- including reducing the number of unemployed black youth and adults by 24 percent between 1983 and 1991. But this is not the core of his message when addressing black audiences.
Some observers believe that race is so divisive in America that whites, especially the poor and working class, will not support a candidate who receives overwhelming support of the blacks who vote. But this fails to consider what draws minority support. If the message is tailored to a black audience, whites draw back, just as blacks draw back when the words are tailored to a white audience. But if the message emphasizes issues and programs that concern the families of all racial and ethnic groups, whites will see their mutual interests and join in a coalition with minorities to elect a progressive candidate.
There is a general view today that the Democrats will once again self-destruct with a weak candidate in November. Those who express such an opinion may be in for a surprise. They may have failed to appreciate the significance of Mr. Clinton's remarkable biracial coalition.

HEADLINE: Sequestering Juries Guarantees Trial System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Outrageous! That is the only appropriate response to "Greed, Sequestered" (Topics of The Times, Feb. 28). It might appear that the expenses of sequestering a jury overnight while it is deliberating its verdict far outweigh the value of sequestration in difficult economic times. Repeatedly, however, we have demonstrated that claims of the saving to be gained by eliminating jury sequestration are inaccurate. Our position has been supported by data taken from the New York State Office of Court Administration budget.
Eliminating sequestration of jurors would be a blatant invitation to violence, tampering and unfair solicitation, not to mention the cause of numerous mistrials. You are likely to spend more, not less, to maintain the credibility of the trial process by eliminating sequestration. We believe the law works perfectly for those it is designed to protect: the public and crime victims. 
 And we resent the "greedy court officers" characterization. Our members are hard-working, dedicated professionals, whose collective reputation does not deserve such slander. We are not alone in our belief that sequestration should remain unchanged. Supporters of sequestration include the New York District Attorneys Association; the New York City and Nassau County Patrolmen's Benevolent Associations; the Suffolk, Nassau and Westchester court employee unions; and the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O.
We find it amazing that you would take such a callous view toward the safety of those upon whom we all depend to make our court system effective.

HEADLINE: With Apologies to Havel, Let Reason Rule;
A Wan Spirituality

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The End of the Modern Era," (Op-Ed, March 1), Vaclav Havel's New Age maundering, would not be so ominous if he were not in charge of a newly democratized nation, and thus the focus of a certain hopeful expectancy. To Mr. Havel the end of Communism is a "message to the human race" that employing the scientific method and accumulated objective knowledge to help bring about commonly agreed-upon social goals is not the way to go.
Instead, he offers a wan spirituality in which we are led by a new breed of politicians, each with "trust in his own subjectivity as his principal link with the subjectivity of the world." 
 If this is how Mr. Havel views himself we are all in trouble. His call to irrationalism will be of little help against the population explosion, the greenhouse effect, holes in the ozone layer, the dramatically widening gap between the rich north and the poor south, the danger of famine, the depletion of the biosphere and the mineral resources of the planet, and the expansion of commercial television culture, all of which he points to as signs that civilization is in danger.
Mr. Havel's embrace of the free-market system, which many consider a major contributor to these disasters, can only be justified by a commitment to a scientific attitude in which policies are continually reassessed in relation to experience.
Few would begrudge the Czechoslovak people and other Eastern Europeans their newly won freedom to experiment with new social and economic directions. But in their attempts to avoid previous errors of both the communist and capitalist systems, they will not be helped, in our opinion, by the sort of dangerous obscurantism represented by Mr. Havel's words.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
CLINTON WINS BIG VICTORIES IN 2 MIDWESTERN PRIMARIES; BUSH INCREASES G.O.P. EDGE

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 17

 BODY:
In a big stride toward the Democratic nomination, Gov. Bill Clinton won commanding victories in the Illinois and Michigan primaries today and dealt a serious blow to former Senator Paul E. Tsongas.
The gains of Mr. Clinton edge him toward the halfway mark in the number of delegates needed to wrap up the nomination. The losses of Mr. Tsongas were heightened by his placing a weak third in Michigan, behind both Mr. Clinton and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
 
Big Leads in Delegates
 
 President Bush won by huge margins in both states over Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator. Despite Mr. Buchanan's attempts to mine Michigan's economic discontent, Mr. Bush won 67 percent and his challenger 25 percent nearly 90 percent of the votes counted. In Illinois, with more than 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Bush had 76 percent and Mr. Buchanan 22 percent. In a statement from the White House, the President said the voters had "virtually assured" his nomination.
On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton had 51 percent of the vote in Illinois with almost 90 percent of the vote counted. Mr. Tsongas followed with 26 percent, and Mr. Brown had 15 percent. In Michigan, with almost 90 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Clinton won 48 percent, followed by Mr. Brown with 28 percent and Mr. Tsongas with 18 percent.
Voters in Illinois delivered a stinging anti-incumbent message, as two relatively unknown political figures, defeated Senator Alan J. Dixon and Representative Gus Savage in the Democratic primary. The victor in the Senate race, Carol Moseley Braun, could become the Senate's first black woman. [Page A19.]
 
Insurmountable Bush Lead
 Mr. Bush held his insurmountable lead in the Republican nomination race, picking up at least 140 more delegates, for a total of more than 720. At his current pace, Mr. Bush will have a majority of delegates, 1,105, by the Pennsylvania primary on April 28. Mr. Buchanan won no delegates, remaining at 46.
Mr. Clinton also maintained a commanding lead in the Democratic delegate contest, but his race was more unsettled. Mr. Clinton won about 160 delegates tonight, making his total at least 973 delegates, including the "super delegates" -- party officials, governors, former elected leaders and members of Congress. To win the nomination, 2,145 delegates are needed.
Mr. Tsongas is well behind in delegates, picking up only about 70, for a total of about 425. Mr. Brown won about 60 delegates, for a total of about 157.
Mr. Clinton, who swept the South in last week's Super Tuesday primaries, was euphoric tonight. Claiming victory in Chicago, the Governor of Arkansas declared: "I ask you to remember what people have voted for. They have voted for change."
Mr. Tsongas, whose aides insisted he was in the race through the Democratic National Convention, was already in Connecticut, campaigning for next Tuesday's primary and arguing that the Democrats wanted "an alternative" and that he was it. In a speech to students at Trinity College in Hartford, the former Senator from Massachusetts congratulated Mr. Clinton, saying, "The fact is he went into two large states and did well."
Still, Mr. Brown's performance in Michigan, where he offered himself as the roaring voice of blue-collar outrage, signaled to some Democrats that he would be competing hard with Mr. Tsongas for the role of "Clinton alternative."
Campaigning tonight in Wisconsin, which votes on April 7, Mr. Brown congratulated Mr. Clinton but added that the race was anything but over. "Bill Clinton has an enormous machine," Mr. Brown said. "Ours takes longer, but the race is turning into a two-man race and will now give a chance for America to make a choice, a real choice."
At stake in today's voting were 295 pledged delegates to the national convention. But the battle for Michigan and Illinois turned into a flat-out brawl over who was the best champion of working America and who was the "most electable" opponent against Mr. Bush next fall. Mr. Brown tried to slow Mr. Clinton by assailing him as a candidate who produced "a scandal a week." But the Governor, with a big boost from his Super Tuesday victories and a formidable organizational edge, quickly took huge leads here.
Some political professionals asserted tonight that it would be difficult to stop Mr. Clinton now in his drive for the nomination. Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said: "I think Bill Clinton has taken a major step toward the nomination. It's clear the end game has begun, but we're still too early in the process to declare anyone the de facto nominee."
Mr. Brown added, "The fat lady hasn't sung -- but she's sure doing her sound checks."
New York's primary, to be held on April 7, is almost always a stern test, even for a front-runner.
 
Sacrifice? Enough Already
 Each state that voted today has about 5.8 million registered voters. In Illinois, with competitive Congressional primaries, 1.5 million people voted in the Democratic Presidential primary and about 700,000 voted in the Republican primary. In Michigan, there were about 500,000 voters in each party.
The exit polls show that Mr. Tsongas was a victim of his own demographics. His message of economic sacrifice, which plays so well among upper-income and better-educated suburbanites, was simply overwhelmed in a region where layoffs are a chronic anxiety and where many voters feel they have sacrificed enough. In Michigan, more than half the voters in union households backed Mr. Clinton; just 1 in 10 went for Mr. Tsongas.
"There was a lot of disaffected labor," said Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's campaign manager. "Paul was very forthright in his views on striker replacement and it hurt him." Indeed, Mr. Tsongas was often asked why he, unlike his rivals, refused to endorse legislation that would outlaw the hiring of permanent replacement workers for striking employees.
But the problems of the Tsongas campaign ran far deeper than that. The former Senator also paid a price for his inability to break through to another crucial part of any Democratic primary coalition: black voters. In Michigan, he received fewer than 1 in 20 votes cast by blacks; in Illinois, about 1 in 10. He had a hard time coping with the burst of good publicity Mr. Clinton received after Super Tuesday. And Mr. Tsongas once again seemed out-organized and out-planned by the Governor.
Moreover, Mr. Tsongas let his message -- particularly his attempt to cast himself as a candidate above politics-as-usual -- seem muted by his tough television campaign against Mr. Clinton.
 
Blaming the Establishment
 At a news conference in Hartford tonight, Mr. Tsongas portrayed Mr. Clinton's victories as the product of money and "the political establishment."
"It's not easy being an agent of change," he said. "It's not easy to try to tell the Democrats that you're going to have to worry about the economy and stop pandering with all these giveaways and invest in our future."
Still, the Tsongas campaign itself had touted this region as neutral turf. "Mr. Tsongas needed to win one of these two states to convince the pundits and the money people that he had a chance at stopping Mr. Clinton," said Tony Coelho, the former House majority whip from California.
 
Brown's Varied Appeal
 Mr. Brown clearly succeeded in filling a political vacuum in Michigan. With his United Auto Workers jacket and his angry stand against "fast track" authority for a free-trade agreement with Mexico, he deftly moved into the position left open by the departure of Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, the favored labor candidate. Mr. Brown picked up more than a third of the votes from union households. He also ran well among younger voters and and, not surprisingly, among voters who said a major factor in their decision was a candidate's ability to "shake things up."
Underscoring the unusual coalition he put together, Mr. Brown received a vote of nearly 4 in 10 of the voters with some post-graduate education.
Once again, Mr. Clinton succeeded in forging a coalition of whites and blacks that put him easily over the top. He received about 7 in 10 black votes in Michigan and Illinois. But he also ran strongly among middle-income voters, and in Illinois received about half of both white Protestant and white Catholic votes. He split Jewish support with Mr. Tsongas.
Mr. Clinton alluded to the broad nature of his support tonight in a victory rally at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago, where he took the stage amid flags and confetti and the gospel strains of "Oh, Happy Day," and where he was formally introduced by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Clinton pleaded for an end to racial divisions and said his campaign succeeded because it was a unifying appeal.
"When an 8-year-old child is shot by another 8-year-old child in this city, this is not a racial problem," Mr. Clinton declared, referring to an incident that occurred last week. "It's an American problem."
The magnitude of Mr. Clinton's victories tonight prompted many Democrats to declare that the race was all but over, although they pointed to Mr. Brown's expected strength in the June 2 California primary. Phil Angelides, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, said, "It appears to be drawing to a conclusion, but in 1992, American politics is very volatile."
In addition, the Democratic Party's rules of strict proportional representation tend to slow down the nominating process. Mr. Clinton will have to increase his victory margins greatly or pick up a large chunk of the 560 uncommitted delegates to attain a nominating majority before California.
But his margins could quickly shoot up if another candidate drops out of the race. And the same rules that make it hard for him to pick up a nominating majority make it hard for his rivals to catch fire late, win some big states and overtake him.
Still, there remains a chance that the Democratic National Convention could convene without an undisputed nominee.
On the Republican side, Mr. Bush declared tonight that Michigan and Illinois had "virtually assured" his nomination. "The voters of Michigan and Illinois have endorsed my approach to change in America," he said in a written statement.
Edward Rollins, a Republican consultant, said, "I think the President has got the primaries behind him."
The Buchanan campaign, meanwhile, was scrambling for excuses. Paul Erikson, Mr. Buchanan's national political director, asserted that votes were siphoned from the conservative challenger by Mr. Brown. "Many of the crossover voters that would have gone to Buchanan were probably absorbed by Jerry Brown," Mr. Erikson said.
Despite his latest setback, Mr. Buchanan vowed to stay in the race, though his top campaign aides have conceded the nomination to Mr. Bush. These aides say the challenger will temper his attacks on Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Vermont Jobless Get Free Classes

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MONTPELIER, Vt., Sept. 17

 BODY:
About 800 unemployed Vermonters are getting a chance to learn vocations ranging from computers to automotive repair for free at local adult vocational centers.
"It was a brainstorming idea that really caught on," said Allen Evans, state coordinator of adult technical education. "The high unemployment rate is depressing. Our perspective is that education can mean a lot in people's lives in terms of getting a job." 
 The 800 taking part in the courses, which started last month, represent about 10 percent of the state's unemployed.
The 16 adult vocational centers run by local school boards have been offering low-cost classes for adults for about five years, with about 5,000 people normally enrolled. People who are out of work and receiving unemployment benefits were permitted to enroll free in any classes in which there were vacancies. None of those eligible for the free classes had to be turned away.
"We're trying to make things a bit easier for people going through difficult times," said Donna Stratton, adult education coordinator at the Barre Vocational Center.

HEADLINE: How to Press North Korea

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 17

 BODY:
Despite a flurry of pledges in recent weeks from North Korean leaders that they are nearly ready to allow nuclear inspections, officials in Seoul and Washington say they are mired in a game of diplomatic hide-and-seek in which no one really knows how much time is left.
The officials say they are likely to let the negotiations play themselves out until June or a little beyond, the time North Korea and South Korea set Saturday for the first inspections to establish that neither side is developing or deploying nuclear weapons. 
 After that, they believe, enough evidence will have been assembled to argue to the United Nations Security Council that North Korea, much like Iraq, is dragging out negotiations in a play for time to build a bomb.
Because estimates vary widely on how much time North Korea needs to begin producing its own supplies of nuclear fuel, and then to make weapons, there are sharp differences of opinion over how long it is useful to keep the North Koreans talking.
 
No Attack Plan Now, but . . .
 Few believe that a full-scale crisis is imminent, and American military officials say there are no preparations under way for a military strike against nuclear plants. But that could change quickly, they say, if any evidence emerges that North Korea has begun to produce weapons-grade plutonium, a development many believe could take place this year.
"In the next few months we will know what it will be, a major crisis for Asia or a peaceful resolution," Francois Heisbourg, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said recently. "And we will also see a major test of the relations between the U.S. and South Korea."
In recent weeks, Bush Administration officials have been in Seoul to try to defuse those tensions and to keep up the pressure on the North. But each new agreement, the latest of which creates a Joint Nuclear Control Commission between North and South to coordinate inspections, seems ridden with loopholes and chances for delay.
So does a separate agreement signed by North Korea in June to allow in the International Atomic Energy Agency. That still requires ratification by the North Korean Parliament, a step expected next month, and then the atomic energy agency will negotiate the sites and the nature of the inspections.
 
Providing a Way Out
 "You must play a game with them," said James R. Lilley, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security, at a recent conference. "We are trying to create a series of clear incentives and disincentives and still leave them a face-saving way out."
The evidence is murky about how quickly the North Koreans are proceeding. In recent months, senior American officials say, reconnaissance satellites have detected "a changed picture" around Yongbyon, a secret research site north of Pyongyang.
Trucks have been sighted pulling up to the recently completed fuel-reprocessing plant, where the North Koreans are thought to be trying to make weapons-grade plutonium. But the reconnaissance photos, officials say, do not make it clear whether the trucks are loading or unloading.
If they are unloading, some theories go, the plant will soon be fully equipped and presumably ready to begin operations. If they are loading, the equipment is perhaps being moved elsewhere in anticipation of inspections.
 
Sanctions Against a Hermit?
 Either way, American and South Korean officials concede that their leverage is limited. It is difficult to impose harsh economic sanctions on a nation with virtually no foreign trade. South Koreahas all but dismissed a military strike, because Seoul is situated only 35 miles from the 38th Parallel and its nuclear power plants would be vulnerable to retaliation.
North Korea has repeatedly denied that it is developing nuclear weapons.
Seoul and Washington have agreed on a basic objective: to force the North into a series of intrusive, short-notice inspections, both by the atomic energy agency and by South Korean teams to verify that the Communist Government has no nuclear intentions.
The two allies have coordinated their actions closely, especially in December, when the United States said it would allow North Korea to inspect its bases in the South to prove that nuclear weapons had been removed.
But recently, South Korean officials have said that the best strategy is to keep the two sides talking, meeting all the deadlines set under a reconciliation agreement reached in December. Last weekend, Seoul abandoned its long insistence on a clear set of dates and places for inspection before setting up a Joint Nuclear Control Commission.
The Pentagon has taken a generally harder line, urging the South to insist on specific inspection regimens rather than let the North win a propaganda battle by initialing vague agreements.
"We distrust the North's motives as much as the United States does," a South Korean negotiator said recently. "But as Koreans, we think we know more about how to negotiate effectively with the North."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Campaign Finance;
Presidential Field Raises Much Less Cash This Year Than in '88

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
This year's Presidential candidates have been able to raise only a fraction of the money that their counterparts raised four years ago. As a result, analysts say, money seems to be having a far smaller impact on primary races this year than it did in 1988.
A principal explanation for the decline, many fund-raisers say, is the recession, which has made it harder to squeeze money out of donors, especially from political action committees representing industries that are suffering. Among those with smaller resources are committees representing the automobile industries, realty agents and home builders. 
 Most strikingly, what this has meant is that the money raised and spent by this time in the 1988 election cycle, when no incumbent was running, was about five times what it is this year.
By Jan. 31, 1988, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who went on to become the Democratic nominee, had raised nearly $15 million. By Jan. 31 of this year, the top Democratic fund-raiser was Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who had received a little more than $5 million in donations.
All told, the 18 candidates for President four years ago had raised more than $149 million by Jan. 31, 1988. The corresponding amount for this Jan. 31 is $32 million for the 13 candidates.
The effect of the bigger pool of money was enormous four years ago, fund-raising experts said in interviews. "By this time last time around, Dukakis had just about blown away the field with his money advantage," said Leonard Riggio, chairman of Barnes and Noble and a major New York fund-raiser for the Democrats. While Governor Clinton is both the apparent leader in the race for the nomination as well as in fund raising, his advantage in cash on hand has not had the same effect. "This year, no one has exited because of money," said Mr. Riggio, who had been one of Senator Bob Kerrey's finance chairmen until Mr. Kerrey dropped out of the race because of his poor showing at the polls.
 
A 'Cheap' Nomination?
 As for the two remaining Democratic challengers, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, had raised $1.9 million by Jan. 31, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California had raised $940,000.
Herbert E. Alexander, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said, "Whoever gets the Democratic nomination this year it will get it on the cheap."
On the Republican side four years ago, George Bush had raised nearly $25 million through Jan. 31. This time, he has raised about $10 million, compared with the $1.7 million raised by his challenger, Patrick J. Buchanan.
Four years ago, Mr. Bush faced stiff competition in the primaries. He was not even the leader in fund raising. That distinction went to Pat Robertson, the television evangelist, who had raised about $28 million.
The political action committees, those groups that special interests set up to support candidates, are also having a difficult time so far.
For example, the Dealers Election Action Committee, which represents domestic automobile dealers, had more than $2.3 million to spend four years ago. This year, by the end of January, it had only $1.2 million, according to records at the Federal Election Commission.
Another political action committee that represents both domestic and foreign dealers, Autopac, raised about $4.2 million four years ago. This time, it faces competition from a splinter group, Americans for Free International Trade. But both groups together have raised only about $1.3 million so far this year.
But Mr. Alexander and others agreed that that that situation would probably change sharply in the upcoming Congressional elections. Because of redistricting and the general anti-incumbent feelings among voters, many more seats are susceptible to change.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Brown's Supporters: a Diverse Group

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 17

 BODY:
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California finished a strong second in the Michigan Democratic primary today because he scored well with a diverse group of voters: blue-collar workers, people with postgraduate degrees and those whose primary interest was the environment.
But from the surveys of voters leaving the polling places, it was difficult to discern a dominant pattern to the Brown vote, and his relative success in Michigan may have been due more to his advertising on television for the first time than to his personality or any particular position he took on issues. 
 In Illinois, where Mr. Brown did not advertise on television, he finished a distant third among the same kinds of voters with whom he did well in Michigan. For instance, he won less than 15 percent of the votes from union households and less than 20 percent from Democrats with advanced degrees.
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Brown has emphasized his view that the political system is totally corrupt. In Michigan, about one voter in seven said corruption in Government was an important element in how they voted, and Mr. Brown carried those voters by a large margin. But in Illinois, Mr. Brown finished well behind Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts among those who felt that corruption was a central issue.
Mr. Brown also apparently benefited from the endorsements he received from some local labor leaders who had been supporting Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa before he dropped out of the race last week. He won about a third of the Michigan voters from union households and about a third of those who said someone in their family worked in the automobile industry.
 
Bush and Clinton's Strength
 Despite the interest surrounding Mr. Brown's second-place finish in Michigan, the exit polls underlined the ability of President Bush and Mr. Clinton to lead by large margins among almost every age, ethnic and demographic group in Illinois and Michigan alike.
Still, the surveys turned up patterns that shed interesting light on the leading candidates' strengths and weaknesses.
For example, only slightly more than one Republican in five in the two states described the economy as "poor," but Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is challenging Mr. Bush for the nomination, won a clear majority of those voters.
Among Democrats, about 20 percent of the voters said that a candidate's willingness to tell the truth was one of the most important factors in their choice of whom to vote for, and of these, only about a quarter voted for Mr. Clinton.
The survey of voters leaving the polling places also underscored Mr. Tsongas's inability to win the votes of more than a small fraction of blacks, union members, blue-collar workers and those from households with annual incomes below $50,000. That has basically been true throughout the primary season. But after the voting in the South last week, Mr. Tsongas maintained that the pattern would change when the campaigns moved onto the neutral ground of the northern industrial states.
For example, Mr. Tsongas won about 10 percent of the black vote in the two states. Among self-described blue-collar workers, Mr. Tsongas took only about 1 Democratic vote in 10 in Michigan and about 2 in 10 in Illinois.
 
Varied Economic Outlook
 The exit polls demonstrated some important differences between Democratic and Republican voters. For instance, about half the Democrats in both states but only a quarter of the Republicans said their personal financial condition was worse than it was four years ago.
Less than 1 Democrat in 10 in Illinois and Michigan described the nation's economy as "good" or "excellent," but a fifth to a quarter of the Republicans characterized the economy that way.
Although Mr. Tsongas did not fare well today at the polls, one of his issues seems to have caught on with voters.
By ratios approaching 2 to 1 in both states, Democrats said that "providing incentives for economic growth" was a higher priority than "a tax cut for the middle class." That has been Mr. Tsongas's position throughout the campaign, while Mr. Clinton and the Democratic leaders in Congress have been emphasizing tax cuts.
Republicans were not asked the tax and growth question.
In both states, Mr. Clinton won a plurality of conservatives, moderates and liberals. More than half the Democrats who called themselves conservative or moderate voted for him as did more than two-fifths of the liberals.
In the Republican primaries, Mr. Bush won at least 70 percent of Republicans regardless of whether they identified themselves as conservative, moderate or liberal.
A gap between male and female voters showed up in the Republican primaries again today. As has been the case all year, Mr. Buchanan did much better among men than among women, winning close to 30 percent of the votes of men but only about 20 percent of the votes of women.

HEADLINE: Soviet Die-Hards Fume by Candlelight

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 17

 BODY:
A much-ballyhooed attempt by hard-line former Communists to revive the old Soviet parliament turned farcical today as only 217 former deputies showed up, fewer than a fourth of the number predicted by organizers, and the congress ended up meeting by candlelight at a state farm outside Moscow.
A somewhat more potent show was mounted later by some 10,000 die-hard champions of the old Soviet Union who gathered outside the Kremlin under red flags to sing the old Soviet anthem and to nominate an army general, Albert Makashov, for president. 
 General Makashov, who garnered 3.7 percent of the vote in the Russian federation presidential election last June and who was one of the organizers of the congress, declared that he would always be a "general of the Union of Soviet Soviet Republics," and said that "betrayers of the fatherland and the people should be publicly whipped."
The demonstrations, which were timed to mark the first anniversary of the referendum in which a majority of Soviet citizens voted to maintain a union, had alarmed proponents of political and economic reform.
 
Delegates Outnumbered
 But the small turnout for the "Extraordinary Sixth Congress of the Peoples' Deputies of the U.S.S.R." -- whose 217 "delegates" were overwhelmed by about 800 reporters -- and the now-familiar chants of the demonstrators on Manezh Square downtown seemed only to underscore the impotence of the old-line Communists.
Organizers of the congress had claimed that they would muster more than 1,000 members of the 2,250-seat Soviet assembly, which was chosen in 1989 as the first Soviet body to which delegates were freely elected.
The project was given additional attention by the decision of the new Russian parliament to declare the Congress unconstitutional. From the outset the proceedings went awry -- only a few dozen delegates came, and the buses they had ordered arrived late.
The organizers, who included a militant Communist from the northern Caucasus named Sazhi Umalatova, General Makashov and Col. Viktor Alksnis, announced that they would meet in Podolsk, outside Moscow. But when the buses arrived, the only hall available was the auditorium of the Voronovo State Farm -- and there the electricity went out.
Organizers darkly charged that the glitches were intentional, and nobody denied the possibility. Illumined by a single battery-powered bulb and candles, the delegates quickly adopted a sheaf of documents passed out in the bus, including a curious resolution titled "On the Inadmissibility of Involving the Country in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
Nonetheless, Mrs. Umalatova claimed that the very fact the meeting took place was a major success. "Now nobody can say there is no Union," she declared. "I congratulate you all, and myself as well."
The rally, which was allowed only at the last minute by Moscow authorities, continued late into the night with denunciations of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Boris N. Yeltsin, Western capitalism, high prices and the many other plaints of those disenfranchised by the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 
Cheers for TV Host
 Some of the loudest cheers went to Aleksandr Navzorov, a television show host from St. Petersburg who is known for his Soviet and nationalist views.
"We do have a real government," he declared. "Only it's in prison." The reference to the jailed plotters of the August coup drew a loud applause.
In the end, however, it was hard to find any genuine program or plan among the demonstrators, only a shared antagonism to the turn history has taken. Mingling with the Communists were monarchists, neo-fascists and a band of anarchists who hopped around in black leather jackets chanting "Eat gaseous worms." Nobody figured out what that was supposed to mean, but the slogan stirred considerable commotion.
The clashes many had feared never materialized. A group of about 20 young Yeltsin supporters chanted his name, infuriating demonstrators nearby, but there were no fisticuffs. The police kept a low profile.

HEADLINE: Private Interests Are Said to Benefit From U.S. Plan for Needy

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
A significant portion of a $3-billion-a-year Federal program intended to help needy communities is spent in ways that provide them few benefits and sometimes enrich private interests, Congressional investigators say.
The program, run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is supposed to build housing, raze slums, create jobs or provide other community benefits, primarily to those with modest incomes. But the investigators say many of program's projects fail to do so and are offering as examples low-interest loans to a minor-league hockey team in Troy, N.Y., a Saudi sheik in Miami and corporate giants like Sears. A Congressional subcommittee on Wednesday will discuss how one nonprofit group outside Philadelphia incurred more than $5 million in illegal expenses, including $10,148 for a dinner at a golf club, $3,258for model airplanes and a $345 limousine ride. 
 Some of the examples cited by Congress, like that from Philadelphia, have come from outright fraud and have led to criminal convictions. But a larger number of activities that are drawing criticism stem from disputes over the program's intentionally broad guidelines, which are meant to give communities wide latitude in spending the money.
 
Some Actions Defended
 In some of the instances cited by Congress, local officials have defended their decisions as being consistent with the program's purpose but Federal housing officials have disagreed and demanded the money be repaid. In other instances, the projects may meet the letter of the law, but critics question whether they fulfill the program's spirit.
In Miami, for instance, critics said the loan provided an unnecessary subsidy to a wealthy businessman who could have financed the project himself. But Federal housing officials say it met the program's guidelines since it brought a renovation in a blighted area.
Housing officials say they have already caught and corrected most of the violations being cited by Congress. They say this is evidence that their program oversight works, and they have called the program one of the Government's most effective.
Anna Kondratas, the assistant housing secretary who runs the program, said Congress was focusing on old and unrepresentative examples.
"It's probably less than 1 percent of the whole program doing clear violations of the law, and maybe up to 5 percent doing some questionable things," she said. "But that's a maximum."
But Representative Tom Lantos, the California Democrat who is conducting the House's investigation, has said housing officials provide lax oversight and that violations of the program's rules are "significant and widespread." And investigators at the housing agency's inspector general's office, which audits about two dozen communities each year, agree that the rule violations are not isolated. They say communities may be using the money for many more ineligible activities than have already come to light.
"Almost any time we go to a city and look at a small portion of their activities, we find lots of questionable activities going on around it that we did not previously know about," said Chris Greer, the assistant inspector general for audit who will testify at Wednesday's hearing.
The allegations of misused money in the program, Community Development Block Grants, come as local and state governments are reeling from the recession, cutting programs for the poor and demanding more Federal aid.
They also strike a sensitive chord at the housing department, where Secretary Jack F. Kemp has established a reputation for having cleaned up the many scandals he inherited from the Reagan Administration.
Mr. Lantos, who headed Congress's investigation into those matters, said the problems he has found in the block grant program do not rise to the level of national scandal. And unlike the Reagan-era scandals, no one is accusing top housing officials of criminal wrongdoing. But, he added: "As in the case of the original investigation, I think we are on to something."
The allegations also have a significance beyond this program itself, since conservatives, including some within the Bush Administration, have long called for making greater use of block grants as a tool of social policy.
Both sides agree that the majority of the development funds are not being abused, and that the program offers hundreds of success stories.
 
870 Cities and Counties
 Housing officials disburse about $2 billion a year to 870 cities and counties, based on a formula that includes their size, the extent of their poverty, and the condition of their housing. In addition, the officials give about $900 million to state governments. Cities and counties can spend the money themselves, or make loans or grants to corporations or nonprofit groups that use it for eligible activities. By law, communities are free to make the awards without first seeking Federal approval, and housing officials review their decisions later.
At least 70 percent of the money has to help people the Government defines as having low or moderate incomes, a figure that varies by region but on average reaches households with incomes as high as $30,000. The remainder can be used to eliminate slums or blight, or meet "other urgent community development needs."
In Troy, N.Y., the city drew on development funds to give a $1 million loan in 1990 to a group of local investors to buy the Capital District Islanders, a farm team for the National Hockey League. When Federal housing officials learned of the loan they said it was an ineligible use of the money and required the city to repay it. But city officials then used development funds to make a second loan, of $650,000, to help the team meet its operating costs, in what housing officials called "blatant disregard" of their warnings. The Department required the city to repay that loan, too.
City officials have said both loans meet Federal guidelines, arguing that the team would create jobs for the needy. While development money can be used to help corporations create jobs, Federal officials said the hockey team was unlikely to do so, citing a report by one of the city's own planners that said that "new job creation opportunities are likely to be minimal."
In 1990 Jacksonville, Fla., officials gave a $5 million interest-free loan in 1990 to Sears, Roebuck & Company to help the corporation build a new distribution center. Sears had told local officials it planned to move its center to Georgia, as a cost-savings measure, and city officials defended the loan by saying it would keep and create jobs and bring in new tax revenues.
But an audit by the inspector general's office said the city had failed to scrutinize the corporation's assertions. The city could not say how it had arrived at the figure of $5 million and had little evidence that the center would bring the jobs and tax revenues it promised.
The audit concluded, "the city had no defensible basis for making the loan," and called it part of a broader pattern, by which businesses "were often unduly enriched."The loan has been repaid.
From 1984 to 1989, Pennsylvania's Delaware County, which includes the suburbs west of Philadelphia, channeled more than $5 million in its development funds to a nonprofit group called the Partnership for Economic Development. Its chairman was Curt Weldon, who is the district's Republican Congressman.
Last year, the group's former executive director, William Tancredi, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Government of $327,000 by spending the money on a host of activities, including lavish banquets and no-bid contracts to political associates.
He has described the Partnership as Mr. Weldon's "private little campaign war chest," and is cooperating with prosecutors in an ongoing investigation.
Mr. Weldon has not been charged in the case and has denied any criminal wrongdoing.
 
Program Chief Faults Congress
 The program's head, Ms. Kondratas, said there would be fewer questionable expenditures if Congress agreed to past Administration proposals to target the program more directly on antipoverty efforts. But local officials have lobbied hard against any reduction in their autonomy and Congress has refused.
In lobbying for new restrictions several years ago, the Administration itself prepared a list of projects that are now legal but that it considers questionable.
These included $94,000 for an automatic park irrigation system in San Diego and more than $1 million for a facelift to a commercial strip in Chicago.
"Within the current rules, grantees can, and do, carry out activities that are relatively frivolous," said the proposal.
But Mr. Lantos said that housing officials "share responsibility for the failures," through "inadequate staffing, inadequate program guidelines, and a failure to enforce sanctions."
Ms. Kondratas acknowledged that current monitoring staff was now "stretched pretty thinly" and would grow more so next year as several new housing programs are being created without new staff members. One of her deputies has told community development officials that there would be "a rather dramatic drop" in the number of sites monitored through visits next year.

HEADLINE: New Japanese Envoy Seeks to Ease Tensions

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 17

 BODY:
The new Japanese Ambassador to the United States says that one of the fictions he wants to dispel when he takes up his duties later this month is that of Japan as a musclebound economic colossus challenging American leadership.
"I don't think most people in Japan feel we are a seven-foot-tall economic giant looking down on the United States," the diplomat, Takakazu Kuriyama, said in a recent interview. "I don't think we have an image of the United States becoming a second-rate economic power." 
 That the new Ambassador would have to say these things is a measure of the prevailing tensions between Tokyo and Washington, especially after various Japanese leaders and writers have commented that the United States is a nation in decline and that its workers are lazy and unproductive.
Like many ambassadors, the 60-year-old Mr. Kuriyama, a veteran diplomat who until recently held the highest ranking post in the foreign service, has studied in the United States and served before in diplomatic posts in New York and Washington. But he also brings an unusual perspective to the new post.
 
Father Warned Against Axis
 During the 1930's, his father was Japan's Ambassador to Belgium, and he warned against Tokyo's proposed alliance with Germany. After Japan joined the Axis, the elder Kuriyama left the foreign service and became a judge. Today his son is one of the staunch pro-American diplomats in the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
"I would rather be called 'pro-Japan-U.S.' because I have always believed that a close relationship between the two countries is in Japan's best interest," he said recently. "America is a country for which I have come to hold deep respect and admiration."
Angular and thin with a meticulous speaking style, Mr. Kuriyama is said by colleagues to have been given instructions to get out and about more than his predecessors and serve as a more effective spokesman for Japan.
Speaking meticulously and cautiously in flawless English, Mr. Kuriyama said he plans to convey the view that both Japan and the United States must resolve deep-seated social and economic flaws that have led to the economic imbalance between the two countries.
 
Both Sides Must Adjust
 The United States must learn to invest in science, education, research and industry restructuring, he said, while Japan must make its rules of the marketplace conform more to those of international trade, so that foreign products and even investments are more welcome. Japan, he said, has begun this process and deserves credit for doing so even though it must do more.
Mr. Kuriyama was one of the diplomats most associated with the unsuccessful effort last year to get Japan more involved in the Persian Gulf war, and the as yet unsuccessful attempt to get Japanese military forces to paticipate in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Both efforts have run afoul of the anxieties of some Japanese over rearming or deviating from the pacifist position Tokyo has adopted since World War II, and Mr. Kuriyama was criticized for trying to push too fast on the matter from within the Government. Many said his ambassadorship to Washington, once a sure thing, was thrown into doubt for a time.
Now he travels to the United States acknowledging that Japan's responses on such crises haved "not been rapid enough." His colleagues hope that his willingness to admit defects in his own country may make his appeal to the United States to put its own house in order more palatable.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Told of New Danger From Ex-Soviet Arms Technicians

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
United States officials said today that an effort to prevent a "brain drain" of top Russian weapon developers to third-world nations had focused little attention on thousands of technicians capable of putting an atomic weapon together.
The officials said it was these people -- chemical engineers, for example -- who possessed the skills to fashion a bomb using technology sold by American and German companies and plutonium from the thousands of warheads the Soviet Union will dismantle. 
 Robert Gallucci, a State Department official coordinating the effort to create an International Science and Technology Center to provide jobs for Russia's scientific elite, said the top priority had been on scientists capable of overseeing an entire nuclear weapons project.
Last week the United States and the European Community each committed $25 million for the center, which is intended to provide the Russian scientists with stable jobs for two years during the transition of their military-driven economy to a free market.
The center will be opened near Moscow by summer, Mr. Gallucci told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But its focus will be on scientists, theorists, managers and other "knowledge" experts rather than on technicians who actually fabricate and assemble weapons, he said.
"The center does not address that last group," Mr. Gallucci testified in response to a question from Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland. "I think we should have somebody look at it."
Mr. Gallucci and Dr. D. Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, told the Senate panel there was no confirmed evidence that any Soviet scientist or engineer had gone to work for Iraq, Libya or other third world countries or that any Soviet missile or nuclear technology had been diverted to such nations.
Dr. Bromley said Russian officials "are as concerned as much as we are and they are making an historic effort" to insure that scientists do not defect under such circumstances.
Mr. Gallucci said more than 100 proposals to employ Russian weapon scientists and engineers in civilian research had reached his office in the last month. Dr. Bromley said those efforts faced several impediments, the biggest of which was that the Russians "do not understand the role of entrepreneurial development that occurs here."

HEADLINE: SUDANESE TROOPS PUSH INTO SOUTH

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, March 17

 BODY:
Fortified by far larger numbers of soldiers than before and new heavy weapons from Libya, Iran and China, the Sudanese Army is moving through the southern Sudan in its strongest effort yet to win the decade-long civil war there, according to diplomats and aid workers.
The army took Pochala, an important center in the eastern Sudan on the Ethiopian border, a week ago and on Friday bombed Kapoeta, the major town held by the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. 
 The intensified war effort has resulted in a cutback in international efforts to deliver food rations to about 200,000 southern Sudanese displaced from their homes by the fighting, United Nations officials here said today. United Nations food convoys from northern Kenya into the southern Sudan have been attacked by local militiamen, apparently armed by the Government.
The civil war in the Sudan is between the northern Arab and Islamic fundamentalist Government in Khartoum and a southern based African rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, whose members are mostly Christian or animist. The Government has stepped up its military effort at the same time as it is hardening its enforcement of Islamic law the north.
In the last several months, the United States has said the Government has allowed international terrorist groups to use the Sudan as a haven. Washington has also expressed concern that Iran, which recently forged military and economic pacts with the Khartoum Government, is using the Sudan to export its Islamic fundamentalism into other Muslim areas of Africa.
Supplementing the regular Sudanese Army on the current offensive is a contingent from the newly formed Popular Defense Forces, a paramilitary group organizing along the lines of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, a Western diplomat said in Khartoum today. The diplomat said the paramilitary recruits had been rounded up in Khartoum several weeks ago and sent to the front in the name of holy war.
The Government forces number about 50,000 and are moving out from the three main Government-held centers of Malakal, Juba and Wau with tanks and artillery, diplomats said. But in its capture of Pochala, on the border with Ethiopia, the army apparently used mercenaries from the Anyuak tribe, who mostly live in Ethiopia, diplomats and aid workers said.
The rebels accused the new Ethiopian Government, which is on friendly terms with the Sudanese leadership, of giving the Sudanese Army free passage and of allowing Ethiopian troops to be used in the operation at Pochala. The Ethiopians denied the accusation.
 
Aid Workers Taken Out
 Western diplomats said they doubted that the Ethiopian Government had knowingly abetted the Sudanese military movements but said Ethiopia had little control over its borders in that area.
Five workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross stationed at Pochala to help more than 20,000 Sudanese refugees displaced by the civil war said that they were flown out of the town to Khartoum by Sudanese military aircraft after the town was taken. In Kapoeta, the United Nations has advised international agencies to scale back their activities because of fears of stepped up bombing.
The Government offensive coincides with an internal split within the rebel group led for the last decade by John Garang, a former member of the Sudanese Army. A breakaway group of rebels led by Riek Machar is said to have given the Sudanese soldiers safe passage as they move south from Malakal.
The rebels have also been weakened by the loss of their bases inside Ethiopia after the change in government there in May.

It's Business as Usual in Thailand (Votes for Sale)

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, March 17

 BODY:
It is election time in Thailand, which means that many of the country's major political parties and politicians are out on the campaign trail not to win votes, but to buy them.
The leader of Chat Thai, one of the nation's largest political parties, insists that he does not buy votes. But he was spotted several days ago leaving 500 baht, or about $20, to pay for a 50-cent bowl of steaming noodles and bean curd at a noodle stand in southern Thailand. After leaving such a large tip, he may well have been hopeful of the startled vendor's vote. 
 The general election scheduled for this Sunday was supposed to be different. It will be the first election in Thailand since February 1991, when the Thai military staged a coup to oust what it described as -- and much of the public believed was -- a wildly corrupt civilian Government.
Nevertheless, Thailand's parliamentary candidates are buying votes and rigging polls as never before.
All that seems to have changed for many Thai politicians are the techniques of vote buying -- they are more inventive -- and the cost, which has become much more expensive.
 
'Politician by Accident'
 The newest bout of dirty politics comes even as Thailand's 57 million people have had their aspirations for good government raised.
While the junta, which calls itself the National Peacekeeping Council, holds absolute power in Thailand, and seems certain to remain in charge after the election, it can take credit for having appointed an interim Prime Minister, Anand Panyarachun, whose administration has been described as the most capable and honest in Thailand's recent history.
Mr. Anand, a former Ambassador to Washington, insists that he is a "politician by accident" and that he will leave government after the election, a decision that has added to the frenzy as political parties scramble to have a say in who replaces him.
"We have no magic wand to stop political corruption," said Gothom Arya, a human rights advocate who is a leader of Poll Watch, an organization that is planning to deploy 30,000 volunteers to monitor polling stations in hopes of what Mr. Gothom described as a "less corrupt election."
It will not be easy. Thailand's economic boom -- despite the global recession, its economy is growing by nearly 8 percent a year -- may have worsened political corruption by flooding the major political parties with cash.
There are reports of brazen vote buying all across Thailand, with candidates and their local representatives, known in Thai as kamnan, or canvassers, handing out everything from 500-baht notes to movie tickets to live ducks to lipsticks. Even small gifts are appreciated in a nation in which the per capita income, while rising quickly, is still only the equivalent of $1,500 a year.
In the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, one candidate is reported to have paid tailors to mend the clothes of local voters, while in central Chachoengsao province, a political party has offered voters free appointments with a dentist.
In what Mr. Gothom described as a particularly clever scheme, canvassers are taking bets on the election outcome.
In a typical case, a party canvasser goes into a village and takes a bet of 5 baht, or about 20 cents, from a villager, agreeing to pay out 500 baht if the party's candidate wins. The villager is then left with a strong financial incentive to support the party.
There is nothing to guarantee that Thai voters will vote for the candidate who gives them money or a handsome gift. But even Thai politicians who condemn the practice admit that vote buying has often worked.
It has lingered in Thailand -- especially in rural areas, which account for nearly three-quarters of the population -- for reasons that can go beyond money and involve the value placed here on the concepts of community and personal loyalty.
Political canvassers do indeed carry around suitcases stuffed with baht notes for payoffs. At the same time they tend to work in the same region for years and often serve as the only real connection many voters have to their government.
The most likely outcome to the election, Thai politicians say, is some sort of coalition government, possibly led by Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, Thailand's army chief and an architect of last year's coup.
Several candidates are trying to stop General Suchinda, most notably Chamlong Srimuang, a retired army major general and devout Buddhist who earned the title "Mr. Clean" during his seven years as Governor of Bangkok.
He stepped down from that post to seek election to Thailand's parliament on a platform calling for an end to political corruption. The Palang Dharma, or Power of Virtue, party, which he leads, has pledged not to buy votes.
While polls show that Mr. Chamlong is one of Thailand's most popular politicians, it is unclear whether his support extends outside Bangkok to rural voters, who are thought most susceptible to vote buying.
A Palang Dharma candidate in the central Thai province of Nonthaburi attended a religious ceremony last week in which he and his competitors were asked to swear they would not buy votes.
During the ceremony, the candidates sipped from a bowl of holy water gathered from temples around the nation and, with a Buddhist monk looking on as witness, demanded divine retribution if they violated their no vote-buying oath.
It was a punishment that most of their opponents were apparently unwilling to risk. Of the 34 provincial candidates invited to the ceremony, only 7 showed up.

HEADLINE: Conflicting Aims in Booming Health Care Lobby Help Stall Congress

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Leading members of Congress say they are swamped with conflicting messages from a growing number of lobbyists and lawyers representing all facets of the health-care industry.
Moreover, no one expects those trends to be reversed in the next decade as the Government assumes a bigger role in financing health care. 
 "On the whole, health-care lobbyists have had the effect of retarding change and blocking it," said Jack A. Meyer, president of New Directions for Policy, a Washington research institute. "That's because most of the effort has come from smart, well-financed groups that have a vested interest in the status quo. They do a good job of pointing out the potential risks and costs of change, but there is little information about the broader public interest in the benefits of change."
The number of national health groups that have offices here or employ Washington representatives has grown to 741, from 502 in 1986 and 117 in 1979. The numbers are tabulated by the National Health Council, a Washington forum for health-care advocates.
 
$60 Million in Donations
 Many of the health-care groups try to influence legislation by contributing to lawmakers' re-election campaigns. Data compiled by Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, show that health and medical organizations have contributed $60 million to candidates for Congress in the last decade, including $19 million since January 1989.
Consumer groups, the elderly and labor unions also have lobbyists, but Gail E. Shearer, manager of policy analysis at Consumers Union, said: "The voice of the consumer is a very small and quiet one. On most health issues we are outnumbered and outgunned."
Democrats and Republicans have introduced dozens of bills to restrain soaring health costs and to assist the 35 million people who have no health insurance. Lawmakers agree that the current situation is unacceptable but say there is virtually no chance Congress will pass comprehensive legislation on the issue this year.
While lobbyists did not create the current impasse, their forceful advocacy has magnified differences among competing interests. Umbrella groups like the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association are still important. But many specialty and subspecialty groups have set up shop here to gain more direct access to Administration officials and members of Congress.
 
Effectiveness Equals Spending
 The effectiveness of these groups contributes to the increase in national health spending, as each seeks more money for its members and their special concerns without advocating cutbacks elsewhere in the Federal budget. These groups often achieve their goals by focusing on complex technical issues, like payment for kidney dialysis, X-rays and anesthesia services.
"The larger the number of groups, the greater the paralysis," said Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy at Harvard's School of Public Health. "The number of groups that have to agree on an issue is so large, it's almost impossible to reach consensus."
The Washington representatives include such diverse figures as Peter Barton Hutt, the nation's leading authority on food and drug law; Hope S. Foster, a lawyer and lobbyist for clinical laboratories since 1973; Deborah L. Steelman, an unpaid political adviser to President Bush, who has registered as a lobbyist for insurance and drug companies, and Kevin Walker, who dispenses more than $3 million dollars every two years from the political war chest of the American Medical Association.
The advocates also include William A. Bailey, a person with AIDS who lobbies on AIDS-related issues for the American Psychological Association; Paul R. Willging, chief lobbyist for the nation's nursing homes, and Michael D. Bromberg, the politically well-connected director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 investor-owned hospitals.
Harvey A. Yampolsky, former chief counsel to the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services, explained the need for specialization this way: "You wouldn't go to a dermatologist if you needed heart surgery. These days a doctor shouldn't go to a general-practice attorney if he has technical Medicare questions."
While lobbyists may stymie major changes in the health-care system, they can also define areas of consensus. Business executives and labor union leaders have come together in coalitions -- inconceivable a few years ago -- to advocate changes, including a requirement for health insurance coverage of all workers.
 
A.M.A. Redefines Itself
 Afraid of being excluded from the debate, the American Medical Association has repositioned itself as an advocate of change, and the doctors' group often finds it has more in common with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. than with the Bush Administration.
Henry J. Aaron, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said: "The leaders of the A.M.A. have gone from a rejectionist position into a true negotiating mode. They are very constructive participants, right in the mainstream of the current debate on health-care reform."
The lobbying process feeds on itself, as new coalitions form to counter the message of other lobbyists. One of the more influential groups, the National Leadership Coalition for Health Care Reform, includes labor unions and corporations like Chrysler and Bethlehem Steel. In November, it endorsed a plan, like one favored by Senate Democrats, under which employers would have to provide health insurance for workers or pay a tax to finance such coverage.
Another coalition is combating such proposals. The new group, the Health Care Equity Action League, includes scores of small businesses and drug, hospital and health insurance companies. The league, like the Bush Administration, wants to make it easier for small businesses to buy health insurance, but says new taxes and Government mandates would bankrupt many small businesses, destroying jobs.
 
Divided Industry
 Internal conflict can be found in almost every part of the vast health-care industry, which now employs 8.4 million people and accounts for nearly 14 percent of the nation's economic activity.
The Health Insurance Association of America, which represents 300 commercial insurers, opposes Federal regulation of premiums and underwriting practices. But within the organization, there is sometimes a split between small companies and big companies. Some of the big companies are willing to accept the idea of Federal regulation, as are many nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
Members of Congress sponsoring legislation to regulate health insurance say they hope to exploit such divisions to overcome opposition to their bills.
The American Medical Association complained loudly about a Bush Administration plan to cut Medicare payments to doctors last year. But the American Academy of Family Physicians did not leave the fortunes of its members entirely to the medical association. It pursued its own lobbying campaign to make sure its members got the increases they had been promised by Congress.
The American Hospital Association has also experienced internal strains. Teaching hospitals, Roman Catholic hospitals, Protestant hospitals, public hospitals, rural hospitals, children's hospitals and psychiatric hospitals all have their own lobbying organizations.
 
Drug Makers Win One
 The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is more cohesive and therefore more effective than many trade groups. On March 11, it helped defeat a Senate proposal intended to hold down prices on prescription drugs.
The sponsor of the proposal, Senator David H. Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, said the drug companies "have a tremendous impact politically and are very well organized in their lobbying."
Health groups enhance their influence by sponsoring political action committees. In its study of campaign contributions from the health-care industry, Common Cause said the biggest donor by far was the political arm of the American Medical Association, which gave $11.9 million to Congressional candidates from 1981 to 1991.
The next most generous donors were the political action committees for the National Association of Life Underwriters, who sell health insurance, the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Hospital Association, the report said.
In a separate study, the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group, said the health and insurance industries gave $19 million to Congressional candidates in the 1990 elections, as against $14 million of donations from agricultural interests and $8 million from military contractors.

HEADLINE: Tradition of Inequity;
States Are Urged to Show Less Favoritism To University Systems' Flagship Campuses

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
A series of lawsuits and court decisions charging discrimination have put pressure on states to distribute more fairly the money they give to various campuses in state university systems.
The equitable financing issue, now being contested in four states, is steeped in both tradition and bias. In most states, legislatures for decades have given more money to one university than others in the same system, arguing that the state needs a showcase institution of higher education. But civil rights groups and individuals who have brought lawsuits in Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and, three weeks ago, in New York assert that these states' allocations for public university systems are rooted in racial and ethnic discrimination. 
 The newer campuses tend to have more students from minority groups, fewer professors with doctorate degrees and fewer or no graduate divisions or professional schools. Whether this is due to discrimination or to tradition is an issue that could land more states in court, say many education consultants and analysts.
"You can make an argument on both sides," said Caspa L. Harris, president of the National Association of College and University Business Managers.
 
Finding Racism in Budgets
 In December, a Federal judge ruled that Alabama's university system had vestiges of racial discrimination and that two historically black universities had been shortchanged by about $10 million each. The Legislature was ordered to revise its distribution of education money. Mississippi is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling in a similar case.
Last month in Texas, a judge ruled that the state's method of financing its two university systems was unconstitutional because universities in South Texas, which have a predominantly Hispanic enrollment, did not receive enough state aid and did not offer enough advanced degree programs. The universities in South Texas are 30 to 40 years old, with less history than the century-old University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University, the flagship universities in the two different state systems.
And three weeks ago a lawsuit was filed against New York State by more than 250 professors and students in the City University of New York system, where the majority of students are black or of Hispanic descent. The suit contends that state officials allocate more money for the State University of New York system, whose enrollment is mostly white, and that the disparity is discriminatory.
"What we have all begun to realize in the past 20 years in civil rights work is that the barriers that exist are no longer de jure sorts of barriers," said Susan E. Brown, a lawyer in San Francisco for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which brought the equity suit in 1987 against the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which supervises the state's 116 public institutions. "What exists now are more subtle mechanisms, and funding is one of the more pervasive in terms of lack of equality."
 
Less Money to Pacify
 In healthier fiscal eras, states sidestepped the equity issue and claims of discrimination by giving institutions with mostly minority enrollments more money every budget year. But this still did not lift them to parity, and now the recession has made it more difficult to mask a flawed system of state appropriations to public universities.
"Institutions got a little bit during the good times, but they still have not received the funding and the programs that would make them competitive and equal institutions," said Julius Chambers, director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in New York.
But to charge that discrimination is the only factor in the debate over equity is simplistic, others argue. Many state university systems have long focused their energy on one or two leading institutitions, building up law schools, medical schools and professional schools.
As public university systems have grown, campuses have been created near major industrial and economic centers, often dictated by employer needs. In the Texas suit, the Mexican-American legal group asserted that the six public universities near the Mexican border had been discriminated against in state appropriations. But that region of the state is largely rural, with little industry.
 
Re-Slicing a Smaller Pie
 "Education tends to follow the economy and not the other way around," said Dennis Jones, president of the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, a private, not-for-profit management consulting group in Boulder, Colo. "You aren't going to find many engineering schools in places where there isn't a lot of industry. That's a function of 100 years of evolution."
That evolution is difficult to reverse. As a result, Mr. Jones said, it is unrealistic for public universities that are not the flagship university to expect to get the same financing and the same academic programs.
But because state education budgets are shrinking and opposition to the current distribution system is growing, education experts say, legislatures around the country may be forced to give the flagship campuses less and others more. That approach is not expected to be popular among the universities that have grown accustomed to advantages. "Reallocation," said Mr. Jones, "comes hard."

HEADLINE: U.S. Takes Lead Back In Exports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 17

 BODY:
The United States overtook Germany last year as the leading exporter of goods, regaining a spot it last held in 1989, the world's main trade body said today.
Germany's figures were hurt by the weakening European economy and the rebuilding of eastern Germany. United States export growth, while slightly down from 1990, rose by five times the world average. 
 United States exports rose 7.5 percent to $422 billion, while exports of most West European countries stagnated or shrank, the survey said. Germany's foreign sales dropped 4.5 percent, to $403 billion, and slipped to second place. Japan, France and Britain followed.
 
Trade Growth Slows
 Growth in world trade volume slowed for the third consecutive year, to 3 percent in 1991, the head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Arthur Dunkel, said in an annual report to delegates. It was the smallest gain since 1983 and down from 5 percent in 1990.
But Mr. Dunkel also told the group's 103-nation council that "a modest economic recovery may now be under way," World trade growth could increase to 4 percent this year, he said.
A new world trade agreement could help revive economic growth by raising business confidence, Mr. Dunkel said. He urged delegates to finish the five-year-old talks known as the Uruguay Round, the organization's most comprehensive effort to lower barriers to commerce and rewrite trade rules.
 
Account Deficit Shrinks
 The GATT report came as America said that its record level of export sales helped to shrink its current account deficit last year to $8.62 billion, the nation's best performance in international trade in nearly a decade. That marked a sharp turnaround from a $92.12 billion deficit in 1990. In addition to higher exports sales, the improvement came from foreign payments to cover the costs of the Persian Gulf war and from lower import demand caused by the recession.
In value, world merchandise exports rose 1.5 percent, to $3.53 billion, last year, the smallest growth since 1985, GATT said. Foreign sales of services rose 5 percent, to $810 billion.
Germany's exports were cut by the sluggish economies of the country's European trade partners and the collapse of East European sales, GATT economists said. Reconstruction in eastern Germany consumed goods that otherwise would be exported.
United States export growth, while down slightly from 8 percent in 1990, was broad based and partly attributed to several years of slow wage increases and low inflation during the recession, the economists said.
United States sales increased significantly in Mexico, Southeast Asia, Germany and the Middle East, the economists said. Exports of motor vehicles, aircraft, chemicals and iron and steel rose more than average, they said.
Asia recorded the strongest trade growth last year and continued to gain market share. Hong Kong replaced the former Soviet Union as the 10th-biggest exporter. China passed South Korea and Switzerland to become No. 13.
 
Developing Countries Improve
 Spain, Singapore, Mexico and Malaysia also improved their export performance, the survey said.
Developing countries, especially Asia and Latin America, are opening markets and integrating their economies into the world economy, Mr. Dunkel said.
Exports by Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union fell an average 20 percent last year, and the region cut imports 25 percent, GATT estimated. The former Soviet Union alone reduced imports 42 percent.

HEADLINE: Blacks in Science Program Shatter Stereotype

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CATONSVILLE, Md.

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, virtually the only sounds in a classroom came from chalk skipping over a blackboard, scrawling a profusion of mathematical expressions, symbols and formulas.
Many of the 13 students in the class peered up from their notes with preoccupied looks. But for Lance Hester and Gary Young, electrical engineering majors in a special black scholarship program, the blackboard jumble seemed rather standard fare. 
 "It was pretty much a review; she was just going over the basics," said Mr. Young, a 20-year-old junior, referring to the teacher. "So far it is not too bad."
He and Mr. Hester, 21, are the only blacks in the class. It is their habit to sit in the front so that, in Mr. Young's words, "the teacher will recognize us."
 
Exploding Stereotypes
 In the last three years, many of this university's professors, administrators and students have come to recognize the tightly knit group of 70 academically talented black students known as Meyerhoff Scholars. Almost from their first days in 1989 on this predominantly white campus of 10,000 students, these scholars began exploding racial stereotypes about blacks' ability to excel in the study of science and technology.
"We've had three years of experience and many of the presuppositions are gone," Michael K. Hooker, the university's president, said of the program. "Now, very often the best student in a science or math or engineering class is going to be a black student. That has brought about a whole cultural change among their fellow white students and among the faculty."
The Meyerhoff program was created in 1988 by Robert Meyerhoff, a white Baltimore philanthropist. His aim was to help a score of academically exceptional black male students who were committed to studying science by giving them extensive financial assistance and academic guidance. Mr. Meyerhoff said he started the program because he had been disturbed by the plight of so many young black American men. In its first year the program was solely financed by a $522,000 grant from the Robert and Jane Meyerhoff Foundation.
After the first year the program expanded to include black female students. It also began drawing national attention and financial contributions from the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, American Telephone & Telegraph and Apple Computer.
 
Paid Internships
 All Meyerhoff Scholars are given full, four-year academic scholarships. They also get books, personal computers and software, adult mentors, paid summer internships and field trips.
The students are encouraged to be assertive in seeking advice or tutoring, studying in groups and getting to know the university faculty and staff, program officials said.
Of 71 students who have begun the program, only one has dropped out, changing to a non-science major. The students have a cumulative grade point average of 3.4 out of a possible 4.0, university officials said.
Dr. Hooker said that the program is an important part of the university's life and that senior faculty members and department heads are actively involved.
For example, Catherine Fenselau, chairwoman of the chemistry department, helped arrange a summer internship in England for a Meyerhoff Scholar. That enabled the student, Maceo Thomas, a 20-year-old biochemistry major, to do research work with histamines in a hospital laboratory at the University of London, and that led to his being the co-author of a scientific paper developed during his internship.
"It has been extremely gratifying," said Mr. Meyerhoff, a 68-year-old businessman and engineering graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who, with his wife Jane, has given the program more than $1 million. "I always felt that black students had more disadvantages in the sense of not having the economic advantages that a typical white college student had."
As the program evolved, however, it became apparent to those who ran it that the disadvantages that even the most promising black students face at predominantly white colleges and universities had less to do with economic conditions than with a sense among blacks that there was no place at the universities for them. Today, Meyerhoff Scholars repeatedly talk enthusiastically about how the program helps connects them to the institution.
"We feel a sense that we can do well here," said one student.
Most of the students are from Maryland, but they represent a broad socio-economic cross section. Some are the children of professionals while others come from single-parent households in which mothers struggled to feed and clothe their children.
Among the students are honor society presidents, valedictorians and straight-A students, some of whom are equally comfortable with a football or a microscope or a microphone. Self-possessed and accomplished, they are the brightest of the bright, among the top two percent of black students in the United States.
"What they have in common is that they are very high-achieving students," said Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, a black mathematician who is the university's executive vice president and who helped Mr. Meyerhoff launch the program. "What we see, as we do research on the students, is that the family support has been extraordinarily strong."
 
Support at Home
 Aliceson Y. King's mother, Carolyn King, became so interested in continuing to help her 19-year-old daughter that she founded a Meyerhoff parents support group a year ago. Now Carolyn King, a former teacher, is also working toward a doctorate in computer science. She is on the campus almost as often as her daughter, a pre-med and business major with a 3.6 grade point average.
All the Meyerhoff Scholars talk of similar examples of love and support from at least one parent, and some tell of a certain teacher who harbored high expectations for them.
Yet for all their ability and promise, the Meyerhoff Scholars need special attention, explained Dr. Hrabowski. It is not uncommon for science and mathematics majors, whether they belong to minorities or not, to change their minds about wanting to pursue such difficult and demanding subjects. Without guidance and support, many of them, despite their outstanding academic backgrounds, are likely to become discouraged and change majors.
Such guidance, said Dr. Hrabowski, is critically important for black students, who are often more isolated than white students and do not have black role models, mentors or fellow students who have traveled the course before them.
 
Battle of Expectations
 "Sometimes I think too much is expected of me," said Oletha Minto, an infectiously upbeat sophomore. This semester, for example, she was disappointed with herself because she received a 'B' in geography -- the first grade lower than an 'A' she had been given in a class in the last three years.
"I called Dr. Hrabowski and talked to him about it," she said. "I'm surprised he has any ears left."
His advice to her was basically to do her best and, if she was convinced that she was doing that, not to worry.
But Miss Minto also recently earned the highest-score in her organic chemistry class, becoming the first black student to receive an A in organic chemistry since the university was founded in 1966.
Interest in black students pursuing science degrees comes amid rising concern that the nation's leadership in science and technology is slipping at a time when racial and ethnic minorities are projected to become an increasing part of the nation's work force.
 
Looking to the Future
 Today there is a dearth of minority scientists and mathematicians. The National Science Foundation, which supports the Meyerhoff program with an annual grant of $200,000, discovered in 1989 that of the 861 doctoral degrees awarded in mathematics, 11 went to blacks.
For Meyerhoff Scholars, the road to the program begins with an extensive search for the most qualified applicants. Typically, Meyerhoff Scholars had grade averages of B-plus or higher in high school and combined S.A.T. scores in math and language skills in the mid-1200's; the highest possible combined score on the test is 1600. One Meyerhoff Scholar scored a 780 out of a possible 800 on the math portion.
Many Meyerhoff students said they had turned down full scholarships to more prestigious institutions, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, to be part of the program.
Charles Hines 3d, a lanky 20-year-old who is combining majors in biology with psychology, said becoming a Meyerhoff Scholar is "probably one of the best decisions I've made."
Voicing a common complaint among these students, Mr. Hines said that in high school he had often encountered hostility from other black students who did not share his enthusiasm about learning. "Here, I have found cooperation," he said.
Miss Minto, who was raised with seven brothers and sisters in Silver Spring, Md., said nothing in her life prepared her for her first days in the program. But it was not that she found the work difficult. She was simply overwhelmed, she said, by images she had never seen.
"I'd never seen so many smart black people in one place at one time in my life," she said, with a knowing grin. "The brain power. I was just in awe."

HEADLINE: Two Giant Banks Plan To Merge

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 17

 BODY:
Midland Bank P.L.C., Britain's third-largest bank, and the parent of the giant Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced today that they had agreed to merge.
The merger would create a bank that would rank about 10th in the world, with assets of more than $270 billion and capital, or shareholders' funds, of about $12 billion. 
 In a statement, the companies said their boards had agreed for Hongkong and Shanghai's parent, HSBC Holdings P.L.C., to buy Midland for "a significant premium" above its market price before the deal was announced. On Monday, Midland's shares were valued at a total of 1.98 billion, or about $3.43 billion, on the London Stock Exchange.
No other specific details were disclosed.
 
First Step Toward a Merger
 The Hong Kong bank bought a 14.7 percent stake in Midland in 1987, in a move seen as the first step toward a merger. The two seem like a good geographical match, with Midland's significant presence in Europe and HSBC's strong position in East Asia and foothold in North America, where it owns Marine Midland Bank in the United States and Hong Kong Bank of Canada. In addition, the two have also developed close management and operational ties since 1987.
But analysts suspect that the prime impetus for the merger is the approach of 1997, when Hong Kong, now a British colony, will be handed over to China.
William Purves, HSBC's chairman, said in an interview in the British magazine The Banker in December: "There's no evidence of us turning our back on Hong Kong. It's a very important market for us and we're continuing to expand our business here."
Still, while China's Communist Government has promised to keep Hong Kong's capitalist system largely intact, many corporations are nervous. And analysts say HSBC seems eager to reduce its dependence on its home market.
HSBC incorporated itself in Britain in April. And while its headquarters remain in Hong Kong, several analysts speculated today that if the merger went through, headquarters might be moved to Britain. It would be Britain's largest bank.
Analysts predicted that the takeover price for Midland would be 3.50 to 4 a share, or a total of $4.75 billion to $5.43 billion. In London, Midland's stock price soared 30 percent today, to 3.29.
The price for the Midland shares HSBC does not already own would be $4.05 billion to $4.63 billion if analyst estimates prove accurate.
Some analysts note that the merger would produce a global giant that might be able to exploit the decision by large Japanese and American banks to reduce their international lending because of financial problems at home or the need to increase their capital to meet international standards.
"There is an opportunity to take a greater share of the international lending markets and enjoy greater profit margins on that business," said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at IBCA Ltd., a credit-rating agency.
 
Questioning a Strategy
 But Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Lehman Brothers International Ltd., questioned the strategy of trying to create a global bank, given how many other banks have tried and failed.
"International strategies have been pretty well discredited," he said. Noting that HSBC already has plenty of problems with its existing foreign operations, he asked, "Will such a company be more efficient or are we going to see another part of its enormous geographic empire with difficulties every time we turn around?"
HSBC, which has assets of $160.5 billion and capital of $7.23 billion excluding undisclosed reserves, earned $728 million in 1991 after taxes and minority interests. On a comparable basis, Midland, which has assets of $111 billion and capital of $4.39 billion, lost 39 million, or about $72.8 million.
Analysts say the desire of HSBC to reduce its dependence on Hong Kong helps to explain its purchase in the 1980's of Marine Midland, which has had no connection with the Midland Bank of Britain, and James Capel & Company, the London-based brokerage house.
 
Problems at Midland
 "But the bulk of their earnings are still from their domestic operations," said William Vincent, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd.
Midland is widely seen as the one that most needs the merger. In the last decade, it has been badly weakened by its disastrous acquisition of the Crocker National Bank of California, loans to less-developed countries, high costs, a bad guess on the direction of interest rates in Britain and a growing pile of bad debts. Crocker has since been sold to Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco.
With Midland seeming to make slow progress in tackling its problems and with HSBC mired in its own difficulties, the two called off previous merger plans in December 1990.
In March 1991, Midland reported that it lost $349.2 million in 1990 and announced it was cutting its dividend in half, the first such action taken by a leading British bank since the 1930's. It also announced that it would replace its chairman and chief executive, Sir Christopher McMahon, the following June.
 
Bank's New Leaders
 Sir Christopher was succeeded by two men. The new chairman is Sir Peter Walters, the retired chairman of British Petroleum P.L.C., who had been deputy chairman of National Westminister Bank P.L.C. until he joined Midland. The new chief executive is Brian Pearse, the former finance director of Barclays Bank P.L.C., Britain's largest bank.
But Midland surprised analysts on Feb. 27, when it announced that pretax profits in 1991 had more than tripled to 36 million, or about $67 million, and that it was maintaining its dividend. Its performance improved as a result of its success in holding down costs, a drop in the second-half charge for bad and doubtful loans and growth in interest and fee income.
At the time, Mr. Pearse said he suspected that competitors were considering making a bid for Midland.
But since Midland reported its earnings, its stock price has climbed. Analysts speculated today that HSBC might have decided to make its move now out of concern that the Midland's stock price would continue to increase, raising the cost of a merger.
 
Another Possible Suitor
 There has also been speculation that another big British bank, Lloyds Bank P.L.C., is interested in merging with Midland. Analysts said Lloyds might want to try to lower its costs by merging with a competitor to achieve greater economies of scale in its domestic market, as big banks in the United States have been trying to do.
For its part, HSBC has had its own problems. Its expansion has been anything but smooth. Marine Midland, James Capel and an Australian subsidiary have been plagued with losses and HSBC has made big changes in their managements and operations.
These efforts appear to be working, which may be another reason for reviving the Midland merger. Marine Midland, based in Buffalo, and the Australian operation sharply reduced their losses last year and Capel moved into the black.

HEADLINE: Housing and Output on the Rise, Spurring Talk of Recession's End

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Government reports on industrial and housing activity today provided what many analysts regard as conclusive proof of economic recovery.
"The long recession is over," asserted Lawrence A. Hunter, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The jump in February housing starts and industrial production -- in addition to markedly improved business confidence and retail sales -- signal a clear turning point for the economy." 
 Builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1,304,000 during the month, the Commerce Department reported. The pace was 9.6 percent above that of January, which itself was substantially stronger than first estimated. The broadly based gain also raised the pace of housing starts to the fastest in nearly two years.
And at the nation's factories, mines and utilities, output was up six-tenths of 1 percent in February after falling in each of the three preceding months, the Federal Reserve reported. A rebound in production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for about half the gain.
In yet another report, Labor Department figures showed that inflation at the consumer level rose three-tenths of 1 percent during the month as jumps in the prices of food and clothing were partly offset by falling prices for energy. [Page D21.]
Although the economy has still not demonstrated more strength than it did during the short-lived recovery of 1991, analysts cite various factors in contending that this rebound is likely to be a sustained one, albeit one with probably less than the usual vigor.
"What you have got going for you this time is substantially lower interest rates, so housing affordability, for example, is substantially greater," said William C. Melton, chief economist for I.D.S. Financial Services in Minneapolis. "You also have a much better inventory situation, which means sales are translated more quickly into new production than 9 or 12 months ago."
Taken as a whole, today's batch of statistics was the most convincing evidence so far that a recovery has now firmly taken hold.
Housing, for example, "is fueling a sharp rebound in housing-related retail sales," observed Edward Yardeni and Deborah Johnson, economists at C. J. Lawrence. Last week the Government reported January and February data showing the best back-to-back retailing advances in more than six years, with furniture and household equipment averaging increases in sales of nearly 2 percent.
The White House, however, mindful of how the rebound in late spring and early summer 1991 suddenly dissipated, greeted today's figures with caution.
"It's very good news," said Michael J. Boskin, the President's top adviser on economics. "But while the economy clearly has improved for the last couple of months and the data are consistent with the early stages of a recovery, we should wait for broader signs of recovery for a longer period of time before jumping to any conclusions."
Mr. Boskin's tentative view was seen by various private analysts as protecting the President against possible charges of over-optimism during the election campaign should the economy relapse. They also said that an acknowledgment of a solid recovery would reduce pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide some monetary-policy "insurance" of a rebound.
Leading Congressional Democrats, quick to point out negatives in the economic picture in recent weeks, volunteered no comments today. An aide to Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, said his office had no statement.
 
Housing Starts
 It was the housing results, which were even better than expected, that seemed to impress economists most. Starts climbed 9.6 percent in February after a January increase that was revised upward, to 6.4 percent. Single-family homes accounted for the entire February gain.
Moreover, all regions of the country posted solid increases, in constrast to January, when the Midwest boomed while the Northeast, South and West all had modest declines.
Once again, the Northeast did the worst of the four, suggesting a slower recovery there than in other regions, but its construction pace did pick up to a rate of 155,000 in February from 144,000 in January.
For the Midwest, the annual pace spurted to 360,000 from 315,000, while the South advanced to 504,000 from 472,000 and the West rose to 285,000 from 259,000.
Over all, single-family starts jumped 14.7 percent, to 1,146,000 from 999,000. Apartments and other multifamily dwellings declined moderately, continuing in the doldrums as the oversupply of existing units is worked off.
Builders have now stepped up groundbreaking in 10 of the latest 12 months, with February's pace, at 1,304,000, representing a 29.4 percent gain over February 1991.
"The housing recovery looks very, very strong, and it looks solid," said Norman Robertson of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
This, combined with the industrial production data, prompted him to raise his estimate of gross domestic product for the politically sensitive second quarter to a rate of 3 percent or more, from the range of 2 to 2.5 percent Mellon had been estimating.
The housing report also showed that permits issued for new homes, a predictive indicator, climbed 4.2 percent in February, to a rate of 1,160,000. This followed a 5.3 percent increase in January, with the latest pace 32.4 percent ahead of February 1991.
Shipments of mobile homes, the department reported, climbed 9.1 percent in January to a rate of 192,000. These figures lag behind starts and permits by a month.
 
Industrial Output
 The advance of six-tenths of 1 percent in industrial output, one of the chief contemporaneous indicators even though it covers only about one-third of the economy, was largely as expected in light of the Government's employment report early this month showing increases in the number of people with jobs and the hours they worked.
The report confirmed the impression of a sustainable recovery, with increased activity in most categories. Factory output rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, with durable goods up 1 percent and nondurables up three-tenths of 1 percent.
Mining, rebounding from a sharp January decline, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, while utility output fell for the third straight month, affected by a continuation of relatively mild winter weather.
The nation's industries operated at 78.2 percent of capacity in February, up from 77.9 percent, the first increase since a tiny one in September.
 
Autos Show Strength
 Motor-vehicle assemblies rebounded to a 9.1 million annual pace after tumbling to 8.2 million in January, the report stated. Consumer goods excluding automotive products climbed 1.3 percent, mainly because of a substantial rise in output of appliances; nonetheless, this category remained below the level of late summer. Nondurable consumer goods edged up as increases for food and chemicals were nearly offset by declines for clothing, paper products and energy.
Business equipment rose three-tenths of 1 percent, not counting vehicles, while construction supplies rose slightly, the Federal Reserve reported.
January's decline in overall production was revised to a drop of eight-tenths of 1 percent, instead of nine-tenths, but December's output fell six-tenths of 1 percent rather than the four-tenths originally reported.

HEADLINE: Le Pen Is Everybody's Problem

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times. Anna Quindlen is on vacation.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
The extreme nationalist right is rising in France to the point where it has become the central issue of national politics. Regional elections on Sunday will produce a map and a measure of the fever, expected to run as high as 30 percent of the vote in some areas.
French commentators have compared the phenomenon to Patrick Buchanan's surprising showing in the U.S. Republican primaries. The campaign slogan of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front party this year is "the French first." 
 But Mr. Le Pen is going for power, not just sending a message. He has already had some influence; some mainstream politicians have tilted toward his xenophobic line in hopes of winning some of his supporters.
Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing came out for changing the basis of French citizenship to blood lines rather than place of birth. This would deny citizenship to children of Arabs and Africans settled in France.
The former Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, expressed sympathy for French workers in low-cost housing living next to a migrant family "with father, three or four wives, about 20 kids, earning $10,000 a month without working." "If you add to that the noise and the smell, the French worker goes crazy," he said.
Although the governing Socialist Party denounces the National Front as proto-fascist, and some Socialist mayors have refused to rent city-owned halls for its meetings, Prime Minister Edith Cresson suggested organizing charter flights to send illegal immigrants back home.
There has been violence in clashes between pro- and anti-Front demonstrators, although nothing as brutal as some incidents provoked by skinheads in Germany. But the German extreme right is marginal, dramatized by world media that are ultra-sensitive to any display of German racism. The French movement has much more political weight, and it is tinged with anti-Semitism as well as anti-alienism.
It is also to some extent anti-European, drawing on fears of losing French identity and independence to the European Community. Foreigners crowding out Frenchmen are blamed for chronic unemployment, although immigrants mostly do dirty, unskilled jobs the French don't want.
Mainstream politicians blame one another for the rise of Mr. Le Pen, a florid, bouncy man with a nasty edge to his voice. Socialists point out that the center-right gives him respectability when candidates make electoral deals to squeeze out the left.
Conservatives stress that the proportional election system introduced by the Socialist Government for the 1986 parliamentary elections enabled the Front to become a highly visible national force with 33 deputies. The Socialists adopted the system, which gives parties representation based on their percentage of votes, in hopes that it would assure them of a majority. But the rightist parties won anyway. Now, President Francois Mitterrand is talking about returning to a proportional system for 1993 legislative elections, when the Socialists are expected to lose a large number of seats. Voter participation has dropped substantially, reflecting a distaste for traditional politics that only serves to enhance Mr. Le Pen's importance.
Conventional analysis attributing his rise to recession, immigration and frustration doesn't seem to account for the trend. It has to do with something deeper about perceptions of government and politicians, and France is not alone in that. It is dangerous and tempting to demagogues. France's chief rabbi has called it a threat to the nation, and Archbishop Albert Decourtray of Lyons had warned against "an adventure that could lead to the rise of some new Hitler."
Democracy's triumph is never final. Its quibbles and power plays open the door to anti-democrats in the name of nationalism. This must concern free people everywhere. It's not just a domestic issue anywhere.

New Top Management For Hambrecht & Quist

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
In a management realignment yesterday, Hambrecht & Quist, the San Francisco investment banking firm, named Daniel Case, its executive vice president in charge of investment banking, to be president and co-chief executive. William R. Hambrecht, who had been president, will become chairman and continue as co-chief executive.
Hambrecht & Quist, which was founded in 1968 by Mr. Hambrecht and George Quist, who is deceased, was the first investment banking firm to specialize in emerging growth companies. 
 The firm came to prominence in the early 1980's when it managed the initial public offerings of Apple Computer, Genentech and Peoples Express, only to stumble later in the decade before regaining its strength.
Hambrecht & Quist has raised $800 million in six initial offerings and four follow-on financings in 1992. Eight additional companies are currently in registration, and Hambrecht & Quist is the lead underwriter for five.
Mr. Case, who is 34, and Mr. Hambrecht, who is 56, together succeed Gordon S. Macklin, 63, currently chairman and co-chief executive. Mr. Macklin, who will leave the company on April 30, joined the firm in 1987 in a five-year arrangement. He will return to Washington, where his family lives.
William R. Timken, executive vice president-syndicate, was elected vice chairman, a new position.
Although Hambrecht & Quist is primarily known for its work in venture capital and initial public offerings, Mr. Case said that the firm was now focused on providing better service in what is known as the aftermarket, where research, private financing and merger and acquisition advice is provided to companies after they go public.
"We want to broaden the products and services offered, to make our clients want to stay with us as they grow," Mr. Case said.
One measure of the firm's success in this area is that "of all the companies we've taken public since June 1988, every one that's done a second deal has come back to us," Mr. Case said.
Mr. Case, who has spent his entire professional career at Hambrecht & Quist, began work with the firm as a summer intern in 1979 and returned full time in 1981. Like Mr. Hambrecht, he is a graduate of Princeton University, where he received a B.S. degree in economics and public policy and was named to Phi Beta Kappa. He was subsequently a Rhodes Scholar, specializing in economics and management studies.

Exxon Is Facing A Tougher Year

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Last year was the most profitable ever for the Exxon Corporation, mostly because of stunningly high earnings from its European and Far Eastern refining operations when prices for jet fuel and kerosene rose sharply during the Persian Gulf war.
But 1992 is shaping up as much tougher for Exxon and the other oil giants. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings to drop by 50 percent for Exxon and even more for most other global oil companies. 
 Prices of crude are moderately lower than in the first quarter a year ago and domestic natural gas prices have collapsed to the lowest winter level in more than a decade. Recession in the United States has crimped profits from gasoline and other refined products, and for chemicals.
Meanwhile, weakening economies overseas could make things worse for Exxon, which derived three-fourths of its $5.6 billion in earnings last year outside the United States. Europe, led by Germany, appears on the verge of recession. Even the fast-growth economies of the Far East, from Hong Kong to Japan, have slowed.
"I'm writing this year off," said George F. Friesen, senior oil analyst at the Deutsche Bank Capital Group. "I don't see the fundamentals improving for the industry until 1993."
Through yesterday, Exxon's share price this year had dropped 7 percent. That is better than oil stocks generally, which are down 9 percent since Jan. 1. But it is worse than the broader index of the Standard & Poor's industrials, which are down 1 percent for the year to date. In yesterday's New York Stock Exchange trading, Exxon shares were unchanged at $56.875.
Analysts fret that oil stocks, with the exception of Exxon, are now into their fifth consecutive quarter of underperforming the broader market -- an unusually long losing streak for the once-mighty sector. Mr. Friesen thinks the slump will extend at least into the summer.
Last year, share prices of the 15 largest oil companies declined 2 percent as a group, compared with a 27 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's industrial index. But shares of Exxon, the world's largest oil company, bucked the downward trend among oil stocks, with a price gain of 17 percent in 1991.
If economic recovery brings higher demand for gasoline, chemicals and other petroleum products in the United States this summer, oil companies whose businesses are more dependent on the domestic market, like ARCO, Unocal and Amoco, will benefit more than global behemoths like Exxon.
"The place to be in 1992 is in U.S. refining, rather than in Europe or the Far East," said Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. Chevron, ARCO and Unocal, which lost money in gasoline pricing battles on the West Coast early last year, he said, are now benefiting from lower refinery output there and firmer prices.
Yet William H. Brown 3d, an oil-market analyst and vice president of E. T. Petroleum Inc., in New York, said oil companies "are desperately looking" for, but have not seen, signs of rising gasoline demand throughout the United States.
Despite Exxon's strong 1991 performance, slumping demand overseas for refined products threatens to turn Exxon's shares into an industry laggard for awhile, said Michael Mayer, an oil analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company.
Mr. Mayer estimated that Exxon's 1992 earnings, excluding special items, would fall by 13 percent, to $3.65 a share, from $4.20 in 1991. (Net income including special nonrecurring transactions was $4.45 last year.) The Wall Street consensus currently is for Exxon's earnings to fall to $3.90 a share.
"Earnings will be down this year for virtually everybody" in the major oil group, Mr. Mayer said. "But if you look further out, you can see some nice increases in 1993."
Mr. Mayer said he expected Exxon to earn $4.10 a share next year. He bases that forecast on several projections: a rise in crude prices to an average of $21 a barrel, from near $19 now; an increase in natural gas prices to perhaps $1.50 for 1,000 cubic feet, compared with the current $1.20, and rising demand for chemicals and gasoline.
He also expects Exxon to approve a modest dividend increase later this year, to an annual rate of $2.80, from $2.68. That would keep its dividend yield near 5 percent if, as he predicts, the stock rises to about $60 a share by the end of the year.
"The yield is a good reason for owning energy stocks now," he said.
As with most major oil companies, the biggest jolt to Exxon's earnings is likely to be the first quarter. Mr. Mayer said the company's profits in foreign refining and marketing will plunge by more than $700 million, to about $250 million, from $937 million in the first three months of 1991 -- the company's best quarter ever.
Earnings for the first quarter should fall by about $1 billion, Mr. Mayer said, to 85 cents a share, compared with $1.78 a share a year ago. Mr. Jacoboski agreed with that earnings forecast, although he predicted that the decline would mean Exxon would be unable to raise dividends this year.

Dollar Falls Despite Signs The Recovery Is Continuing

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday despite new statistics indicating that the economy continues to recover.
The dollar fell after the Government released figures that showed housing starts were up 9.6 percent in February and industrial production rebounded six-tenths of 1 percent after three months of declines. The Government also said consumer prices rose a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Economists said the figures indicated the recession was fading.
But the dollar, which has rallied since January on improving economic numbers, lost ground despite the positive data. Analysts say traders now want to see extraordinary numbers before they will move the dollar higher.
Analysts said profit taking was responsible for some of yesterday's losses.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 132.80 Japanese yen, down from 133.90 Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.98 yen, to 133.32 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.45.
Japan is expected to cut its interest rates to help speed its economic recovery. That could bring a turnaround in the yen, which has been depressed by the stagnant Japanese economy.
The dollar also fell to 1.6460 German marks in New York, from 1.6620 on Monday. In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6525 marks from 1.6650.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.7350 in New York, from $1.7220 Monday. In London, sterling rose to $1.7315 from $1.7170.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.4900 Swiss francs, down from 1.5070; 5.5985 French francs, down from 5.6425; 1,237.00 Italian lire, down from 1,249.75, and 1.19315 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19875.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday, were: 1.4960 Swiss francs, down from 1.5085; 5.6105 French francs, down from 5.6560; 1,242.25 Italian lire, down from 1,252.00, and 1.1971 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1988.

HEADLINE: When U.S. Helped Poor College Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Proposing that President Bush should increase Government programs to help needy students attend private colleges, Samuel Hynes (Op-Ed, Feb. 29) cites the G.I. Bill, which provided one month's college tuition for each month a World War II veteran served on active duty. He could have mentioned National Youth Administration assistance for poor college students, predating the war.
Through that agency, the Federal Government provided money to colleges, which hired needy students to perform needed chores on campus. The work ran the gamut from cleaning urinals to washing test tubes and setting up lab experiments. 
 The pay may have varied, but in 1939 manual labor earned 35 cents an hour. That was not as paltry as it seems, because tuition at some of the finest schools ranged from $300 to $400 a year (Stanford's tuition after the war was $500 a year), a dormitory room cost $12 a month, and cafeteria bills seldom exceeded $10 a week. Through National Youth Administration income and summer employment indigent students managed.
Not only college students were assisted by the agency's programs. In the summer of 1941, when the Government foresaw the need for welders, machinists and other crafts for expanding military production, unemployed inner-city youths from Massachusetts were recruited, fed, housed in college dormitories and received daylong training for three months in the crafts shops of the local high schools in Springfield. That was a successful and worthwhile program.

HEADLINE: Bank Yields Show Mixed Trend for Week

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit went in mixed directions again last week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks bank rates
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday, "This is the fifth consecutive week that short-term certificate of deposit yields have remained flat, while yields on longer-term accounts such as the two-and-a-half-year and the five-year C.D.'s continue to rise slightly." 
 "Normally you would see a rebound," he continued, "in all rates after the fifth week following the end of a down cycle, but that is not happening this time. And the longer it takes for an upward movement to begin, the more likely we will see slow economic recovery."
Among commercial banks in the New York area the average yield on money market accounts dropped 5 basis points, to 3.42 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Among savings institutions, money market accounts averaged 3.95 percent, off 4 points from a week ago.
Marine Midland reduced the yield on its money market account by 31 points -- the biggest decline among the area banks. In the opposite direction, the yield on six-month certificates went up 22 points at the New York branch of the Bank of Tokyo Trust. In three-month certificates, Astoria Federal Savings led the way down, with a cut of 21 points.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area held steady at the previous week's 3.58 percent, while their six-month certificates averaged 3.89 percent, up 3 points from last week.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rate was 4.09 percent and 4.27 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Consumer Price Index Rises 0.3%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Government reported today, and analysts said inflation should remain low the rest of the year despite signs of more economic activity.
"Typically, what we see in the early stages of a recovery is a window of six to nine months that inflation stays the same and then begins to notch up," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York. 
 The Labor Department said the February advance in the Consumer Price Index followed increases of one-tenth of 1 percent in January, two-tenths in December and four-tenths in November.
 
Annual Rate Is 2.2%
 Extended over a full year, consumer prices rose at a 2.2 percent rate in the first two months of 1992. Most analysts expect prices to rise between 3 percent and 3.5 percent for the year. That is a bit higher than last year's 3.1 percent but well below the 6.1 percent increase in 1990 when the recession began.
Energy prices declined nine-tenths of 1 percent in February, the second straight drop. But Mr. Niemira said the recovery would eventually increase demand for energy and bring higher prices.
Food prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent for the month, and John M. Albertine, head of a Washington economic forecasting company, said that should not be a source of concern.
"Food prices have been amazingly low for the last year," he said. "Considering the bizarre weather we have had, a small jump in food prices should not come as much of a surprise."
 
Some Categories Jump
 Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, consumer prices were up four-tenths of 1 percent in February, the steepest advance since a similar gain last September.
Still, the Labor Department said much of that advance was attributed to a 1.5 percent rise in apparel prices accompanying the introduction of spring and summer clothing. Analysts said it was unlikely that the increase would be repeated.
A 1.5 percent jump in fresh fruit and vegetable prices accounted for nearly all of the increase in food prices. The cost of tomatoes soared 43.1 percent, helping to raise the overall price of vegetables 8.9 percent.
Meat prices, which had declined in January and in most of 1991, rose moderately. Beef was up five-tenths of 1 percent, and pork rose seven-tenths.
Cereal and bakery products were up three-tenths of 1 percent, while dairy products declined one-tenth.
In the energy sector, natural gas prices fell 1.3 percent, electricity declined 1.1 percent and the cost of home heating oil was down four-tenths of 1 percent.
Gasoline prices were down five-tenths of 1 percent in February after a 1.9 percent drop in January. They are now 18.6 percent lower than their peak in November 1990 after the flow of foreign oil was disrupted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 138.6, compared with 134.8 a year ago. That meant that goods costing $134.80 in February 1991 would have cost $138.60 last month.

HEADLINE: $8.62 Billion Trade Gap in '91 Was the Lowest in a Decade

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
America turned in its best performance in international trade in nearly a decade last year as the country's current account deficit shrank to $8.62 billion, the Government said today.
That marked a sharp turnaround from a $92.12 billion deficit in 1990. Nearly half the improvement came from foreign payments to cover the costs of the Persian Gulf war. But a record level of American export sales and the recession, which cut into import demand, also helped. 
 The current account is considered the best gauge of a country's international competitiveness because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services and investment flows between countries.
The current account deficit also declined in the final three months of the year, dipping to $10.27 billion compared with a revised $11.62 billion in the third quarter.
President Bush is counting on continued trade improvements this year to help propel the economic recovery and blunt campaign criticism that his Administration has failed to aggressively attack trade barriers against American products.
But many private economists predicted the 1992 current account deficit would shoot up to $50 billion or higher, as the gulf war payments dry up and export growth slows because of weakness overseas.
C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the good news in the current account performance was that it showed American businesses were becoming more competitive.
But he said growing economic weakness in Europe and Japan would cut into export growth this year while the improving United States economy would mean imports would start rising again.
The country's trade performance over the last two years was an important factor in helping to reduce the severity of the recession, but few analysts said they believed trade would be a positive factor this year.
"Whatever recovery we manage to have in 1992 will have to be home grown," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch. "Our export growth is going to slow down because of recessions in other countries."
Until the 1980's, the United States normally ran surpluses in the current account as its earnings on overseas investments and service trade like banking and tourism offset perennial merchandise deficits.
However, as Americans transferred billions of dollars overseas to pay for imported oil, televisions and cars, the United States was transformed from the world's largest creditor country into the world's largest debtor nation.
Last year's current account deficit was the smallest imbalance since a deficit of $5.87 billion in 1982. The current account had swelled to a record $160.2 billion in 1987.
For all of 1991, the deficit in merchandise trade fell to $73.6 billion from $108.1 billion in 1990 as exports increased 6.9 percent, to a record $416.5 billion, while imports declined 1.5 percent, to $490.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Federal Express to Trim European Operations

BYLINE: ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Underscoring its long-term difficulties in Europe, the Federal Express Corporation has said it will significantly scale back its operations there.
Its plan to halt delivery between countries in Europe starting May 4, a move resulting in a $254 million charge, is the second restructuring by the company in just over a year. In February 1991, the company drastically cut its operations in Britain, cutting 25 percent of its staff and taking a $121 million charge against earnings. 
 The latest cuts, analysts said, are the result of several missteps by Federal Express in its effort to repeat in Europe the success it continues to experience in the United States, where it holds almost half the market that it created two decades ago.
Federal Express plans to maintain operations in 16 major cities - down from 125 in Europe now - and subcontract deliveries outside those core markets to other carriers. The restructuring, announced on Monday, will reduce its European work force to 2,600 from 9,200.
The company also reported a quarterly loss of $298 million, compared with a deficit of $168.7 million in the period a year earlier. Revenues were $1.89 billion, up from $1.86 billion.
"The operations needed to support our intra-European service have been extremely costly, and we have not generated adequate revenues to cover our costs," said Frederick W. Smith, chief executive of Federal, in a statement.
Analysts said they were uncertain of the degree to which the cuts would reverse the company's European operating losses. For example, they are unclear whether the remaining 16-city European operations are profitable.
"The street is really puzzled about the extent of the reduction of the loss," said James D. Parker, an analyst with the Robinson-Humphrey Company in Atlanta. He noted that part of the troubles of Federal Express in Europe, particularly for its air-cargo business, resulted from sluggish economies there. Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, estimated the cuts would result in savings of up to $150 million a year. The company declined to speculate.
 
Improved Earnings Predicted
 Analysts generally predicted improved future earnings in the wake of the report. Federal Express shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, closed yesterday at $55.25, up $1.75.
Mr. Murphy of Morgan Stanley said the company mistakenly tried to secure a stronghold in Europe too quickly, an undertaking that should have been given 20 years to succeed. United Parcel Service, another established competitor in Europe, required 11 years to become profitable in Germany, he noted.
In Europe, consumer loyalty to the more established competitors, such as DHL, is high. Also, Mr. Murphy said the name Federal Express connoted a distinct United States flair that probably did not sit well with European customers. "It just wasn't their market," he said.
The company said that a unit of Australia's TNT Ltd. would buy the French operations of Federal Express and would serve as the agent of Federal Express for deliveries in 10 European countries. In Britain, Federal Express said it intends to sell its assets to Securicor Omega Express Ltd., the largest express-delivery company there.
The latest restructuring adds to the list of failed experiments by Federal Express to achieve "second generation" growth beyond its core market. In 1986, it ended its electronic mail service known as Zapmail. The move resulted in a $340 million pretax write-off, adding to their $317 million in losses suffered by the service from the time it was introduced in 1984.

HEADLINE: Big Job Loss in Los Angeles Us Expected

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Federal cuts in military spending could result in the loss of up to 420,000 jobs in Los Angeles County by 1995, a study group said yesterday.
The county receives more Federal military dollars than any other county in the nation, leaving it exposed to sharp spending cuts made possible by the end of the cold war. 
 The county's Aerospace Task Force called on local, state and Federal officials to help the industry make a transition to commercial projects.
"The aerospace decline is not primarily the result of market forces, or a failure of the industry or community to maintain competitiveness," the group said. "It is instead the result of a major change in Federal policy in response to new international circumstances."
The group's analysts estimated that military spending in Los Angeles County would fall to $3.5 billion to $4.9 billion in 1995, compared with $8.88 billion in 1990.
"This would result in the loss by 1995 of between 210,000 to 420,000 direct and indirect jobs within the county," the report said.
As of December 1991, the county had 225,600 workers directly employed in the aerospace industry, accounting for 5.3 percent of non-farm employment and 28.3 percent of manufacturing jobs.
The group estimated that for every $8 lost in military revenue, the county economy would lose $28.
The estimated loss includes the cost of unemployment insurance, public assistance, losses in personal income and retail trade, a downturn in residential and commercial construction, and losses in public sector revenues.
"Large defense firms are not easily able to convert their technology and manufacturing resources to commercial projects," the group said. "Large aerospace firms are still devoting a majority of their research and development eforts to developing new products for the Department of Defense."
The group recommended the formation of a privately financed venture capital fund to help in the transition of technology from aerospace and military uses to commercial applications like electric vehicles.

HEADLINE: Telmex to Triple Dividend

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 17

 BODY:
Investors scrambled to buy stock in Telefonos de Mexico today on news that the company planned to triple its dividend.
Analysts said the dividend, which would rise to 75 pesos, or 49 cents a share, from 25 pesos, or 16 cents, would still be too low by itself to justify buying the stock.
But they said the dividend move should bolster buyers' confidence in the stock. 
 The telephone company's American shares closed up $1, to $55.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Mexican bolsa, Telmex L shares ended up 3.3 percent, lifting the broader market sharply higher.
Telmex shares have been under pressure since the Mexican Government said this month that it might sell its 9.5 percent stake in May or June.
Analysts said Telmex might have decided to consider a dividend hike to appease investors. They also said that dividend yields tended to be low in Mexico because of inflation.
The proposed increase to 49 cents an American share would translate into roughly a 1 percent dividend yield. That compares with yields of about 6 percent for regional telephone companies in the United States.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 19.68 on Favorable Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed with strong gains yesterday on the heels of new economic data that gave further evidence of an economic recovery and a manageable inflation rate. A slight bounce back in the Tokyo market from its steep selloff the previous day also helped lift American shares.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.68 points, to 3,256.04. Traders said equity gains were underpinned by a firm bond market, which managed to erase its own earlier losses. 
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 3.19 points, to 409.58. Birinyi Associates, the Wall Street research firm, noted that the large block traders who were the big sellers on Monday were the big buyers of issues in the Dow and S.& P. 500 yesterday, after the economic data fell within expectations.
 
Other Gauges Higher
 Trading on the American Stock Exchange pushed the composite index up 2.76 points, to 405.64, while the Nasdaq composite index rang up a 5.33-point gain, to 623.27, led by technology and health-care issues. The Russell 2,000 index of smaller company stocks gained 1.1 points, to 207.21.
Investor confidence was lifted another notch or two by the positive economic data and by some follow-through from Monday's blue-chip rally. Other positive factors included the Tokyo rebound and gains in London.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a marked improvement over the previous day -- 188.8 million shares, up from Monday's 156 million, with gaining issues outpacing losing ones by 1,051 to 651.
The economic reports included stronger-than-expected February housing starts and Consumer Price Index data that were in line with forecasts. Industrial production was below expectations, and capacity utilization, while shy of predictions, still displayed some improvement.
Paul J. Kronlokken, the technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis, described the trading session as interesting, with a roller-coaster ride in bonds ending in a round trip that finally added some support to stocks.
He said, collectively, all the data were neutral, but individually they added early volatility to bonds, which limited the gains in stocks.
 
Elan Corp. at $46.50
 Among the issues posting gains yesterday, the Elan Corporation rose 1 5/8, to 46 1/2, on the Amex, after saying it would seek approval from the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year for a new wearable drug delivery device called "panoject." It would be used to administer powerful pain-killers in hospitals, initially morphine and approved analgesics.
Telemex, known as Telefonos de Mexico, rose 1, to 55 1/8, after it said its board would recommend increasing the dividend at its April 10 meeting.
The company received a "buy" recommendation from Stephanie Georges, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., who also liked Southwestern Bell, up 3/8, to 58 7/8, which owns 10 percent of Telemex and is part of a consortium with voting powers on the company's board.
Following its announcement late on Monday of a European restructuring, Federal Express gained 1 3/4, to 55 1/4. The package-delivery company said it was taking a $254 million charge for the restructuring. David Guthrie, an analyst at Morgan Keegan & Company, said, "If this doesn't allow them to reach the break-even point for their international operations within a couple of years, nothing will."
Applebee's International rose 3, to 18 1/2, yesterday. Traders noted that on Monday the restaurant franchiser publicly offered 2.8 million common shares at $15 each through underwriters led by Piper, Jaffray and Montgomery Securities.
Microsoft jumped 3 3/4, to 128, based on expectations of a strong reception for a soon-to-be-introduced upgraded version of its graphical system software. The company expects the product to overshadow a rival system upgrade that I.B.M is expected to introduce on March 31.

HEADLINE: As the Rich Get Leaner, The Poor Get the French Fries

SERIES: Resetting the Table: The Changing American Meal -- Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
IT was called "The Gourmet Revolution," "The Dietary Revolution," "The Awakening of American Taste." And now the revolution is complete. Sun-dried tomatoes and extra-virgin olive oil, once rationed to a chosen few, are now displayed in supermarkets and widely distributed. The exotic cuisines that people traveled the world to sample are now as close as the local frozen-food department.
"I knew it had peaked last year when a Midwestern menu made a pun on 'blackened redfish' and offered 'reddened blackfish,' " said Michael Batterberry, the editor of Food Arts magazine, a trade journal published in New York. "And then there are those prepared chicken entrees in the grocery that come complete with fake grill marks and a packet of mesquite flavoring for that fresh-grilled taste." 
 The revolution, which bridged generations and crossed class lines, began almost 20 years ago when the health-food consciousness of the Woodstock era combined with the dietary concerns of the buttoned-down establishment. Buoyed by the free-flowing cash of the 1980's, the alliance expanded into epicurean territory. It rearranged grocery shelves, rewrote the menus of luxury restaurants and McDonald's alike and reordered the national dietary guidelines. And just as rock-and-roll songs were tamed into Muzak, exotically seasoned avant-garde food was retooled as mall fare. Lite rock, lite food.
The revolution dovetailed with wider social changes as well, and eventually mirrored the disparity between the rich and the poor that the 80's economy amplified. The more that health concerns shaped the country's most expensive cuisine in restaurants and the higher the price rose on "healthful" designer vegetables, olive oils, pasta, fish and fat-reduced food products, the more the ingredients for healthful eating were beyond the reach of poor people.
Analyzing household food expenditures from 1980 to 1988, the Agriculture Department found that the average weekly grocery budget rose slightly or remained constant in middle- and upper-income households, said James T. Blaylock, an analyst of food spending with the department's Economic Research Service. At the same time, he said, food spending fell 13.1 percent in the nation's poorest households.
While the gap between the high and low ends of the national food chain widened, the types of food that people bought completed a reversal, said Dr. Nan A. Rothschild, an anthropology professor at Barnard College and the author of "New York City Neighborhoods" (Academic Press, 1990), a sociological study of 18th-century New York based on excavations.
"At that time," she said, "wealthy areas could be identified by the remains of heavy meat bones. There were few food remains in poorer neighborhoods, where people ate cheap vegetables and fish."
By 1984, when Dr. Rothschild was commissioned by the City of New York to study trash in various neighborhoods, the remains showed that eating patterns had reversed.
"The poorest neighborhoods had the heaviest meat remains by far," she said. Households in blocks of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn discarded as many take-out containers as those on Park Avenue, she said, though the former were typically from Kentucky Fried Chicken and the latter from Maxim's de Paris. In poor neighborhoods, she found cans that had contained regular soda; on wealthier blocks, diet-soda cans. Poor areas threw out bags that had contained high-fat and high-salt chips; the privileged discarded cans that had contained low-salt peanuts.
The change in food remains reflected the social correctness that the food revolution assigned to light, fresh eating. "The lighter the food, the higher the status." said William Woys Weaver, the author of "America Eats" (Harper & Row, 1989). And Clark Wolf, a consultant to the food industry, observed, "At the very best restaurants, the biggest growth area in both selection and price is in salads and vegetables."
But greengrocery items evade the grasp of some poor people, said Elizabeth Crockett, the nutrition coordinator for the Food Bank of Central New York in Syracuse. Because of poor grocery distribution in low-income neighborhoods, she said, fresh vegetables are few and typically much more expensive than in suburban stores. The prices can be prohibitive.
In a study at Syracuse University, Ms. Crockett compared a shopping list drawn from the Thrifty Food Plan, the Agriculture Department plan used to determine food-stamp allotments, with a shopping list drawn from the department's 1990 dietary guidelines.
"The Surgeon General's recommendations are healthier, but they cost 25 percent more in groceries than previous eating plans,' she said. "Someone living on the current food-stamp allotment couldn't afford to eat the healthy plan."
Whether by limited finances or personal preference, health concerns are a great divider between the haves and the have-nots today. Dr. Robert Schnee, a senior vice president of BAI, a market research concern in Tarrytown, N.Y., interviews as many as 600 people a year to construct consumer profiles.
"When I hear the words, 'I don't care if it's good for me or not,' I know that I am talking to somebody poor," he said. "Almost nobody above the poverty level says that anymore."
But food preferences have long conveyed more than the simple distinction between the poorest and everybody else. "People tell a very detailed story about themselves by what and how they eat," said Mark Miller, an anthropologist and the chef and owner of the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., and Red Sage, a restaurant in Washington.
The revolution substantially changed the traditional rank and file of food symbolism; one doesn't encounter Brie or fillet of beef with bone-marrow sauce at the best dinner parties today. But from the generation that rebelled against the rules of the effete cuisine that featured Brie and beef, another strict pecking order of high-status foods is emerging.
Rare ingredients have long conveyed luxury, but in the aftermath of the revolution, rarity is harder to come by. Crucial to the change in American taste, said Raymond Sokolov, the author of "Why We Eat What We Eat" (Summit Books, 1992), was the speedy transport of far-flung ingredients and the rapid dissemination of information about them. As the difficulty in obtaining exotic ingredients decreased, appreciation of their nuance became necessary.
"Anybody recognizes the taste of fresh ginger," Mr. Miller said. "The epicurean can now discern the flavor of young ginger from Hawaii, or the difference between green and black cardamom."
Mass-market availability is the nemesis of chic. After regional Cantonese and Hunan dishes replaced chop suey and chow mein in the frozen-food section of supermarkets, Southeast Asian cuisine climbed past them on the food social ladder.
"Lemon grass, dried Thai condiments and chilies are in now," Mr. Miller said. Farm-raised game birds like squab, quail, duck, "the birds that are hardest to find in the supermarket," are the darlings of chic menus, he said.
Mr. Miller noted the rise of "cross-status foods," typically with plebeian ingredient that bespeak a oneness with the common person, which is then elevated by rare commodities. He recently sampled an appetizer of two thin potato slices sandwiching a thick slice of white truffle pan-fried in butter and served with shredded veal-tongue crackling and a cabbage confit.
In addition to rarity and complexity, environmental correctness adds status to food, Mr. Weaver said. He cited the popularity of "biodynamic beef, free-range chickens, organic vegetables, long-line tuna."
Some environmental correctness may go too far. "Scuba-harvested scallops?" Mr. Batterberry asked. "Venezuelan rain-forest honey?" After noticing the items on a Manhattan menu recently, he said, "It's tough to keep ahead of the mass market, but this is getting absurd."
With rarity and exoticism teetering so close to parody, the handwork and epicurean erudition required to produce dishes like the potato-truffle sandwich confer high status to food. "Time is a precious commodity these days, so food that has received attention and time is more valuable than food that hasn't," Mr. Batterberry said. The peeled fresh carrots and pre-rinsed lettuce that command premium prices in supermarkets signal the value that time adds to food.
Noting the recent introduction of a high-priced clarified butter in upscale groceries, Mr. Batterberry said, "There is a little of Marie Antoinette at the dairy in all of this."
Ripples of populist scorn are already washing across post-revolution conceits. There may even be a market for retro-cuisine. After years of championing "spa" cooking and small nouvelle portions, the major food magazines have recently featured recipes for "he-man pork dinners" and "those gooey old-fashioned desserts." The editorial tone is consistent: "We know better, but what the heck."
Books like "The Bad for You Cookbook" (Villard, 1992), a collection of recipes rich in fat and full of passe preservatives, are selling well. "Real people are real sick of the elitist food police," Chris Maynard, one of the book's authors, said shortly before the book was published.
"Real people never really heard the food police," said Michael Stern, who along with his wife, Jane, began traveling America's back roads and sampling regional food in 1972. The food revolution put club soda and yogurt, pita bread and salad bars into Piggly Wiggly stores in the South, Mrs. Stern said. "But once you get away from the small foodie enclaves on either coast," she said, "most Americans are eating about the same as ever."
Harry Balzer, the vice president of the NPD Group, a market research concern in Chicago, agrees. Every three months for the last 15 years, he has analyzed the dining habits of 13,000 people who keep detailed diaries of what they eat.
"People talk a better game than they eat," he said. "Eighty percent of the American population never changes its eating habits. That 20 percent who can afford to experiment drive the market and are responsible for the thousands of new products that are introduced each year, 9 out of 10 of which fail. Capturing a sliver of a percent means you've started a trend. If it lasts more than a year, you've found a niche."
The revolution may have increased the amount of talk about food among Americans; it may have boosted the amount of money that the middle and upper classes spend on certain foods, and may have widened the gap between the diet of the privileged and that of the poor. But Mr. Balzer said he expected the movement's enduring icon to be the word "lite."
Lest the food conscious think their efforts in vain, he is quick to cite the other significant change. "Turkey sandwiches are competing with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and tuna fish," he said.
 
The Series So Far
 THE third article of this series, which appeared on March 11, described the rise of ethnic foods in the American diet. The second article, on March 4, described the love-hate relationship between American consumers and convenience foods. The first article, on Feb. 26, detailed the war of words between the advocates of good health and the advocates of food-for-pleasure, and the confusion of consumers caught between the two.

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
RANDOM notes while watching random clips from Meals on Reels, the first film festival devoted only to food, which is to be held Saturday at New York University School of Law in Manhattan:
STARVING ARTISTS' COOKBOOK, by Paul Lamarre and Melissa Wolf (video, 41 minutes). Surreal dishes prepared by artists, some famous, some not. William Wegman, the art world's reigning dog photographer, demonstrates how to pop vitamins. He drops vitamin C capsules into a pan of hot oil on the stove, covers the pan, turns up the burner. He shakes the pan. Rattling sounds are heard. He lifts the cover to reveal . . . popcorn. Oops! He spills it on the floor. An off-camera Weimaraner devours it.
Debby Davis, a Bronx sculptor, makes Flashlight Jell-O, using lime gelatin and a loaf pan longer than a flashlight. The effect is ectoplastic.
M. F. K.: A DOCUMENTARY ON THE LIFE of MARY FRANCES KENNEDY FISHER, by Barbara Wornum (video, 45 minutes). At the age of 83, the master food writer is still a wicked beauty. In one scene, Mrs. Fisher, in chiffon and long, sparkly earrings, speaks from her wheelchair to an audience in San Francisco. Asked whether she reads current food writing and, if so, what she thinks of it, she seems to wince.
"Even in the worst book," she says, waving a microphone, "there is one jewel, the jewel in a toad's head. I just don't have the time anymore to look for it. All these idea books. The story of bread or the story of potatoes. Some editor will say, 'Well, write about peanuts.' And some poor soul does."
HOW TASTY WAS MY LITTLE FRENCHMAN, by Nelson Pereira Dos Santos (film, 80 minutes). A wry look at eating at the very top of the food chain, cannibalism, by one of Brazil's Cinema Novo directors. When the film was first released, in 1971, judges at the Cannes Film Festival withdrew it from competition because of its nudity and cannibalism, according to the program notes. It didn't help that the main item on the menu was French.
Still hungry? There are 26 other courses in this cinematic feast that celebrates, scrutinizes and satirizes -- in art films, documentaries, commercials, music videos and cartoons -- what, how and why we eat.
The festival is sponsored by City Lore, a New York center for urban folk culture, and the Culinary Historians of New York. It runs from 11 A.M. to 11 P.M. on Saturday at the N.Y.U. law school, at 40 Washington Square South (between MacDougal and Sullivan Streets). Tickets are $10, or $6 for students and those 62 and above. For more information, call (212) 529-1955.
Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a folklorist, who is a power in both groups, served as the matchmaker as well as the author of the introductory program notes. "Meals on Reels," she said, "suggests the many ways we organize our social life and cultural values through the malleable and ephemeral medium of food."
Garlic has never been accused of being ephemeral. GARLIC IS AS GOOD AS 10 MOTHERS, by Les Blank (film, 31 minutes) is a hymn to the culinary and curative powers of the stinking rose. It visits a garlic festival in Gilroy, Calif., and Chez Panisse in Berkeley for an all-garlic meal. Screened in Mr. Blank's "aromaround," which means garlic cooking in the theater.
Audience watching could be an entertainment in itself. Food critics as well as film critics are expected, along with anthropologists, folklorists, historians and, of course, foodies.
Chefs, too, may drop by to see stars like Paul Prudhomme perform on camera, or in FLYING MORNING GLORY (ON FIRE), by Skip Blumberg (video, 4 minutes), an acrobatic cook in Thailand. Silliness itself. A Thai street cook stir-fries morning glory leaves in a wok. Flames. The cook yanks the wok from the burner and hurls the morning glory leaves into the air. Half a block away, a waiter catches the leaves on a platter. Instant replay follows.
Since the organizers ruled out obvious titles like "Babette's Feast," the festival's director, Eric John, worried at first that there would not be enough food footage for a program. As it turned out, he had leftovers.
Mr. John experienced cravings for Cajun cooking -- YUM, YUM, YUM!, by Les Blank and Maureen Gosling (film, 31 minutes). He contemplated a trip to Gill's restaurant in Brooklyn for a West Indian meal -- RICE AND PEAS, by Karen Kramer (video, 12 minutes). And he longed to visit the kosher kitchen of a grandmother who sings in Yiddish to the chicken in her pot -- CHICKEN SOUP, by Kenny Schneider (film, 14 minutes).
Only one film was an appetite suppressant: SUMMER OF THE LOUCHEUX, by Graydon McCrea (27 minutes), showing a practice in Alaska of burying fish until it decays.
The festival opens with a 1949 documentary of a slaughterhouse on the outskirts of Paris, THE BLOOD OF BEASTS, by Georges Franju (film, 22 minutes). The butchers literally whistle while they work. Steam rises from the blood on the killing floor.
In a sobering look at food production, a changing economy has forced Appalachian women into minimum-wage, part-time, dead-end jobs, in FAST FOOD WOMEN, by Anne Johnson (video, 29 minutes).
Hunger is the theme of two entries. One, SHAPING THE IMAGE, by Ilan Ziv and Freke Vuijst (video, 29 minutes), explores the role of television in the political exploitation of famine in Africa.
The other, THE FAMINE WITHIN, by Katherine Gilday (film, 90 minutes), examines the reasons behind American women's obsession with weight and dieting, and the sad consequences of bulimia and anorexia. Surveys mentioned in the film indicate that many women consider losing weight more important than moving ahead on the job or having a satisfying love life, that fear of fat may be more powerful than fear of death.
Finally, from the rusty film cans of yesteryear comes a look at how food has been advertised, promoted and taught since the 1930's. In A PRESENTATION OF FOOD COMMERCIALS AND INDUSTRIALS, by Richard Prelinger (film and video, 90 minutes), laugh along with "Breakfast Pals, starring Snap, Crackle and Pop." Have your pencils ready for "Let's Make a Meal in 20 Minutes." And, in the light of current nutritional wisdom, hiss "The Four Food Groups."

HEADLINE: Poll Says Home Rule Could Bend To Ward Off Sprawling Growth

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 17

 BODY:
New Jerseyans are willing to give up one of the state's most hallowed political traditions, control over local land-use rules, to keep sprawl from eating up too much open space, according to a recent Rutgers University opinion poll.
They are also generally satisfied with the way their state has grown in recent years, the poll suggests, and believe more growth is important for economic reasons. 
 The survey was sponsored by the Center for Analysis of Public Issues, a nonprofit research group, to test public opinion about a central objective of a new state growth plan, which is to be released this summer. The plan will urge a strengthening of state and county roles in channeling growth into compact, already developed centers.
Asked how strict they thought growth controls should be in New Jersey, 32 percent of the 800 respondents said "very strict" and 52 percent answered "somewhat strict."
 
Trading Power for Growth
 And to the question of whether state government should "be actively involved in determining how and where the state grows," 78 percent said it should, and just 19 percent disagreed. The state plan grants no special powers to Trenton, but state regulation of new roads, sewers and utilities, which are essential to any development, are likely to be governed by the plan.
Although the state's 567 municipalities have sole constitutional power to regulate land use within their borders, 61 percent of the poll's respondents said they would be willing to give up some of their town's land-use powers in return for more planned and coordinated overall growth.
The poll, conducted in February by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
 
Focusing Concerns
 "The survey shows that home rule is dead and buried in the minds of most New Jerseyans," said Neil Upmeyer, president of the analysis center, which is based in Princeton.
Some of the strong support for planned development may result from population shifts during the 1980's, Mr. Upmeyer said. The northern counties of Essex, Hudson, Bergen and Union lost 100,000 residents during the decade, while the six counties that form the waist of the state -- Somerset, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean -- gained 300,000 residents, and gave up to development 50,000 acres of once-open land, an area larger than Hudson County.
Mr. Upmeyer said he believed the population shift helped focus many respondents' worries about suburban sprawl. "What is a concern to people is that they do not get into a situation where, given the development, they wind up with the same ills that they fled," particularly traffic congestion, he said.
State residents have mixed but generally good feelings about growth in their communities so far, the poll reported. Thirty-three percent said that development had made their communities better places to live, and 29 percent said it had made them worse, while 35 percent said it had made no difference.
By a wide margin, 88 percent, respondents said that continued growth and development is very important or somewhat important to the state's economic health.

HEADLINE: Dissolve Bridgeport? No One Embraces the Idea

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT

 BODY:
Until this month, Lee A. Samowitz was little known beyond the Bridgeport district that he represents in the Connecticut General Assembly. But thanks to a recent legislative proposal that could be characterized as somewhere between radical and off the wall, the 39-year-old Democrat has been cast into the limelight.
Mr. Samowitz has been a lifelong resident of Bridgeport and lives in the middle-class Black Rock district, but if his proposal were to be enacted, he and Bridgeport's 140,000 other inhabitants would suddenly become residents of the adjacent towns of Trumbull, Fairfield and Stratford. 
 Bridgeport would simply vanish.
Mr. Samowitz said he never imagined that his suggestion to dissolve Bridgeport would draw such animosity from other public officials and such interest from the news media.
His proposal -- to parcel the economically beleaguered city out to three neighboring, well-to-do towns -- was a "cry for help," he said, never one to be taken seriously.
Mr. Samowitz said his intent was to force politicians to address a very real and rather messy issue -- the fiscal, social and political relationship between poor, decaying cities and their more affluent suburbs.
 
'Plantation Mentality'
 "Bridgeport is the victim of a plantation mentality in this state," said Mr. Samowitz, a lawyer who is serving his fourth term in the House of Representatives. "We take care of the whole region's trash, we provide the hospitals and homeless shelters, and the suburbs send us their welfare cases. We pay the highest property taxes in the state -- two to three times as much as some suburbs -- for these services, so there should be some way to equalize the tax burden regionwide."
While many Bridgeport politicians may share that view, they have little enthusiasm for Mr. Samowitz or his proposal. Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, a fellow Democrat, has disparaged it, saying, "I don't think it's a productive bill."
State Representative Joe Grabarz, whose east Bridgeport Assembly district includes some of Connecticut's poorest areas, is less charitable.
"Samowitz's proposal is an incredible waste of legislative effort," he said. "It would be a better use of the Legislature's time to try to use the state as a mechanism to take resources from the region to develop practical, regional approaches to Bridgeport's problems."
In neighboring Fairfield, First Selectwoman Jacquelyn C. Durrell is not taking the idea seriously.
"I think it was done in jest," she said. "But if you go back 350 years, originally we had Black Rock. If they're serious about it, and they'll give us Black Rock, we'll be glad to take them up on it."
 
Addressing Immediate Needs
 Mr. Samowitz, who is one of 13 assistant majority leaders in the House, says he would prefer solving Bridgeport's financial problems by levying property taxes on suburban shopping centers or altering what he considers onerous "sweetheart" contracts with the city's police officers and firefighters.
"The assembly is in no mood to impose additional layers of taxes," he said. "And these solutions would impose no new taxes on individuals."
One alternative being considered by legislators would create a regional economic-development commission that could issue bonds and perhaps collect taxes to pay for public services like schools and welfare in Bridgeport, Fairfield, Trumbull, Monroe, Easton, Milford and other nearby towns.
But Mr. Samowitz said such an approach might be too "long term" to address Bridgeport's immediate needs. And Michael Lawson, the director of intergovernmental finance for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, warned that regional government could "create another level of bureaucracy."
 
City vs. Region
"The state already has a lot more weapons in its revenue-raising arsenal than towns do," he added. "And it would be more efficient and equitable for the state to fund and operate social services."
But if these approaches fail in this year's legislative session, Mr. Samowitz said, the state should seriously consider pulling the plug on Bridgeport and returning to the geographical boundaries of the early 19th century, before Bridgeport was carved out of pieces of Stratford and Fairfield. He said that despite opposition from most corners, "I've gotten lots of favorable attention from my constituents on this."
Mr. Samowitz said that, in addition to urban affairs, his chief concern now is to create "magnet high-tech high schools." He described himself as "in the twilight of my public service," and suggested that after he saw his city "back on track," he wanted to devote himself to his law practice in Bridgeport.
Most Connecticut politicians dismiss Mr. Samowitz's proposal to abolish Bridgeport as a headline-grabbing gambit, but they grudgingly acknowledge that it does highlight the need for regional approaches to city problems.
"The suburbs feel the way to preserve their life style is to wallop all their social problems into urban areas," said Lennie Grimaldi, a top aide to Mayor Ganim. "But the poor in Bridgeport are not just Bridgeport's poor. They're the region's poor."
Bridgeport, which is a largely an island of poverty in the midst of wealthy Fairfield County, tried to declare bankruptcy last summer and on Thursday presented a new plan to close this year's $19 million budget deficit with a combination of more layoffs and service reductions.
The city's budget gap is expected to reach $40 million next year, and it would be saddled with a sharp increase in its welfare costs under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s proposal to reduce state reimbursement for local welfare payments from 90 percent to 67 percent.
"It's the Moe, Larry and Curly routine," Mr. Samowitz said. "Moe, the Federal Government, slaps Larry, the state, who slaps Curly, the cities. And then there's no one else to slap."

HEADLINE: Report Cards on Schools Show Some Improvement

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 17

 BODY:
The State Education Commissioner, John Ellis, released the second annual "report cards" on New Jersey schools today, saying that there had been improvements but too few of them to keep the state competitive.
The report cards grade each of New Jersey's 555 public school systems in three major areas: finances, teacher-to-student ratio and student performance on national tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
 Mr. Ellis said he was encouraged by some results, including the fact that the state ranked fifth in the nation in participation in the aptitude tests.
"There are encouraging signs, but we have not yet made significant progress," he said. "Our schools simply are not as good as they need to be to make New Jersey internationally competitive."
 
Criticism From Union
 The teachers' union, the New Jersey Education Association, criticized the report as a "numbers game" and a waste of time and money. "It is a very negative approach that says no matter how much our students have improved, it's just not enough," said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the 138,000-member association. "If we don't stop concentrating on the negatives, we are never going to improve on education."
The report card program is meant to stimulate public discussion of the schools, but in its short history it has produced more controversy than discussion.
Last year there were complaints that the study was riddled with errors, including miscalculated teachers' salaries. There were also complaints about the timing of the report cards, which were distributed only weeks before school district elections. This year's elections are scheduled for April 7, but the Republican-controlled Legislature has passed and sent to Gov. Jim Florio a bill that would postpone the elections until April 28.
The report card program is a joint effort of the State Education Department and the Business Roundtable Education Initiative of New Jersey, a consortium of nine major corporations that paid the $85,000 cost of compiling and distributing the critiques. The companies -- A.T.& T., Johnson & Johnson, McGraw-Hill, Prudential, American Cyanamid, CPC International, American Home Products, Merrill Lynch and Merck -- have agreed to pay for the report cards for 10 years.
P. Roy Vagelos, the chairman of Merck and the head of the consortium, said today that he was worried about the education system's ability to produce qualified workers. "New Jersey needs highly educated workers to continue to produce the high-tech products and complex services that are the strength of our state's economy," he said.
The New Jersey School Boards Association, which a year ago assailed use of the report cards, gave its reserved approval to this year's effort.
"Like all statistics, those in the report card can be interpreted in many ways," said the group's executive director, Robert E. Boose. "However, the 1992 report card is a vast improvement over last year's and is something that school districts can work with to inform their communities about the public schools."
Responding to the criticisms last year, officials revised their method of evaluating schools. For example, this year they used current-year information on spending and compared districts with similar systems in their regions. The changes made it impractical to compare this year's findings with last year's.
But the New Jersey Education Association said it still found the report virtually useless.
"This new and improved version of the New Jersey state report card does nothing to advance a more positive attitude toward our children, our schools or the men and women who have dedicated their lives to education," said the association's president, Betty Kraemer.
"All of the information included in the report card can already be obtained at the local school level and is customarily made available by district superintendents each school year," she said. "The Business Roundtable would better serve our children by contributing its time, resources, and dollars directly to our schools."

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
AMERICAN women have far more to fear from the men they know and once loved than from any stranger on the street. Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury and death to American women, causing more harm than vehicular accidents, rapes and muggings combined.
Each year an estimated six million women are beaten by the men they live with, and 30 percent of women who become homicide victims die at the hands of men with whom they have a "family" relationship. While there are some cases of domestic violence in which the wife is the abuser as well as problems of abuse among gay couples, in the overwhelming majority of cases, women are the victims at the hands of their men. 
 When such cases gain wide attention, the public tends to blame alcohol or drugs or poverty as the provocation. But are they? A chemical high may release inhibitions against physical abuse but it does not create a violent, power-hungry person who needs to control a spouse even more tightly than a master rules a slave. As for poverty, experts say well-educated, well-off professional men are hardly immune; they are simply better at escaping punishment.
Even when the victim's charges of abuse are believed, she is often blamed for staying with her abuser, for not throwing him out or picking up the children and leaving. Sometimes she is blamed for hooking up with a violent man, or even for provoking his attacks.
"Why did she stay?" is the leading question. Far fewer people ask, "Why did he do it?" Yet understanding the nature of spouse abuse and the forces that foster and perpetuate it is crucial to establishing effective social and legal mechanisms for protecting the victims, breaking these violent patterns and preventing such cases from developing in the first place.
 
Why Men Do It
 As more communities mandate therapy for men convicted of domestic violence, the extent and origins of their abusive behavior is at last undergoing professional scrutiny. For example, Cyndee Pattison, a therapist who runs groups for men who batter women, said: "Most of the time the men don't understand that what they are saying or doing is offensive. It's like a reflex, something they've done all their lives." She says men tend to minimize their actions and the consequences, saying things like "we had a little argument," even when the woman required stitches to close facial wounds.
Ms. Pattison, who works for Victim Services, a private nonprofit agency in New York City that aids battered women, said the men are acting on beliefs they learned from their parents and society. "Boys are taught to settle problems and disputes with their fists, whereas girls are taught to use their mouths," she said.
John Aponte, a founder of the Victim Services counseling program for men who batter, said batterers were at the extreme of a continuum of men who "carry the seeds of superiority given to them" at an early age. "Men may use intimidation, threats, economic control or emotional abuse," he said. "It's when these control tactics don't work and a man's authority is challenged that he feels he has to resort to physical abuse."
Experts say many abusive men are the products of a vicious cycle in which they were abused as children or witnessed their fathers abusing their mothers physically or psychologically by belittling them.
The issue, Ms. Pattison said, is power and control. "Historically, women were property and men had to keep them in line," she said. An abusive man may control his wife's access to money, not allow her to work and make her account for every penny she spends. He may try to isolate her from social contacts by disapproving of her friends, escorting her everywhere she goes and alienating her from her family. And he may constantly berate her until she is convinced she is worthless. When he is through, she has nowhere to turn for support and affirmation but to him, her abuser.
 
Why Women Stay
 Dr. Samuel C. Klagsbrun, psychiatrist and medical director of Four Winds Hospital in Katonah, N.Y., points out that most abusive relationships start out normally as loving, romantic and exciting. When abuse begins, women have trouble believing that something initially so wonderful is turning sour. There is a lot of apologizing and making up, and the woman thinks everything will go back to the way it once was. Slowly, barraged by repeated abuse, she becomes dehumanized, helpless and unable to see herself as a separate person and to distinguish right from wrong.
Dr. Klagsbrun, who treated Hedda Nussbaum, the abused companion of Joel Steinberg, the New York lawyer now in jail for fatal child abuse, said such women end up surviving in the same way that prisoners of war, hostages or concentration camp victims do: by trying to behave well, by accommodating their captors, by living from hour to hour. An abused woman may even begin to believe her batterer's rationalization that the beating is for her own good.
When a woman finally musters up the courage to leave a man who abuses her, she typically encounters insurmountable obstacles. Sarah Buel was herself once the victim of an abusive spouse. She eventually escaped with her young son, put herself through college, went to Harvard Law School on scholarship and is now an assistant district attorney for Norfolk County, Mass., and a leading advocate for battered women and court reform nationwide. She lists some problems faced by battered women who try to leave:
*Most do not have enough money to live on and cannot earn enough to support themselves or their children, particularly if the children require day care. If they have no street address, many cannot get welfare.
*Most have trouble finding a place to live. Five women are turned away for every one who seeks shelter, and 95 percent of shelters will not accept women with children.
*Leaving an abusive spouse does not necessarily bring safety; it often triggers more serious violence. More women are killed in the process of leaving than at any other time. For example, last week a Milwaukee woman was stabbed to death in the courthouse by the man from whom she was seeking court protection.
*Women who leave are afraid they will lose their children. The men, who control the money, are often able to hire good lawyers and fight successfully for custody of the children. In Massachusetts, 70 percent of men who try to gain custody succeed.
More often than not, the law fails to protect a battered woman. Abusive men, instead of being prosecuted and jailed for committing acts of criminal violence, are either not arrested or are released by disbelieving judges. They are then able to hound and terrorize their spouses until the women are forced to return. Having nowhere else to go, half of them do.


GRAPHIC: Victim Services says that a woman who answers "yes" to any of these questions may be in an abusive relationship.
 
Does your partner:
Chart: "Are You Abused?"
 * Constantly criticize you and your abilities?
 * Become overprotective or extremely jealous?
 * Threaten to hurt you, children, pets, family or friends?
 * Prevent you from seeings family or friends?

HEADLINE: MANY ISRAELIS SEE LOAN AID AS LOST

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 17

 BODY:
Although high-level negotiations were still under way in Washington, some senior Israeli officials and newspapers wrote what amounted to obituaries today for the $10 billion in United States loan guarantees that Israel has requested.
This left Israelis pondering the economic, political and diplomatic consequences, both for the country and for the Middle East peace talks, a process that some argued would not be enhanced if Israel felt it could no longer rely on its chief ally. 
 Anti-Government critics said that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had no one but himself to blame for the deadlock over the loan guarantees because he had defied the Bush Administration and made what they consider a misguided priority of Israel's right to build settlements in occupied territories.
But many Israelis also expressed bitterness over what they perceive as American unfairness.
 
'No More Free Lunches'
 Recent accusations in Washington -- vigorously denied by Israel -- that Israelis surreptitiously re-exported American weapons technology without getting United States approval has further deepened feelings among some people that they had better think harder about going it alone from now on.
"The message from the United States is becoming clearer," Yoel Marcus, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, wrote in a widely shared opinion. "The relations between the two countries will never be the same again, and there will be no more free lunches."
If anything, the general sense of siege intensifed tonight with reports that at least 10 people were killed and almost 100 wounded in a bomb explosion at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires.
Officially, Israel has not withdrawn its bid for the loan guarantees, which it first requested a year ago to help absorb what was then a torrent of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, however, the stream of immigrants is much thinner.
"Why should we make life easier for the Bush Administration?" one official said. "Let them be the ones to say no."
 
Going It Alone
 But several top officials suggested that the aid package was all but clinically dead, a theme echoed by some newspapers.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens, who met in Washington today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said in radio interviews broadcast here that Washington's insistence on no new settlements in the occupied territories amounted to "impossible terms" that "no Government in Israel could accept."
"We will have to raise the necessary funds for absorbing immigration from the Soviet Union ourselves, with the help of Jewish communities around the world," said Mr. Arens, who is close to Mr. Shamir and is No. 2 on the ruling Likud Party's list of candidates for parliamentary elections in June.
Referring to the loan guarantees, he said, "In my opinion, there's no point to another request."
Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental body responsible for immigration, told Israel radio that there was no longer any reason for the Government to press its search for aid.
 
What's Next?
 All this raised questions about what Israel would do now.
While Mr. Dinitz said the loan guarantees were essential, other officials said Israel could get by without them, even if it might cause the economy to limp a bit more heavily.
The idea of the guarantees is not that the United States would give Israel $10 billion but that it would stand behind Israel when it goes to private institutions to borrow the money. Two billion dollars' worth of such loans were included in Israel's 1992 budget, which may have to be recalculated.
With the guarantees, interest rates would be lower and loan terms more favorable; repayment might be stretched out over a much longer period, for example. Without the guarantees, some economists say, the country faces rougher sledding. Foreign investors may even view the lack of guarantees as a vote of no confidence that casts doubts on the wisdom of putting any money into Israel.
 
Defining Alternatives
 Saying that the "writing is on the wall," Dan Gillerman, head of the Israel Federation of Chambers of Commerce, called for a "crash program" to revitalize the country's lumbering economy. Senior officials of the Bank of Israel, who have been among the most insistent on the importance of the guarantees, met tonight in a long session but announced no decisions.
Still, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said that the country "can manage in the worst-case scenario" and that there were alternatives.
The newspaper Maariv reported that Mr. Modai had made a secret visit to Europe to persuade Jewish millionaires that, in the probable absence of the guarantees, now was the time to come to the aid of the country. He reportedly came away feeling confident.
The $10 billion in loan guarantees anticipated an average of 200,000 immigrants a year in the next few years. But thus far in 1992 the pace has slowed to 5,000 a month, an annual rate of 60,000. And while officials say that conditions are so unstable in the former Soviet Union that immigration could surge at any moment, they acknowledge that they may have extra breathing room.
 
The Bigger Picture
 Dollars aside, some argue that the shabby state of United States-Israeli relations is likely to make Israel more skittish in the peace process, which has bumped along inconclusively for five months.
"To the extent that Israelis perceive that they don't have the cushion of a firm, reliable American ally, it might affect their willingness to take what they perceive as security risks," said Harry Wall, who heads the Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
There were no public comments on the loan guarantees today from the opposition Labor Party. But it seemed inevitable that Labor would seize the moment to repeat charges that Mr. Shamir had sacrificed a Zionist opportunity to increase Jewish immigration on an ideological altar: his commitment to Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Labor, like the United States, has called for a freeze on such settlements.
But Mr. Shamir, some commentators said, may respond with an argument that the Americans have it in for Israel and, with or without settlements, the aid request was in trouble.
In any event, the Prime Minister told reporters that he would not alter his policies and that he expected ultimately to prevail.
"If we do not change, and continue our political path," he said, "I have no doubt that also the stance of the other side will change over time."

HEADLINE: Nassau's Mortgage Crunch;
Backlog in Record Keeping Compounds Fiscal Problems

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., March 17

 BODY:
Millions of dollars in mortgage taxes and recording fees are stashed in envelopes in the Nassau County Clerk's office, rather than on deposit in banks, because layoffs have created a three-month backlog in the recording of deeds and mortgages.
Coming at a time of fiscal crisis that has forced widespread cutbacks in Nassau County government, the unusual backlog has deprived local governments of desperately needed revenue from mortgage taxes. 
 The backlog is by far the worst in the state. In New York City and Westchester County, for example, there is a two-day delay in recording mortgages; in Suffolk County, it is three days, and in Albany there is no delay.
The Nassau County Clerk, Harold W. Connell, estimated that the boxes stuffed with thousands of unrecorded deeds and mortgages represented $5.2 million in undeposited funds.
"I'm not proud of it, but there's not very much I can do," he said today. "This is what I'm trying to tell the powers that be, I need some help to get these things moving."
The backlog, which has grown from 8 weeks in October to 13 weeks, has been aggravated by budget cuts that eliminated 54 of the County Clerk's 130 employees and by an antiquated system of recording mortgages that is labor-intensive.
"It's absurd," said the North Hempstead Supervisor, Benjamin J. Zwirn, who estimates that North Hempstead is being deprived of at least $3 million due it in mortgage taxes. Had North Hempstead been getting its share of the mortgage taxes more quickly, Mr. Zwirn said, he probably could have avoided some of the 135 layoffs the town has made.
"In part, the layoffs are attributed to the failure of revenues to come in," he said. The backlog has also worried the state's title insurance industry, whose trade association, the New York State Land Title Association, won a court order last week demanding that the county comply with state law and record mortgages in a timely fashion.
Mr. McConnell, an elected Republican who has worked in the County Clerk's office since 1947, said that while deeds and mortgages go unrecorded, mortgage lenders are left without any legal claim on properties, theoretically opening the way for another lien to take precedence and leaving the county open to lawsuits.
Mr. Zwirn complained that the slowdown was damaging North Hempstead's credit rating because the town borrowed money against expected revenue that came in short. And it has played havoc with the town's attempts to close out its 1991 fiscal record.
 
Major Source of Revenue
 Both Mr. Zwirn, a Democrat, and Donald P. DeRiggi, a Republican from Glen Cove, said they planned to send local employees to the County Clerk's office to examine the documents and amounts of revenue involved.
"I'm at that point of asking if we can come down there," Mr. DeRiggi said, "and if not process the papers and checks, at least get a sense of how much money we're talking about."
The 1 percent mortgage tax is the single biggest source of revenue for the cities and towns of Nassau County. Half the amount collected goes to the city, town or village in which the house is located, with the rest split between the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the State of New York Mortgage Association.
Also involved are recording fees that go directly to Nassau County, and transfer taxes that are earmarked for the state.
In a memorandum, the clerk's office calculated that combined fees and taxes deposited during the first two months of this year were $6.3 million, down from $11.5 million in the first two months of last year. Though home sales have dropped in Long Island with the recession, Mr. McConnell said, home refinances and equity loans have kept the volume of paperwork unchanged.
This afternoon, Victor Provenzano, supervisor of the receiving department, tackled three stacks of mortgage papers that came into the office on Dec. 9, 1991, for transactions dating to last fall. He estimated that it took workers two days to get through one box of mortgages, but said they arrived at a rate of two a day.
While Nassau County's lag in recording mortgages and land transfers has been a longtime problem, the budget cuts have brought it to a state of crisis. In a recent letter, Lawrence F. Keeley, acting director of the Transaction and Transfer Tax Bureau of the state Department of Taxation and Finance, reminded the County Clerk of his obligation to promptly remit the real property gains tax and real estate transfer tax.
"I am compelled to write now because by all appearances the situation is progressively getting worse," Mr. Keeley wrote in the Jan. 31 letter. "It is imperative that you take the steps necessary to meet your statutory duty and comply with these legal requirements."
 
Streamlining Measures
 Guy F. Paquin, executive vice president of the New York State Land Title Association, said the backlog left title insurers vulnerable legally. "When an intervening lien can take priority over a mortgage, the bank can find itself in second instead of first place with its mortgage on a property," he said.
Robert J. McDonald, chief deputy in the office of the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, said he had been looking into ways to streamline the operation of the County Clerk's office.
He said that in the future, only one employee would check each paper that came in, rather than three or four, and that the county would stop providing time-consuming services that it is not legally required to perform. For example, he said, it would no longer match deeds against tax maps to check the boundaries of properties purchased.
"We're not going to be able to serve up the whipped cream and the cherry -- just the dish of ice cream," he said.
He said he hoped the new procedures would ease the backlog within the next few weeks.

HEADLINE: Clinton in Driver's Seat;
Nomination Now Seems to Be His to Lose, But Foes Still Hope He Trips in New York

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 17

 BODY:
The double-barreled Midwestern showdown put Bill Clinton in the fast lane toward the Democratic Presidential nomination today and left Paul E. Tsongas and Edmund G. Brown Jr. to squabble over which one could better pick up the pieces if Mr. Clinton should crash.
Unless he spins out of the race, it will be hard to deny Mr. Clinton the rest of the delegates he needs, because the proportional system awards large blocks of votes to both winners and runners-up. It will be all but impossible to overtake him if he can keep putting together broad biracial coalitions like the ones that swept him to victory last week and this, in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt alike.
New York's Democratic primary on April 7 now takes on fresh meaning. After Mr. Clinton's triumphs by thumping margins in both Michigan and Illinois, it may offer the last chance for his challengers to stop him.
"It's almost a done deal," said John Marino, the New York Democratic chairman, who often expresses the viewpoint of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The nagging questions about Mr. Clinton's personal life, most recently his financial affairs and those of his wife, Hillary, probably represent a larger threat to the Arkansas Governor's progress than rival candidates do. They are trying to convince people that he is not electable, and in the meantime they are staying in the contest in the hope that some new revelation will bring him down.
 
Hoping for a Stumble
 "Every morning Bill Clinton gets out of bed," said a senior figure in the Tsongas campaign, "he faces the possibility of some media disaster unfolding that day. We would be fools to get out at this point. You stay in, you soldier on, you try to remain a constructive alternative, so if . . . "
President Bush held Patrick J. Buchanan to only a quarter of the vote in Illinois and Michigan as the Republican protest continued to fade. Mr. Buchanan's purse is almost empty, to judge from his small-scale television campaign in Michigan, and he now plans to cut back his campaign, bypassing most tests to concentrate on the June 2 California primary. He hopes he can lay the groundwork there for a conservative crusade in 1996.
That approach amounts to a concession that the President is going to be nominated again and clears the way for Mr. Bush to be more Presidential. He spent Election Day in Clinton-land, traveling to Bentonville, Ark., to present a medal to Sam Walton, the retailing wizard, and talking about the American dream instead of chasing votes.
Next Friday, the deadline Mr. Bush has set for Congressional approval of his economic package, will pass, giving him the opportunity to redefine himself as the implacable foe of a do-nothing opposition Congress, a role that won President Harry S. Truman a lot of votes in 1948.
But Mr. Bush still has plenty of problems. In Illinois, a state that has gone with the winner in nine of the last 10 Presidential elections, a Chicago Tribune poll last week showed Mr. Clinton beating him, and Mr. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, tying him. It indicates that only a third of the electorate thinks he can solve the nation's economic problems.
There were also strong rumblings of anti-incumbent feelings in Illinois, and they cannot have cheered the President much. Senator Alan J. Dixon and Representative Gus Savage were beaten, while Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the hitherto untouchable chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had to resort to heavy advertising for the first time in his career to pull out a victory.
A lot will change between now and November, of course. But in swing states like this, Mr. Bush must find a way to convince people that he is not an economic klutz. He needs most desperately to find the formula among the blue-collar voters of various Eastern European ethnic groups who for the last five or six elections have backed Republicans for President.
In Michigan, where there are large numbers of such "Reagan Democrats," he has a very long way to go; a Detroit News poll last week found that 94 percent of Democrats, an unheard-of majority, had lost faith in his economic stewardship. The task may well be beyond Mr. Bush or any President. Many of the jobs lost in the recession that has devastated the American automobile industry have probably been lost forever, which is a politically unspeakable truth.
 
Credibility for Brown
 That kind of weakness in an incumbent makes Democratic politicians keen for the hunt. In normal circumstances, they would be closing ranks around Mr. Clinton, judging him a big winner after his 10 victories in two weeks. But they are not; they are worrying about Mr. Clinton's vulnerability in the general election, a vulnerability that encourages the claims of the also-rans.
For the moment, Mr. Brown has the better of the argument, in terms of credibility if not delegates, in which he trails Mr. Tsongas. The former California Governor's advantage results from his strong second-place finish in Michigan, an economically devastated industrial state where he demonstrated strong appeal to union members and ethnic voters.
It was by far his best showing in a major contested primary.
Mr. Brown plans to take his low-cost insurgent campaign to all the remaining industrial states, and his fund-raising has improved to the point where he was able, for the first time this year, to run a television commercial in Michigan. He is building toward the California primary, but he is also talking about putting together a permanent reform movement.
 
Dismaying for Tsongas
 A third-party candidacy cannot be ruled out, in the view of some Democrats who have watched Mr. Brown turn himself almost overnight into a populist evangelist denouncing big business, free trade, high taxes and the kind of opulently financed campaigns that he once specialized in.
Mr. Tsongas finished second in Illinois. Mr. Brown made little effort here, but Mr. Tsongas apparently still failed utterly to sell himself to any significant number of blacks or blue-collar whites.
The actual figures in polls of voters leaving the booths today were dismaying for the Tsongas camp. In Illinois and Michigan, only about 1 black voter in 10 backed Mr. Tsongas. Likewise with blue-collar voters; Mr. Tsongas won only 1 in 10 in Michigan, only 2 in 10 in Illinois.
Granting the former Senator's strength among independents, well-educated technocrats and suburbanites -- all of whom are important in building an eventual majority coalition -- it is hard to see how he can win in November, if nominated, unless he can greatly broaden his appeal.
 
Eyes Toward New England
 But Connecticut, back in Mr. Tsongas's native New England, is the next primary test, followed by Vermont a week later and New York (plus Wisconsin and Kansas) a week after that. The former Massachusetts Senator has enough money to carry on that long, aides say, and try to restart his effort by reaching out to less well-off voters.
Ted van Dyk, who has signed on as an adviser to Mr. Tsongas in the last few days, conceded that a failure in New York would dry up the flow of dollars quickly. Still, said Mr. van Dyk, a longtime political strategist, "It will take Bill months to get an absolute majority of delegates, and there's at least a 50-50 chance, in my mind, that he'll be blown out of the water before he accomplishes that."
Many members of the Democratic establishment welcome Mr. Tsongas's determination to persevere, and some welcome Mr. Brown's searing attacks on Mr. Clinton.
But Jody Powell, who was President Jimmy Carter's press secretary and helped plan the strategy of his two Presidential races, said the party would be "much better off getting things settled early," so it could turn its attention to President Bush.
Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, himself a candidate for President four years ago, urged party leaders tonight to fall in behind Mr. Clinton.
 
 The Feb. 26 article also referred incorrectly to an Op-Ed page article written by Mr. Van Dyk about Mr. Tsongas. The article appeared in The Los Angeles Times, not The Washington Post.

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Warns Port Authority On Transit Links to Airports

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration is threatening to block plans to build mass-transit links to the metropolitan region's three main airports unless the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey abandons efforts to strengthen jet-noise restrictions at the airports.
For months, the F.A.A. has been trying to discourage the Port Authority from taking a tougher stand on noise at the airports than the Federal agency demands, but it has made little headway. In linking the mass-transit plan to the noise-control dispute, the aviation agency is hoping to bolster its position. 
 At stake for the authority is a $2 billion plan to build a network of airport rail links to Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports. Planners have long sought the links to relieve automobile congestion, a critical component of the airports' economic viability.
 
A Passenger Tax
 The F.A.A.'s weapon against the Port Authority is its power to reject a $3 passenger tax that would be levied on airline tickets to finance the mass-transit plan. The authority said yesterday that it could not construct the mass-transit links without the money from the passenger tax, which is expected to generate $100 million a year.
At stake for the Federal agency is its attempt to protect the airlines from having to quickly scrap or refurbish older, noisier aircraft. The F.A.A. has its own noise rules for airports, which would use a slower method of phasing out such aircraft than the Port Authority is proposing.
After the dispute had been at a standoff for months, an F.A.A. official stepped up the fight with the Port Authority last week, writing the authority to say that its proposal for noise regulations could cause Federal officials to reject the $3 passenger charge.
Michael C. Moffett, the official who wrote the letter, said the Port Authority's rules, which have yet to be proposed to its board, "might well be found" in violation of Federal regulations. Under those regulations, Federal officials said yesterday, the F.A.A. can reject an airport's application for a tax on passengers if the airport is deemed not to be following Federal noise rules. The F.A.A. would contend that by imposing stricter rules, the Port Authority was not following the Federal rules.
"We once again urge the Port Authority to move off a course that will inevitably lead to costly legal confrontation," wrote Mr. Moffett, the assistant administrator for policy, planning and international aviation at the F.A.A. in Washington.
 
'Incensed' Over Link
 David Z. Plavin, the Port Authority's director of aviation, responded in a letter on Tuesday saying that he was "incensed that you would choose to link the approval of our passenger facility charge" with the proposed noise restrictions.
Federal law allows the authority to impose the tax on passengers with the permission of the F.A.A. The Port Authority applied on Feb. 28 for permission to levy such a tax.
Under the Federal Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the airlines must gradually phase out or upgrade the noisiest aircraft in their fleets -- including the 727 and DC-9 -- over the next 10 years. As they reach each of several deadlines set for throughout the decade, the airlines must bring an increasing percentage of their fleets into compliance.
Under the Port Authority's rules, the airlines would have to cut down on the actual number of noisy planes that arrive at and depart from the region's airports. The authority's rules also seek to speed up the Federal schedule for compliance.
 
Complaints From Neighbors
 Port Authority officials said they do not believe that the Federal rules would have much of an impact on New York and New Jersey, which have a disproportionately high number of noisy flights. The officials said their tougher rules were in response to the complaints of the airports' neighbors.
But in his letter to the authority, Mr. Moffett said the Port Authority's rules would have "potentially severe economic and operational impacts throughout the national air transportation system." He estimated the rules could cost the airlines in excess of $1 billion and might increase the noise problems in other cities, thereby undermining the national effort outlined in the 1990 law.
John M. Meenan, the assistant general counsel of the Air Transport Association of America, an industry trade group, said his organization was flatly opposed to the authority's proposed rules, which he said would add to the airlines' costs when they are financially strapped.
The chairman of the Port Authority, Richard C. Leone, said the agency would continue to solicit comment on the rules and would not bring a proposal to its board of commissioners until May, at the earliest.
"We would like to work with the F.A.A., the airlines and the community groups to come up with a proposal that everyone can live with," Mr. Leone said. "We don't want to have to resort to a political or legal battle. I don't know if that's possible."
 
Other Improvements
 F.A.A. officials said they had until the summer to review the Port Authority's application for the $3 tax, which would be collected by the airlines on the tickets of departing passengers and then forwarded to the authority. In addition to mass transit, the Port Authority said it would use revenue from the tax to pay for other access improvements at the airports.
Plans for the mass-transit links to the three airports are in their infancy, and no routes, timetables or costs have been made final. In one proposal, which has been endorsed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, a $1.6 billion light-rail line would connect Kennedy and La Guardia Airports with the subway and the Long Island Rail Road in Queens. A similar rail line would connect Newark Airport with mass transit in Newark and would cost an estimated $400 million to $500 million.
Carl E. Van Horn, policy director for Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, said the Governor supports the Port Authority on both the noise and mass-transit issues.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut;
Clinton Taking the Campaign to Tsongas Turf: Connecticut Is Looming as Vital Battleground

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 18

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, fresh from decisive victories Tuesday in Illinois and Michigan, laid the groundwork today for his campaign in Connecticut, the backyard of Paul E. Tsongas, which is reeling from the effects of the depressed economy.
Mr. Tsongas, badly battered by a second-place finish in Illinois and a third-place effort in Michigan, raised the stakes for himself today. The former Massachusetts Senator proclaimed at a news conference in Hartford that Connecticut was now a "must win" state for him. 
 Just weeks ago, Mr. Tsongas was heavily favored in the Democratic contest here, and such a statement would have seemed far-fetched. But the combination punch in the two Rust Belt states clearly enlivened the March 24 Connecticut primary.
While Mr. Clinton and most of his staff spent the day in Little Rock for some rest and reassessment, they pointedly noted that Mr. Tsongas was already back in New England -- with all the advantages of operating on home turf.
 
Rally Hastily Arranged
 Behind the scenes, however, Mr. Clinton's staff began a television advertising campaign this afternoon, going head to head with Mr. Tsongas's advertisements in the Hartford television market. And a rally was hastily organized for Thursday night in downtown Hartford, where Mr. Clinton plans to appear.
Edmund G. Brown Jr., who fought his way to a second-place finish behind Mr. Clinton in Michigan on Tuesday, arrived in Connecticut tonight for at least three scheduled campaign stops over the next six days. So far, there has been little if any speculation that the former California Governor will finish higher than third. But he tapped the bitterness of anxious blue-collar workers in Michigan, and Mr. Tsongas cannot afford to count him out in Connecticut, particularly in areas hit hard by unemployment.
Across this diverse, depressed state of blue-collar factory towns, white-collar office parks, distressed cities and slumping military contractors, the signals were subtle but unmistakable: Mr. Tsongas was in the spotlight and looking vulnerable.
Speaking of Mr. Tsongas, Jonathan Pelto, a Democratic strategist, said. "Two weeks ago, I would have given him 60 percent to 70 percent of the vote." Mr. Pelto, who managed Gary Hart's Connecticut campaigns in 1984 and 1987, said the "conventional wisdom" still calls for a Tsongas victory but by a far narrower margin.
Such is the delicate position Mr. Tsongas now finds himself just weeks before the far more expensive and delegate-heavy New York primary on April 7. On the other hand, if Mr. Clinton declares a full assault in Connecticut and loses, Mr. Tsongas would get an even bigger lift by appearing to fight off a determined challenge.
Campaign coordinators for Mr. Clinton said on Tuesday, before their candidate's primary victories in Michigan in Illinois were certain, that he would make perhaps one appearance in Connecticutbefore the primary there. And a Clinton news release called Mr. Tsongas "heavily favored" as a regional candidate.
But today a Clinton campaign spokesman, Craig Sutherland, said Mr. Clinton's Connecticut effort would now include at least three appearances. Television advertising in the Hartford market was also bought today, with the possibility of more to come, although Mr. Sutherland emphasized that the Connecticut campaign budget was still "very, very small."
"Next week we hope to move into our neighbor's yard," Mr. Sutherland said.
Mr. Tsongas has also stumbled -- to Mr. Clinton's benefit, and perhaps Mr. Brown's as well -- over one of the crucial emotional issues in the state: the Seawolf submarine. Navy contracts for the submarines, built in Groton by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics, would be scrapped under President Bush's military budget and under many of the plans put forward by Democrats in Congress. The result would be thousands of layoffs over the next decade in the southeastern corner of the state.
Mr. Clinton has said he thinks it is possible to maintain submarine-building capacity in Connecticut -- a stance that Mr. Tsongas attacked last weekend as "pandering" and misleading to a state that must face the facts that the Seawolf is doomed under almost any post-cold war scenario. The result is what a Tsongas campaign spokesman called the "mistaken perception" that Mr. Tsongas is against even trying to save the Seawolf.
"Seawolf is going to be the litmus test," said Ernest Kulka, an electronics technician from Torrington who came to see Mr. Tsongas at a rally in Hartford on Tuesday night at Trinity College. But Mr. Kulka said he was not sure whom that would help or hurt. "When Clinton gets down there, you're going to see a lot of waffling," he predicted.
Mr. Clinton has also allied a formidable array of powerful Democratic endorsements here, including those of the former state party chairman, John F. Droney Jr., and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who appeared at Mr. Clinton's side in Chicago on Tuesday. Speculation began flying immediately that Mr. Lieberman was being groomed as a possible running mate.
 
A Dull G.O.P. Contest
 Mr. Tsongas said today it sound more like the rumor of the week. "It's a good strategy -- there were stories about Mayor Daley last week," he said, referring to Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago.
So far, the Republican primary seems to be conforming to the expectations of dullness. Neither President Bush nor Vice President Dan Quayle has any campaign appearances planned, and the Republican challengers on the ballot, the conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, have little or no formal organizations to get supporters out to the polls.
The main issue in that race, politicians in both parties say, is how many people vote against Mr. Bush out of protest, and where they are concentrated, with the Seawolf country of southeastern Connecticut again considered ripe for a statement of outrage. Given Mr. Bush's roots here -- his father, Prescott Bush, was a United States Senator from Connecticut -- the standard of failure is pretty low by some measures.
The state Democratic party chairman, Edward L. Marcus, said he thought a 15 percent protest would be significant in Connecticut, where Democrats outnumber Republicans, but where Republicans and independents have combined their votes to give the Republican candidate victory in the state in every Presidential election since Richard M. Nixon won in 1972.

HEADLINE: U.N. Sending Envoy to Aid Burmese Refugees

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 18

 BODY:
The United Nations Secretary General plans to send an envoy to Southeast Asia early next month in an effort to stop the expulsion of the Muslim minority from Myanmar, formerly Burma, to neighboring Bangladesh, diplomats and United Nations officials said today.
The envoy, Under Secretary General Jan Eliasson of Sweden, the senior United Nations official in charge of humanitarian aid, is expected to travel first to Bangladesh to inspect the growing number of Burmese refugees arriving there. 
 If Myanmar's military rulers will receive him, he will then seek to persuade them to stop persecuting the Muslim Rohingyas, as they are called, living in Arakan province. He will also try to get the junta to take back the more than 150,000 who have fled to Bangladesh since October, apparently to escape a campaign of torture, killing and forced evictions by the Burmese Army.
The refugees, who are living in makeshift encampments along the border, are continuing to arrive at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day, Bangladeshi diplomats say. Arakan province is thought to have a population of about 2.2 million, of whom some 1.4 million are Muslims.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has appealed for $27.5 million in emergency aid for the Burmese refugees.
Myanmar's military rulers have shown themselves impervious to outside criticism in recent months. Both the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Commission in Geneva have adopted resolutions criticizing what they see as the Government's flagrant abuse of human rights.
And the five members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brunei -- have also sought unsuccessfully to bring about a change of policy by quiet persuasion.
Western diplomats now say they hope China, which is one of the few countries with ties to Myanmar's increasingly isolated leadership, may also be able to use its influence to obtain a change of policy.
Myanmar's junta maintains that the Rohingyas are not ethnic Burmese and asserts that those fleeing to Bangladesh are really illegal immigrants without official identity papers. But many of those crossing the border say the army forcibly confiscated their papers before expelling them.
"The army seems to be following a policy of Burmization in Arakan by ridding the province of its Muslims," Bangladesh's United Nations representative, Humayan Kabir, said. Most of Myanmar's people are Buddhist.
In 1978, Burma forced about 200,000 Rohingyas out of Arakan into Bangladesh but was eventually persuaded to take most back.
In a new display of Congressional anger with Myanmar's military rulers, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week attached conditions to the confirmation of Parker W. Borg, a Foreign Service officer, as next United States Ambassador to Myanmar.
The committee recommended that the full Senate delay formal approval of Mr. Borg's appointment until the Bush Administration states publicly that the military junta does not represent the Burmese people, withdraws the American military attache from Myanmar and supports an arms embargo against the country as well a suspension of all United Nations aid.
At the same time as it seeks to dislodge the Rohingyas from Arakan in the west of the country, the Burmese Army is stepping up its offensive against rebels from the Karen tribe in eastern Myanmar who are fighting for independence from bases just inside Thailand, Asian diplomats say.
Myanmar's international reputation has been in sharp decline since 1990 when the military junta, which had taken power in 1988, organized elections and then refused to hand over the Government to Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi after her opposition party won a sweeping victory. Mrs. Aung Sang Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, is under house arrest in the capital, Yangon, formerly Rangoon.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Media;
CLINTON STRATEGY TO DEFUSE RUMORS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 18

 BODY:
The Clinton campaign, concerned that questions about the candidate's character could be the last remaining hurdle to his nomination, is taking a number of steps to try to defuse the issue before the April 7 New York primary.
Throughout the campaign, the Arkansas Governor's aides have assembled notebooks full of background information on competitors like Paul E. Tsongas, Bob Kerrey, Edmund G. Brown Jr. and President Bush. Now, they are trying to face down their most critical enemy: rumors about Bill Clinton himself. 
 As part of that strategy, some aides have recently shown reporters a statement from a former Miss America denying that she had an affair with the Governor. The denial came from the Clinton campaign even before nude photographs of the woman, Elizabeth Ward, were to be published in the May issue of Playboy magazine. Speculation about the content of the Playboy layout has been part of the undercurrents within the Clinton campaign in recent weeks.
A spokeswoman for Playboy would not confirm the contents of the upcoming issue, which will be on newsstands April 7 -- the same day as the New York primary -- but she said, "I can confirm to you it is not harmful to Clinton."
Top Clinton aides have already had an advance look at the Playboy magazine feature on Ms. Ward.
 
Sex Allegations
 Ms. Ward was one of five women alleged to have had sexual relations with Mr. Clinton in a civil suit filed in September 1990 against Mr. Clinton by a disgruntled former employee of the state government. The man who filed the suit has since withdrawn it, saying he had no evidence, and four of the women have denied any relationship. The fifth, Gennifer Flowers, sold her story of an affair to a supermarket tabloid this year.
Governor Clinton has denied having had an affair with any of the women.
As devised by campaign aides, the move to deal with any rumors about the Playboy feature is part of a broader effort to dominate the news with positive campaign developments and to knock down persistent speculation that some future scandal could derail Mr. Clinton's drive for the nomination.
"New York media is a monster," said James Carville, a Clinton strategist. "You have to feed it every day, and you have to feed them cheeseburgers and french fries, not just lettuce."
Another element of the news media strategy involves having Mr. Clinton directly confront the question of whether there is some damaging information yet to come.
On television today, Mr. Clinton said there would be "no debilitating disclosure" that would be revealed as true that would "make me unfit to be President."
In an interview, Mr. Clinton elaborated on his theme that his substantial primary election successes have proved that the press and his political rivals are more interested in questions about his past than voters are.
 
Call for 'Higher Standard'
 "Of all the states in the country, New York ought not to want another campaign where the personal destruction of the candidate is the centerpiece of the campaign," Mr. Clinton said in an interview. "With all the stories of the kids' being shot and black kids painted white and white kids assaulted in retaliation, all the real heartbreak. The real human suffering and loss ought to call the people of New York to a higher standard. And I think it will."
Even before securing victories in Illinois and Michigan this week, Clinton strategists were preparing for what they expect to be a barrage of negative attention by setting plans in motion to consistently present positive images based on his appeal for economic revival and racial unity.
By stopping rumors before they begin and by anticipating the needs of an event-hungry New York press corps, the Clinton campaign has already sketched out a schedule that will take Mr. Clinton around the state stressing that New York voters have more pressing issues to worry about than rumors about Mr. Clinton.
In recent days, Mr. Clinton has also started sending another message, often from the pulpits of churches. No person, he has said, should be asked to meet a standard of perfection.
"When your pastor said I was not perfect, I started to say 'Amen' and stand up and lead a shout," Mr. Clinton said after being introduced warmly at a Baptist church here on Sunday. "This is a place not for saints, but a place for sinners."
Mr. Clinton said in the interview that he expected voters in New York to be drawn to a candidate who "would lay it all on the line and make a real commitment.
"I think that rough and tumble politics is nothing new to New York," he said. "So if I take a few more blows there, it won't surprise them. They've been watching it all unfold anyway."
A core group of Clinton advisers, enhanced by a New York lawyer, Susan Thomases, and Mr. Clinton's state campaign manager, Harold Ickes, are convinced their strategy will allow the Arkansas Governor to pick his way around potential minefields.
"This is not a bunch of hayseeds coming to New York," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker.
"Bill Clinton is the story," Mr. Greenberg said. "The issue is, do we become Bill Clinton the story as the tabloids try to write it, or do we become Bill Clinton the story about trying to change the nation?"

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Voters;
Primaries Drawing Fewer Blacks as Overall Turnout Declines

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 18

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas picked up about three-quarters of the black vote in Tuesday's Democratic primary in Illinois, but the black turnout in this state was much lower than it was four years ago.
That has been the case in much of the country this year, and Democrats will be hurt in November if blacks continue to stay away from the polls. 
 In part, the falloff in black voting in this year's primaries reflects an overall trend of decreased voter participation, which has occurred in nearly two-thirds of the party primaries in 13 states. But the decline among blacks also clearly happened because no black candidate was in contention the way the Rev. Jesse Jackson was in 1988, said Sonia R. Jarvis, executive director of the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation in Washington.
She added that it was perhaps more important that none of the Democrats generated enthusiasm in black neighborhoods or conducted aggressive drives to get out the vote. While Mr. Clinton's success in winning endorsements from black politicians kept his percentage of the black vote high, it did not mean that large numbers of blacks were turning out for him, she said.
 
November May Be Different
 A survey of people as they left the polling places on Tuesday found that 19 percent who voted in the Illinois Democratic primary were black, while four years ago 28 percent were. In Georgia two weeks ago, a similar survey showed a 29 percent of the voters in the Democratic primary were black, down from 35 percent in 1988. In Tennessee last week, 13 percent were black, down from 27 percent four years ago.
The polls were conducted by Voter Research and Surveys, which was created 1990 by ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News, and those for Illinois and Michigan had a margin of error of plus or minus three to four percentage points.
While most states are seeing fewer black voters and fewer voters over all in the primaries than they did in 1988, Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, said that if history was a guide, the low turnout in the primaries this year said little about the size and nature of the turnout in November. For example, the high black turnout in the 1988 primaries was not replicated in the general election, and that worked to the serious disadvantage of the Democratic candidate, Michael S. Dukakis.
This year the number of primary voters for both parties has been lower than it was in 1988 in 17 of 26 party primaries, and in many cases the difference has been significant. In Florida, for example, turnout last week was down by 60,000 from 1988, even though the number of people of voting age has increased by about one million. In Texas, the turnout was down nearly one-fifth to 2.3 million from 2.8 million, and in Louisiana, it fell by a third, to 515,000 from 770,000.
Looked at another way, 19 percent of Floridians of voting age voted in this year's primaries, while 23 percent did so in 1988; in Texas, the participation was down to 18 percent from 23 percent.
The main exception to the rule was New Hampshire, where the turnout was more than one-fifth higher than it was in 1988. In Illinois, despite the drop in the number of blacks voting, the overall turnout was about the same as it was four years ago.
 
Boost From the Undercard
 Turnout varies enormously from state to state, and the reasons are often difficult to come by. This week, for instance, 15 percent of the people in Michigan of voting age went to the polls, while 27 percent did so in Illinois. In 1988, Michigan did not hold a Presidential primary.
The record high voter participation in the New Hampshire primary apparently was mainly a result of the flagging economy there and the desire of voters to register their protest about it. Furthermore, because the Iowa caucuses were not seriously contested this year, the candidates spent more time campaigning in New Hampshire than was the case in 1988.
In Illinois, the relatively solid turnout was probably the result of several tight Congressional races, including the three-way fight for the Democratic Senate nomination. Senator Alan J. Dixon, running for his third term, was defeated by Carol Moseley Braun, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.
Primary turnouts have fallen consistently since 1972, said Mr. Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate who has conducted extensive research on voting participation. The main reason, Mr. Gans said, is that no cutting issue has distinguished the candidates in the primaries from one another.
"Take this year," said Mr. Gans. "The differences between the Democrats is minuscule compared with, say, the differences over the war in Vietnam in 1972."
As a general principle, he said, "you get high turnouts when people have something to decide."
For example, Louisiana had a record turnout for a Senate race in 1990 when Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat, was challenged by the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. And North Carolina also set a record that year when Senator Jesse Helms, the extremely conservative Republican, ran against Harvey Gantt, the former Democratic Mayor of Charlotte, who is black.
In the same vein, Mr. Gans said, a high rate of voter participation can be expected in the Presidential race in November if the economy stays sour. But if the economy improves noticeably, he said, more people are likely to stay home out of a lack of interest.
In recent years nationwide, about 20 percent of eligible voters have turned out for Presidential primaries, as against about 50 percent in general elections.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congress;
The Rumble of Discontent Rattles Illinois Incumbents

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The Illinois primary blew a chill breeze over Congressional incumbents today as a Senator and two Representatives were beaten by challengers and two veteran House members survived with some difficulty.
There was an expected pattern of anti-incumbent voting in the Chicago area, fanned by last week's public disclosures that 355 current and former House members had written thousands of overdrafts on the House bank. In that clouded political air, three Democrats -- Senator Alan J. Dixon and Representatives Charles A. Hayes and Gus Savage -- were defeated. And Representatives Dan Rostenkowski, a Democrat, and Philip M. Crane, a Republican, won with less than three-fifths of the vote. 
 The House bank scandal had an obvious effect on only one race, the defeat of Mr. Hayes. After it was disclosed that Mr. Hayes had written 716 overdrafts in 39 months, the five-term incumbent was defeated by Alderman Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther leader, in his Congressional district on Chicago's South Side.
Being one of the House's leading writers of overdrafts appeared to tip the balance against Mr. Hayes in a race that was already close. Mr. Rush got 42 percent of the vote to 39 percent for Mr. Hayes. For Mr. Rush, the victory marked a new level of acceptance in his journey from militant opponent of the white power structure in the 1960's to South Side Alderman in 1983 to deputy chairman of the state Democratic Party two years ago.
 
Danger of Not Looking Ahead
 Don Foley, executive director of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said he thought the bank issue could "spill over" into other races even if it bore no direct connection to a vulnerable incumbent. He said the scandal, which has stoked the anger of a recession-weary public, could strengthen a "sense of frustration that nothing is being done in Washington" about the nation's problems while lawmakers worry about themselves.
Mr. Foley said the Illinois results also underscored the fact that if incumbents dwelt on their records rather than conveyed some vision of what they planned to do, they took a grave risk. In the Senate race, he said, the incumbent was so preoccupied defending himself against the $3 million television campaign waged by Albert Hofeld, a lawyer, that "I'm not sure Dixon ever got to talk about the future."
In the end, both were defeated by Carol Moseley Braun, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds who entered the race against Mr. Dixon after he voted to confirm Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court last fall. If she wins in November against Richard S. Williamson, a conservative former assistant secretary of state who was recruited to run in the Republican primary, she would be the first black woman to serve in the Senate.
Largely overlooked, and treated civilly by the other two candidates, Ms. Braun plainly profited from their attacks on one another. With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, she had 538,496 votes, or 38 percent. Mr. Dixon had 495,577, or 35 percent, and Mr. Hofeld had 389,624, or 27 percent.
But the bulk of Washington's attention was fixed on the state's House races, although analysis was complicated by redistricting. Illinois lost 2 of its 22 seats. The new lines were drawn to discomfit Democrats, forcing one Democratic retirement and two races between Democratic incumbents.
 
Turmoil of Redistricting
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said the Illinois returns showed once again that "incumbents have to fight to gain re-election." He said that even before Tuesday's results, "Anyone who didn't understand that was not in the real world."
But in fact only one incumbent had been denied renomination before Tuesday. She was Representative Beverly B. Byron, a seven-term Maryland Democrat who traveled widely for the House Armed Services Committee and apparently lost touch with her district, taking too lightly a challenge from Thomas A. Hattery, a State Representaive who upset her March 3.
The other incumbent who was upset, Mr. Savage, suffered a resounding defeat that plainly exceeded any possible impact of the bank scandal. Redistricting, however, was critical. Melvin J. Reynolds, a businessman who had challenged Mr. Savage twice before, won the race 59,243 votes to 34,717, piling up almost all of his winning margin in the enlarged suburban section of the district.
Mr. Reynolds said his victory over the six-term Congressman was a message to all politicians not to run on racial themes. He had attacked Mr. Savage as being hostile to whites and particularly Jews. Mr. Savage explained his defeat by saying, "We have lost to the white racist press and to the racist reactionary Jewish misleaders." Both candidates are black.
 
Not Business as Usual
 Mr. Rostenkowski, with 57 percent, and Mr. Crane, with 55 percent, had closer challenges than most political analysts had expected, and Chicago experts attributed those results to the revised districts that brought each man before many new voters, to antagonism from voters who disliked their anti-abortion stands and to distaste over the bank scandal. But the veteran lawmakers, respectively the chairman and third-ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, prevailed over their much lesser-known challengers.
The anger against an image of business as usual in Washington prevailed even in the two contests pitting Democratic incumbents.
In a district spreading from Chicago into its southwestern suburbs, Representative William O. Lipinski prevailed with 58 percent over Representative Marty Russo after attacking him as a deal maker on the Ways and Means committee. But the fact that much of Mr. Lipinski's old district was in the new one helped, too.
In Southeastern Illinois, a heavily outspent Representative Glenn Poshard got 62 percent of the vote against Representative Terry L. Bruce after taking issue with his refusal to accept contributions from political action committees.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
Brown and Tsongas Search For Victory in Connecticut

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

 BODY:
More in hope than in expectation, Paul E. Tsongas and Edmund G. Brown Jr. began a dogged pursuit of votes in Connecticut yesterday, following a pair of decisive defeats at the hands of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in the Midwest on Tuesday.
Both hope they can use the Connecticut primary next Tuesday as a political trampoline to gain some energy for the big event, the New York primary two weeks later, which may be their last chance to halt Mr. Clinton's powerful progress toward the Democratic nomination. Confident, almost cocky, the Clinton entourage holed up in Little Rock, Ark., for rest and reassessment, and the front-runner will not arrive in Connecticut until late this afternoon.. 
 But defeating Mr. Clinton in New York, another industrial state with many similarities to Michigan and Illinois, will not be easy. And Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic chairman, said that if Mr. Clinton could win in New York, with its 244 convention delegates, second only to California's, it would be time to think about "rallying around our eventual nominee."
 
Buchanan Staying In
 In a sense, that process began yesterday in the Republican Party. Patrick J. Buchanan, President Bush's conservative challenger, said that "only celestial intervention" could block Mr. Bush's renomination. He pledged to tone down his criticism, drop negative television commercials and support the President in the fall.
But the pugnacious former White House speech writer, who has lost 16 straight primaries to Mr. Bush, did not quite drop out. He said he would "show the flag" on a one-day trip to Connecticut and then concentrate on North Carolina, which votes May 5, and California, which votes June 2. By then -- in fact, by April 28, the date of the Pennsylvania primary -- Mr. Bush is expected to have more than the 1,105 delegates needed for nomination.
Even after the California primary, Mr. Buchanan said at a news conference outside Washington, he intends to press his views at the Republican National Convention, especially in the platform committee. The Bush forces would not "have the guts to kick me out of that convention," he said.
The conversion of the Buchanan campaign into a symbolic quest was an obvious plus for the President, as were the improving economic statistics released on Tuesday. Mr. Bush is also the captain of his own fate, able to shape the fall campaign, to a greater degree than Mr. Clinton, who even if nominated faces the constant danger of fresh, reputation-damaging accusations about his private life.
 
Endangered Incumbents
 As the baton of populist protest passed from Mr. Buchanan to Mr. Brown, who hoisted himself into second place in Michigan on Tuesday by blaming all the country's ills on the rich, Illinois voters threw a scare into Congressional incumbents by ousting a Senator and two Representatives. Two other usually super-safe Representatives, Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who is a Democrat, and Philip M. Crane, a prominent Republican conservative from the Chicago suburbs, saw their margins shaved to less than 60 percent.
"We could see historic numbers of members pitched onto the streets this fall," said Robert Beckel, who managed Walter F. Mondale's Presidential campaign in 1984. "And the incumbent-in-chief, George Bush, the stereotypical political professional and Washington insider, has reasons to worry, too."
The House bank fiasco appeared to have doomed Representative Charles A. Hayes, who was listed as having written 716 overdrafts; he lost to Alderman Bobby Rush of Chicago, a former Black Panther. But by contributing to a "throw-the-bums-out" mood, the scandal also hurt Senator Alan J. Dixon, who went down to defeat at the hands of Carol Moseley Braun after 29 consecutive elective victories.
 
Clarence Thomas Factor
 Polls of voters leaving the booths in Illinois suggested that Ms. Braun, who is black, had been greatly helped by support among women and members of minorities who resented the Senate's confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court despite Prof. Anita F. Hill's accusation of sexual harrassment. If such resentment proves lasting and pervasive, it could be bad news for the President, Justice Thomas's champion, especially if combined with an anti-abortion decision this summer when the Supreme Court is expected to rule on a challenge to Roe v. Wade.
Ms. Braun, who would be the first black Democrat and the first black woman to sit in the Senate if elected in November, carried all the Chicago suburbs, where opposition to Justice Thomas appeared to run especially high.
Almost half the Illinois Democratic women interviewed in an exit poll by Voter Research and Surveys, the four-network consortium, said they objected to the confirmation, but only a third of the women said they liked Mr. Dixon, who voted to confirm Justice Thomas.
Ms. Braun and Mr. Dixon, known locally as "Al the Pal" because of his glad-handing ways, split the vote of women who backed confirmation or were not sure, but she beat him better than 2 to 1 among those who opposed confirmation.
The other Representative to lose his seat was Gus Savage, a militant black politician whose habitual diatribes against Jews, whites and the press cost him dearly in new suburban wards added to his previously urban district. Mel Reynolds, a former Rhodes scholar, beat him 2 to 1.
 
Distrust and Disgust
 Although Mr. Bush will no doubt use the bank scandal as a campaign weapon this fall, blaming it on the Democratic leadership in Congress, the issue cuts both ways. He, too, is an incumbent, and therefore at risk with all the others in a climate of distrust and disgust. In addition, several Republican members of Congress, and three former ones who now serve in Mr. Bush's Cabinet, are on the House ethics committee's list of members whose accounts had been overdrawn.
The largest number of House members to be defeated since World War II was 83 in 1948, when President Harry S. Truman successfully campaigned against a "do-nothing, good-for-nothing" Congress. In recent years, the number has remained below 40 and often below 20. Mr. Beckel predicted it would "easily exceed 100 this year."
Tuesday's results contained some suggestions that the Reagan Democrats -- the white, blue-collar voters, mostly Roman Catholics with roots in Southern and Eastern Europe -- were ready to abandon their two-decade flirtation with Republican Presidential candidates and come home.
Exit polls in both Illinois and Michigan showed about 4 of 10 Democrats or independents who voted for Mr. Bush in 1988 voting for Mr. Clinton this time. In Macomb County, north of Detroit, where racial fears had helped convert tens of thousands of conservative, working-class Democrats into Republicans, the Demcratic primary drew almost 10,000 more participants than the Republican primary did.
Burton Yale Pines, a conservative analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said that Mr. Buchanan had "sent up a flame" and could have shown Mr. Bush how to hold the Reagan Democrats, but that the White House had not responded.
"Republican conservatives may not have any place to go other than Bush," Mr. Pines said, "although they can always refuse to vote. But Democratic conservatives, the ones who gave Reagan his landslides, can simply return to their roots. I think that's what will happen, and it might cost George Bush a close election."
With 2,145 delegates needed for nomination, a New York Times tally shows Mr. Clinton with 991, or 46 percent, Mr. Tsongas with 423, Mr. Brown with 143 and 563 undetermined. Among Republicans, Mr. Bush has 729 of the 1,105 he needs, or 66 percent, Mr. Buchanan has 46 and 6 are undetermined.
 
Weak Third
 Mr. Tsongas was grievously wounded by the returns on Tuesday night, because he had called Illinois and Michigan the neutral turf where he could respond to Mr. Clinton's show of strength in his home region on Super Tuesday. The former Massachusetts Senator was not able even to finish second in both states, falling to a weak third in Michigan behind the resurgent Mr. Brown.
The problem, once again, was Mr. Tsongas's inability to attract blue-collar workers and blacks. That could hurt him badly in Connecticut, which his managers described as a state he must win, along with New York. Although he has an advantage through his New England connections, cities like New Britain, New Haven and Hartford have large Italian-American and Irish-American working-class populations. Many of the suburbanites to whom he might otherwise appeal vote Republican in the primaries.
Mr. Clinton is counting on his longstanding ties to the state, where he attended Yale Law School and met his wife, Hillary. He has the backing of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, who introduced him at a victory rally in Chicago. And unlike Mr. Tsongas, he has pledged to maintain production of the Seawolf submarine, which the Bush Administration wants to phase out. The $2-billion vessels are built by the Electric Boat division of the General Dynamics Corporation at Groton, Conn.
If Mr. Tsongas can convert his status as the favorite in Connecticut into a big victory, he will then try to capitalize in New York on the antipathy between Mr. Clinton and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
But that is a thin reed on which to build a Tsongas comeback, and few professionals gave him much chance of surviving New York. Mr. Brown, who campaigned in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania before speaking in New Britain last night, seems to have a somewhat better chance, because he has been doing better with core Democrats and because he needs less money to continue.
That seemed to be the Clinton campaign's judgment, too. George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputy campaign manager, called the former California Governor "a political terrorist" and promised that if he mounted further attacks on Mr. Clinton's character the Arkansas Governor would take the offensive against him, even though he preferred to focus on Mr. Bush.
 
Brown on the Attack
 Unrepentant, Mr. Brown described Mr. Clinton as a member of the political establishment that raised its own pay and bounced its checks. He seemed determined to fulfill the prophecy of Brian Lunde, the former political director of the Democratic National Committee, who said Tuesday night, "This process now becomes a referendum on the front-runner."
But Mr. Brown conceded later that he was very much a long shot for the nomination and said that his real goal was to put together a movement similar to the Rainbow Coalition formed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson as part of his 1988 Presidential bid.
Despite all his combative tactics, despite his anti-boss language, despite his adoption of a light-blue sateen United Auto Workers jacket as a campaign uniform, Mr. Brown could not gain the bulk of the blue-collar or union vote in Michigan. That went to Mr. Clinton, the exit polls showed, but Mr. Brown got the second-largest slice, far ahead of Mr. Tsongas, and it helped to establish him in the spoiler's role for the rest of the campaign.
In Ypsilanti Township, home of the big General Motors plant whose coming closure Mr. Brown seized upon as an example of an economy gone haywire, he took 35 percent of the vote, compared to Mr. Clinton's 46. In Macomb County, the Reagan Democrat stronghold, the figures were 30 and 46.

HEADLINE: Israel Considers Effect of Rebuff by Bush on U.S. Loan Guarantees

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 18

 BODY:
Israeli economic planners today began the tough and perhaps painful process of how to rearrange Government spending priorities now that the country's request for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees seems to be dead.
Leading the call for a thorough reassessment was the governor of Israel's central bank, who said that "difficult decisions" lay ahead and that the national budget had to be studied. 
 But the governor, Jacob Frenkel, said that Israel would still look for billions of dollars in overseas loans even though its credit standing is likely to be lowered because it will not be able to count on the American guarantees.
 
Silent on Specifics
 Government officials were almost stonily silent today about what specifically they intended to do next. Although Mr. Frenkel and private economists said that Israelis would have to tighten their belts, probably with a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, the exact nature of the Government's next moves were unclear.
Among the complications it faces is that Israel is at the start of a campaign for June parliamentary elections, not normally a period graced with fiscal rectitude and budget austerity.
Nevertheless, there were no signs that senior officials were in a panic a day after President Bush said he would oppose a Congressional compromise that would have given Israel the loan guarantees but also, to the President's displeasure, would have allowed the Israelis to continue building settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
While technically the aid package remains alive, it is viewed here as no longer an issue, at least not while Mr. Bush is President and Yitzhak Shamir is Israel's Prime Minister. Both men are running for re-election this year.
 
No Immediate Pressure
 Real financial pressure will not be felt for at least several months, several economists said, although they added that the country did not have the luxury of waiting indefinitely to decide what measures to take.
"The issue is not pressing in terms of months," said Dan Halperin, a former Finance Ministry official who works with an economic consulting concern in Tel Aviv. "But next year's budget has to be shaped differently. Israel will have to take a second look at its priorities."
The American guarantees -- which originally were supposed to be spaced over five years at the rate of $2 billion a year -- had been intended to make it easier for Israel to obtain favorable conditions on money it intends to borrow from private banks and other financial institutions. Ever since it first asked for help a year ago, Israel has characterized it as humanitarian assistance to ease the burden of absorbing hundreds of thousands of Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union.
One of the many questions facing the Israelis now is how badly they need that $10 billion. The figure was reached on the basis of a projected immigrant flow of 200,000 a year. In recent months that tide has receded to a rate translating into only 60,000 a year.
Mr. Halperin argued that the borrowing needs remains large because Israel still had to contend with the 350,000 Soviet Jews who have already arrived here since mid-1989. It is not just the immediate cash that counts, he and others say, but also the investment and economic growth that would be encouraged.

When a City Newspaper Is the Enemy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 18

 BODY:
Since January, two of this city's most powerful institutions have been engaged in an increasingly bitter war of words. The latest salvo is an advertisement appearing on the sides of dozens of buses here. In bold black letters on a yellow background it says in Spanish: "I don't believe The Herald."
The advertisement, which is also scheduled to appear on billboards, is sponsored by the Cuban American National Foundation, an influential Miami-based lobbying group that says it speaks on behalf of more than one million Cuban-Americans who want to see Communism ousted from their former homeland. 
 The target of the group's ire is The Miami Herald, the largest newspaper in Florida and, to some Cuban exiles here, a symbol of liberal Anglo establishment.
Although The Herald has been a consistent critic of Fidel Castro's Communist regime, the foundation questions the newspaper's devotion to the cause and treats any skepticism of its own policies and activities as a slur against all Cuban-Americans. Not surprisingly, that attitude awakens deep passions in a city whose political and economic life is now dominated by Cuban-Americans, and in which the distinction between events in Havana and purely local issues has long been blurred.
Over and over again, leaders of the foundation have accused the newspaper of waging a campaign of "unjust harassment" and "distortion and disinformation" against the largest ethnic group in the Miami area. One attack against the paper came in a 4,000-word article published on the op-ed page of The Herald itself.
The Herald has retorted that such accusations, which have coincided with acts of vandalism and threats against its employees, are part of an effort to turn Miami into "a totalitarian society," just like the one from which many Cuban exiles here fled.
The fight began in mid-January, when The Herald published an editorial opposing a bill in Congress that would tighten the American economic embargo of Cuba. On the same day, the newspaper's Spanish-language edition, El Nuevo Herald, carried a column criticizing exile leaders who advocate military action against Cuba but who are unwilling themselves to stir from the comfort and safety of Miami.
Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the foundation, quickly took to the city's Spanish-language radio stations to accuse The Herald and its sister paper of "manipulating information just like Granma," the newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party. Mr. Mas Canosa said the papers had allowed themselves to become tools of the Castro regime and intimated that Cuban intelligence agents had infiltrated the staffs of both newspapers.
Mr. Mas Canosa, who has acknowledged harboring presidential ambitions in a post-Castro Cuba and is a powerful force in Republican Party politics here, also urged the editor of El Nuevo Herald and the president of the Miami Herald Publishing Company, both of whom are Cuban-Americans, to resign. The two men should step down, he said, to protest what he called the Herald's "continuous and systematic campaign against Cuban-Americans, their institutions, values, ethics and ideals."
Shortly after Mr. Mas Canosa's first wave of denunciations of The Herald, the paper's publisher, David Lawrence Jr., and both of the Cuban-American executives received an unsigned death threat written in Spanish. In a letter to the Miami police chief, Mr. Lawrence said the newspaper had also received a telephoned bomb threat.
In addition, dozens of the Herald's vending boxes have been vandalized, their coin slots often jammed with gel or glue. Some have been smeared with feces or painted over with Spanish-language graffiti like "comunistas!"
Mr. Lawrence, who has also met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has not accused Mr. Mas Canosa of direct responsibility for any of the threats or vandalism. But in a signed column last month, he said that "wild and angry accusations" against the newspaper "stir up the less well-intentioned and the more misguided."
Earlier, in an op-ed article entitled "Come On, Mr. Mas, Be Fair," Mr. Lawrence wrote, "You are a powerful person, here and in Washington, and you would like to hurt us, destroy us if you could." The publisher concluded by saying, "We cannot promise you, or anyone else, that we will stop printing certain opinions or certain stories."
Several reporters and editors at both editions of The Herald have said they are enraged by the foundation's verbal attacks and wish Mr. Lawrence would defend the paper more vigorously. Public support for The Herald has also come from some exile factions, though many prominent Cuban-Americans have remained silent.
Raul Masvidal, a former mayoral candidate who broke with Mr. Mas Canosa in the mid-80's, wrote in a letter to the editor: "Please don't allow The Herald to be pushed around. You have an obligation to the future of Cuban democracy and the Cuban people."
The Cuban American National Foundation has issued a statement saying it "condemns any acts of violence and intolerance" and called for "an immediate investigation." Mr. Mas Canosa has also suggested that the vandalism and threats against the Herald are the work of "Castroite agents" seeking to discredit exiles.
In addition, the foundation leader has hinted that he might organize a boycott of the newspapers. At the least, he said in a recent radio broadcast, his campaign would continue until "The Miami Herald respects the ideals and values of the Cuban-American community and embraces the cause of freedom for Cuba."
With that goal in mind, Mr. Mas Canosa, joined by Mayor Xavier Suarez of Miami and other prominent local Cuban-Americans, recently helped organize the Cuban Committee Against Defamation. To no one's surprise, the first complaint the new organization received was filed by the Cuban American National Foundation against The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald.
The strife is so bitter that it attracted the attention of the Inter American Press Association, which more commonly defends freedom of the press against left-wing and right-wing dictatorships in Latin America. The organization said last week that it would investigate "recent vandalism, threats of boycott and warnings of physical attack" against The Herald. It was the first time, members said, that the group has felt the need to stand up for a newspaper under political siege in the United States.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Says Ukraine Will Give Up Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 18

 BODY:
The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, said today that he had been assured that Ukraine's battlefield nuclear weapons would be transferred to Russia by July as planned. But there was no confirmation from Kiev that the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, had reversed his order to halt the move.
According to the news agencies Itar-Tass and Interfax, Mr. Yeltsin told Russian members of parliament that Mr. Kravchuk had told him on Tuesday by telephone that he would meet the July 1 deadline for moving all tactical weapons to Russia for destruction. 
 The elimination of the weapons was agreed on between the United States and the former Soviet Union last fall, and once the Commonwealth of Independent States was formed by 11 former Soviet republics, Ukraine agreed to transfer its weapons to Russia for dismantling.
But last Thursday, Mr. Kravchuk unexpectedly announced that he was suspending the transfer, saying he had no guarantees the weapons were being destroyed. He suggested that Ukraine might set up its own dismantling plant, and asked for Western money to do so.
The declaration disturbed Washington. In Moscow, it was viewed largely as a ploy by Ukraine to wrest a share of Western funds earmarked for the dismantling, and as a political maneuver in advance of the meeting Friday of Commonwealth leaders in Kiev.
The fate of the vast Soviet military machine is high on the agenda, and Ukraine has been especially adamant in resisting Russia's claim to the bulk of the former Soviet Army. Though couched largely in terms of nation-building, the kernel of the dispute is widely viewed here and in Kiev to be the potential commercial value of military hardware.
Earlier this week, on his return from a two-week vacation, President Yeltsin announced that Russia was setting up its own Defense Ministry, with himself as acting minister. At a briefing for members of parliament, Mr. Yeltsin was quoted as saying that he regarded establishment of a defense ministry as a transitional step, and that it did not portend the transfer of former Soviet troops to Russia.
Until now, Russia has argued for the maintenance of a unified Commonwealth army; Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova have insisted on forming independent armies and disbanding all but the strategic nuclear arm of the former Soviet forces, which would remain under a unified command.
Military issues are expected to be at the top of the agenda of the meeting on Friday. Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Alexei Novikov, said today that the agenda included an agreement on relocating of nuclear materiel, a decision on the united command and a convention on not using force among Commonwealth members.
The leaders will also deal with the status of troops in the stormy Caucasus region, where ethnic clashes have left hundreds dead. Mr. Yeltsin was quoted as saying that it was unclear who controlled the troops there.
 
Touchy Issue of Caucasus
 Senior generals in Moscow, backed by the Russian Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, himself an Air Force officer, have been increasingly anxious to withdraw Commonwealth troops from the Caucasus, where they have been regularly raided for arms and have been drawn into local frays.
Past meetings of republics' leaders have managed only to paper over differences over the military, and disputes over military issues ranging from the tactical weapons to oaths of allegiance have been a primary factor in the growing rift between Ukraine and Russia.
In a move that underscored his concern, Mr. Yeltsin's office disclosed today that he had named Yuri V. Dubinin, former Soviet representative at the United Nations and ambassador to Washington, as chief negotiator with Ukraine on political, military and economic issues.
Mr. Dubinin, 62 years old, was recalled from France after the coup last August, when he was accused of failing to resist the plotters. He is nonetheless considered one of the ablest diplomats that Russia inherited from the Soviet state.

HEADLINE: BANGLADESH CHIEF VISITS WASHINGTON

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
A year after taking office in the first peaceful and democratic transfer of power in Bangladesh, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia came to Washington this week to ask the Bush Administration, Congress and international bankers not to overlook one of the most vulnerable nations in the rush to create a new world order.
The year has been a cruel one for Prime Minister Zia, only the second woman to head a modern Islamic country. Weeks after her Government was installed, Bangladesh was struck by a devastating cyclone that killed more than 100,000 people. 
 Now the country is being overrun by tens of thousands of Burmese refugees fleeing at the rate of 5,000 or more a day from a Burmese military campaign against that nation's Muslim minority. The Bangladesh Army, never hesitant to enter politics, is watching that crisis build, experts in Washington say.
"We are a poor country with a large population and it is not possible for us to care for such a large community from across our border," Prime Minister Zia, the 47-year-old widow of an assassinated former President, Gen. Ziaur Rahman, said in an interview on Tuesday. On Thursday, she is to go to the United Nations to discuss the refugee crisis with Secretary General Boutros Ghali.
 
Crucial Areas of Progress
 Despite the unending cycle of human-made and natural tragedies that afflict Bangladesh, Prime Minister Zia is getting a good reception in Washington. For the first time in the South Asian country's 20-year history, there is a sense that Bangladesh is addressing some of its fundamental problems.
Officials at the World Bank, in the Bush Administration and in private organizations no longer call Bangladesh a "basket case." Over the last five or six years -- even under Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, the country's last military ruler, now in prison on corruption charges -- Bangladesh has shown that progress can be made in critical areas of economic and social development with very slender resources.
In South Asia, Bangladesh is gaining a reputation as the most innovative and receptive nation in making use of grass-roots organizations, like the rural Grameen Bank movement, which gives support to village entrepreneurs.
Between 1985 and 1991, the percentage of infants and young children immunized against the six most common childhood diseases rose from 2 percent to 62 percent, and the figure is expected to reach 85 percent within the next five years, according to World Bank figures. Nongovernmental organizations have carried out the immunization program in neighborhood centers with the help of the United States Agency for International Development and other donors.
"What makes this a hopeful country to look at is that there are so many examples of grass-roots projects which have made a difference to people's lives," said Teresita C. Schaffer, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Pakistan.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
On a Dark, Stormy Republican Night

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Senators do it. Journalists do it. Even the alienated daughters of former Presidents do it. So Marilyn Quayle and her sister said, let's do it, let's write a book.
"Embrace the Serpent," by Marilyn T. Quayle, the Vice President's wife, and her older sister, Nancy T. Northcott, is due out from Crown Publishers on April 3, the latest entry in this year's Washington celebrity power-novel steeplechase. 
 The former Tucker sisters of Indianapolis have spun a plot to warm the heart of anyone skeptical about glasnost. The Cubans tend to have bad teeth and reek of garlic. The Russians are nefarious, and greedy to boot. The journalists are craven, the Democrats corrupt, perverse or Russian dupes, and the Central Intelligence Agency has been "emasculated" by national security wimps.
 
Secure in Their Knowledge
 The Republicans are able to see through Russian disinformation; they live secure in the knowledge that "Star Wars" could save the world, if the craven, the corrupt and the wimpy would permit it.
After years of circling the flame of power, famous Washingtonians not infrequently decide to write novels. Margaret Truman has published 10 murder mysteries. Several years ago, Senators William S. Cohen of Maine and Gary Hart of Colorado wrote a bipartisan thriller. Patti Davis, daughter of President Ronald Reagan, wrote a roman a clef.
"Embrace the Serpent" is joined by three other new novels: "Capitol Secrets," by Maureen Dean, wife of John Dean of Watergate fame; "The Candidate's Wife," by Patricia O'Brien, a former journalist and spokeswoman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 Presidential campaign, and "Capitol Hill," by Catherine Mann, wife of Representative Fred Grandy, the Iowa Republican who played "Gopher" on "The Love Boat."
"There are two different kinds of Washington novelists," said Sally Quinn, a former reporter for The Washington Post who has written two novels set in Washington. "One is the Washington celebrity who decides they want to write a novel -- the Gary Hart, Bill Cohen, Marilyn Quayle, Maureen Dean syndrome. Then there are writers, who happen to live in Washington, like Larry McMurtry, or who write about Washington, like Ward Just."
 
'I'm Not a Celebrity'
 Ms. Quinn, who said she started in the first category and wants to be in the second, described the celebrity tome this way: "Why don't I try my hand at a novel? I know Washington. I know how it works. It is a genre book. The President gets sick, whatever, goes blind, becomes a dupe of the K.G.B., or what used to be the K.G.B. The Senator sleeps around, or the candidate sleeps around, usually with the foreign diplomat's wife. They're interchangeable."
Mrs. Quayle and Mrs. Northcott bristle at the comparison.
"I'm not a celebrity," Mrs. Quayle said in an interview. "There's a mind-set, and I don't think I've got that. But Nancy and I undertook this more because we really wanted to write a book. It's not a book about my life in Washington as the wife of the Vice President."
 
The Cigar Lingers On
 It begins with the C.I.A.'s ultimate fantasy: Fidel Castro dropping dead while smoking a cigar. "The magnetism and vitality had vanished; all that remained was a torn uniform below a scraggly beard littered with fading embers and ashes."
The Russians, in thrall to the Arabs after having sold off their assets to save their crippled economy, allow military officers pining for the old days to launch "Operation Romanov." They murder Raul Castro, Fidel's brother, and put a puppet, Cesar Valles, in power.
Meanwhile, Gen. Jose Moya, leader of the underground movement La Causa, languishes in prison. "Even he realized that gaining freedom was improbable at best, but he also knew no man's sanity could withstand the horror of a never-ending existence in this hellhole."
The Russians aim to undermine America through arms and drug traffic. And the Democratic President, a gullible fellow who does everything for personal gain, is unwittingly duped by Russian intelligence into supporting Valles.
 
Sex and Disguises
 The hero, Senator Robert Hawkins Grant, Republican of Georgia, knows better. With the help of friends in the Cuban resistance and his loyal aide (who does not have any mommy-track conflicts, since her husband had been "shot by a druggie"), he works to foil the plot and make General Moya the President.
Washington novels generally have two additional characteristics: sex and characters disguised just enough to avoid lawsuits.
It irritated Mrs. Quayle and Mrs. Northcott to think that people were thumbing through their book looking for sex scenes. There are none.
There is romance, between Alejandro, the brave soldier of La Causa, and Maria, who bravely poses as a maid in the Presidential Palace to help him. "But Castro's Cuba was no place for love."
 
The Passion of Marriage
 It is a measure of the steaminess of "Embrace the Serpent" that the love passages (mostly between married couples) can be quoted: " 'Love you,' he said with a quick kiss. 'Mmm,' he whispered, pulling her closer and nuzzling her ear. As always, the sweet smell of her warmed him. 'Thanks for being so understanding.' After another much more satisfactory kiss, he released her." (And then left for work.)
"Journalists can write much more freely about sex than other people can," said Ms. Quinn, whose books have plenty of sex scenes. "Politicians are not supposed to have sex."
Not even with their spouses? "Well, it's possible, but risky," she said.
 
A Certain Wednesday
 The President in "Embrace the Serpent" is a Democrat who, curiously, appears to have beaten George Bush in the 1992 elections. The action begins on Wednesday, Jan. 25, after the fall of the Soviet Union. The only Wednesday, Jan. 25, after that in this century is in 1995.
So definitely not George Bush, right? This fictional President, Peter Evans, is a man who likes to say he is from a Southern state, when in fact he's a Northeastern establishment type. "He was careful to emphasize his Kentucky heritage: he was just a good old boy. Funny how few had keyed on his real history: boarding schools in the East. Ivy League college, first jobs in the East as well."
President Evans is protected by journalists, including a cynical, left-leaning Washington newspaper editor. Journalists are not treated gently by Mrs. Northcott and Mrs. Quayle, who has viewed reporters with clenched teeth since Dan Quayle's trials in the 1988 campaign.
The authors acknowledged that they did fit one characteristic of the Washington celebrity novelist. "We first started talking about writing a book about 10 years ago, having read many, and thought we could do as well," Mrs. Northcott said.
 
A Labor of Three Years
 The sisters spent three years on this book. Mrs. Northcott, who lives in Tullahoma, Tenn., with her husband, Thomas, an oral surgeon, said she waited until her four children were old enough to fend for themselves.
Like another political wife, Hillary Clinton, Mrs. Quayle is a lawyer. Unlike Mrs. Clinton, she no longer practices, so her career has not been a political problem. "This is my time," she said. "I've worked hard for everyone the last three and a half years, so I don't think anyone begrudges me this time."
Mrs. Quayle and Mrs. Northcott said they prized their ability to work together. But Esther Newberg, the New York literary agent who represents Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator and Democratic Presidential candidate, found celebrity Washington novels and two people writing fiction together equally unnerving.
 
'The Mind Boggles'
 "The idea that they finish each other's sentences!" she said. "Does that mean we have to read a Bill Clinton-Hillary Clinton book? I mean, she already finishes his sentences. The mind boggles."
A favorite pastime for readers of Washington celebrity novels is uncovering political messages. Mrs. Quayle and Mrs. Northcott said theirs is not a political tract, although they acknowledged a "conservative perspective."
When an interviewer noted that the Democrats in the book are, well, dumb, Mrs. Quayle said, "That's real life."
Indeed, "Embrace the Serpent" is a primer on conservative political correctness.
The hero, Senator Grant, is black -- a fact introduced with the phrase "he'd smiled at her, his straight teeth white in his black face" -- and had been a career Navy officer. Grant ran for office reluctantly, because the Democratic incumbent was an outrageous pork-barrel politician who had sex with teen-agers.
Mrs. Quayle is unrepentant about painting the Russians as bad guys. There are, however, limits.
Talking about rewriting passages after the fall of Soviet Communism, Mrs. Northcott said, "We just guessed that they'd start selling their assets and doing all that."
Mrs. Quayle: "We've been shocked" at how prescient that was.
Mrs. Northcott: "Delighted."
Mrs. Quayle: "No, now come on. What a word to use. Geez. Strike that."

HEADLINE: Japan Sets Lower Ceiling for Auto Exports

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, March 19

 BODY:
In an election-year gesture to the United States, Japan today announced a big reduction in its ceiling for automobile exports, saying it would limit exports to 1.65 million a year, down sharply from 2.3 million now.
While the move marks a significant concession by Japan, its impact on the reeling American automobile industry is likely to be limited. In part because of the depressed auto market and in part because of the increasing number of cars manufactured at Japanese "transplant" factories in the United States, Japan exported only about 1.76 million cars to the American market in 1991, or only 110,000 above the new ceiling. That was the fifth consecutive year that Japanese exports to America fell below 2.3 million, the level that has been in effect since the mid-1980's. 
 Though there will be little effect on the actual number of cars shipped to the United States, Japanese officials are betting that the Bush Administration will be able to greet the announcement as a victory. Mr. Bush's ill-fated trip to Japan in January focused tremendous attention on the automobile issue -- autos make up about 75 percent of the trade deficit -- and the Japanese clearly hope the Administration will be able to cite the lowering of the export limits as a response to pressure from the President.
[In Washington, an American trade official declined to discuss the new export level announced by the Japanese, but said, "What the U.S. is after is opening the Japanese market." ]
In recent weeks, as Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry has debated whether to keep the formal limit at 2.3 million or to reduce it, officials have made little secret of the fact that they were keeping one eye on the Presidential primaries.
The unexpectedly deep cut in the limit seemed to suggest that the growing calls for protectionism in the United States jolted the Japanese auto industry and the Government into taking an action that they have resisted for several years. But it is not clear whether the Japanese strategy -- to offer a concession now in hopes that it will defuse any movement for sharper limits that might emerge later in the campaign -- will prove successful.
"Japan-U.S. relations are quite important," Kozo Watanabe, the Trade Minister, said recently. "Economic policy must be developed to make Japan-U.S. relations better."
The new export restraints will go into effect on April 1, the beginning of the Japanese fiscal year. The trade ministry has estimated that exports to the United States would total 1.73 million cars in the new fiscal year, meaning that the auto industry will have to trim its plans slightly. Presumably, some manufacturing could be moved to American transplants, which are not affected by the limits.
This will be the 12th consecutive year for the restraints, although they were originally conceived as a temporary measure to give Detroit a chance to grow more competitive.
Japanese officials say in private that the initiative has largely failed and that they see little evidence that the American auto makers used the voluntary limits to lift productivity or reduce the price of American autos. But they view the restraints as politically useful, at little cost to the Japanese economy. Every year for five years Japanese car exports have been well below 2.3 million, but the market share of Japanese cars has risen above 30 percent.
Japanese auto makers have also seen their revenues from export rise, largely because they are shipping larger, more expensive cars to the United States, vehicles like Toyota's Lexus and Honda's Acura. The American transplant factories have been used to produce less expensive, higher-volume models.

HEADLINE: Analysts Consider Recovery Too Weak To Make Jobs Yet

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
For all the robust gains showing up in recent economic reports, most economists say that the evidence available so far is not sufficient to demonstrate that a strong enough recovery is under way to generate new job growth.
Unless job growth resumes soon, they say, there will not be enough additional family income to sustain the jump in consumer spending that began 60 days ago. That could mean a renewal of the recession or, at the very least, a continuation of the stagnation that has plagued the American economy for three years. A similar surge in consumer spending last spring, also hailed as the first stage of a recovery, came to a halt in August after failing to increase jobs. 
 "I don't think you can go past May without significant job growth and keep a recovery going," said David Wyss, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a data-gathering and consulting service. One million fewer Americans hold jobs since the recession began in July 1990.
Healthy increases in retail sales, new home construction and auto and truck production since December have encouraged many economists to predict that by midsummer, the economy will be growing at an annual rate of more than 3 percent. The Federal Reserve's periodic survey of regional economic conditions released yesterday confirmed the upturn in consumer buying, but noted that manufacturing layoffs persisted. [Page D2.]
A 3 percent growth rate by mid-summer would mark the first time since the winter of 1989 that the growth rate has exceeded even 2 percent -- a slowdown that has blurred the distinction between stagnation and recession.
Strictly speaking, a recession means that the gross domestic product, measuring all the new wealth created in the United States in a given period, is shrinking, as it did from the summer of 1990 until last spring. Since then, growth has been so anemic that economists and the public alike have often called it a recession.
The reason for this blurring of definitions is the loss of jobs. By almost every estimate, if jobs are to be created again, rather than lost through layoffs and attrition, then the gross domestic product must grow at an annual rate of more than 2 percent for several quarters, and perhaps by as much as 3 percent. Only then, said Nancy Lazar, senior economist at ISI Group, a consulting firm, would there be "a tone change in the economy."
Three percent growth, adds Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economic sciences, "is just about enough to keep the unemployment rate constant or slightly diminishing."
 
Something for Everyone
 Whatever the long-term outlook, President Bush can point to the incipient upturn as evidence that an election-year recovery is under way. And his Democratic opponents, with equal authority, can hammer away at the missing jobs and the rising unemployment rate: 7.3 percent today, compared with 5.3 percent when the recession started. "They'll each be able to put their spin on the data," Mr. Solow said.
Ms. Lazar and some other forecasters say that 3 percent growth is likely by Election Day, and could endure into 1993. They base their optimism on two conditions lacking last spring, when consumer buying also surged. One is the decline in interest rates for mortgages and auto loans since last year, although some rates have recently turned up a bit. The other is healthier banks, specifically those that have written off many of their uncollectable loans and now seem more willing to finance new activity.
But in a dozen interviews with economists, their doubts about job growth, the most important factor of all, repeatedly came to the surface.
"A lot of manufacturers have not yet seen a significant pickup in orders, despite the healthy rise in retail sales," said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, whose territory includes Midwestern states that have weathered the recession better than other regions. "I cannot tell you that anyone is suggesting to us that they are in a strong rehiring mode at this moment. They are hopeful, but they are also cautious."
 
New Cut in Rates?
 Reflecting this caution, David W. Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggests that the Fed might bring short-term interest rates even lower than their present 4 percent level if the upturn shows signs of fading. "In the current, complex, sluggish environment, we are watching the situation very carefully because last summer, the economy started to take off and the environment snuffed out that recovery," he said, noting that rising rates a year ago had discouraged consumers and businesses.
Perhaps the main reason for the current upturn is a sudden rise in personal disposable income, the money Americans can spend or save after paying their taxes. After declining for most of last year, total disposable income jumped 1.5 percent in January from December's level, even after adjusting for inflation. And February brought an additional 2.2 percent increase.
These were far and away the largest increases since the summer of 1990, when the recession began -- but they did not come from job growth or from noticeably higher wages, economists say. The bulk of the gains came from more fragile sources: a rise in overtime pay, the extended unemployment benefits recently granted by Congress, higher Social Security checks and the Government's early mailing of veterans' benefits and income tax refunds.
"We do have some stimulus out there and our surveys show a recent strengthening in consumer confidence, suggesting a turnaround," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment surveys. Mild inflation -- the Consumer Price Index is rising at an annual rate of less than 3 percent -- also helps to stretch family budgets, and lower interest rates have reduced millions of mortgage payments, Mr. Curtin noted.
 
Doubts on Employment
 "But more fundamentally," he said, "when consumers look to the year ahead or to the next five years, they are not seeing the employment problem solved and that will inhibit any recovery."
Thomas Plewes, associate commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, also doubts that the employment problem has been solved, although 164,000 jobs were added to the labor force in February, the first rise since last November. "The figures that we put out were not incompatible with a recovery, but they did not demonstrate one either," he said.
Most of the reported job gains were at retailers and auto factories. But the rise in retail jobs was partly artificial: a formula used to adjust for seasonal variations increased retail employment by 133,000 instead of the 50,000 or so jobs actually created. And the more than 10,000 new jobs at auto makers mostly represented call-backs of hourly workers temporarily laid off, industry executives said.
 
Auto Industry Reluctance
 The auto industry illustrates how reluctant many American companies are to add to their job rolls. At the Ford Motor Company new hiring would come only if assembly lines were speeded up or a shift were added, "and that sort of quantum leap is way down the road," said Joel Pitcoff, a Ford researcher and analyst.
Car and truck production is currently running at an annual rate of nearly 13 million vehicles. "I suspect that if we get a sustained demand for 13.5 million cars and trucks a year, then employment will start to grow in the auto industry," said Wynn Van Bussman, a Chrysler Corporation economist.
The current upturn has to weather three other hazards, economists say. One is a possible decline in exports. What growth there has been in recent months has come partly from strong exports, now threatened by declining economies in Europe and Japan.
Another hazard is rising imports. When the economy revived last spring, a portion of the new purchases was imported goods, creating jobs abroad but not at home.
Finally, many economists argue that a consumer-led recovery cannot, by itself, sustain sufficient growth, unless rising production also stimulates investment in new machinery and factories. That would require a reversal of a trend that saw net new investment in plant and equipment drop to 5 percent of the gross domestic product in the late 1980's from 7.8 percent in the late 1960's.
"One thing that saved us in the 1980's was investment by foreigners in the United States," Mr. Wyss of DRI/McGraw-Hill, said. "Lately, there has not been enough consumption to make investment rise."

HEADLINE: Dim View of Economy From Oil Industry

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Whatever the tea leaves show in other parts of the American economy, the oil industry said yesterday that the nation was still in recession, with February's refinery output at its lowest level in nearly five years. Domestic crude-oil production also continues to fall sharply.
But overall demand was up in February compared with last year, because of an anomaly: February 1991 was a depressed month because of the Persian Gulf war. 
 Oil use is neither a leading indicator of the economy nor a trailing indicator, but a measure of current activity, according to Charles DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute. He said that from the statistics released yesterday, "we don't see any evidence the economy is reviving."
 The institute, the industry's main trade association, said that deliveries of refined products were up 2.5 percent compared with February 1991, when deliveries were at a five-year low. But the institute said that on a month-to-month basis, taking seasonal variations into account, "there has been no real sign of strengthening in deliveries since mid-1991."
Domestic crude production fell about 250,000 barrels a day, or 3.4 percent, to 7.299 million barrels a day, from 7.552 million. Imports rose about six-tenths of a percent, to 6.888 million barrels a day from 6.844 million.
The average demand for imports is substantially higher, the institute said, in the range of 7.7 million to 7.8 million barrels a day, but stocks were drawn down by a larger amount than average last month.
Refinery utilization fell to 79.9 percent, from 84.4 percent a year earlier.
 
 
Mobil Cuts Spending Plans
 The nation's weather has been generally warm, but weather is a fairly small factor in overall oil demand.
In line with generally glum news on oil, the Mobil Corporation said yesterday that it would cut its capital spending this year to $4.8 billion, about $1 billion less than previously planned. It was the second straight year in which Mobil cut expenditures during the year. And the company's chairman, Allen E. Murray, said that about $800 million more might be deferred unless conditions improved.
The company also said it would take $105 million in first-quarter charges, mostly for restructuring.

HEADLINE: Debt Deal For Trump On Plaza

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump has reached an agreement to turn over 49 percent of his interest in the landmark Plaza Hotel in Manhattan to a group of banks led by Citibank, people involved in the talks said yesterday.
The nearly completed deal is one of the last in a long line of debt restructurings that Mr. Trump has reached with his creditors. It would cancel $125 million of Mr. Trump's personally guaranteed debt, plus accrued interest, and would give the developer more favorable terms on the remaining $300 million of mortgage debt. 
 The Plaza deal is similar to other Trump deals in swapping mortgage debt for equity, and it would leave Mr. Trump in control of the hotel, although his equity would be heavily encumbered by bank liens.
To keep control of the Plaza, as well as two Atlantic City casinos, Mr. Trump must meet certain business projections over the next several years. If he failed to meet the projections and make the required interest payments, he would lose control of his remaining stake in the hotel.
 
Subject to a Lien
 Mr. Trump's 51 percent stake would still be subject to a lien held by the banks that lent him $125 million. He would be allowed to pay interest as low as 5 percent on the $300 million of mortgage debt if he could not pay the original floating rate.
The deal, which was reached last week, values the Plaza at about $260 million. Mr. Trump paid $409 million for the hotel in 1988 and will retain a $300 million mortgage on it. In 1990, the Trump Organization estimated the value of the Plaza at $830 million, while the Kenneth Leventhal Company, which was retained by Mr. Trump, put the value at $413 million to $500 million.
"The deal has been agreed upon by the whole group of banks and Mr. Trump, and it is 49 percent for the banks and 51 percent for Trump," said Richard Wilhelm, president of the Plaza Hotel, yesterday.
The banks and Mr. Trump still have to sign a final agreement for the deal to take effect.
Despite the formidable array of problems and the billions in debt facing Mr. Trump, he has managed to convince scores of creditors that they should grant him more time in which to try to increase the value of his deeply indebted assets and that they should release him from his guarantees for hundreds of millions of dollars of debt.
In the case of the Penn Yards, a 76-acre tract of undeveloped land on the West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Trump has been able to improve the value by negotiating for zoning approval with city officials and community groups.
If the Plaza proposal goes through, Mr. Trump will be personally liable for at least $115 million in debt, down from roughly $900 million in 1990.
But Mr. Trump is far from out of the woods. In June 1993, about $350 million in mortgage debt will come due and it is unclear whether the banks will roll over the debts or demand payment. The $300 million mortgage on the Plaza comes due in 1995. In addition, Mr. Trump's $115 million of personally guaranteed debt matures in 1995. Whether he will be able to pay that plus tens of millions more that will have come due by then is anyone's guess.
 
Eleventh-Hour Negotiations
 For two years, Mr. Trump has faced 11th-hour negotiations to shore up his empire, which has been crumbling as a result of his heavy borrowing to buy high-profile assets at inflated prices during the 1980's. With the collapse of real estate prices at the end of the decade and the troubles in the gaming and airline industries that were aggravated by the recession, Mr. Trump became trapped in a cash squeeze and was finally rescued by banks that stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if he was forced into bankruptcy.
Between bondholders of his Atlantic City casinos and the banks that liberally lent him hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Trump and the top executives of the Trump Organization managed to cobble together a series of deals that give him more time to improve the performance and value of some of his assets.
Banks have also taken back some assets in lieu of the debt on them. Among these are the Trump Shuttle, which USAir is now operating; the Trump Princess Yacht; a 50 percent interest in the Grand Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan; a 28 percent stake in Alexander's department store; three Atlantic City land parcels, and hundreds of New York condominiums in the Trump Palace and another Manhattan building.
 
Action at the Casinos
 In addition, Mr. Trump has swapped 50 percent of Trump's Castle casino and 50 percent of the Trump Taj Mahal, two Atlantic City casinos, for more favorable debt terms granted by holders of junk bonds that he sold to finance the casinos.
In the case of the Plaza Hotel, the proposed deal underscores the developer's difficulties. He bought the hotel for about $409 million in 1988, or about 25 times the hotel's 1988 cash flow of $16 million, from the Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth. With accrued interest and other borrowings, the total debt on the property before this latest deal exceeded $430 million and interest was accruing at a floating rate.
The new deal would leave the original $300 million mortgage and its floating-rate debt in place, but it would allow Mr. Trump to pay as little as 5 percent interest and accrue the balance. By trading the personally guaranteed $125 million debt for 49 percent of his equity in the hotel, and through other such deals, Mr. Trump is trying to clear the way for a financial comeback.
 
Remaining Questions
 Final details of the new partnership agreement are still being worked out. It is not known whether the banks will be free to sell their 49 percent equity interest in the Plaza.
The Plaza, which is rated as one of New York's best hotels and has been performing strongly for the last few years, has not been able to generate enough cash to make its debt payments for several years now. In 1990, interest payments on the acquisition debt cost about $41.3 million, but the hotel had only $21 million in cash flow. Last year, the hotel's cash flow totaled $17.6 million, while the total accrued debt-service cost was about $42 million.
This year, Mr. Wilhelm estimates, the hotel will generate nearly $21 million in cash flow before its debt-service cost, which will be about $15 million.

HEADLINE: President's Plan Seeks to Create a Market for Cars That Pollute

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Pressing its drive to cut the cost of complying with Government regulation, the Bush Administration today announced a series of initiatives in the transportation sector that includes a "cash for clunkers" program, under which states and companies can meet Federal clean-air requirements by buying and scrapping the old vehicles that generate the most pollution.
The buy-up of old cars, to be left largely to market forces under guidelines to be established by the Environmental Protection Agency, could begin within a few months. 
 "This is just one example of the innovative, market-based approaches to pollution reduction that have been pioneered by our Environmental Protection Agency," President Bush said in a statement. "The result is a cleaner, healthier environment and a more competitive economy."
 
Debate on Fuel Standards
 But the Administration pulled back from a plan to relax fuel-efficiency standards for cars burning cleaner fuels, a fiercely debated issue. Many environmentalists seek to make the current 27.5-mile-a-gallon standard even tougher. That standard, known as CAFE, for corporate average fuel economy, is a minimum for the average fuel economy of each auto maker's fleet.
Officials said this initiative was postponed on technical grounds, but there were also indications of a strenuous internal argument about the wisdom of reducing the standard, which would reportedly fall to an average of 26.5 miles a gallon.
In general, American auto makers oppose the standards, which they say forces them to skew production to build more small cars and fewer large cars than customers would prefer. This hurts both profitability and safety, they maintain.
Anticipating a rollback announcement that did not come, at least today, the Sierra Club issued a statement denouncing any reduced standard as "outrageous and illegal," and as bad for the economy, for jobs and for the environment.
 
Study of Ethanol Not Done
 Michael J. Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser and a leader in the Administration's campaign to streamline regulations, said the postponement of any rollback decision was specifically tied to the fact that the E.P.A. had not yet finished its analysis of ethanol in reformulated gasoline. An announcement on that study would be made "in the very near future."
Although today's initiatives also contained various measures involving truck and rail transportation and ocean shipping, the bulk of attention centered on the cash-for-clunkers program to get the vehicles that pollute the most off the road. The Administration made no grand claims for the plan, however, which is patterned on one conducted by the Unocal Corporation in California in 1990 and 1991.
Under the Government program, a power plant or other "stationary source" could buy the right to continue polluting by reducing pollution from vehicles. The idea is that the new cars that would replace the old ones would be cleaner.
 
Economic Benefit Possible
 Officials said the cash-for-clunkers program would do no harm to the environment and might improve it somewhat. It might also act as a mild stimulant to the economy, as drivers of at least some clunkers replace their vehicles with later-model used cars or, in some cases, even new ones.
The General Motors Corporation, the nation's largest auto maker, said it supported the basic premise of a scrap program, which it said could prove "a cost-effective policy alternative for improving the environment and reducing fleet fuel-consumption."
As sketched out at a White House briefing, the cash-for-clunkers program would be run by individual states, cities and companies with the aid of federally provided data on the pollution and other characteristics of each kind of car. The main target is the four million pre-1971 cars still on the road, but officials said many cars from the 1980's would also likely be bid for, depending on such things as their pollution rating and estimated years of remaining useful life.
 
Unocal's Experiment
 In its program, Unocal bought more than 8,300 pre-1971 cars at $700 each in the Los Angeles area. Old cars emit as much as 20 times more in pollutants than those of the 1990's.
As an example of how the Government program would work, said Richard D. Morgenstern, director of the E.P.A.'s Office of Policy Analysis, a refiner in danger of exceeding its pollution limits might place an advertisement in the newspaper listing what it would pay for various kinds and vintages of cars and, having made the purchases, would apply the resulting credits to its own "account."
To prevent junkyard entrepreneurs from peddling wrecks, cars qualifying for purchase would have to be continuously insured for the past year and be driven in under their own power.
Although the oldest cars would tend to bring the highest prices, a car's value would also depend on its type, its mileage and its likely remaining life.
The pollution credits could be traded but could not be applied outside the program area, officials said.
Of the remaining Administration initiatives today, perhaps the most important was to accelerate a proceeding under which truckers would no longer have to obtain a registration stamp for each vehicle from each state in which they operate. Instead, a designated base state would do this work with no change in the amount of revenue each state collects.
This would save an estimated $250 million to $500 million a year, the Administration estimated.

HEADLINE: Vote Sought On Gasoline In California

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A group of oil companies that oppose California's strict new requirements on gasoline moved yesterday to block the rules with a statewide referendum. The move, prompted in part by concern that similar rules would be introduced elsewhere in the nation, would apparently be the first electoral test of whether people think that changes made in gasoline to reduce air pollution are worth the higher price.
The group plans to ask the California Legislature to put a measure on the ballot that would require another analysis of benefits and costs before proceeding with the rules, which the California Air Resources Board recently approved and are to take effect in 1996. The referendum would be phrased broadly to cover all environmental rules, said a spokesman for Texaco, one company involved. The spokesman, David J. Dickson, said the goal was to address "structural problems" in the California economy, which he said was being hurt by high costs for environmental compliance.
 
Conspicuously Absent
 ARCO, California's biggest gasoline marketer, was conspicuously absent. ARCO has voluntarily reformulated some of its gasoline and supported the Air Resources Board in its plans to enforce stricter rules. 
 Several factors beyond concern over California's economy appeared to play a role. While the ostensible target of the referendum would be the California rule, many executives of national oil companies say that whatever steps the state takes are likely to be adopted, in whole or in part, in the Northeast and in other parts of the country. Eleven Northeastern and Middle Atlantic states have said they plan to adopt the California standards.
Texaco, which has only about 7 percent of the California market but a bigger share in the East, has been especially vigorous in arguing against the California rules.
In addition, according to refining analysts, the cost of meeting new rules will differ substantially from company to company, depending on the age and configuration of their refineries. ARCO, which is predominantly a California company, would find the rules relatively easy to meet, refining experts say.
The composition of the group that met yesterday was unclear. Mr. Dickson said it was the directors of the Western States Petroleum Association. But a spokesman for the association, Jeffrey B. Wilson, said that the issue was not on the board's agenda, and that it was not addressed while the board was in session.
Shortly after California passed the new rule last October, the association considered and rejected a proposal to challenge it.
 
Meeting in Sacramento
 Mr. Dickson said other participants in the meeting in Sacramento yesterday included Chevron and Mobil. Chevron referred all comment to the association. A spokesman for Mobil said he was unaware of any meeting.
But a spokesman for the Air Resources Board, William Sessa, said he had heard some talk of an effort by the companies to oppose the rule.
At ARCO, Robert J. Trunek, the senior vice president for manufacturing, engineering and technology, said the idea of requiring a cost-benefit analysis was "just silly," because the Air Resources Board's enabling legislation required an analysis before the regulation was imposed. He added that cars contributed more than 50 percent of the pollution, and that "if you don't do as much as you can on the big emissions sources, you're going to have to do something just ridiculously strenuous on stationary sources." The latter are factories and other sources of pollution.
The California rules, which would take effect in April 1996, require gasoline with less benzene, a carcinogen, and more oxygen to reduce production of carbon monoxide.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed in Busy Day; Dow Off 1.79

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were narrowly mixed in heavy trading as investors with no fresh data to direct them had little incentive to buy, locking the market in a narrow range most of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average barely moved, closing at 3,254.25, down 1.79 points.
Even though the Federal Reserve's "beige book" report, a summary of economic activity, saw some improvement in economic conditions, it had no more impact on the market than Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's comments that a recovery is under way. Analysts said that while these might have provided some relief, the market was still waiting for a pickup in corporate earnings. 
 Pressure was also felt by the approach of the "triple witching hour," which actually will be played out over two days. It had investors moving around cautiously, as bonds posted small losses and offered no support to stocks yesterday. The 8 percent yield on a Treasury long bond remains an attractive alternative to equities.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 0.43 point, to 409.15, while the American Stock Exchange dropped 4.67 point, to 400.97, which traders said might have been influenced by a more than 62 percent drop in the share price of the Chambers Development Company traded there.
The waste management company, which plunged 19, to 11 1/4, revised its 1991 earnings to 3 cents a share from 83 cents, because of an accounting change. That was later followed by a change in recommendation from Douglas Augenthaler, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, who cut his rating on the the stock to "sell" from "market performer."
 
Waste Management Companies
 Other waste management companies caught up in the selling by unhappy investors included Waste Management Inc. off 2 1/4, to 40 1/2, and Browning-Ferris Industries, off 3/8, to 22 1/2.
In Nasdaq trading, the composite index rose 1.67 points, to 624.94, as the Russell 2,000 index of smaller company stocks gained 0.93 point, to 208.16.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 194.1 million shares, up from 190.8 million on Tuesday, as gaining issues putpaced losers by 917 to 798.
Blue-chip issues came under pressure in early trading, bounced a couple of times and ended lower. The weakness in the market came from a number of directions, one of them, losses in overseas markets to set the tone, while high yields in Treasury securities also weighed on stocks.
Traders said that without news, program trading is likely to dominate market activity over the next couple of days and provide direction ahead of "triple witching" expirations today and tomorrow of options on individual stocks, stock indexes, futures and options.
Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm that tracks program trades, clocked four program trades that combined to raise the Dow by 6.27 points.
Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said "it was as if the market was running in place." He saw a lot of situation buying instead and thinks that there may not be as much volatility in the market during the "triple witching" expirations as some may have come to expect. "It may have slipped through the market earlier in the week," he said.
In trading yesterday, NBD Bancorp fell to 28 7/8, down 7/8, after the company said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire INB Financial, up 7, to 43. The agreement is valued at about $876 million, and provides that NBD would exchange 1.6 shares of its common stock for each share of INB.
Elsewhere, shares of Seagram Company Ltd. jumped 5 3/8, to 117 1/8, on news of a 12 percent dividend increase and proposed 4-for-1 stock split that accompanied a better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report. The dividend increase hinges on shareholder approval of the stock split, traders said.

HEADLINE: Blocks Seen to Trade Pact With Canada and Mexico

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is almost certain not to seek Congressional approval of a free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this year, although it hopes to conclude talks on a pact in the coming months, senior Administration officials said today.
The officials also said that it seemed increasingly unlikely that there would be a successful conclusion to global trade talks in Geneva this year. Because the United States and the European Community have been unable to resolve their disagreements over agriculture, many countries have stopped negotiating on other issues in the world talks, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said. 
 As a result, an Administration that a year ago had hoped for two major agreements to open foreign markets will now end up with what one senior official termed one-third of one agreement: the completion of negotiations on a pact with Mexico and Canada to replace an agreement struck with Canada alone in 1988.
 
 
A 3-Stage Process
 Three stages are needed to complete a pact: negotiation, legislative drafting and Congressional approval. All the Administration is likely to end up with on the Canada-Mexico pact, the official said, is the first stage.
Administration officials emphasized that a sudden breakthrough in negotiations with Mexico and Canada could still make it possible to seek Congressional approval this year. But they acknowledged that such a development was unlikely.
Not one of the 19 negotiating groups in the trade talks with Mexico and Canada has reached an agreement, and talks in the highly contentious energy and auto negotiating groups are still "in the concept stage," Mrs. Hills said.
No efforts have been made to assemble the needed coalition in Congress for either the Mexico-Canada trade agreement or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade pact being discussed in Geneva, and no such effort is planned soon, Administration officials and senators said.
Both sets of negotiations have already gone on too long for the Administration to force Congressional consideration this year under the so-called fast-track authority for the President that Congress renewed last year after considerable debate.
 
 
Fiercely Contested Issue
 The proposed free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada in particular has become a fiercely contested issue in the Presidential election campaign, especially in industrial states of the Midwest, where there is concern about possible job losses to low-wage workers in Mexico.
Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, who finished second to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and ahead of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts in Michigan's primary election Tuesday, had strongly criticized the proposed pact, while Mr. Clinton endorsed it.
Both Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, and Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who is the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on International Trade, said there had been no Administration contacts about organizing a Congressional coalition to support the Canada and Mexico pacts.
Mr. Danforth said that it would be difficult in an election year to push either trade agreement through Congress, adding, "I'm not sure we'll be any better off next year, post-election."
 
Pointing to Mexico
 Placing the onus on Mexico rather than American politics, a senior Administration trade official who insisted on anonymity told reporters this morning that the refusal of Mexican negotiators to discuss a sweeping revision of bilateral trade relations had bogged down talks on the free trade agreement.
Current Mexican officials want a pact to lock their successors into preserving the new openness of the Mexican economy, and the United States wants an agreement that further opens the Mexican economy and can serve as a blueprint for future agreements with other Latin American nations, the official said.
President Bush spoke by telephone to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico on Tuesday. A senior Mexican Government official said today that the two leaders agreed that progress was being made in the talks but that President Bush made no pledge to put an agreement before Congress this year.
Mr. Salinas and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who spoke to Mr. Bush by phone last week, both said publicly on Tuesday that they expected an agreement to be reached soon, but they expressed doubts that it would be approved by Congress this year, according to Reuters reports from Ottawa and Mexico City.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Free Fund Yields Up; Taxables Are Mostly Stable

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on both tax-exempt and taxable money market funds are beginning to reflect the overall rise in market yields, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
The report, issued yesterday, collects figures on tax-exempts for the week ended Monday and on taxables for the week ended Tuesday. 
 Referring to the taxables, Walter Frank, economist for IBC/Donoghue, said that "the long decline in yields on taxable funds is ending, at least temporarily, reflecting the recent rise in short-term open-market yields, such as those on commercial paper, and Treasury bills."
 
More Increases Seen
 Mr. Frank added, "Unless we get another move toward easing money by the Federal Reserve, we expect to see some increase in the money fund yields over the next few weeks."
The seven-day compound average yield of the tax-exempt funds rose to 2.6 percent, up 10 basis points from the previous week, while the seven-day simple yield rose to 2.56 percent from 2.47 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
During the same period, the 30-day compound tax-free yield was 2.58 percent, down from 2.61 percent; the simple yield was also down 3 basis points, to 2.55 percent.
 
Highest Returns
 Among the funds with the highest yields in the region, the top Connecticut fund again was the Fidelity Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Portfolio, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 2.97 percent, up from 2.91 percent.
In New Jersey, the top fund was New Jersey Municipal Inc., reporting a yield of 2.91 percent. It is new to the list of recent leaders.
In New York, the top fund again was the Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund. It had a seven-day compound yield of 3.41 percent, up from 3.36 percent.
Assets of tax-exempt funds dropped by $663 million, to $98.2 billion. Donoghue said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in tax-free portfolios remained unchanged at 52 days for the third week.
Of the tax-free funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, Milwaukee, led once again with a seven-day compound yield of 3.45 percent, up from 3.38 percent the previous week.
 
Drop in Assets
 Assets of the taxable funds, meanwhile, declined by $1.8 billion, to $497.2 billion. Mr. Frank noted that institutions accounted for $1.4 billion of the total $1.8 billion outflow.
Mr. Frank said the average days to maturity of holdings in taxable funds declined to 56 days from 57.
The average seven-day compound taxable yield was unchanged at 3.79 percent, while the seven-day simple yield was also unchanged, at 3.72 percent.
At the same time, the 30-day compound yield on taxables declined 2 basis points, to 3.82 percent, and the 30-day simple yield also dropped by 2 basis points, to 3.75 percent.
The Fidelity Spartan Money Market Fund led the way as the highest-yielding taxable fund, with a yield of 4.42 percent, compared with 4.45 percent a week earlier.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 3.66 percent, off 2 basis points, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Surveys by Fed Find A Bit More Optimism

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Adding to recent reports of economic upturn, the Federal Reserve said today that business sentiment nationwide was "moderately more optimistic" than it was at the beginning of the year, although some caution remained.
Based on interviews as recent as last week, the survey, which comes out eight times a year, was noticeably more upbeat than in January, when the Fed characterized economic activity as "lackluster." 
 The report, compiled from surveys by the Fed's 12 regional banks in the two months ended March 9, said that home sales, auto sales and retail sales were improving and that there was little indication of strong upward pressure on retail or wholesale prices.
 
Manufacturing 'Flat'
 The report was less buoyant about manufacturing, saying the manufacturing sector "remains generally flat, with layoffs and rising unemployment often noted." It added that commercial construction "remains moribund," but said that residential mortgage lending "is often mentioned as a bright spot."
Today's survey, which follows strong reports over the last week on retail sales, housing starts and industrial production, confirms a widespread sentiment that a recovery is starting to take hold. In reaction to these positive signs, an increasing number of economists say they doubt the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in the near future, its usual strategy for stimulating the economy.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that department store sales in the New York area were stronger than expected in January and February. The bank added that home builders in New York and New Jersey reported a "significant increase in customer interest, with actual sales improving though still light."
It said labor-market developments in the region remained unfavorable, with unemployment rising and "a continued heavy schedule of planned corporate layoffs."
The survey said that in most Federal Reserve districts, there was "guarded optimism" on the part of merchandisers, except in the West, where retail sales "remained soft." The Federal Reserve added that most districts reported increased auto sales, with only the Texas region reporting a decline.
 
Layoffs Continued
 "The manufacturing sector is probably best described as 'mixed,' " the report said. The Federal Reserve banks of New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco all reported that factory layoffs continued in their regions, while the Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas districts saw modest gains in factory shipments or output. Several districts also reported declining inventories.
All Federal Reserve districts reported "at least modest improvement in real estate sales or residential construction or both." The Richmond, San Francisco and Chicago districts said housing prices were flat in their regions, but Minneapolis and Dallas saw some increases.
The San Francisco district noted a decline in the price of commercial buildings, while New York reported a rising vacancy rate for commercial office space.
According to the survey, several districts reported a pickup in sales of furniture and other home related goods. Several districts also mentioned that lumber prices had soared because of increased construction activity and restricted supply. The San Francisco bank said some grades of lumber were selling at record prices in the West.
Health care was the only other sector in which many districts reported large price gains.
But, reflecting the high interest rates that many banks continue to charge, the report said loan demand was "generally flat" nationwide. It also said that credit standards were "largely unchanged," which is sure to disappoint many businesses and the Bush Administration, which have complained that banks are holding back the recovery by their reluctance to make loans.
The report added that while most districts said the wave of mortgage refinancings was continuing, that trend appeared to have slackened because of the recent rise in mortgage rates. One bank economist in the Chicago region reported that several corporations were seeking financing to begin capital spending programs that had been postponed in the fourth quarter.
For New England, the survey said that retailers appeared to be emerging from the recession ahead of manufacturers, although the stores were uncertain whether their increased sales presaged a significant turnaround. The region reported weakness in its military production sector.
In the West, the survey found that economic conditions range from "persistent weakness in California to moderate growth in intermountain regions." Employment continued to fall in several sectors in that region: defense-related manufacturing, banking, law and government.

Dollar Mixed in a Slow Day; Gold Prices Continue to Fall

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in lethargic trading yesterday as investors adjusted their holdings before the release today of United States trade figures.
Gold, which is trading at its lowest levels in six years, continued to fall in nervous New York trading. Although some buyers were interested in gold at its current depressed price, they were hesitant to make major commitments because of fears the metal would remain weak, traders said. 
 Gold closed on the New York Commodity Exchange at $338.40 a troy ounce, down $1.70 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late price of $338.40, off $1.75.
In currency trading, dealers said they expected the dollar to remain sluggish. Investors were waiting for news that would give them an incentive to trade in either direction, they said.
Walter Simon of Bank Julius Baer & Company said traders were staking out positions before the Government's announcement today of merchandise trade figures for January.
Analysts said that transactions among other currencies dominated the markets yesterday.
The Japanese yen strengthened against all major currencies as traders waited for the Government in Tokyo to take steps to stimulate the stagnant Japanese economy. Among the anticipated moves is a drop in Japanese interest rates. The Japanese Government has indicated it will introduce measures to stimulate the economy.
Mr. Simon said there was also talk that the central bank of Malaysia dipped heavily into the market yesterday, buying yen and selling pounds and marks.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 132.30 Japanese yen, down from 132.80 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 133.20 yen from 133.32, and in London, it was quoted at 132.05 yen.
But the dollar was higher against the German mark in New York, closing at 1.6535, up from 1.6460 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6500 German marks from 1.6525.
The British pound also fell against the dollar in New York, slipping to $1.7280. from $1.7350 late Tuesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.7320 from $1.7315.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4965 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900; 5.6145 French francs, up from 5.5985; 1243.75 Italian lire, up from 1237.00, and 1.19425 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19315.

U.S. Issues Flat in Light Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed in light, listless trading yesterday.
Bond prices fell slightly early in the session, but recovered after a report on the economy compiled by regional Federal Reserve banks was released. 
 The banks reported some improvement in economic conditions, but said businesses were not adding workers to payrolls. The report emphasized that the pickup is free of inflationary pressures.
"The Fed keeps harping on the theme that inflation is not a threat," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
"And if inflation can be held at around 3 percent or so, and economic data for March and April are less robust than the February numbers, we may have seen the end of the rise in interest rates."
Michael Evans, the president of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm, said an informal poll of the firm's clients echoed the Fed's findings.
 
No Hiring Seen Yet
 "They are all saying the same thing," Mr. Evans said. "Business is a little bit better, but they aren't going to hire anybody. And until hiring picks up, we aren't going to see much of a recovery."
While the steady deterioration in prices of Treasury securities appears over for now, traders expect difficulty in coping with record auctions of two-year and five-year notes next week and say yields on short- to intermediate-term securities may increase.
The Treasury announced yesterday that it would sell $14.75 billion worth of two-year notes on March 24, and $10.25 billion of five-year notes the next day.
The size of both auctions was increased by $500 million from the amount sold by the Treasury last month.
In when-issued trading following the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.86 percent. The five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.07 percent.
 
Long Bond Is Unchanged
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 9930/32 , to yield 8.00 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 999/32 , down 2/32 , to yield 7.60 percent. And the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered at 9431/32 , up 1/32 , to yield 7.32 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.04 percent, the same rate as late Tuesday. And six-month bills were steady at a late-offered rate of 4.22 percent.
The highlight of activity in the tax-exempt municipal bond market was a negotiated sale of $717.59 million of general revenue bonds for the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.
The offering is the third in a series that is projected to raise $5.5 billion for the cleanup of Boston Harbor.
The issue consisted of callable and noncallable bonds, most with long-term maturities.
Yields on the securities range from 6.72 percent on noncallable bonds due in 2007 to a maximum yield of 6.97 percent on bonds maturing in 2021.
 
Strong Demand for Issue
 Demand for the securities was so strong that the size of the issue was increased from $675 million.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the corporate bond market, the Treasure Island Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of Steve Wynn's Mirage Resorts Inc., offered $300 million worth of first-mortgage bonds to investors in the high-yield junk bond market.
The 9 7/8 percent securities, which mature in 2000 and are noncallable for three years, were priced at $100, or par.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the transaction. The securities are rated Ba-2 by Moody's and BB by Standard & Poor's.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager for an offering of $300 million worth of 12-year notes for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.
The 8 1/8 percent notes were priced at $99.701 to yield 8.164 percent, 53 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-2 by Moody's and AA by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
And participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt securities said prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up an eighth of a point.

Attacks Planned in Newspaper-Phone Company Turf War

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The battle between telephone companies and newspapers heated up today, as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee vowed to introduce "comprehensive" legislation favoring the publishers, and the seven Bell companies prepared a bare-knuckled counterattack.
"There is now a window of time in which Congress can take action to establish competitive safeguards before they fall to the spreading chaos of deregulatory zeal," said Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas, the committee chairman. While refusing to spell out details, Mr. Brooks has made it clear in recent hearings that he strongly favors rolling back a recent court decision and continuing restrictions on the Bell companies' ability to offer information services, as well as to manufacture equipment or enter the long-distance business. 
 The newspaper industry is waging an aggressive lobbying campaign to keep telephone companies from owning services that would compete with their own offerings and drain advertising revenue. Newspaper publishers argue that the telephone companies will use their near-monopolies on local calling to compete unfairly.
 
 
Study Critical of Newspapers
 Executives of the Bell companies plan to punch back on Thursday with a study that they said would show that newspapers often used their own local monopolies to raise advertising rates above the inflation rate or faster than the rates for radio and television. The study will cite data from dozens of cities that the Bell companies argue are dominated by newspaper monopolies.
"This issue is not about journalism," said Janice Rylander, a spokeswoman for the Pacific Telesis Group. "It's not about the First Amendment. It's about advertising revenue.
"Newspapers have a monopoly on advertising in many cities, and where they don't have a monopoly, their rates go down."
Mr. Brooks's action makes it more likely that the House will adopt a measure that reinstates at least part of the ban on information services that was included in the antitrust settlement that broke up the old Bell System in 1984. That ban was reluctantly lifted in July by Judge Harold H. Greene of the United States District Court in Washington after a Federal appeals court ordered him to reconsider the issue.
 
 
White House Position
 But the ultimate prospects for such legislation are uncertain. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has been trying to draft legislation as well, and some lawmakers on that committee favor easing the restrictions while preserving "safeguards." The White House supports the elimination of restrictions on manufacturing and information services and would almost certainly veto a bill with stiff prohibitions.
Indeed, lobbyists for some of the Bell companies are quietly betting that the House will not complete action this year. Leaders on the House telecommunications subcommittee have tried for months to come up with a measure that had enough support to survive, but have yet to introduce a bill.
In support of continued restrictions on the "Baby Bell" companies, state regulators from New York, Pennsylvania and Minnesota testified that it was virtually impossible for either state utility commissions or the Federal Communications Commission to prevent the telephone companies from abusing their monopolies.
 
 
Nynex Case Is Cited
 "History is not on our side," said Willam J. Cowan, general counsel for the New York Public Service Commission. Mr. Cowan noted that his agency had carried out an exhaustive investigation of purchasing practices by the Nynex Corporation, which was eventually charged with buying equipment at inflated prices from a subsidiary, the Material Enterprises Company.
The state commission and the F.C.C. later charged that Nynex had rolled those costs into its rate base, which is used by regulators to decide the rates a telephone company can charge. In 1990, Nynex settled charges with the F.C.C. by agreeing to pay $1.4 million and accepting a one-year price rollback.
But New York officials think that the actual overcharges may have been much greater. Mr. Cowan argued that telephone companies will always find ways to evade the rules.
Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, the Minnesota Attorney General, added that there was no pressing need to lift the restrictions. "The markets are already healthy as it is," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Industry Begins to Rethink The Importance of Awards

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
As the contretemps over the Clio Awards continues, imperiling the advertising industry's best-known prize, there are indications that its problems are affecting not only other awards but the industry's predilection for measuring success by the statue.
Since June, when the Clios collapsed amid disrupted and canceled ceremonies, industry executives have been rethinking a belief that awards validate their work. 
 Yet attitudes will not be altered overnight. Yesterday, a day after Clio Enterprises Inc. filed for bankruptcy in New York, announcements were made concerning four other awards. And Ruth L. Ratny, an advertising trade publisher hoping to revive the Clios, said the filing would not disrupt her plans.
The most tangible evidence of a sea change in attitudes is the growing number of award competitions reporting declines in entries or extending their entry deadlines. For instance, entries received by the Magazine Publishers of America for its 1992 Stephen E. Kelly Award for creativity fell 25 percent from last year.
John Schenck, the association's vice president of promotion, ascribed the fall-off to "the Clio factor, that awful picture of everyone grabbing trophies off the table." His reference was to a memorable photograph on the front page of Adweek magazine last June that captured the chaos when executives rushed a stage to swipe Clio statues.
The fading of award fervor has coincided with the advertising industry's steep recession, which has dampened agencies' eagerness to spend extravagantly to enter scores of award competitions.
"The Clio debacle was found money," said Gerald M. Goldberg, president of the New York Festivals, a competition that presents awards in categories like print and broadcast advertising, "budgeted funds they didn't have to spend. Once that started, they said: 'This is a good cutback. Let's make some more.' "
While entries for the New York Festivals' print categories are higher than last year, he added, he expects radio entries to decline at least 25 percent.
Richard Kirshenbaum, executive creative director at Kirshenbaum & Bond in New York, described a deepening "resentment of awards that are considered just a money-making machine," an allusion to complaints that the Clios precipitously added categories to increase entry-fee income.
Still, he joined an advisory committee for the New Clios, as Ms. Ratny, editor and publisher of Screen magazine in Chicago, has dubbed her restoration effort.
"While I'd rather see awards that are more relevant and more supportive of the advertising community," Mr. Kirshenbaum said, "the industry has suffered. Anything that would be good for advertising now, I am supportive of."
Another committee member, Marcio M. Moreira, vice chairman and international chief creative officer at McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, expressed similar sentiments.
"Yes, the Clio got out of hand," he said, "and yes, it tried to cover too many categories."
He asserted that creative executives must "send a signal to advertisers that we are a responsible bunch of people, and we just don't have an artistic, hedonistic view."
"If we don't send that signal out, we'll fail," he added.
Even so, he said, "whether it is Ratny, or anybody who has a reputable background in this business, I would like the Clios to survive, because they have become a standard."
Ms. Ratny said yesterday that she would proceed with a planned production of a 1992 Clio ceremony on Sept. 14 in New York. As part of the bankruptcy filing, Wayne L. Deas, a financial adviser to Bill Evans, owner of Clio Enterprises, had sought to block her plans; Mr. Deas has disputed the contention by Ms. Ratny that a $10,000 payment she made last year to Mr. Evans bought her the Clio trademark.
Ms. Ratny is running advertisements in trade publications, created by Frankenberry, Laughlin & Constable Inc. in Milwaukee, that try to dispel concerns over Clio's fate. They humorously contrast the awards with George Armstrong Custer, Amelia Earhart and other historical figures who "never made it back."
Whether the industry will find the Clios a laughing matter is doubtful.
"What happened was so horrible and so messy, I don't know if they will ever redeem it," said John E. O'Toole, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
As for introducing other awards to fill any vacuum a Clio disappearance might create, he added, "I think maybe we have enough."

Idealism And Reality At Hormel

 BODY:
"American Dream" was shown as part of the 1990 New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 6, 1990. The film is at the Angelika Film Center, 611 Broadway, at Houston Street.
Barbara Kopple is well remembered as the director of "Harlan County, U.S.A.," her outstandingly fine and troubling 1977 documentary about a strike by coal miners against a power company in eastern Kentucky. Now, in her account of another walkout, this time by factory workers at the George A. Hormel Company meatpacking plant in Austin, Minn., Ms. Kopple has found and illustrated another American tragedy. 
 "American Dream," her devastating look at this strike and the profound damage it left behind, begins in the mid-1980's with a matter-of-fact look at meat processors at work. It's a dirty job, but in the town of Austin it was then also a good one, paying $10.69 an hour and providing steady employment. "American Dream" is about what happened to Austin when Hormel tried to roll back those wages to $8.25. Unlike "Harlan County, U.S.A.," which observed a more violent struggle that was simpler, "American Dream" is no David and Goliath story. The David here, Local P-9 of the meatpacking division of the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union, pits itself against two Goliaths and embarks on a suicide mission. Rebelling against both Hormel and its own international parent union, Local P-9 resisted the idea of lower wages. "The unions are getting their teeth kicked in," said Jim Guyette, the local's president. He was right.
"American Dream" begins with Ronald Reagan, since it sees his economic policies as the root of Austin's troubles. Early in the film, workers protesting the wage cut visit the home of a Hormel executive and are asked (by a wife speaking to them through a screen door), "Why do you stay if you aren't happy?" Corporate spokesmen cite "the welfare of the long-term future of the company" to counter the workers' demands. One of Local P-9's first moves, in response to such stonewalling, is to hire Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc., a one-man army whose specialty is turning media attention into a secret weapon.
Although Mr. Rogers is a colorful figure and his tactics have an element of mischief, "American Dream" is no "Roger and Me." Ms. Kopple spends much less time questioning the behavior of Hormel's management than she does studying the terrible predicament in which it places the workers. As the protest moves inevitably toward a strike, Local P-9 meets opposition from employers, its parent union and even inside its own ranks. "That'll destroy us quicker than anything will," one union member says.
Ms. Kopple's camera observes all of this at very close range, at the kitchen tables of those who are most painfully affected. When the prospect of a strike becomes inevitable, she films two brothers who are on different sides of the dispute and agree they will not speak again if one crosses the picket line. Once the strike is under way, with nonunion workers earning $10.25 an hour, she captures the misery and bewilderment of those on the picket line. "You see all these people you talk to every day, and it makes you want to cry," one picket says. Above all else, "American Dream" is about the destruction of Austin's ideals.
By the end of the film, the limb onto which P-9 has ventured has been sawed off. P-9's parent union has ousted the renegades and made its own settlement with Hormel, making no allowance for restoring jobs to those who honored the picket lines and agreeing on a $10.25 wage. It didn't take long, Ms. Kopple notes in a closing title, for Hormel to sublease the factory to a company that paid $6.50 an hour.
What hits home most powerfully in "American Dream" is the film maker's sense of how deep this damage ultimately runs. When the defeated strikers try to claim victory or when a woman tearfully packing her belongings insists, "We're not leaving, we're just taking our fight elsewhere," it's clear how crushing the full weight of this debacle will be.

HEADLINE: Union Rejects Pact for Buses And Subway

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
New York City bus and subway workers decisively rejected a new three-year contract yesterday, sending union leaders and transit officials back to the negotiating table and raising the possibility of work slowdowns and other disruptions by discontented transit workers.
By a ratio of nearly 2 to 1, members of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union turned down a tentative agreement that union leaders and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reached in January. The mail ballots, submitted over the last two weeks, were counted yesterday. 
 The local's president, Sonny Hall, said in a statement that he hoped to reopen negotiations. He said he would not rule out any options, but he also said that arbitration was not desirable and that a union walkout -- which is forbidden by state law -- was "the course of last resort."
 
'No More Money Available'
 Anonymous fliers distributed at a rally by dissident union members two weeks ago said workers should consider slowdowns and even a shutdown of the subway system during the Democratic National Convention in July if they did not obtain a more generous labor settlement.
The chairman of the transportation authority, Peter E. Stangl, said he was disappointed by the vote, and he indicated strongly that his agency would not increase its offer. He said a decline in ridership, a sharp drop in state operating subsidies and the city and state's financial distress had left the agency in a bind.
"The proposed agreement reflects the full measure of our ability to finance a labor settlement," Mr. Stangl said in a statement. "Simply put, there is no more money available."
"I will not sacrifice the quality or level of service or raise the fare again in order to meet unrealistic expectations," he added.
 
Setback for Hall
 The tentative agreement called for a raise of 4.5 percent this year and an additional 2 percent next year. The proposal also included a $1,000 payment to cover inflation since last May, when the previous contract expired.
Under the old contract, bus drivers are paid a base salary of $34,676 a year. They would have been paid $36,961 next year under the the proposed settlement. Pay for train operators would have risen to $39,325 from $36,894 and for conductors to $34,307 from $32,186..
The rejection was a clear setback for Mr. Hall, who was challenged aggressively on the contract by several dissident factions within the union that are unhappy with his leadership. It also reflected broad economic dissatisfaction among the union's rank-and-file.
Interviews with several dozen subway conductors, train operators and maintenance workers earlier this month indicated sweeping discontent with many provisions of the proposed contract and a general anger that the 32,000 unionized transit employees have been working without a contract since last May.
Opponents of the contract mounted two large protest rallies in the last month, each of which drew more than 1,000 transit workers.
But several leaders of the largest dissident union faction, called New Directions, discounted the chance of a transit shutdown. "No one wants a strike," said Cecile Clue, a subway conductor who is a member of New Directions and is also on the union local's executive board. "We're not saying strike. We can hurt them in other ways, but I can't discuss that right now."
 
Workers' Complaints
 When they reached the tentative pact in January, union leaders said it was the best they could get in a severe recession, particularly since transit officials had just approved a 10-cent fare increase and another fare increase remained a possibility this year. The Transit Authority, the subsidiary that runs the subway and buses, is still struggling to find city and state subsidies to balance its 1992 budget, even after the fare increase.
But transit workers said repeatedly in recent interviews that they thought their leaders could gain additional concessions and that the proposed raises were too small. They also said that the $1,000 payment did not constitute a raise, and that it was unacceptable because it would not have figured in their base salaries, in subsequent raises or in the calculation of their pension benefits.
The proposed contract also called for additional contributions by the Transit Authority to maintain the basic level of workers' medical benefits -- an area in which many unions have been forced to make concessions in recent years as health costs have skyrocketed.
But the tentative agreement would have required transit workers to begin paying $10 of the cost of each doctor's visit, and union members said in the interviews that they strongly opposed the provision.
Several dissident union members said yesterday that union leaders had also failed to obtain contract provisions that were important to them, like leave for fathers of newborns and measures guaranteeing alternative work assignments for pregnant women.
Under state law, the transportation authority is required to begin a new round of negotiations if Mr. Hall requests it. If no progress is made, either party could then seek a declaration of an impasse from the State Public Employment Relations Board. If the state board ruled that an impasse had been reached, the dispute would then go to arbitration.
"If they want to come in and negotiate a new contract that is going to cost us more, those negotiations are going to be very short," said Gary J. Dellaverson, the transportation authority's director of labor relations. "There is no more money available, end of discussion."
Mr. Hall, who did not respond to a request for an interview, said in his statement that the contract's rejection "represents a nationwide feeling of dissatisfaction among workers" who feel that they are bearing the burden of what he called mismanagement and misguided policies by the city, state and Federal governments.

HEADLINE: Rising Poverty Threatening Elite 'Projects'

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Evelyn McClendon practically beamed as she surveyed her meticulously neat two-bedroom apartment in the St. Mary's Park Houses in the South Bronx. She has lived there, in apartment 8A, since the day the project opened 34 years ago.
"People in New York hear the word 'projects' and they think rundown and nasty," she said recently. "But it's not that way here at St. Mary's. It's terrific and I've always enjoyed it. 
 "Until last night."
That night, several weeks ago, a man was shot to death in the stairwell just outside her apartment.
Mrs. McClendon's ambivalence reflects the two faces of New York's public housing, home to 590,000 people, more than the populations of Buffalo and Rochester combined.
Throughout its 58-year history, the New York City Housing Authority has provided stable homes for hundreds of thousands of working-class citizens, and its 325 projects have never suffered the same degree of blight, danger and hopelessness as projects in other big cities.
But as a new chairwoman, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, takes over the authority, the largest in the country, she confronts increasing complaints of crime and disrepair, compounded by the prevalence of drugs and aging housing. The authority is also under pressure to reduce a waiting list of 200,000, the largest ever.
"New York City has had a history of being at the forefront of public housing -- both in terms of its decision more than 50 years ago to build it, and it is the most professional and the best managed staff in the country," said Joseph B. Rose, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council. "But public housing throughout the country has been extremely hard-hit during these hard economic times."
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, a 39-year-old lawyer with extensive financial and housing experience, was sworn in to her job yesterday. She lived at the Twin Parks West project in the Bronx with her family from age 16 to 26.
 
Some Problems 'Intractable'
 "I know about elevators that don't work," she told a City Council committee recently. "I know delayed repairs. I know especially about the need for a secure and amenable place to live.
"Suffice it to say that New York City public housing has its troubles -- difficult, sometimes even intractable," she said. "But we also have the bragging rights to the best public housing program in America."
Unlike those in other cities, New York's projects -- ranging from small, two-story rehabilitated tenements to sprawling mini-cities of tall towers -- are almost always 100 percent occupied. Detroit, in contrast, has about a 44 percent vacancy rate. Empty apartments are an invitation to gangs and drug dealers, housing experts say.
The New York authority "has to my knowledge never abandoned or lost a unit of housing, unlike Newark or Chicago or St. Louis," said Peter Marcuse, a Columbia professor who is writing a book on the authority. "The waiting list still far exceeds the number of units available, and that's some indication of the way it is regarded in the community."
 
Economic Balance
 New York's public housing, always intended primarily for the working poor, differs from that of other cities in its demographics. The share of families on some form of public assistance is now 28 percent, a proportion that has been slowly but steadily increasing. But in other cities the rate is as high as 90 percent, said Joseph G. Schiff, an assistant secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. That means higher costs to the authorities for social programs and more Federal aid to support each apartment.
The authority works hard to maintain an economic balance among families on public assistance, working families with very low incomes and families with somewhat better incomes. The income limit for a family of four is $29,500 a year; the average income in 1991 was $12,173.
But because the Federal Government has required housing authorities to take in more and more people in greater need, like the homeless, the population of New York's public housing will become more dependent on the government, Mr. Schiff said.
 
Families Doubling Up
 One growing problem for the authority, which has a budget of $1.5 billion and 15,000 employees, is doubling up, largely because of a citywide lack of low-cost housing. Of 590,000 residents, the authority estimates that 130,000 are living illegally with relatives or friends.
That shortage has also kept families in the projects longer. Just over 4 percent of tenants move out each year, making the average wait for an apartment 8 to 10 years.
At the same time, crime and physical deterioration are eroding the projects' stability.
There are many projects where drug dealers have taken over entire stairwells, lobbies or elevators, where graffiti completely cover some walls and the elevators reek of urine.
Tenants tell of being mugged in elevators. Others complain about rodents, no hot water, walls mildewed from leaking pipes and elevators that constantly break down.
Tenants in the Edgemere Houses in Far Rockaway, Queens, recently went to Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's office, complaining that stoves and refrigerators in many apartments had broken but had not been replaced. Some families cannot keep food fresh, said Helene O'Brien of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, which brought the families together.
"Families are getting sick from spoiled milk and rotten meat," she said. Plaster is falling and pipes and roofs are leaking, she said.
 
Fear of Rising Crime
 Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for the authority, said records for 1991 show that all emergency complaints, like gas leaks or burst water pipes, were corrected or abated within 24 hours. Of nonemergency complaints -- they rose by 4.8 percent last year, to 2.1 million -- 1.6 percent went unattended for at least a month, but that number has been steadily dropping, Ms. Nathan said.
By far the most frequent complaint from tenants is about rising crime. Housing authority officials have long boasted that crime is lower in the projects than in the rest of the city, but statistics show it is increasing more quickly in the projects.
The number of murders in public housing has more than doubled in a decade, and the murder rate is now about the same as in the rest of the city. Last year, 200 people were killed in the projects and 944 random shootings were reported. In 1980, 89 people were killed.
Rosa Hunt, who has lived at Claremont Village Houses in the Bronx for 35 years, said fear defines the life of tenants in her project. Three bodies were found in the parking lot outside her building last summer, she said. It wasn't always like that, she said.
"That's when the Bronx was the Bronx," she said about the era three decades ago when Claremont Village was new. "It was nice then."
Now, she said, "you're afraid going out and you're afraid coming in."
Through her church, Mrs. Hunt has become involved in the Tenant Union for Public Housing, organized by the South Bronx Churches. So far, 12 projects have joined. The group plans to ask officials to assign armed security guards to every building.
 
The Scourge of Drugs
 The Housing Authority's own police force of 2,200 patrols the projects, but the officers themselves concede that the increase in drug-related crime is difficult to control.
Officer Eugene F. Madden and his partner, Officer Kenneth C. Finn, see it in the area they patrol in Brooklyn, which includes East New York and has one of the highest concentrations of projects and one of the highest rates of police calls.
One day recently, the two officers' 4 P.M.-to-midnight shift began with a call about a sniper shooting from the roof of the Louis H. Pink Houses on Linden Boulevard. A man and his young son were injured; the police never found the sniper.
"It's usually drug dealers who come up here to test their firearms," Officer Madden said, pointing to a heater pockmarked with bullet holes.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero knows that being landlord to one of every 12 New York City residents will not be easy.
 
Tenant Participation
 She said in a recent interview that she would make maintenance her top priority. She wants to set a deadline of 24 hours to fix broken front door locks, and is considering a policy for cleaning graffiti within a few hours.
"We can't 100 percent solve the security issue, because there are crime problems; there is a crack problem," she said. "We can't unilaterally solve those. But the maintenance issues are much more within our control. So that's why I've made that our primary focus."
That is not to say she is conceding some projects to drug dealers and other criminals. The authority is working with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration and has stepped up its own police patrols at about 40 different sites, she said.
But Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said that tenant participation was the most important factor in making any project more livable, and that she would work to encourage it "Without the tenants it can't work," she said. "That is the absolute prerequisite for turning around a project, because they are there every day."

HEADLINE: Improv, in Chapter 11 Protection, Is Still Joking

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
It is no laughing matter. The Improvisation on Manhattan's West 44th Street -- grandfather of comedy clubs and spawning ground for a virtual Hall of Fame of comics -- has filed for bankruptcy protection.
The 29-year-old club, a victim of the recession, will stay open for the time being. Seven comics and a master of ceremonies appeared last night. The schedule was full for every night this week, the manager, Errol Edwards, said yesterday. 
 The Improv's owner, Silver Friedman, could not be reached for comment. But in court documents filed on Tuesday, she said the club "operated profitably until losses were sustained because of the recession, causing the debtor to fall behind." Under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, the club is protected from its creditors as it tries to reorganize. It listed assets of $55,000 and liabilities of $270,043.
The Improv opened at 358 West 44th Street, at Ninth Avenue, on April 20, 1963, the first of a breed of clubs that let aspiring comics try their routines, and possibly fall on their faces, before a tough public.
 
Well-Known Survivors
 On a wall just inside the club's front door are photographs of some of the Improv's alumni, including Richard Pryor, Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams. "They all come through and become famous after starting here," Mr. Edwards said.
Among others who have played there over the years are David Brenner, Robert Klein, Steve Landesberg, Stiller and Meara, Professor Irwin Corey, Rodney Dangerfield, Jimmy Walker, the late Andy Kaufman and Richard Lewis.
Mr. Lewis once said that he began hanging out at the Improv "in 1973, long before every carpet store in America started having 'Remnant Comedy Riot Night.' " The actor Danny Aiello worked as a bouncer and Bette Midler was a waitress at the Improv.
The club was founded by Ms. Friedman's former husband, Budd. In 1973 Mr. Friedman moved to Los Angeles and established an Improv there. The Manhattan club has always been an informal place where where agents and other performers come to see who and what is new in the business.
And there have been impromptu comic jam sessions at the club, like the time Joe Piscopo and Gilbert Gottfried were suddenly joined onstage by Robin Williams, or when Stevie Wonder came up and, ignoring the piano, did 20 minutes of stand-up.

HEADLINE: WILLIAMSBRIDGE JOURNAL;
If Only, an Inventor Says, He Could Invent Capital

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Wilbert Murdock has struggled to market his inventions -- gadgets ranging from a computerized golf club that corrects mistakes in the swing to a motion analysis system that could help doctors and coaches provide better treatment for sports and other injuries.
Name a problem and the self-described "George Washington Carver of technology" will offer inventive suggestions to do the work faster and quicker. But his degrees in bioengineering and constant tinkering have yet to rig up a solution to his biggest hurdle -- lack of capital. 
 No stranger to necessity, you could call him the brother of invention.
"A lot of people don't like the way I look," said Mr. Murdock, neatly dressed in a conservatively cut blue suit. "The people I met in the investment community are not comfortable with my outer skin."
Mr. Murdock, who is black, is the chairman of Motiontronics for Science, a company he and several friends founded to develop and manufacture computer-based sports simulators and biomechanical analysis instruments that could be used for training and physical rehabilitation.
He left a job at a Veterans Administration hospital to devote himself full time to the venture, financing his research through temporary office work, investments from his parents and the support of his partners.
His single-minded pursuit has cost him his car and his apartment -- he lives with his mother in Williamsbridge, in the northeast Bronx -- and he frets that perhaps he has wasted 10 years of his life.
"I don't understand how we can give billions to the world, and I can't get anything," said Mr. Murdock, who is 34 years old. "Before I lost my father last year, he always repeated to me -- what's most important is the mission, the goal. Personal things mean little if you're trying to help your country."
Mr. Murdock said he and his company spent thousands of dollars to develop the Computerized Golf Master, which helps golfers perfect their swings to hit the "sweet spot" by using audible tones to tell them if they are hitting the ball too far outside or inside on the club.
A buyer at a major toy retailer who has seen the golf club said it was an "interesting" product with market potential. Other people familiar with both Mr. Murdock's inventions and his work as a student said they were impressed with his creativity and determination.
In describing his design approach, Mr. Murdock sounded almost Zen-like. "I became the golf ball," he said. "I designed the technology around the golf ball because it is the only variant that does not change. We had to make the golf club intelligent."
His interest in sports also led him to design a computerized shadow boxing system that uses sensors to tell sparring partners standing six feet apart when they have connected a punch.
He has patented a brace-like knee alignment device that detects stresses and strains. A similar interest in biomechanics led to the development of a motion analysis system that compares stored images of optimal physical performance with videotaped images of a person performing a similar series of physical movements. He said his system costs a third of those being currently used in hospitals.
All that matters little without financing, which is difficult to get for some high-tech medical devices, according to Joel Snyder, a member of the Motiontronics board of directors.
"Financial people feel the medical electronics field has a low return on income," said Mr. Snyder, who is also a professor of engineering and computer science at Polytechnic University, Mr. Murdock's alma mater.
In his quest for money, Mr. Murdock has deluged politicians and government officials with letters, but no money has come his way. He also shot back to a Japanese publication that had published an article denigrating the creativity and work habits of American minorities.
"I wrote to them that the only traits we have that are negative is our lack of access to economic opportunity," said Mr. Murdock.
Mr. Murdock says he would like to use his inventions to build a company that would employ urban youths and minorities.
"Without interesting them in technology, the technological race in this country is over," he said. "They are the work force of the future."
His latest brainstorm is a sports technology learning center where he would use his sports inventions to get young people interested in computers and innovation.
"It just takes a few things to turn this thing around, this kids killing kids," he said. "Nobody comes from nowhere. They need to know they fit into this society."
Typically, he does not have a penny to finance the venture, but he said he hoped to persuade computer manufacturers to donate equipment. If need be, he would go back to working at odd jobs to help raise funds.
"All we ever wanted was a chance," he said. "Not promises, just a real chance to build a real company."

HEADLINE: New Haven Is the Target of Inquiry

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, March 18

 BODY:
Federal investigators swooped down on this city's municipal offices this week, taking away boxes of documents that may figure in a fraud inquiry focusing on the rehabilitation of a rundown commercial area.
It is the third Federal investigation of a major Connecticut city's government in three years, and some here are wondering why the state seems suddenly to be a favorite target for United States attorneys. 
 "Until a couple of years ago, a Federal municipal government corruption investigation was unheard of," said Hugh Keefe, a New Haven lawyer who is defending the former Mayor of Waterbury, Joseph J. Santopietro, against Federal corruption charges in a trial in Bridgeport. Mr. Keefe also defended the former Mayor of Danbury, James E. Dyer, in a 1990 Federal corruption case in which Mr. Dyer was convicted of filing a false income-tax return, but acquitted of other tax charges as well as racketeering and extortion.
 
Cases Are a Priority
 An expert with the American Bar Association in Washington said the recent rash of Connecticut cases may reflect a particular emphasis by the United States Attorney, Albert S. Dabrowski, but it also shows that such cases are a priority for the Department of Justice.
"Connecticut has no monopoly on public corruption," said the expert, Tom Smith, the associate director of the association's criminal justice section. "There has been a Federal presence in prosecuting local political corruption for many years that has reached high levels and low levels."
In 1989, 1,349 public officials were indicted nationwide and 1,149 of them convicted, said Doug Tillett, a spokesman for the Justice Department. Each case "involved abuse of the public trust," he said.
Details remain sketchy in the New Haven case, since the United States Attorney's office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to comment on it. They are conducting the investigation along with the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
A subpoena served on Tuesday at City Hall demanded that officials turn over documents related to a business-relocation program that ran from 1987 to this year. Under the program, Federal money was used to help business owners move from the dilapidated Ninth Square neighborhood so that it could be rebuilt as a complex of apartments and stores.
The subpoena, dated March 12, also demands applications and requests made to the city for loans from the Small Business Administration and the Women and Minority Business and Development programs from January 1987 to December 1989. It also demands documents "relating in any way to services performed or offered to be performed" by a local company called Fucci Construction, also between January 1987 and December 1989.
 
Daniels Pledges His Help
 All documents requested predate the term of the current Mayor, John C. Daniels, who took office in 1990. Efforts today to reach his predecessor, Biagio DiLieto, who is also a former police chief here, were unsuccessful.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Mr. Daniels pledged his "continued cooperation" and added, "It is my sincere hope that this issue, as painful and difficult as it is, will be brought swiftly and equitably to a close."
Nancy A. Fucci, the owner of Fucci Construction, said, "I've been in contact with the U.S. Attorney's office and I've indicated that we're willing to cooperate in any way necessary to assist them in this investigation."
All work her 50-employee company did for the city, she said, was awarded because the company made the lowest bids. Most of the projects were for street improvements, such as installing benches and lights and replacing asphalt with brick paving.
John J. Sennett, a spokesman for the F.B.I. in New Haven, said, "No specific individual or individuals are being targeted in this investigation," and added, "we are only pursuing allegations of wrongdoing, and the investigation will take us where it takes us."
A state investigation of a similar city-financed program resulted in the arrests of 11 people last year. That program, known as the Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization Program, repaid people for up to $15,000 in renovation work on properties in designated neighborhoods around the city.
Investigators charged that it became riddled with false applications for reimbursement from people applying on behalf of properties they did not own or inflating claims of how much they spent on renovations.

HEADLINE: Not All Bounces Are Bad

 BODY:
The scandal at the House Bank is generating a storm of criticism out of proportion to the sins committed. Whatever sloppiness occurred -- and whatever shady acts may have been performed by a few -- the scandal threatens to tar unjustly the reputations of scores if not hundreds of representatives whose offenses appear minor.
Perks like the bank are galling because they reflect a self-indulgent legislature that is often sorely out of touch with the real world. But as voters ponder the overdrawn checks of their own representatives, they need to discriminate carefully between major abuses or even crimes, if there were any, and minor transgressions. 
 What most inflames the public is the spectacle of "privileged" Congressmen getting a benefit (free overdraft privileges) that is not available to the average person. The bank did its best to keep House members happy, providing yet another example of how many members live in a cocoon, insulated from the pressures that make life miserable for many constituents. That may help some legislators concentrate on their jobs; but others no doubt lose touch with real-life concerns.
In contrast to most banking scandals, this one does not appear to have victimized anybody financially. The House members were not guilty of writing "bad" checks that "bounced," leaving the recipients of the checks without payment. The House Bank honored nearly all the checks, even if the members did not have enough money in their accounts to cover them.
The accurate charge, then, is that many members "overdrew" their accounts without having to pay the high interest or service fees that ordinary mortals must pay for overdrafts. But no taxpayer funds were used to cover the overdrafts. Instead the House Bank used money from the accounts of other members, who were in effect making interest-free loans to their overdrawn colleagues. But it cost them nothing to do so because they were not earning any interest on their own accounts.
Many of those caught up in the scandal have offered persuasive defenses. Dick Cheney, now Defense Secretary, said he was dismayed to find he wrote at least 21 checks against insufficient funds while a Congressman from Wyoming. Mr. Cheney, who prides himself on paying bills promptly and avoiding purchases on credit, said he had no way of knowing of the overdrafts. Under the bank's haphazard administration he was never notified, and the bank routinely jiggered its monthly statements to show that accounts were in balance.
Even one of the worst offenders, Stephen Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, who wrote hundreds of overdraft checks over a 39-month period, may have done little more than treat his account as if it were an American Express card. As he explains it, he and his wife paid monthly expenses from the account, were informed by the bank when they were in overdraft and promptly, within a week or two, deposited enough money to cover the deficiency. They did not, he insists, use the bank to obtain a long-term interest-free loan that rolled over from month to month.
The House ethics committee found that 24 members, including Mr. Solarz, seriously abused their privileges, but has yet to release details. If there were cases of fraud, tax evasion or campaign finance violations, they should be prosecuted. And writing overdraft checks to invest elsewhere for personal gain might raise ethical questions.
But as voters feel their blood pressure rising in anger over the scandal, they need to measure the overdraft issue carefully. In choosing a legislator to handle issues ranging from the economy to education reform to world affairs and national defense, overdrafts will generally be a minor consideration.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
A New South Africa

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A political-science theory used to have it that no group holding absolute power in a modern society would ever give it up short of physical overthrow. Thus Jeane Kirkpatrick propounded that Communist totalitarianism in any country could not be ended by political means.
The theory was shattered as to Communism by the Gorbachev years and the fall of the Soviet Union. Now something just as dramatic has happened in South Africa: The whites who had absolute power in that society have voted to give it up. 
 This was not a mere decision to let a minority have civil rights, as in the American South 25 years ago. It was a decision to let the overwhelming majority, 80 percent of the population, have rights. The result must be power for that majority.
How did it happen? Why would a privileged minority -- very likely the most privileged in the world -- take such a step?
The broad answer is that politics worked: politics both local and international. The "armed struggle" by black resistance groups never made a dent in the power structure. Political pressure and political leadership persuaded whites that their own best interests lay in peaceful transition to a democratic South Africa.
Economic sanctions were much debated. But no one can really doubt, now, that they were effective in making businessmen and more and more white individuals in South Africa see that apartheid had no prosperity in its future.
Sanctions also produced a sense of isolation that bore heavily on many South Africans. So did the international sports boycott, which greatly troubled a sport-loving people.
There was a moral element. Along with international disapproval came increasing religious condemnation of apartheid, finally by the Afrikaners' own Dutch Reformed Church.
All those factors worked over time. But there is no saying when they would have changed the racial system if it had not been for the political daring and courage of F. W. de Klerk. In two and one-half years as President he has transformed the country, opening it up to free political debate for the first time and negotiating with the black leadership.
Mr. de Klerk's boldest stroke was the calling of a referendum among whites on whether to continue on his path of change. He risked all. With violence rising in the country, and with the economy in a prolonged recession, many observers thought the white public would be frightened of change and would at best give Mr. de Klerk a narrow victory.
But the conservative opposition offered no real alternative to the voters, no vision of a workable system of white power. It offered only fantasies of a separate white state or a return to apartheid and legal tyranny over the black majority.
Faced with that choice, most whites understood that non-racial democracy, though a gamble, gave them more hope than a return to racism and isolation. They had a realistic chance, at least, of keeping much of their good life. That was the calculation that led the British upper classes to enlarge the franchise in the 19th century, trading some political power for continued economic privilege.
The 69 percent yes vote for Mr. de Klerk should open the way to early agreement in the negotiations on an interim government of all races. The parties have already agreed on much: votes for all adults, a judicially enforceable bill of rights and an elected body of some kind to write a new constitution.
It would be fatuous to predict an easy transition for President de Klerk and his essential negotiating partner, Nelson Mandela. There are still enormous obstacles to a peaceful, functioning democracy in South Africa.
The huge gap between blacks and whites -- in income, property, education -- would stagger any social system. The expectations of younger blacks for quick economic benefits are dangerously high.
And then there is the violence. Growing evidence suggests that much of it has been inspired by Gatsha Buthelezi, the Zulu leader, to force concessions to him. But there is also evidence that elements in the state security forces have engaged in random violence against blacks, to obstruct change. A big question is whether Mr. de Klerk can and will stop that.
But the change to a new South Africa cannot now be stopped.

HEADLINE: Socialism Makes Everybody Equally Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I strongly disagree with Andrew Schotter in "Improve Capitalism. Use Some Socialism" (Op-Ed, Feb. 29). He calls for more socialism to deal with poverty and health care problems. Mr. Schotter gives us an excellent example of a mother of four, stating that "the economic battle for her is probably lost." 
 I think Mr. Schotter does not know what real poverty is. I lived for 35 years in Russia, where my next door neighbor was Anna Uskov, a mother of six children, who lost her husband in World War II. The family lived in a single room with a kitchen shared with four other tenants, no water supply and no bathroom.
Most of the time the kids were hungry, and they ran barefoot in the snow because their mother was unable to provide shoes for them. When the oldest daughter married, for years she slept with her husband and two small children in the same bed. There was no welfare for that family because the fathers of socialism Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels decreed, "If you do not work, you do not eat."
The streets of our suburb were infested by crime, yet all the children in my neighbor's family became good and decent citizens. The mother worked hard as a janitor, and in the most important corner of their tiny apartment hung a traditional Russian icon, the symbol of God. The love and strong belief in moral norms, not Government programs, gave them the key to success.
In no country in the world has socialism, even in small portions, made people happy. Not in Russia and not in Sweden, which has the highest rate of suicides in the world. Our problem is not that we don't have enough socialism; it is that we have too much of it.
The way socialism works is this: By distributing the wealth, it does not make all the people rich. It makes all the people poor.

HEADLINE: Socialism Makes Everybody Equally Poor;
Huge Inequities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Andrew Schotter (Op-Ed, Feb. 29) writes: "In a capitalist system, people are in effect paid according to how much society would lose if it were to do without their services." This is a myth perpetuated by ideologists of the right. That it is picked up and repeated by one who advocates government intervention to correct inequities that arise when markets allocate resources shows how successful those ideologists have been. 
 However, in our free market society there is no definite relationship between what people are paid and their contribution to social welfare. This becomes clear if we compare the earnings of a teacher or a police officer or a social worker or a research scientist with the $4.5 million that Lee Iacocca made as chairman of Chrysler Corporation, the $7.6 million earned by the 17-year-old tennis star Monica Seles, the $54 million that the New Kids on the Block took in for their music, Madonna's $24 million, the fabulous sums made from advertising or selling tobacco and alcohol or the millions won by people who pick the right numbers in lotteries.
Nor is there necessarily a relationship between how hard people work and their relative standard of living. Many people, for example, live better off returns from inherited assets than those who must depend on wages and salaries alone. Indeed, there is really no good moral justification for the extent of the wealth and income inequalities that exist in our country.
We have 60 families or individuals who have a net worth of $1 billion or more. If they hold their wealth in interest-bearing accounts, they will take home $50 million a year or $137,000 a day for doing nothing. At the other extreme are the more than 33.6 million people (13.5 per cent of the population) with almost no assets and annual incomes below the poverty line. Over the last 15 years the real income of these people has declined, while the real income of the rich has increased.
Yes, as Mr. Schotter and others point out, our capitalist system has made us one of the most productive countries in the world. We produce enough to provide every individual in the country with $22,000 worth of goods and services a year. And yet we do such a bad job of distributing that output that more than 33 million citizens, 40 percent of them children, live in families that lack adequate housing, good health care or many of the other goods and services that have been defined as necessities.
Therefore, as Mr. Schotter suggests, we need to do more to help the poor. But at the expense of this issue and other issues relating to the inequitable distribution of wealth and income in the United States, the Presidential candidates and the news media devote their attention to economic growth. Thus, everybody knows that the rate of growth of output in Japan is faster than here. But how many know that the income of the richest 20 percent of the population to the poorest 20 percent is 9 to 1 in our country but only 4 to 1 in Japan?
Until we do something about the inequalities reflected by this second set of statistics, no matter how fast the United States grows, we will always be behind.

HEADLINE: Japan Has Learned From Bypassed Giants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "How Economic Empires Are Born" (Op-Ed, Feb. 25), Jean Strouse finds in the relationship between the United States and Japan echoes of the economic confontation between Britain and the United States in the late 1800's. Writing of Andrew Carnegie's long-term view, she asks, "Sound familiar?" This question recalls a statement by John Maynard Keynes in his "General Theory": "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist." 
 The economist statesman whose theories are implicit in the article is Alexander Hamilton (1757-1804). In his "Report on Manufacturers" (1791), Hamilton states that the future of the American economy lay in the development of its industrial base. To that end he advocated its protection, an approach that has been derided: the fallacy of the infant industry argument.
Historical evidence suggests that Britain, America and now Japan have used this policy to their advantage at various times. Yes, this is familiar territory.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Primaries;
TSONGAS ABANDONS CAMPAIGN, LEAVING CLINTON A CLEAR PATH TOWARD SHOWDOWN WITH BUSH

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts withdrew from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination today, a decision that many in his party said all but insured the selection of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Mr. Tsongas announced his departure at a news conference in Boston, where he said his campaign did not have enough money to continue. His move leaves only former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California to compete with Mr. Clinton in the remaining primaries and caucuses in 21 states. 
 Without adequate money to win, Mr. Tsongas said, "the alternative was to play the role of spoiler."
 
'That Is Not Worthy'
 "That is not what I'm about," he continued. "That is not worthy. I did not survive my ordeals in order to be the agent of the re-election of George Bush." [Excerpts, page A14.]
Mr. Clinton is already close to the halfway mark in the number of delegates needed to win the nomination and has a 7-to-1 edge over Mr. Brown, who is running a maverick, anti-establishment campaign. Many Democrats said that barring an unexpected collapse by Mr. Clinton's campaign, it is difficult to see how Mr. Brown can overtake the Governor.
"It certainly brings it much closer to a conclusion," said Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman. "You could argue that it's theoretically possible for Jerry Brown to mount a come-from-behind challenge, but the math and the reality of Bill Clinton's momentum certainly work against him."
Mr. Brown, campaigning in Connecticut, vowed to stay in the Democratic race until the end and seemed to relish a head-to-head contest with the well-financed front-runner.
"It's not over, because this is not just a game of politicians," the former California Governor said in an interview on the Cable News Network. He said the "soul of the Democratic Party is up for grabs."
Mr. Clinton hailed Mr. Tsongas at a rally in Hartford tonight but was clearly focused on the general election, delivering fierce criticism of Mr. Bush.
"He's acting like he's been on Mars for the last three years and just dropped down and can't believe what a mess people made of things," the Governor said as he attacked economic burdens on the middle class.
At a news conference afterward, Mr. Clinton declared: "I don't want to give anyone the impression that the race is over. I'm going to do my best to wage a national campaign."
Mr. Tsongas, whose campaign soared with his victory in New Hampshire's primary just a month ago, stunned much of the political world with his decision.
He was the third Democrat to withdraw from the race in the last two weeks, following Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, as the rapid succession of primaries took a heavy toll on a field that was politically young, late to get started and always scrambling for money. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia dropped out of the race before even getting to the primaries.
Mr. Tsongas had lost heavily in the South last week and was widely seen as crippled by his losses in Tuesday's primaries in Michigan and Illinois. Still, he had been expected to fight on through next week's primary in Connecticut and the April 7 vote in New York.
But at his news conference, which was remarkably good-humored although tinged with regret, he said:
"The hard fact is that the nomination process requires resources, and last evening it was clear that we did not have the resources necessary to fight the media war in New York. We simply did not have the resources. I would have been defined by others, and have been unable to defend myself. Worse, my message, my message would have been wounded, and all that we worked for, for this past year, would have been put at risk."
And so, he said, he decided to abandon his campaign, bringing an end to what he described as "a hell of a ride."
Mr. Tsongas, who left the Senate in 1984 to battle cancer and underwent a successful bone marrow transplant more than five years ago, had cloaked his campaign throughout as an enterprise of serious moral purpose.
Many Democrats today hailed him for bringing a new focus on economics to the political debate. He had campaigned as the economic truthteller in the field -- "I'm no Santa Claus" was his rallying cry -- and urged such against-the-grain policies for the Democrats as a cut in the tax on capital gains to encourage investment, and a rejection of a tax cut for the middle class. Many of his positions, he asserted today, cost him political contributions.
Mr. Tsongas's supporters, who stuck with him through the long months of 1991 when many analysts viewed his campaign as a decidedly minor one, cheered today when he declared: "We stood for something. We stood for something."
 
Talk of Unity
 The former Senator said today that he was "suspending" his campaign, rather than officially withdrawing, a technicality that keeps many of his delegates from being automatically redistributed to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown. Mr. Tsongas said he was declining to endorse either of the candidates at this stage.
But the attitude among many party leaders today was that the race was winding down. Many said it was time for the party to begin turning its attention to the battle against Mr. Bush.
"I think we have the chance to bring the party together around the presumptive nominee as early as I've ever seen it," said Steven Grossman, the chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Phil Angelides, the chairman in California, said, "Today is really the day we start the general election campaign against George Bush."
Mr. Angelides and many other Democrats said Mr. Clinton needed to keep campaigning hard in the coming primaries to define himself for the fall election.
According to a compilation by The New York Times, Mr. Clinton had 991 delegates this week, while Mr. Brown had 143. It takes 2,145 delegates to secure the nomination. The Democratic rules allocate delegates on the basis of strict proportional representation -- rather than winner-take-all -- which means that it could still take considerable time for Mr. Clinton to attain the magic number. But those same rules make it harder for Mr. Brown to catch fire late, win some big states and overtake him.
"George Bush will secure his magic number before Bill Clinton, but it seems inevitable that both of them will reach their magic number, sooner rather than later," said Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker.
 
A 'Dangerous' Brown
 Still, Mr. Hart and many other Democrats caution that Mr. Clinton still has a race to run, against an opponent who delights in flouting the conventions of politics. "Jerry Brown is going to be extremely dangerous," Mr. Hart said, "because in essence he's going to be the Che Guevara of the 1992 Presidential election. He'll go anywhere and fight with any tools available."
In Michigan, where he knocked Mr. Tsongas out of second place, Mr. Brown showed he could court disaffected labor. John A. Marino, the Democratic state chairman in New York, said Mr. Brown's appeal to labor, coupled with the fact that he is now the only choice for the anti-Clinton vote, would make Mr. Brown a serious factor in the New York primary.
"I think Brown gives him a run in New York if Brown spends time in New York," Mr. Marino said.
Moreover, Mr. Brown has shown a willingness to push hard on the "character issues" that have dogged Mr. Clinton, most recently questions about his wife's partnership in a law firm doing business with the State of Arkansas.
Mr. Brown, the party chairman, seemed to be trying to send a warning today to Mr. Clinton's sole remaining challenger. "Jerry Brown is a former Governor, a former state party chairman, and this is his third run for the White House," he said. "I hope and I expect that he is as anxious to beat George Bush as I am. I would hope and trust that would cause him to focus on the issues."
But the former California Governor has based his campaign on attacks against career politicians and the way they do business. In Connecticut today he asserted: "If you feel things are more or less O.K., that's Bill Clinton. If you feel this country is decidely on the wrong track, this is your campaign."
Mr. Clinton spoke with Mr. Tsongas by telephone this morning, soon after learning of the former Senator's withdrawal, said George Stephanopoulos, the Clinton deputy campaign manager. "Clinton was a little overwhelmed by the news," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Mr. Clinton still has considerable work to do, not least of which is courting New York, an important part of any Democratic coalition.
Many Democrats, including many committed to Mr. Clinton, took pains today to praise Mr. Tsongas, who entered the race almost a year ago, when Mr. Bush was near 90 percent in the public opinion polls and when the silence on the Democratic Presidential front was deafening.
"When other people looked at the polls, Paul Tsongas looked at what needed to be done for the country," Mr. Angelides said.
Mr. Tsongas's message of bitter economic medicine played well among educated, affluent suburbanites, but seemed to fall flat among core Democratic constituencies like blacks and labor. Still, he said today that he believed he had helped alter the debate. And in the end, he added, he sat down Wednesday night and made the kind of hard choices he believes the nation needs to make.
"This is not a day for regrets," he said this afternoon.

HEADLINE: Warmest Winter Slips (on Ice) Into History

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Winter, or what there was of it, ended this morning at 3:48 A.M. Eastern time. The National Weather Service is counting this winter as the warmest in the 97 years records have been kept.
Nationwide the average temperature from December through February (the Weather Service's "winter," for record-keeping purposes) was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, but that hid large variations. Eastern Montana was 11 degrees above normal; Chicago was 6 degrees above normal. Major Northeast cities recorded temperatures 2 degrees above normal. 
 But the weather statisticians could tell without looking at the numbers. "I didn't put on my long underwear this year," said Dr. David R. Rodenhuis, director of the National Weather Service's climate analysis center in Camp Springs, Md., near Washington.
Some public officials and people worried about the environment fear that rather than just talking about the weather, people are doing something to it, releasing pollutants that are changing the global climate. But scientists remain skeptical that a single North American winter, or even the string of warm years since the late 1980's, is evidence of a long-term global trend.
Still, said Dr. John W. Firor, a specialist in the greenhouse effect at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., "their resolution to be skeptical" had been weakened."
As if to demonstrate the variability of nature, the last full day of winter produced snow across a broad band of the Northeast, in some cases the only major snowfall of the season. In fact, the last few days of winter came with a blast of cold air, a phenomenon that Natural Gas Intelligence, a weekly newsletter, called "Indian Winter." It said the weather arrived "as if to tease producers about what might have been." Gas is the largest winter heating fuel, and this was the second year in a row of low gas use.
"We had a normal winter about three years ago," C. J. Silas, president of Phillips Petroleum, said with a nostalgic glow, referring to an extended cold stretch in December 1989. "It was cold for three weeks. We used to have a month or two of that."
Mr. Silas, who is chairman of the oil and gas industry's main trade association, the American Petroleum Institute, said his industry did not know what was going on. "We haven't found a consultant to explain it," he said. "We could go to church, maybe, and talk to them."
In Glasgow, Mont., where it was 11 degrees warmer than normal, there were few regrets. "It's been a beautiful winter," said Nancy Runningen, the office manager in the city water department. "Right now there is no snow, my tulips are up and sticking their noses out, and I've seen a few robins."
 
Need for Rain
 She recalled one winter when the temperature stayed below zero for 78 straight days; this year, the temperature climbed above zero almost every day, she said. But the temperature was not the most important oddity of this year, she said. Local farmers and ranchers will miss the moisture if it does not rain soon, she said. Along with Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Wyoming experienced one of the five driest winters in the last 97 years.
Around the United States, the only areas where temperatures were not above normal were parts of western Maine, the central Rockies and northern and western Alaska, according to the climate analysis center.
The Government figures, for the sake of simplicity, count winter as running from Dec. 1 until the end of February, although astronomically winter runs from late December through late March, when the sun crosses the Equator in the vernal equinox.
While North America was warm again, the North Atlantic was colder, and so was North Africa. Jerusalem had more than a foot of snow, and Cyprus had its first snow in 40 years. Athens, Beirut and Shanghai, where it rarely snows, all had snow this winter.
Siberia and Eastern Europe were also warmer than normal, according to meteorologists.
A short-term explanation of the weather may be the existence this year of El Nino, a current in the Pacific Ocean that flows toward South America, and is generally correlated with warmer weather in the midwestern United States.
Drawing a global picture is difficult, said Dr. Firor, and generalizing from the experience here is risky. "The U.S. is in the neighborhood of 6 percent of the globe," he said. "We don't amount to a hill of beans in the grand average." Another problem is that while temperature in this country is recorded on 10,000 thermometers, the South Atlantic, which is an area almost as large, has 2. "We've got a real problem with the data set," he said.
"I am a firm believer that the world is in deep trouble," he said. "We are going to have a climate change that is too rapid for easy adaptation." But the data are not adequate to support that, he said.
Dr. Rodenhuis said that the calendar year 1991 was the second-warmest year on record, considering air temperature over land around the world. The warmest was 1990. Globally, he said, 7 of the past 10 calendar years were warmer than average, which he said was not proof of global warming, "but part of the growing evidence."
Daniel H. Graf, a meteorologist at the Weather Communications Group at Penn State University, said: "The major climate events are cast in terms of tens of thousands of years. We have a record of 97 years that we work with here in the U.S. "You would figure that every 100 years you would have an unusual group of years. It's hard to say if that's really something bizarre. If you were to have 1,000 years of records, you'd see a lot of strange things."
Is it global climate change? "We don't have proof," he said. "We have some concerns."
Though the causes of the recent warm winters in this country may be in doubt, there is little doubt about the effects on energy suppliers. Warm winters meant lower heating bills for almost everyone. Nationally, the demand for heat was down about 10 percent this heating season compared with normal demand, according to Weather Service statistics. On the West Coast, it was nearly 14 percent lower than normal. The south Atlantic area was 11.5 percent warmer than usual and the mid-Atlantic region was 10 percent warmer.
This is of most importance to gas producers, because gas heats more than half the nation's homes. Electricity has the second-largest share, followed by oil, but oil companies say that because most oil is used in transportation, mild winters do not have a major effect on oil prices. But gas prices are at their lowest in 10 years.
The gas industry has numerous problems, said Theodore Eck, an economist at Amoco, which holds extensive gas properties, and warm weather is simply adding to the problems. But, he vowed, "We will have winter, one of these years."
Another gas expert, Robert A. Hefner 3d of the GHK Company, of Oklahoma City, a gas producer, said: "Nature is fickle. You'll have some good ones and some bad ones." But the experience of the last few years, he said, was that "we can't live for the next cold winter." Gas companies will have to cut overhead to survive, he said, and to seek regulatory changes.

HEADLINE: INVESTIGATORS SAY U.S. SHIELDED IRAQIS FROM BANK INQUIRY

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Enmeshed in a doomed courtship with Saddam Hussein, the Bush Administration in 1989 and 1990 repeatedly frustrated its own criminal investigators and regulators examining Iraq's role in a multibillion-dollar bank fraud scheme in Atlanta, interviews and internal Government documents say.
Government investigators involved in the case said they were blocked by the State Department from traveling overseas to interview key witnesses and suspects. 
 Additionally, the State Department discouraged prosecutors from filing criminal charges against a Jordanian shipper with extensive political and diplomatic connections, and against the Central Bank of Iraq, Justice Department and State Department documents show.
 
Fierce Government Debate
 Interviews with regulators and investigators, and a review of remarkably revealing internal records describe a fierce debate among Government agencies, and offer evidence of how seriously the Administration pursued its goal of courting the Iraqis to counterbalance Iran in the region.
On Feb. 28, 1991, the day after President Bush ordered a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war with Iraq, Dick Thornburgh, then the Attorney General, announced indictments against Iraqi officials and former executives of the Atlanta branch of a state-controlled Italian bank, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, also known as Bank Lavoro.
The investigation, said Mr. Thornburgh, had exposed "an international white-collar crime scheme with dire global consequences" -- a scheme that has so far resulted in guilty pleas by some former bank officials who admitted making illegal loans to Iraq.
What Mr. Thornburgh did not say was that prosecutors actually sought an indictment more than a year earlier, and that in 1989 and 1990 the Justice Department asked Federal Reserve Bank officials in Washington and New York to delay regulatory action.
Indeed, the Government's handling of the Iraqis was so delicate that in March 1990, prosecutors deprived of any other means of interviewing key targets were reduced to inviting Iraqi suspects to fly to the United States, all expenses paid, to be interrogated.
The Iraqis did not show up.
Government investigators and regulators say that in late 1989, once it became clear that high-level Iraqis were involved in the $4 billion bank fraud, they tried unsuccessfully to persuade the Agriculture and State departments to deny guarantees for $500 million in loans to the Iraqi Government. The agencies ignored their entreaties and approved the loan guarantees, and the United States Government is now liable for much of that money because the Iraqis defaulted.
Robert L. Barr Jr., the former United States Attorney in Atlanta who oversaw the early stages of the investigation, would not discuss specifics of the inquiry. But he acknowledged that in the Bank Lavoro case considerations of foreign policy had become entwined with those of law enforcement.
Mr. Barr, a prominent Atlanta Republican, said that the State Department had become involved early on, and that the case "became complex both legally and because of foreign policy concerns."
Asked about the accounts of investigators who said in interviews that they had become increasingly frustrated with the State Department's role, he said, "As a hypothetical matter, and I'm not talking about this scenario, certainly in any case when you have a good case and there are policy matters, the delay can be frustrating."
Lawrence Urgenson, now the Acting Deputy Associate Attorney General, said foreign policy considerations had played no role in the investigation.
 
Scheduling Problems Blamed
 Mr. Urgenson said that if any trips were prohibited scheduling problems were the reason.
Colin Cleary, a spokesman for the State Department, issued a brief statement today asserting that the Justice Department had consulted with the State Department because the Bank Lavoro case "focused upon senior officials of the Iraqi Government." He said State supported Justice's indictment, but, along with other agencies, including the Department of Defense, opposed the indictment of the Central Bank of Iraq because it might set a bad legal precedent.
After the war with Iraq, the Government accused two former Bank Lavoro executives of conspiring with Iraqi officials to illegally arrange more than $4 billion in unauthorized loans and export credits to Iraq.
The 347-count indictment charges that executives of the bank in Atlanta defrauded the parent bank in Rome by arranging loans for Iraq without its knowledge. Prosecutors assert that some of the bank executives received hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from merchants seeking to sell goods to Iraq, goods the war-ravaged nation would have been unable to buy without huge infusions of cash.
At the time the illegal scheme took place, between 1985 and 1989, the United States was trying to build ties to Iraq. After the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, the United States began helping Iraq rebuild its economy.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat whose banking subcommittee has reviewed many internal State Department documents related to Bank Lavoro, said the war with Iraq illustrated how the Government's earlier policy was "dead wrong."
The case began in earnest on Aug. 4, 1989, when the agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and officials of the Federal Reserve, acting on a tip, raided the bank's Atlanta office and seized thousands of pages of records.
After the raid, the Government shut down the Atlanta branch of Bank Lavoro, one of Italy's largest banks.
Almost immediately, the case attracted the attention of intelligence and diplomatic officials.
"The loss of B.N.L. financing and, more important, any reduction in U.S. agricultural credit guarantees because of negative publicity about the scandal probably would damage U.S.-Iraqi commercial ties," the C.I.A.'s Directorate of Intelligence wrote in an memo dated Nov. 6, 1989.
In May 1990, the American Embassy in Baghdad, concerned that the Agriculture Department was considering removing Iraq from the loan-guarantee program, weighed in with a cable arguing that "from a foreign policy perspective," this would be a mistake.
The documents seized in the August raid provided evidence so clear-cut that Mr. Barr proposed returning an indictment by October 1989, internal records show. That date passed, and on Jan. 9, 1990, in a letter to the Federal Reserve Bank, Mr. Barr referred to the "anticipated indictment early next month."
In a series of interviews, law enforcement officials and lawyers involved in the case, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said that in late 1989 or early 1990, the Government actually wrote an indictment, though it was not presented to a grand jury. These officials said the indictment was passed along to Justice Department officials in Washington, and that they do not know what came of it. Mr. Urgenson said the Justice Department would not discuss the indictment.
The officials said that during this period they sought the State Department's permission to visit Turkey and Iraq to interview key conspirators. They said Mr. Barr's office told them they could not make these trips.
They also said they were rebuffed in their requests to interview a Jordanian businessman, Wafai Dajani, whose brother is a former Jordanian Cabinet minister.
Mr. Dajani was listed in court documents in Atlanta as an unindicted co-conspirator. Gale McKenzie, the Assistant United States Attorney in charge of the case, said Mr. Dajani remained a target of the inquiry.
In a telephone interview from London, Mr. Dajani said he had never been contacted by investigators or regulators.
On March 26, 1990, the investigators in Atlanta, now anxious, came up with a highly unusual plan to interview the Iraqis whom they suspected of helping to plan the scheme.
At their request, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Michael Young, then Deputy Legal Adviser for the State Department, asking for permission to fly the Iraqi suspects in for interviews.
According to the letter, the Government would assure the Iraqis that they would not be charged while in this country and that the Government would pay for their travel.
In late February 1991, shortly before the allied victory in the Persian Gulf war, the State Department expressed reservations about the indictment being drafted by Atlanta prosecutors.
The memos quoted Justice Department officials as saying it was important to indict the Central Bank of Iraq, because it had over $1 billion in American assets that could be seized for fines. According to the memo, the prosecutors in Atlanta were particularly adamant that indicting the Central Bank was important. The State Department objected, arguing that the Central Bank was like a government agency, and that its indictment would set a bad legal precedent.
The State Department's memo, addressed to Robert Kimmitt, then Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, did not strongly object to indicting individuals. But it warned of problems, particularly with Mr. Dajani.
Mr. Dajani is a powerful figure in Jordan, and his brother, it pointed out, "is a former Minister of the Interior, and Wafai himself is considered well connected to the King and to U.S. grain exporters." It continued, "His indictment would be seen as a further U.S. attempt to 'punish' Jordan" for its support of Iraq.
Neither the Central Bank nor Mr. Dajani were in the indictment, which was returned within a few days of the internal memo.

HEADLINE: Haiti Accord Is Set Back in Parliament

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, March 19

 BODY:
Diplomats said today that their effort to win a reversal of the military coup that ousted Haiti's elected President in September had all but collapsed after Parliament failed to ratify an internationally brokered settlement.
The assessment emerged after a raucous parliamentary session on Wednesday in which conservative lawmakers seemed to deliberately torpedo the accord, which was reached after months of painstaking negotiations. 
 Diplomats and Haitians agreed that those lawmakers now appeared categorically opposed to the accord, which would have provided for the return of the deposed leader, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
After repeated procedural delays, the scheduled vote on Wednesday had been anticipated as a moment of truth in which Haitian legislators, weary of the economic misery resulting from sanctions imposed after the coup, would vote to dismiss the country's provisional leadership and recognize Father Aristide's legitimacy.
 
Shoving, Shouting and Guns
 What unfolded instead was a tumultuous session that diplomats said had all of the subtlety of a professional wrestling exhibition. After four hours of shouting, shoving and brandishing guns on the assembly floor, several conservative members abruptly walked out of the House of Deputies after an apparent dispute between close allies.
The protest deprived the legislature of a quorum and allowed the conservative president of the assembly, Dejean Belizaire, to end the session, all but killing any chance of ratifying the settlement anytime soon.
"We have had enough of this nonstop debate over the return or non-return of Aristide," said Senator Thomas Eddy Dupiton, a conservative who joined the walkout. "We have work to do."
Asked if the disruption had been deliberate, one angry and flustered Western diplomat said it apparently "was right on cue."
"I guess you have a group of people in the executive and certain politicians who are still looking to get theirs," the diplomat said. The diplomat was referring to allegations by politicians that a number of conservative lawmakers were receiving payoffs from the army in exchange for opposing any agreement on Father Aristide's return.
 
'Shock to the System'
 Officials of the Organization of American States were even more dejected, having acted for months as a tenuous bridge between this country's bitterest enemies in the hope of reaching a settlement.
"This latest delay has really been a shock to the system," a senior official with the organization in Washington said by telephone. "Up until now, our people had believed this agreement was going to be approved. A few still do, but the prevailing feeling around here is that we are heading instead toward a major crisis.
"We are thinking again of moving to the punitive mode," the official said, referring to a long-delayed move by the regional organization to freeze bank accounts and cancel visas of supporters of the military coup.
Diplomats noted that the proposed settlement had been reached only with great difficulty. It calls for the creation of a broad coalition government headed by a Prime Minister who is a longstanding rival of Father Aristide and sets no timetable for his return.
Drafting a new agreement or amending the current one to demand further concessions from Father Aristide would be impossible, they said.
Father Aristide, who governed Haiti for eight months after winning the country's first democratically elections, was ousted on Sept. 30 in a violent coup organized by the army. He has since been living in exile in Venezuela.
Aside from doubts about the sincerity of many of Haiti's civilian politicians, many diplomats now suspect that Haiti's military leadership "is at least two-faced," the O.A.S. official said. He said army leaders had privately indicated that they would support the accord.
Thousands of Haitians have fled the country in rickety boats since the coup, citing economic misery and violent repression by the military.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Suddenly, the Choices Are Clearer

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
With the abrupt withdrawal of Paul E. Tsongas from the contest for the Democratic nomination, the likely shape of the 1992 Presidential race has suddenly come into sharper focus. A long, fierce and possibly close fight is in prospect between President Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Election Day is more than seven months away, but a few things can be said with confidence. 
 It will be a fight between a self-described agent of "fundamental change" and a longtime champion of the status quo, a fight between an older generation (Mr. Bush is 67 years old and fought in World War II) and a new one (Mr. Clinton is 45 and graduated from college in the year of the big Tet offensive in Vietnam).
It will also be a fight between two men who have spent almost their whole adult lives in politics. Mr. Clinton calls himself an outsider, but he is as much a part of the Democratic establishment as Mr. Bush is a member of the Republican hierarchy.
Not for 50 years, what's more, have the habitually fractious Democrats settled so early on their nominee. Not since John F. Kennedy was chosen in 1960 have they done so with so little bad feeling and so few overt concessions to special-interest groups of the kind that then hurt them in the fall.
Perhaps the oldest of political maxims holds that elections are won or lost in the middle, not on the extremes, and Mr. Clinton seems positioned to challenge Mr. Bush on that ground, as Jimmy Carter successfully challenged Gerald R. Ford in 1976, the last time the Democrats won the White House.
Mr. Carter, a moderate Southerner without Washington experience, like Mr. Clinton, ran against a wounded Republican incumbent, like Mr. Bush, although the opprobrium of having pardoned Richard M. Nixon was small potatoes compared with Mr. Bush's economic woes, which have driven his overall approval rating down to 40 percent.
 
Character Issue
 The Arkansas Governor remains vulnerable, of course, to fresh accusations about his private life, of the kind that have plagued him for months, and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, his sole remaining Democratic rival, intends to keep pressing his attacks on the man he calls the "scandal a week" candidate. The White House is expected to take up where Mr. Brown eventually leaves off.
"We've been keeping track this winter," said a Bush campaign official who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, "and you can rest assured that we will be exploring the nature of Mr. Clinton's character."
Political prognostication is a mug's game in the best of times. Few will attempt it with conviction this year, when bitter, frustrated voters have turned vindictively upon a President they lionized a few months ago.
Still, because of Mr. Bush's lack of popularity, the broad appeal to the traditional Democratic constituencies that Mr. Clinton has demonstrated in the primaries, and the political moxie the Governor demonstrated in holding his campaign together when he was under constant attack, he is widely considered in both parties to be the Democrats' strongest candidate since the Vietnam era.
If -- always that "if" -- if he does not self-destruct.
There are other "ifs" as well. If the economy bounces back, as some statistics published on Wednesday suggested it might be doing, and if it does so in a way that becomes palpable to the voters, the advantages that typically accrue to a President seeking re-election should reassert themselves.
 
Liability of Incumbency
 Among those, the capacity to focus the nation's attention is primary; the mere arrival of a President and his big red, white and blue airplane are enough to dominate the news in most cities and states. In a communications era, the power to command audiences is very serious political magic.
If, on the other hand, Mr. Bush allows himself to be defined as "the incumbent in chief" in a year when incumbents as powerful as Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, have to fight for their political lives, the trappings, powers and perquisites of high office could turn out to unexpected liabilities.
The key for Mr. Bush, said Ed Rollins, a White House political director under Ronald Reagan, is "not asking people whether they are better off than they were four years ago, but telling them where they are going, explaining what you want the Bush Administration to be remembered for in the history books and not just trying to get your ticket punched again."
So far, he said, not only has the White House not developed a plan of action for the next four years, it has not begun to think about one.
For Mr. Clinton, said Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic National Committee, the key is making himself better known to the hundreds of thousands of Democrats and independents who still do not know much about him or his ideas.
 
Needing More Exposure
 "We're trying to invent a new generation of Democratic leadership," Mr. Tully said. "None of our guys had ever run for national office before, so Clinton is still a stick figure to a lot of people, a cartoon figure who's a bit better defined for a lot more and a fully rounded person only in the states where he's run."
In that sense, Mr. Clinton could be hurt if there is no full-fledged Democratic contest in big states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and California. In New York, where the primary is scheduled for April 7, John A. Marino, the Democratic state chairman, said Mr. Clinton should go all out for the next three weeks as a means of introducing himself to a potentially pivotal state.
"He's got to talk about gun control, the homeless, crime and rebuilding the cities," Mr. Marino said. "He needs to spend time in the suburbs. He needs to forget about rallies and visit drug rehabilitation centers and homeless shelters and learn about our problems firsthand."
A New York Times/CBS News survey that ended on March 1 showed Mr. Clinton trailing Mr. Bush, 50 percent to 40 percent, with the rest saying they did not plan to vote or had no opinion. But that was before the Arkansan's impressive string of victories on March 3, on Super Tuesday and this week, and subsequent polls in major states like Illinois have shown Mr. Clinton leading in such trial heats.
 
Factor of Independents
 Mr. Bush's ability to attract independent voters and to hold on to the Democrats who crossed over to support him in 1988 will be major factors.
In the voting on Tuesday in Michigan and Illinois, the omens were not favorable for the President. Exit polls in both states showed about 4 of 10 Democrats or independents who backed Mr. Bush in 1988 voted for Mr. Clinton this time. Over all, 685,000 independents voted in the primary in Illinois this year, and 71 percent asked for Democratic ballots; in Michigan, of 292,000 independent primary voters, 64 percent cast Democratic ballots.
Those figures shed no light, of course, on the predilections of independents who skipped the primary, and they may be skewed because of more interesting local races this year on the Democratic side of things.
Republican and academic theorists have speculated for years about whether the Republican Party has developed an "Electoral College lock," in which geopolitical trends have made it all but impossible for the Democrats to recapture the White House. They have won only once in six elections.
But this year, both Republican and Democratic strategists believe the supposed lock could be picked. One reason is Mr. Clinton's Southern roots, which may give him a chance in a few Southern states and most of the border states, like Maryland, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Missouri, although his prospects are poor in Florida and not a great deal better in Texas.
 
Belt of Industrial States
 All through the West, from the Plains States to the Pacific, Democratic strength has been improving. Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, did 10 percent better nationally than Walter S. Mondale, the 1984 nominee, but Mr. Mondale did 22 percent better in the Western region.
California, the biggest prize in the region and the nation with 54 electoral votes, is leaning heavily Democratic at the moment and would give Mr. Clinton a huge boost.
The election could then be won or lost by the Democrats in the belt of industrial states stretching from Wisconsin through Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York, where American elections, more often than not, have been decided since the 19th century. At the moment, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York all look winnable for Mr. Clinton.
"But they shouldn't be worrying about that now, or about attacking each other," said Mr. Rollins. "It's not Labor Day. The public doesn't want circuses yet. It wants ideas, solutions, ways out of this mess."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut;
Protest Vote Looms in State Once Vital to Tsongas

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 19

 BODY:
Paul E. Tsongas had a hard time firing up his ambling race for the Presidency. In Connecticut, at least, he may have an even tougher time shutting it down.
"As far as we are concerned, the Tsongas for President campaign is alive and well and it will go forward," said Tom Sullivan, Mr. Tsongas's state campaign director. He met today with nearly three dozen volunteers -- all of whom said they would continue to support the man who is no longer running. Mr. Sullivan said he had no desire to cancel a Tsongas fund-raising event scheduled for Saturday here. And next Tuesday, when the state's unhappy voters go to the polls, Mr. Tsongas, whose name will still be on the ballot, may be the recipient of a lively last rite, a protest vote he may not have received if he had not withdrawn today from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
 
Seeking the Outrage Vote
 It is too early to gauge the impact of Mr. Tsongas's withdrawal here, in part because the Connecticut primary seemed irrelevant a week ago, when the former Senator from Massachusetts was expected to win, and truly important on Wednesday, when it looked as if Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas was closing in and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California appeared ready to challenge Mr. Tsongas for the outrage vote. 
 Now it may again become irrelevant. But Connecticut, with its high unemployment rate and its troubled major cities, has plenty of rage stored up. So the vote next Tuesday may say more about the psyche of angry voters than it does about those who are seeking their votes.
"People here know when they are being lied to," said Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a former Republican who was elected as an independent in 1990. "I think they would have respected what Paul had to say. He is a decent and honorable man."
Mr. Weicker, who last year introduced the state's first income tax, an act that has brought him the most consistently abysmal ratings in public opinion polls in the state's history, said he was not endorsing any candidate. But he added: "Nobody called. My polls are not of such a distinguished height that it would lead a politician to seek to associate himself with me."
The race in Connecticut will be an attempt by Mr. Clinton to sell his message in a state that had until recently embraced Mr. Tsongas. Labor leaders here have already started to flock to Mr. Brown, who tapped the bitterness of blue-collar workers in Michigan to finish second in that state's primary on Tuesday.
"This is like some black comedy," said Jerome P. Brown, president of District 1199 of the New England Health Care Employees Union. "Clinton is supposed to have exactly one thing going for him: he is electable. Well, after the Republicans spend $20 million on attacking him this fall, and turn the election into a referendum on his character rather than our dying economy, we will see how electable Mr. Clinton really is."
"Jerry Brown is a political terrorist," said John F. Droney Jr., a former Democratic state chairman who is running the Clinton campaign in Connecticut. "He is capable of tossing bombs and hurting people. What he can't do is help his party."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: White House;
Bush Plans to Withhold Spending In Fight Over Economic Program

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
President Bush plans to mark the passage of his March 20 deadline for Congressional enactment of his economic-growth legislation by announcing on Friday that he will not spend $4 billion that Congress has allotted for Federal programs, White House officials said today.
Mr. Bush's refusal to spend appropriated money, an action that is called rescission, was also employed by President Reagan. But it proved ineffective because Federal law requires Congressional approval of such actions. Congress has generally chosen not to rescind its own actions, and it is not likely now to approve any cuts Mr. Bush sends it. 
 The President's announcement, in a speech scheduled for mid-afternoon, appeared to be the only administrative action planned so far in the political war that Mr. Bush has long threatened if Congress sends him a package of economic legislation that he finds unacceptable.
Congress appeared ready tonight to do just that, sending Mr. Bush a bill that contained some version of the seven anti-recession measures he has demanded, but also included an increase in taxes on the well-to-do that the President has said he would veto.
 
Republicans See Confusion
 Some Republican officials tonight were sharply critical of the White House and strategists in Mr. Bush's re-election campaign for what they said was confusion and reluctance among top officials to confront Congress more toughly.
They said the scope of Mr. Bush's political retaliation against Congress was unsettled, mired late today in a debate between the White House and Mr. Bush's campaign organization over what the President should do and when he should do it.
"They don't have the most minimal understanding or sense of how to orchestrate an event or make something work," one Republican official, who refused to be identified, said today of the White House staff. "It's distressing."
A second official said, "It's not just the White House. The campaign has its share of problems, too."
Congressional reaction to the White House plans was dismissive. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, questioned whether the President would actually be able to make the rescissions.
"I'm sure that he doesn't have that constitutional authority," Mr. Rostenkowski told reporters tonight during a dinner break from a conference drafting a compromise on the Democratic House and Senate tax bills.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, acknowledged that, "We propose this to Congress, and then they have the right to vote the cuts back in (the budget) on an item-by-item basis."
At the peak of Mr. Reagan's political popularity, in 1981, Congress agreed to rescind nearly three-quarters of the $16.5 billion in programs that Mr. Reagan proposed cutting. But in 1986 and 1987, when the White House was enmeshed in the Iran-contra affair, Congress approved only 1 percent of Mr. Reagan's rescissions, according to a tally by the magazine National Journal.
Mr. Bush plans to announce unilateral cuts on "hundreds" of Federal programs, White House officials said, from construction projects to research programs of the sort that former Senator William Proxmire, Democrat of Wisconsin, used to ridicule with "Golden Fleece" awards.
But with a potentially bruising election season under way and Mr. Bush's own popularity at its lowest, the actions are effectively theatrical and have virtually no chance of reducing Federal spending significantly.
Even if those cuts were to be approved, the $4 billion that Mr. Bush proposes not to spend is only a tiny fraction of a Federal deficit that approaches $400 billion annually. Most of that deficit is made up not of the sort of discretionary programs that the President is attacking but of programs like Medicare, food stamps and student aid, whose levels are set by law.
The list of cuts to be announced on Friday was still being assembled tonight, White House officials said.
 
'Line in the Sand'
 The President's action comes nearly two months after he invoked the language of the Persian Gulf war to press Congress on economic issues, drawing "a line in the sand" for Congress to enact his anti-recession legislative package by March 20 or face a political firefight.
White House officials said tonight that Mr. Bush would chastise Congressional Democrats in his afternoon speech, accusing them of prolonging the national economic slowdown.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Bowing Out;
Tsongas, in Quiet of Home, Faces Realities of Finances

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 19

 BODY:
For the candidate of "hard choices" and "fiscal responsibility," Wednesday was the day of reckoning.
At 9:30 in the evening, Paul E. Tsongas sat in the living room of his Lowell, Mass., house as his campaign manager and best friend, Dennis Kanin, delivered the bad news: Not only was the campaign broke, but it also needed at least $1 million to compete in the New York primary. 
 Mr. Tsongas said he would sleep on it, but it was clear to his wife, Niki, and a few other confidants who were there that the ever-stubborn former Massachusetts Senator would not waver: what he called "a great adventure," running for President, was about to end.
 
More than 'Growing Pains'
 By all accounts, it was a crushing and emotional moment for a campaign that was written off by the Democratic establishment as a pipe dream when it began just one year and 12 days ago and made it into the history books when Mr. Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary last month.
In the end, the factors that briefly turned him into the Democratic front runner crushed him as he struggled to expand his campaign into a national effort. They were more than "growing pains," as Mr. Tsongas called them: He and his aides were unable to adjust to the demands of competing in several states against Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, whose organization and preparation around the country they could never match.
For the same reasons that Mr. Tsongas appealed to voters in New Hampshire -- as a no-nonsense, truth-telling politician -- he failed as a national campaigner. He would not budge in the face of his advisers' entreaties to sweeten his blunt message of economic pain and sacrifice.
Mr. Tsongas was so unwavering in sticking to his message that some of his friends and advisers say he put it above winning the Presidency. And that is why he said he bowed out today: He was confident about his showing on home turf in the Connecticut primary next week, but feared that if he were trounced in New York, he would lose his credibility and his remedies for the nation would sink with him.
At a news conference this afternoon at the Parker House hotel here, Mr. Tsongas recalled that his momentum in the polls before the Texas primary stalled after Mr. Clinton bombarded the state with commercials and he could not respond effectively.
"That's the reality I had to face last night," he said. "That in New York I would run into the same thing.
"The message would have been hurt in the process," he said.
The chain of events that led to today's announcement began only two days ago with the Illinois and Michigan primaries. As he traveled from Chicago to Hartford on Tuesday night, Mr. Tsongas turned again and again to his aides for the latest figures from those contests. The news never got better: his losses were devastating.
So later that night, the former Senator instructed Mr. Kanin to come up with an accounting of the campaign's finances. It was "unspoken," Mr. Kanin said, but the idea of pulling out was on both their minds.
 
Stunned Advisers
 Their thoughts turned to words on Wednesday afternoon when, Mr. Kanin said, Mr. Tsongas "threw out as a possibility" the idea that he would withdraw. He went to a fund raising event here anyway, only to return to his living room that night to make the fateful decision.
It was a decision that stunned many of Mr. Tsongas's aides and even close friends. Peggy Connolly, the press secretary who late Wednesday afternoon was still speaking confidently of Mr. Tsongas' game plan in New York, said she was "shocked" when word came last night.
Ed Jesser, a senior adviser, was also surprised, saying that many candidates faced with similiar political realities would not have bowed out so quickly. "The sun was not shining on the horizon for us," he said. "And he chose not to get into what was a semi-hopeless endeavor."
 
'Who's Goofy'?
 Mr. Tsongas broke the news at his headquarters here this morning to nearly 100 campaign aides. Several people who were there said he stood on a chair so people could see him, and he immediately broke into tears before thanking everyone.
"There were shouts of 'Stick with it,' " said Tak Takvorian, the doctor Mr. Tsongas credits with helping him overcome cancer. "There was a certain dejection but he had some wit."
Describing his mood, Ted Van Dyk, another adviser, said "He was down, down, down."
The announcement today was particularly unexpected because Mr. Tsongas and his advisers had insisted as recently as Wednesday that they were in for the long haul. "I want to be heard in California," Mr. Tsongas said at a news conference on Wednesday.
But Mr. Tsongas seemed to be going through the motions on Wednesday, a sharp contrast to his animated, witty performance today.
"I've spoken to all of the other five candidates," he said. "Bob Kerrey was in Disney World. I told him I would be there too at 3 o'clock. You can decide who's goofy."
Most surprising at the news conference was Mr. Tsongas's explanation that his campaign's financial troubles were why he withdrew. At the Hartford news conference Wednesday, he disputed that his campaign was broke, saying donations have "increased over time -- not diminished" and that "We've had the best fund raising we've ever had."
Mr. Tsongas backed down today from his optimistic outlook, saying that the campaign did not have the resources to compete effectively in New York. "This campaign was lost in 1991 because of lack of resources," he said. "It was almost rescued in 1992 by the message."
But Mr. Tsongas's change of heart on money suggests that there were other factors affecting his decision , like his own future political viability. For days, he has insisted that he would never serve as Mr. Clinton's Vice President, saying a few days ago, "I would not want to be part of an administration whose economic views I so strongly disagree with."
Today he refused to rule out running on a Clinton ticket, saying that he promised his advisers last night that he would "make no statements on my future."
Mr. Jesser, for one, said that now that Mr. Tsongas has left the race relatively unscathed, it would not be farfetched for the Democrats to turn to him later should Mr. Clinton stumble.
 
Damaging Frankness
 All Mr. Tsongas would say today on that note was, "I will be a player because I am now the message that people responded to."
He said that there no hidden reasons for his withdrawal. Dr. Takvorian said he spend today fending off inquiries about Mr. Tsongas's health, insisting, "There's no health issue at all."
As polls in recent days showed that Mr. Tsongas faced an increasingly uphill climb against Mr. Clinton, his close advisers grew more frustrated that he was damaging his prospects by being more blunt with voters than necessary.
They blamed his embarrassing third-place finish in Michigan on his opposition to a bill that would forbid companies to replace striking workers. Though the advisers said he would look like he was pandering if he backed down from that position, they said he could have softened his opposition.
His aides also cringed in Miami Beach before the Florida primary when he praised Anwar Sadat, the slain President of Egypt, before an audience of elderly Jewish voters. A week later, in Flint, Mich., he offered little immediate hope to unemployed blue-collar workers who wanted to know how he would get them jobs.
"This state is in agony -- and he tells them that," Mr. Jesser said after midnight Tuesday, once the results from the Midwest primaries were clear. "The most Machiavellian political person on the planet couldn't see any good in that. He's not going to change his opinion for political advantage."
His aides were equally baffled by his comments until today that he would never serve as Mr. Clinton's Vice President. Even if that were the case, the aides said making such an early declaration would hurt his fund raising efforts among donors who thought he might not win the nomination but was a possible vice president.
"You don't throw those cards away," Jim King, another top aide, said early Wednesday. Speaking of how Mr. Clinton has hammered away at Mr. Tsongas's vulnerabilities, he went on: "Most of the politicians I've worked for would have made moves politically that would have precluded much of it. He didn't. He won't."
Mr. Tsongas's advisers also said that he never was comfortable attacking Mr. Clinton and that those efforts came off poorly and damaged the campaign.
For his part, Mr. Tsongas seemed to take pride in not always following the script of his advisers.
"At times," he said at the news conference, "we were under a great pressure to change our views to accommodate various interests. I chose not to. My principles could not have been compromised without destroying that message." But, he acknowledged, "those decisions cost us dearly."
Something else may have been at work in Mr. Tsongas's decision to quit the race. His advisers suggest that a man who thought he was going to die from cancer has goals that go beyond being President of the United States, that he really did want his message to be heard.
"He isn't totally, utterly, subsumed by his candidacy for President of the United States," Mr. Jesser said. "This is not the fight of his life. He's had the fight of his life."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Front-Runner;
Clinton Campaign Watches as Obstacles to the Democratic Nomination Fall

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
Little more than two weeks ago, aides to Gov. Bill Clinton believed that his campaign was in desperate shape. Slumped over their morning coffee at an Atlanta hotel on March 3, three of his top advisers braced themselves for bad news from Georgia and Maryland, where there were primary elections that day.
But Mr. Clinton got the victory margin he needed in Georgia, finished within seven percentage points of former Senator Paul E. Tsongas in Maryland and so built up enough speed to steamroller the Super Tuesday primaries the next week. 
 By the time they arrived in Chicago last week to kick off a campaign for votes in Illinois and Michigan, the Clinton organizers were able to throw a raucous, balloon-strewn victory party for the local television cameras. The party was intended to send voters a distinct message: Bill Clinton would inevitably be the Democratic nominee.
 
Getting a Nearly Clear Path
 That likelihood grew markedly yesterday with Mr. Tsongas's decision to drop out of the race, handing the Clinton campaign, at turns battered, resilient and victorious, a nearly clear path to nomination.
Mr. Clinton and his staff learned of Mr. Tsongas's decision at their morning strategy conference call in Little Rock, Ark., yesterday. One adviser was summoned away from the telephone to answer a call from a reporter, and returned minutes later to stun the others with the news.
As the aides absorbed the surprise, this adviser said, Mr. Clinton immediately began issuing orders about what steps to take next.
Campaign aides tend to depict their candidates as perennially in charge, but indeed the Clinton organization has always seemed candidate-driven.
In its recurring periods of crisis, the Clinton camp has depended almost entirely on the candidate's personal skills as a tireless stump performer with vast confidence in his own ability to convince voters that he is an honorable man who deserves to be President.
 
Strength 'at Every Juncture'
 As a result, the campaign and its candidate have rejuvenated themselves at every critical hairpin turn. "We've had scrutiny since December," said Frank Greer, Mr. Clinton's media adviser, voicing a recurring campaign theme. "And at every juncture Bil Clinton has been strengthened."
The campaign's two most crucial tests occurred in Georgia on March 3 and in New Hampshire two weeks earlier. 
Mr. Clinton and his advisers knew they had to win decisively in Georgia to counter what was by then a burgeoning Tsongas campaign that was proving itself attractive to more-educated, white-collar voters in Colorado and Maryland, two of the three other states with primaries that day.
A leading Clinton strategist, James Carville, was dispatched to Atlanta to help Gov. Zell Miller, a Clinton supporter, work the state. Mr. Clinton himself set a frantic schedule, returning repeatedly to Georgia. He wound up with 57 percent of the vote, to Mr. Tsongas's 24 percent, and, having won there, traveled to 21 cities across the South in the six days before Super Tuesday.
Similarly, in the week before the New Hampshire primary last month, Mr. Clinton embarked on a breakneck schedule of live half-hour television shows and public appearances. After placing second to Mr. Tsongas in New Hampshire while weathering a flurry of reports about his marital life and whether he had sought to avoid military service, he christened himself the "comeback kid."
Now he has gone on to eliminate all his opponents, except for former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
It took more effort to hurt some than others. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who was initially presumed to be a potential threat in the South and among black voters, dropped out before the first votes were cast. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York decided not to run at all.
Among those who did mount active campaigns, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa faltered almost from the outset. Senator Bob Kerrey, too, failed to live up to expectations after a brief challenge in Georgia, where he predicted that Republicans would shell Mr. Clinton in November "like a soft peanut."
The Clinton campaign is now negotiating for Mr. Harkin's endorsement, and two of Mr. Kerrey's top fund raisers, Bob Burkett and Marvin Rosen, have begun working for Mr. Clinton.
But it was the challenge from Mr. Tsongas that frustrated Mr. Clinton most. The questions about his marital life and his draft status bothered him less than the evidence that voters were choosing Mr. Tsongas for the specificity of his economic message.
In an interview earlier this week, the Governor said: "One of the most emotionally difficult periods of this campaign for me was after the storm passed over all the personal hits, I realized that all of the work I had done for years and years and years to establish a whole new direction for the Democratic Party, to come up with some new ideas and new approaches, that all of that had been erased from the public consciousness, unavoidably, by all the events that had taken place."
Mr. Clinton said he had survived the subsequent attacks directed at him by Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Tsongas, who described him as not electable, because voters started listening to his message once more.
"Once voters started voting for us, it validated us," said Mr. Carville, the Clinton strategist. "It carried on to the next one."
The Governor said that after he began pounding home that message, which stressed "opportunity with responsibility" on welfare, student loan programs and trade issues, he became confident that his campaign was "back on our own strategy."
"I think it just took a long time to get people back to the listening stage again," Mr. Clinton said.
Then he paused.
"It didn't take a long time," he continued. "It took two weeks, but two weeks in this process, and particularly during this particular month, it's an eternity."
Before Mr. Tsongas's withdrawal, Mr. Clinton had said he intended to take his campaign to every remaining primary state even if his nomination was a foregone conclusion. His aides said yesterday that although he had already scaled back his plans for Connecticut, that approach would not change.
"I think you've got people in New York and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Indiana and Wisconsin and New Jersey and California and all the states that haven't voted yet, I think they want to be heard," Mr. Clinton had said.
Aides to Mr. Clinton said Mr. Tsongas's withdrawal would give the Governor an opportunity to challenge President Bush early.
"Everybody hoped we'd have a nominee early," said Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's press secretary. "Now we're not there yet, but I think we're one step closer. Now the job is to define George Bush and to make this a two-person race."
That approach assumes that the other remaining Democratic candidate, Mr. Brown, will share the spotlight for only a short time.
For the past several days, Mr. Clinton and his aides had been convinced that the support they needed would eventually gravitate to them even if Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Brown remained in the race. An anybody-but-Clinton movement, they were predicting, would diminish with every success that showed Mr. Clinton's message getting through to voters.
"If the election demonstrates that I can do that in the midst of all the personal rocks and stones," the Governor said this week, "then I think the politicians who want to be part of that will come to us."

HEADLINE: Democrats Prepare Veto Friendly Tax Bill

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Struggling to settle the terms for a politically attractive middle-class tax cut in time for action before President Bush's Friday deadline, House and Senate negotiators worked tonight to try to finish sweeping tax legislation they knew would not become law.
At 10 P.M., a Senate aide said that Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, designated by the other conferees to work out a bill, intended to finish tonight, no matter how long it took. But he said they would not brief other conferees before morning and would not reveal their agreement to reporters or the public until then either. 
 The election-year measure is expected to include some version of each of the seven points Mr. Bush said in January were essential to spur the economy. His demand included a deep cut in capital gains taxes, accelerated depreciation for business investment and several measures to help the real estate and housing industries.
But the expected tax increases on upper-bracket taxpayers, needed to pay for the middle-class tax cut, have provoked threats of a veto no one expects to override.
Indeed, passage of the measure on Friday is not viewed as a sure thing. But leaders of both houses arranged for unusually quick delivery of the bill to Mr. Bush on Friday evening if it is passed, thus meeting the timing deadline he set, if disregarding the content he demanded.
Earlier versions of the bill were passed by only 12 votes in the House and 3 in the Senate in an air of widespread skepticism that the tax cuts were worth much either to the economy or as election-year slogans for the Democrats. But there was an even stronger concern that failing to pass anything would make the Democratic Congress look even worse than passing a bill Mr. Bush would reject and they could argue about.
 
Early Caucus Today
 House Democrats scheduled an early-morning caucus to round up support for whatever emerged from tonight's bargaining. Extra persuasion may be critical because of widespread unhappiness with the way Democratic leaders have handled the House bank scandal, which became public late last week, two weeks after passage of the House version of the tax bill.
For most of the day, Mr. Bentsen, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Mr. Rostenkowski, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, met together with only a few aides.
Other lawmakers on the conference had agreed to leave it to them to try to cut a deal, and they went over 141 large pages comparing where the two measures were identical, similar or contradictory.
The biggest difference was on the political heart of the Democratic effort to portray themselves in an election year as friends of the middle class.
The House bill provides a temporary, two-year tax credit of up to $400 for working couples. The credit is for one-fifth of the Social Security and Medicare taxes a worker pays, and the $400 level would be reached at an income level of about $26,000. The House credit would be refundable, meaning that if someone's income taxes were not as large as the credit owed, he or she would get a check from the Treasury for the balance.
 
The Senate Version
 The Senate bill, in contrast, is focused on children. It provides a $300 credit for each child under 16 claimed as a dependent, for couples with adjusted gross incomes under $47,500. The credit would be gradually reduced for couples with incomes up to $60,000, and eliminated above that level. Despite complaints from some liberal Democrats, it would not be refundable; low-income parents would not benefit.
Another major difference is that the Senate bill includes provisions on health insurance. It would prohibit insurance companies from canceling coverage or excluding members of small groups because of existing health problems or prior claims, and try to eliminate gaps in coverage for workers changing jobs. It would also seek to eliminate wide disparities in health insurance premiums.
While including these elements in the bill sent to Mr. Bush for a veto would enable the Democrats to attack him on another politically advantageous front, House Democrats were resisting including these elements in the final version of the bill because they have not yet considered the issue.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's New Treasurer Defends Budget to Assembly

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 19

 BODY:
New Jersey's new state treasurer is not officially on the job until Friday, but he was at work today defending Gov. Jim Florio's proposed $15.7 billion budget against Republican attack.
The treasurer, Samuel Crane, whose nomination was confirmed last week by the Senate and who is to be sworn in Friday, was the first member of the administration to formally testify over a budget proposal that has become the major strain in the power-sharing between a Democratic governor and a Republican-led Legislature. 
 "Obviously there are some clear differences," Mr. Crane said in an interview after completing his testimony to the Assembly Appropriations Committee. "Overall, I didn't think it was as bitterly partisan today as most people thought it would be."
The committee meeting opened with a direct attack on Mr. Florio by the Republican chairman, Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen. He called the budget "the cornerstone of Governor Florio's plans to remake his battered public image at taxpayers' expense."
 
Sales Tax at Issue
 Mr. Florio based his budget in part on a 7 percent sales tax rate despite the Republicans' warnings that they intended to roll back the sales tax to 6 percent to fulfill a campaign promise. The Governor's budget proposal also increases aid to public schools by $341 million, maintains a home rebate program and keeps transit fares at current levels.
"Governor Florio has made this budget document so politically charged that it attempts to thwart this legislature's efforts to do what the public wants -- craft a smaller, more efficient government and lower taxes," Mr. Frelinghuysen said.
The state constitution requires that New Jersey have a balanced budget in place by the start of its fiscal year, July 1.
During nearly three hours of testimony today, Mr. Crane doggedly defended his department's budget projections in civil, but sometimes pointed, exchanges with the Republicans.
In his prepared text, Mr. Crane ended with a swipe at the Republicans' plan to roll back the sales tax to 6 percent, which would mean a $608 million loss in revenue in the next fiscal year and $638 million the following year.
"If you have an economic analysis which shows that the repeal will, indeed, jump-start the state's economy, please share it with us and the public before acting solely on the basis of faith," Mr. Crane said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
In TV Age, Tsongas Built A Campaign on His Book

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 19

 BODY:
In the end it was not enough to win, but Paul E. Tsongas deserves to be remembered for a remarkable achievement in the television age. He based a political campaign on a book that he wrote himself.
Few voters read it, of course, but the mere existence of "A Call to Economic Arms" gave Mr. Tsongas credibility and helped inspire a battle of the books. He and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas took their campaigns to the reference desk of local libraries in New Hampshire, where voters could compare Mr. Tsongas's work with Mr. Clinton's "A Plan for America's Future." 
 Both he and Mr. Clinton addressed a classic literary theme, the American dream, with similar plots: Nation gets dream, nation loses dream, nation gets five-point plan to get back dream. Both introduced heroic figures: Mr. Clinton's New Covenant, Mr. Tsongas' New American Mandate. But Mr. Tsongas was more thorough in character development -- maybe too thorough. A reader could come away with a good idea of why his campaign went the way it did.
There was no mistaking his sincerity and moral conviction, the qualities that initially appealed to many voters. Mr. Tsongas admirably discussed unpopular ideas like higher gasoline taxes or lower Social Security benefits for the wealthy.
Unfortunately, unpopular ideas that sound reasonable in a book do not fare well on 30-second commercials. Mr. Clinton demonstrated this in commercials showing a copy of "A Call to Economic Arms" and flipping through its pages. Underlined words appeared on the screen, complete with page citations, a rare and apparently successful use of footnotes on television.
Mr. Tsongas might have benefited if voters had bothered to read both candidates' books, because they would have seen Mr. Clinton's penchant for urging bold action without actually offending anyone. But they would have noticed another difference, too. If Mr. Clinton at his worst was an unprincipled glad-hander, Mr. Tsongas was a messianic pedant.
This preachy side of Mr. Tsongas was probably one of the chief reasons that his campaign eventually faltered. It came out only gradually on television, but it was obvious long ago to anyone who read the 86-page book.
 
Orders of Narrator
 The omniscient narrator incessantly issued orders ("must" was a favorite word) and proclaimed sweeping truths. He knew everything from the most beautiful place on earth (Alaska) to the greatest mystery in climatology (his discussion of global warming began, "The issues here are well known.").
His plan for reorganizing American business was particularly revealing. There was nothing unusual about Mr. Tsongas's enthusiasm for a national industrial policy -- although he and the other Democratic candidates had trouble planning their own schedules more than a day in advance, none of them shied from plotting the course of entire industries through the end of the century. But Mr. Tsongas' attitude was singularly confident.
"Take a deep breath," Mr. Tsongas warned the believers in laissez-faire economics. "It's a brave new world out there. Adam Smith was a marvelous man but he wouldn't know a superconductor or memory chip if he tripped over one."
For an economic planner to dismiss Adam Smith in one sentence is a little like a rocket engineer casually pooh-poohing the laws of gravity because Isaac Newton would not know a solid-fuel booster if it landed on his head. Mr. Tsongas elevated this year's political discourse, but his own discourse might have benefited from a touch of self-doubt. "The Wealth of Nations" is going to stay in print a lot longer than "A Call to Economic Arms."

HEADLINE: As Gun Debate Rages, Ammunition Makers Are Quietly, and Busily, at Work

SERIES: 200 Million Guns -- Sixth article in a series

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Although making billions of rounds of ammunition annually is a big business and thousands of people are killed or injured by misuse of some of those products, the nation's ammunition industry hums along in quiet obscurity, all but ignored by opponents and supporters of gun control.
In most states, all anyone needs to buy ammunition is a driver's license. No special records are kept of the purchase, which is just as likely to be made at a K-Mart or a gas station-convenience store as a gun shop. 
 By law, convicted felons are prohibited from buying ammunition, but retailers are not obliged to make any special effort to determine if their customers have a criminal record, and they virtually never do. In the few cities like New York and Washington where ammunition is much harder to buy, it still flows readily to criminals, along with illegal handguns, from neighboring states.
 
Lonely Battle for Moynihan
 The inattention to the ammunition market frustrates Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who has waged a lonely drive to ban the manufacture and sale of ammunition used in many handguns.
But most law-enforcement officials and policy makers believe that the easy availability of ammunition has little to do with the nation's gun problems. They say that criminals tend to use ammunition sporadically and in such small quantities that a minute fraction of the available supply is all they need. In addition, the officials say, any effort to choke off the commercial production of ammunition would almost certainly be undercut by a homemade supply.
"You could work for years and never learn to machine a gun," said John C. Killorin, head of public affairs for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. "You could take a 20-minute course and learn how to make ammunition."
Simply comparing the ammunition industry with other businesses turns up other reasons for its low profile, starting with who owns it. Large industrial conglomerates like the Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, and E. I. du Pont de Nemours, which owns Remington, control the major producers. But for the industry giants, the ammunition makers are minor subsidiaries.
 
$843 Million Annual Sales
 Another major producer, CCI-Speer, is a division of Blount Inc., a sprawling privately held concern that is making industrial products and sporting goods and owns a construction company. In addition, a substantial part of the ammunition business is in the hands of individuals and small-scale enterprises that produce new ammunition from recycled shells.
While many small-scale producers, especially those that reload used shells, are not included, domestic production of "small arms ammunition" had an estimated wholesale value of $843 million in 1990, according to the Commerce Department, with a portion of the sales going abroad. By comparison, production of firearms had a wholesale value of $1.14 billion in 1990. About 10,000 people are employed in the industry.
Profits, executives say, are under constant pressure, especially in the most popular calibers, for which prices are low and competition intense. Although specialty ammunition used to hunt big game may cost as much as $5 a cartridge. The average cartridge sells for about 15 cents.
To survive, companies need to offer higher-priced, specialty cartridges as well as commonplace ones, said Les Jones, director of sales for the Federal Cartridge Company, a subsidiary of Pentair Inc. that is pushing Remington for second place in the market.
 
Stable Business
 If one word characterizes the industry it is stability. Fashions in the kinds of ammunition purchased come and go with changing tastes in guns, but not with the speed and force of, say, money-spinning shifts in clothing fashions. Imports have crimped profits but the fallout has been modest compared with the havoc in automobiles and electronics. Environmental problems have altered products and operations but hardly as traumatically as in many other industries.
Commercial ammunition sales growth stalled in the mid-1970's, hurt largely by falling demand from hunters. Growing handgun sales and target shooting has led to renewed, although slow, growth in recent years. Military sales, which account for 10 percent to 15 percent of the total sales, are about half of what they were during the early years of the Reagan Administration. Part of the decline is the result of the armed forces' use of Government arsenals for a larger percentage of their requirements.
"I think we bottomed out about five years ago," said G. W. Bersett, president of Winchester.
 
Competitors
 At Winchester, History in Motion
 Perhaps the single best place to get an overview of the ammunition industry is East Alton, Ill., the Mississippi river town just north of St. Louis that is home to Winchester, believed to be the largest ammunition manufacturer. Winchester's factory complex, next to an Olin brass mill that supplies it, produces about 350 different cartridges and shells, totaling more than a billion rounds a year, according to a company spokesman who would not be more specific. They range from industry standbys like 9-millimeter cartridges to specialty rounds like bulletless ramset shells that the construction industry uses to blast nails into concrete.
Winchester's complex is in some areas a finely honed working museum. The first step in forming lead shot, for example, is a two-century old process in which molten lead fed through a sieve solidifies while falling seven stories into a pool of water that cushions its impact. Low-volume products are still loaded at rates of 40 to 60 a minute on machines designed by John Olin long before his family's Western Cartridge Company acquired the bankrupt Winchester rifle company in 1931.
Elsewhere, Winchester looks a lot more like a company with its eye on the 21st century. Only a few yards from the Olin loaders, computer-controlled Manuhrin cartridge loading stations imported from France churn out 9-millimeter cartridges and other big sellers at rates of up to 450 a minute.
With millions of dollars invested in such automation during the 1980's, Winchester has followed the strategy of low-cost, high-volume producers in other industries by steadily reducing its work force while improving quality and increasing output.
 
Remington the Chief Rival
 Winchester's main rival over the years has been Remington, which manufactures about 1.5 billion rounds annually at Lonoke, Ark., according to Paul Kvederis, a spokesman at Remington's headquarters in Pittsburg. Olin's sale of Winchester's domestic and foreign firearms operations during the 1980's made Remington the only major ammunition producer also active in the market for traditional firearms, which has been only intermittently profitable.
Ammunition industry executives say rumors that DuPont is anxious to sell Remington never cease. Remington executives declined to comment on the rumors or any aspect of the company's business.
The third major competitor is Federal, the descendant of a company that was at one time supported by the Olin family to preserve competition in the industry and keep antitrust officials at bay. After going through a management-led leveraged buyout in 1985, Federal was sold to Pentair in 1988.
"You are a little bit at the mercy of lead prices and other raw materials whose costs are determined by demand in other industries, but ammunition is more stable and less vulnerable to recession than some of our other businesses," said Richard Ingman, vice president of corporate development for Pentair, a conglomerate with interests in paper and a variety of industrial products.
 
40 Million Reused Rounds
 Winchester, Remington and Federal, along with CCI, which concentrates largely on .22-caliber ammunition and inexpensive cartridges that do not have recyclable brass casings, account for most new ammunition sales. A number of smaller specialty manufacturers, like Nosler Bullets Inc., have developed reputations for innovative designs later adopted by bigger manufacturers.
Several hundred million rounds of ammunition a year are made by reloaders, who recycle used shells. They range from target shooters trying to save money for themselves and their acquaintances to relatively sophisticated "remanufacturers," who turning out as many as 40 million rounds a year for law-enforcement agencies and military forces to use on practice ranges.
Of the major remanufacturers, only 3-D Ammunition of Doniphan, Neb., has made a major effort to expand from the law-enforcement market into commercial realms like hunting. Police detectives say that it is unusual to find recycled ammunition in guns used by criminals but that reloading would undoubtedly expand rapidly if supplies of new ammunition were somehow interrupted.
For now it is a specialty business, with each region of the country dominated by one remanufacturer living largely off contracts too small to attract the major new ammunition manufacturers.
 
Marketing
By the U.S. Mail Or at K Mart
 Ammunition is sold directly to customers by mail order -- something not allowed for guns -- through sporting goods stores and general retailers and at gun shows. In some municipalities and a handful of states, there are restrictions governing both who can buy and who can sell such products.
New York City is among the strictest, with rules forbidding the sale of ammunition to anyone who does not show a legal permit to use a gun firing the type of ammunition being bought. And New York City gun shop owners are required to record every ammunition sale, even though shopkeepers and police detectives agree that the information is useless in criminal investigations.
"I don't recall ever having a police officer look at the book," said Pat Lozito, owner of Alpine Arms Corporation, a gun shop in Brooklyn.
A similar reporting requirement for the whole nation was eliminated by Congress in 1986 as part of legislation banning the production, sale or importation of "cop-killer" bullets that could pierce "bullet-proof" vests. That ban, the only measure ever to limit directly the sale of any form of small-arms ammunition, was ultimately supported even by the National Rifle Association.
Shops like Mr. Lozito's account for a declining share of ammunition sales nationwide, according to ammunition distributors. Because ammunition can be sold to anyone with a driver's license in most of the nation, chains like Wal-Mart and K Mart have regarded it as just one more product to plug into their highly efficient operations.
They have snapped up somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent of sales, according to Markham Dickson Jr., owner of Sport South Inc. in Shreveport, La. Big gun shops that once bought up to 300 cases a year now purchase as few as 10, Mr. Dickson said.
 
Concerns
 Pushing Shooting, Battling Imports
 Not surprisingly, ammunition makers and their employees are generally strong opponents of efforts to restrict the freedom of gun owners to buy, sell or use firearms. "Strict enforcement of the laws that are on the books can do more for controlling misuse than additional gun controls," said R. G. Phelps, president of 3-D Ammunition and Bullets Inc.
Ammunition industry executives almost always endorse the National Rifle Association's positions on arms and ammunition. But they officially identify with the National Shooting Sports Federation, which is dedicated to promoting hunting and target shooting, and its sister organization, the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, which sets voluntary national standards for bullet diameters and other aspects of ammunition and firearm design.
The sports federation never lobbies and its sister organization rarely does so, said Robert Delfay, executive director of both organizations.
Ammunition companies have donated millions of dollars over the years to organizations that encourage hunting or shooting, including conservation groups trying to rebuild wildlife populations and preserve wetlands.
"I'm personally just as concerned with the anti-hunting and animal rights people as I am the anti-gun people," said Mr. Jones of Federal Cartridge. "Ten years from now we could wind up with all of our guns and ammunition and nothing to shoot at."
Hunting represents about 80 percent of the commercial ammunition market, but that segment has been stagnant at best. Target shooting, which often involves semiautomatic pistols, has been the best commercial growth area.
For that reason, the industry concedes, it does have a direct interest in the fate of semiautomatic weapons that are not typically used for hunting. Winchester officials, for example, say that they noted a drop in sales in Los Angeles County after a number of military-style weapons were banned there.
On the environmental front, the banning of lead pellets in shotgun shells for some types of hunting and concerns about high exposure of shooters to lead at indoor shooting ranges have spurred efforts to redesign products that are radical by historical standards. Steel components in the place of lead completely change the performance characteristics of bullets,
The industry has also faced a challenge from imports. Ammunition is imported from a number of European countries, as well as Israel and Brazil, among others, but it was a surge of low-cost supplies from the Far East in the early 1980's in tandem with weakening demand that shocked domestic manufacturers.
Cost cutting since then seems to have held imports to less than 20 percent of the market. Now, a number of American manufacturers are thinking more globally and pursuing export opportunities of their own.

The special United Nations envoy to the Caucasus region, Cyrus R. Vance, said today that a cease-fire accord had been reached in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and that he would travel to the territory on Friday.
Mr. Vance, a former American Secretary of State who recently negotiated a plan to send United Nations peacekeeping troops to Yugoslavia, has described his initiative in the Caucasus as a fact-finding mission. 
 Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have fought for four years for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave inside Azerbaijan that is inhabited mainly by Armenians. The fighting has intensified since the breakup of the Soviet Union, and Mr. Vance had said that he wanted a cease-fire in place before he traveled to the territory.
He announced that he would visit Nagorno-Karabakh at a news conference after three days of talks with Government officials in Armenia and Azerbaijan, but said he was not trying to mediate the dispute.
 
'To See for Myself'
 "I consider this to be extremely important, because I think it is absolutely essential to my mission that I have the opportunity to see for myself, listen with my own ears and talk to those who are residents in the area," Mr. Vance said.
Iran's official press agency reported that the President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, had agreed to the terms of an Iranian-brokered cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh on Wednesday night after meeting in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, with an envoy from Teheran.
Previous efforts to reach a durable truce in the enclave have failed.
Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a tentative agreement on Sunday in Teheran to try to "normalize the situation" in Nagorno-Karabakh but tensions between the two former Soviet republics remain high.
Armenia declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, saying that an Azerbaijani rail blockade of fuel and other necessities had caused a sharp deterioration in its economy.
More fighting was reported in and around Nagorno-Karabakhtoday. Armenian reports said two people were killed and 15 were wounded in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative center, by rockets fired from the predominantly Azerbaijani village of Shusha.

HEADLINE: Japan's Gift to Bush

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 19

 BODY:
Well before the Presidential primary season began, Japanese officials and industrialists made no secret that their candidate was President Bush. But it was not until this morning, when the Government announced a new, more restrictive limit on Japanese auto exports to the United States, that those who run Japan Inc. found a way to make their first campaign contribution..
Unlike virtually every other trade concession made in recent years, this one was Japan's idea, not America's. Moreover, timing was crucial. In discussions in the last few weeks, Japanese involved in the decision said they wanted to act late enough to avoid accusations that Japan was meddling in the primaries, but early enough to head off election-year calls for more restrictions on Japanese products, perhaps including those produced in the United States. 
 In the end, true to form, Japan's industrial leaders opted for the plan that they guessed would cost them the most in the short term but the least in the long term. Late Wednesday, after a last-minute analysis of the results in the Michigan primary, they decided to impose the tightest limits in the 12-year history of the voluntary export ceilings, hoping that even if auto companies were forced to forgo some sales in North America this year, they would avoid a big backlash as the election approaches. More carefully timed concessions may follow, perhaps with an announcement about new limits on steel exports sometime around the Pennsylvania primary.
"I don't think that we are making that big a sacrifice, and we are presenting a big gift," a senior executive of one of Japan's biggest auto makers said today, insisting on anonymity for fear of retribution by the Japanese Government. "The main idea is that we are sending a political message. And the message is that we are not an uncaring juggernaut, cruising into the U.S.A. We know how much trouble the Big Three are in, and we are willing to act accordingly."
Under the plan announced today by Kozo Watanabe, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, the ceiling on auto exports to the United States will be set at 1.65 million, effective April 1, far below the current ceiling of 2.3 million. But over five years, as Japan opened more "transplant" factories in the United States, Japanese auto makers have not come close to the old limit. Last year, one of the worst of recent times in the American car market, they shipped only 1.76 million cars to the United States, and until today it seemed the number would be likely to hold this year.
Now, the Japanese car makers will have to forgo sales of about 100,000 cars, or quickly move their production to plants in North America. Only cars actually shipped from Japan fall within the voluntary export limits. That means Japan's share of the American auto market, now 30 percent and still growing, is unlikely to be affected.
Publicly, Japanese officials tried to position their move as a peace offering to the American automobile industry and, by extension, to Americans angry at Japan's success. "The action was taken in consideration of the significance of coexistence and co-prosperity for the Japanese and U.S. auto industries, which are essential for maintaining the free-trade system," Mr. Watanabe said.
But in private, Government officials and Japanese business executives quickly volunteer that the decision was a careful calculation intended to bolster Mr. Bush, whom the Japanese regard as the best bet for maintaining the economic status quo under which Japanese firms have prospered.
Senior Japanese officials view the President as a man more committed to reducing trade tensions with Japan than fundamentally altering the economic status quo. He has no radical plans for reducing the trade deficit, despite the fact that it shows evidence of once again rising quickly. Rightly or wrongly, Mr. Bush is regarded by many in Japan as essentially uninterested in the details of trade negotiations or industrial competitivness.
But in discussions in recent weeks, Japanese officials and industrialists have expressed the fear that Mr. Bush will be forced to change his stripes on trade, under pressure from Democrats on the left and Patrick Buchanan on the right. The idea was to set up a concession that Mr. Bush can take credit for winning, even if the cut was three-quarters symbolism.
Publicly, neither the Government nor any of the nation's leading industrial groups will voice official support for Mr. Bush, and add that if they did try to help him their effort would probably backfire. "If there is really such an impression" that Japan is pushing for the President, "then I would be very concerned," said Takakazu Kuriyama, who later this month will become Japan's new ambassador to the United States. "It would give the impression that we are getting involved in American domestic politics, in an election year."
But all winter, each candidate has been described in the press and on television here through the single lens of trade politics, each labeled "free trader" or "protectionist" or, in a few cases, as "basher." Few candidates received more coverage than Tom Harkin, who dropped out of the race, but who espoused the most protectionist views. Now that he and Bob Kerrey are out of the race, the Japanese may feel that even deeper concessions for the United States may be unnecessary.
One problem for the Japanese is that their list of potential campaign gifts -- export ceilings, commitments to buy more American cars and high technology, new restraints on machine tools and steel -- all smack of "managed trade," something both Mr. Bush and the Japanese insist they oppose.
"It would be best if we could maintain free trade without resorting to such measures," Mr. Watanabe, the Trade Minister, acknowledged today. "But staving off protectionism or regionalism in the U.S. will mean advancing free trade in the end." Mr. Watanabe said, however, that Japan's managed-trade generosity had its limits: he said there were no plans to impose similar limits on auto exports to the European Community. The Europeans have already criticized Japan harshly for failing to treat its trade partners equally, bowing to pressure from the United States, Japan's biggest market, but not from others.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Research Lags, Report Finds

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Research conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency suffers from uneven quality, inadequate funds, poor direction and a lack of first-rate scientists and equipment, a report made public today says.
The report, discussed at a hearing of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said the environmental agency neither conducts environmental research as well as it could nor uses science effectively in considering and writing regulations. 
 Critics charge that many of the agency's policies are driven by response to a crisis rather than by research. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., says that is not the way it should be.
Concerned about the poor reputation of its science, Mr. Reilly appointed a special advisory committee of prominent scientists last year to assess the work of the E.P.A.'s Office of Research and Development and the agency's overall use of technical information.
 
'Uneven Quality' Found
 "The panel affirms that the E.P.A. needs its own strong science base to provide the background required for effective environmental protection programs," the committee said. "Currently, E.P.A. science is of uneven quality, and the agency's policies and regulations are frequently perceived as lacking a strong scientific foundation."
The committee recommended that the agency take steps to improve matters, including bringing in promiment scientists and appointing a high-ranking science adviser for the agency.
Mr. Reilly, testifying at the hearing, praised the report and said he would begin immediately to carry out many of its suggestions. He promised to appoint science advisers at different levels in the agency, have himself regularly briefed on technical issues, and create and publish an annual research agenda that establishes priorities.
"Sometimes our decisions are based on partial information, and we need to be clearer about our sources of data and the quality of the data," Mr. Reilly said in an interview. "The time has come when science should be what we do and what we are seen to do. We are not eco-cowboys and we don't want to be seen that way."
Representative George E. Brown Jr., who is chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, noted that the E.P.A. conducted little basic research on fundamental environmental processes and health effects. The agency has to do more than short-term applied research if it wants to reduce scientific uncertainties that hamper efforts to create thoughtful, cost-effective regulations, he said.
Mr. Brown, a California Democrat, praised Mr. Reilly's quick response to the science study and said he would try to get more money for environmental research. An analysis by the committee found that even though the environmental agency's research and development budget had been rising modestly in recent years, it still had not recovered from deep cuts that were made under the Reagan Administration.
The research budget increased from $358.1 million in the fiscal year 1991 to $525.9 proposed for the fiscal year 1993. But the analysis found that, after adjusting for inflation, the budget was 3 percent less than it was in 1981.
Dr. Bernard D. Goldstein of Rutgers University, a member of the four-member panel of scientists that studied the E.P.A.'s research, said the panel held three public meetings, interviewed 30 scientists and other experts on environmental issues and received additional comments from 25 others.
 
Science Counseling Urged
 "There is a perception that the quality of science at the E.P.A. is uneven and that the agency's policies and guidelines lack a strong scientific foundation," Dr. Goldstein said at the hearing. The agency needs to recognize the importance of quality science, he said, and include scientific advice "early and often in its deliberations."
When it considers regulations, Dr. Goldstein said, the environmental agency "always has someone from the general counsel's office to assure that what it is doing is in compliance with the law." He added, "We suggest the same role for science in these deliberations."
Responding to the report's recommendations, Mr. Reilly said he wanted agency policies to be driven by rational priorities based on dealing with the greatest environmental risk, and not on the popular crises of the day.
Science and research play a major role in determining both risks and priorities, he said, and have been improving at the agency in recent years.
 
'Pro-Science' Culture Sought
 Saying he wanted to "alter the culture at the agency to be more pro-science," Mr. Reilly said the E.P.A. would try to attract prominent enviromental scientists and engineers to the agency for permanent positions by establishing the equivalent of six endowed chairs at the agency, at $1 million for each.
Other parts of the plan are these:
*Reorganizing the staff into areas by issue, so that work can be conducted long in advance of crises. Some of the areas would include drinking water pollution, climate change, species loss and indoor air pollution.
*Increasing the involvement of academic scientists with the agency by reducing contract research at E.P.A. offices and laboratories, and offering more competitive grants for university researchers.
*Establishing a new standard for research done by the agency, making all of it of publishable quality and assuring taht all of it gets reviewed by a panel of peers, which Mr. Reilly said is often not the case now.
*Creating a board of scientific counselors, made up of the best scientists in academia, government and industry, to advise the E.P.A.'s research division.
*Starting programs to encourage young scientists to choose the E.P.A. as a career to supplement the agency's aging cadre of scientists, and seeking more money to update aging equipment at its laboratories.
"I believe that the steps we are proposing to take will fundamentally alter the way in which scientific information is developed and used in the E.P.A.," Mr. Reilly said.

HEADLINE: Report in California Recommends Customizing High School Studies

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 19

 BODY:
Rejecting the traditional "shopping mall" approach of most high schools, a state-sponsored study group today recommended that California students be asked to take two years of a tougher core curriculum, then customize their studies in the last two years to better prepare them for college or the workplace.
The report, the result of a two-year study by a 69-member High School Task Force, proposes routing juniors and seniors into "majors" that would be organized either by career fields, like health care, or by academic disciplines, like the humanities. These focus areas could lead to college, further technical training or directly into a job. Students would have the option of changing paths. 
 Commissioned by the State Department of Education, the report was heartily endorsed by Bill Honig, the state superintendent of public instruction, who said he would hold several workshops to explain the recommendations, in the hope of persuading school boards to adopt them.
 
Tightening of Standards
 The recommendations reflect ideas being discussed by leading educators nationwide about how schools can better prepare students for the work force, ideas that Marc Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, said would "bring us into line with the rest of the world."
The California report recommends a tightening of standards for the first two years of high school, requiring students to follow a more rigorous core curriculum that includes language arts, mathematics, history and science as well as other disciplines. The specialization of the final two years would be coordinated with businesses and parents to assure that students are being prepared for the world they will face after graduation.
In presenting the report, its sponsors avoided the term "tracking," which indicates that high and low achievers are separated and is a concept that has aroused strong opposition from people who fear that students will be unfairly labeled and pigeonholed. In contrast to tracking systems, the report's sponsors said its recommendations were meant to let students choose their path, but to require all students to take the rigorous core curriculum.
"There is a concern on the part of the business community and the world at large that kids coming out of high school are not prepared for the work force," said Susie Lang, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Education. "There is a sense that unless a kid is on a college-prep track, the rest of the kids are left to just kind of wander through, and then suddenly they have a diploma and, 'Now what do I do?' "
 
Reorganizing Teaching Time
 The report also recommends a reorganization of teaching time to foster closer teacher-student relationships and a refocussing of academic work to emphasize underlying processes rather than rote acquisition of facts.
David D. Marsh, a professor of education at the University of Southern California who helped write the report, said that although some of its elements were already in use in some California schools, broad implementation would be slowed by budget constraints and entrenched attitudes about teaching.
To dramatize the intent of the recommendations, a summary of the report was made public today at Pasadena High School, where students can elect to join the school's Graphic Arts Academy. This program, developed in partnership and with money from the Printing Industry Association, includes a paid work internship and offers both vocational training and a focus on related academic subjects like chemistry, history and applied arts.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Verbatim;
Excerpts From Tsongas's News Conference on His Withdrawal

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BOSTON, March 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the news conference where former Senator Paul E. Tsongas today announced his withdrawal from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
 
 It had been my intention to make only one announcement today, but because of a phone call that came in an hour ago I have two to make. One is that I will suspend my candidacy for President of the United States, and because of the second phone call I am pleased to announce that I have agreed to accept the presidency of the Speedo bathing suit company. . . . 
 A year ago, you and I began our journey of purpose. We undertook this journey out of love of country. America faces economic peril and social disharmony. That is not what America's all about. America is a great nation and we are a great people and we must be called to that greatness.
This journey had two missions. The first was to redefine the Democratic Party, to combine economic growth with our traditional social compassion. America needs such a Democratic Party. I believe the force of our message and our sheer survival has caused people all over this country to see a new path.
It is a steeper and harder path, but it is more compelling and more noble. It is the path of America's future. At the end of that path lies a prosperous and humane America. More importantly, it is the path of our generational responsibility. Our young deserve our willingness to make hard choices. Their fate lies in our resolve. To turn away from that sacred responsibility is to violate the legacy of our ancestors. That message, that sacredness, that resolve, was my mission, and I feel deeply fulfilled. The obligation of my survival has been met.
The second mission was to secure the nomination, take the party and take the fight to George Bush. I believe that I could have brought in independents and moderate and disaffected Republicans to combine with traditional Democrats and become President of the United States.
But the hard fact is that the nomination process requires resources, and last evening it was clear that we did not have the resources necessary to fight the media war in New York. We simply did not have the resources. I would have been defined by others, and have been unable to defend myself.
Worse, my message, my message would have been wounded, and all that we worked for, for this past year, would have been put at risk.
The message must endure.
At times we were under great pressure to change our views to accommodate various interests. I chose not to. My principles could not have been compromised without destroying that message. Those decisions cost us dearly, and the resources simply were not there to make up the difference, and thus today's announcement to suspend the campaign.
The alternative was clear. The alternative was to play the role of spoiler. That is not what I'm about; that is not worthy. I did not survive my ordeals in order to be the agent of the re-election of George Bush.
My task is to pay homage to principles. In the larger sense it is our collective -- you and me -- our collective commitment to a set of values. That is what will endure. We stood for something. We stood for something.

 	 	 		. . .	 	My heart is hopeful for America. I congratulate Bill Clinton and Jerry Brown. I look forward to the convention, and I look forward to a Democratic victory in November.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. [Inaudible] using the words "suspending" your campaign?
A. The difference -- the reason I'm using the word 'suspension' -- is that we have delegates who wish to go to the convention, and by suspending the campaign they're intact and they can go. And we've got a number of calls urging us, pleading with us, to do that. And so that's why we're doing that.
Q. Senator, [inaudible] problem was not money, that you had plenty of money to go on. What changed in the last 24 hours?
A. The problem is not money coming in; the money was coming in. I mean the amount of money coming in, the numbers I think you're familiar with, 300,000 in February -- 300,000 in January.
I will say this is totally aside -- I can now wander freely --
But I'd like to apologize for three remarks I made during the campaign. One, Molly is in the fourth grade not the fifth grade.
The second is I have three children, not four.
And the other thing I said the other day was I got cancer at the age of 38, not 42. So let me -- gotten all those things straight.
This campaign was lost in 1991 because of a lack of resources. It was almost rescued in 1992 by the message. We came into 1992 without any money and in debt. So the 300,000 that came in in January, the 1.4 million that came in February, and the 1.4 we've raised already in March, I mean that was wonderful, but the problem is we were starved.
If money is the mother's milk of politics, our mothers didn't show up until late January.
And so what happened was we had no reserves. As we then moved into the states with all the media buys, what we were bringing in was fine, but there was no reserves to play, and what we found out in Texas, Florida, Michigan and Illinois was the fact that if someone goes on television and defines you and you have no capacity to respond, people's impression of you is not what you are but what you are defined by your opponent.
And it was obvious that to go into New York, defenseless in terms of financial resources, being unable to get up the air in the Buffalos, Schnectadys, et cetera, would have meant that we could not compete. And the danger was, and the great agony, was that the message, if I had gone down in that way, that the message would have been so damaged, that all that we have endured would have been hurt.
So I have no complaints about what was coming in in the last month or so. What affected us was not having the capacity to organize to do things back last year, and to come into 1992 basically in a state of poverty.
And I've spoken to all of the other five candidates. Bob Kerrey was in Disney World.
I told him I would be there, too, at three o'clock. You can decide who's goofy.

HEADLINE: Workers Mourn Maxwell House's Last Drop

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOBOKEN, N.J., March 19

 BODY:
Twenty-one months after the conglomerate that owns Maxwell House announced that it would phase out its operation here, the last big factory on this famous waterfront is sputtering to an end.
Today, the day before their last, union workers had a farewell lunch at the plant cafeteria and finished cleaning out their lockers. They pick up their final paychecks Friday. Then, save for about two dozen employees who will remain to tie up loose ends by July 1, the sprawling brick complex off Frank Sinatra Drive, once the largest producer of coffee in the world, will be empty. 
 At a time when businesses throughout the country have been closing with little warning, the protracted quality of this plant's death has done little to reduce the impact on Hoboken. To many who live here, Maxwell House was more than a factory. It seemed to define the city -- from the smell of roasted coffee that wafted through the streets 24 hours a day to the landmark "Good to the Last Drop" sign with its tilted coffee cup dripping neon drops into the Hudson.
 
Dwindling Consumption
 And for more than a decade Maxwell House has been Hoboken's largest taxpayer and employer. It had 640 workers in June 1990, when its owner, Kraft-General Foods, a Philip Morris subsidiary, announced that the Hoboken plant had lost out to one in Jacksonville, Fla., in a competition to see which would stay and which would go.
Company officials blamed dwindling coffee consumption and an excess of production capacity, with four plants operating at a net of 55 percent of capacity, for the decision to close one of its two East Coast operations; the Hoboken plant, where some workers earn $15 to $20 an hour, was chosen because its labor costs were 20 percent higher than those in Jacksonville and because it sits on 22 acres of valuable waterfront land.
Nan Redmond, a corporate affairs director for General Foods U.S.A., which directly oversees the Kraft-General Foods plant, said the company has no plans for now to remove its famous sign and that it has hired real-estate consultants to evaluate "a full range" of possibilities for the property.
 
Jobs and Taxes
 After Friday hundreds of people at the Hoboken plant who made the company their life's work and are now 40 or 50 or older will be unemployed. And Hoboken will have only a small barge-repair company that employs 75 people left on the waterfront, said Peggy Thomas, director of Hoboken's Department of Planning and Community Development. "The biggest impact is the loss of jobs," she said.
Scores of workers who have been at the plant 30 years or more have said they are bitter at the way the closing was handled. James Reilly, who joined Maxwell House after graduating from high school 35 years ago, called the last year the worst of his life. "It's like we had a disease and have been wasting away," Mr. Reilly said. "It would have better if they shot us in the head."
Mr. Reilly, who lives in Jersey City, and other members of Local 56 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union say they were dealt a bad hand in the final contract negotiations. Mr. Reilly will not receive the pension or medical benefits he has been expecting because he will not turn 55 until next February.
He blames the union president, Leo Cinaglia, for negotiating an agreement that sets both 55 years of age and 25 years of seniority as minimum requirements for a pension. Mr. Cinaglia pleaded guilty in January to accepting payoffs from the owner of a meat-packing company in Pennsauken, N.J.
Ms. Redmond, the corporate affairs director for General Foods U.S.A., said the company had tried to negotiate a fair deal for its employees. She said it provided an extensive package of support services during the months leading to the closing, including an on-site transition team available for resume writing and other job services, a $2,500 stipend for those who want training in another field, even a Dale Carnegie course, bonuses for those who stayed on after the closing announcement and offers to relocate workers to other plants.
"The company recognizes that the employees have put in long years of loyal service," she said. "We really worked very hard to make the agreement as fair as possible."
Fourteen employees have moved to plants in Houston or Jacksonville, Ms. Redmond said.
Earlier this week, management negotiated a final agreement that added three months of medical benefits to the original severance package, which included at least three months of medical coverage.
Under the agreement, employees who will turn 55 by the end of the year may stay on with the company so they can retire with full pensions. Mr. Reilly is not among them.

HEADLINE: Democratic Convention Attracts Corporate Help

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
With the opening session of the Democratic National Convention four months away, New York City and the Democrats have begun lining up corporate sponsors for not necessarily partisan projects inside and outside Madison Square Garden.
The city said last month that A.T.& T., American Express, New York Telephone and Time Warner had pledged $2 million in cash, equipment and supplies to the New York '92 Host Committee, a nonpartisan public and private partnership set up to manage the city's convention preparations. 
 The four companies and the committee plan to recruit 6,000 volunteers and raise $6.5 million more for convention-related functions. A.T.& T. is providing computers and technical support for the host committee.
The city estimates it will spend $20.8 million to provide services and support for the convention, which is expected to generate $190 million in business. It will be held from July 13 through 16.
 
Special Services
 To help delegates find their way around, American Express will give them its "Pocket Guide to New York" and will charter buses to carry them and their families on a shopping spree. The delegates will also be able to consult a special convention telephone directory being donated by New York Telephone listing delegations, convention facilities and hotels.
Some of the convention-related projects are not for conventioneers only. New York Telephone is giving the host committee advertising display space on 400 telephone booths in the five boroughs, and Mayor David N. Dinkins announced plans yesterday for a nonpartisan students' guide to the Presidential election process.
The Board of Education will distribute the guide to 25,000 social studies teachers next month. Scholastic Inc., which will edit the guide, is spending $10,000 on the project and is donating additional labor costs. The New York Times gave the host committee $25,000 to finance the guide.
"There couldn't a better time to excite New York students about the electoral process than now," said Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times. "I believe the convention will galvanize the city as it did in 1976, when the city had gone through a similarly troubled economic time. Then, as now, many of us were down but not out."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Success in House Splits Party Leadership

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Just when the House Republican leaders have forced the Democrats into retreat over the House bank scandal, they are showing more strain than glee.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, today distanced himself from his second in command, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, whose slashing attacks on what he calls Democratic corruption have dominated the debate on the House bank. 
 "Newt's personality is Newt's, and mine is mine," Mr. Michel said at a breakfast with reporters today. "We each do our own thing. I am not in any position to tell Newt what to say or when to say it."
The differences between the two have more to do with style and tactics than with philosophy. Mr. Michel likes to go head to head with Democrats over policy matters on the floor by day and play gin rummy with them by night. Mr. Gingrich, for his part, plays political hardball every waking hour.
The fissures developing between the ranking House Republicans also reflect the fault lines emerging in their party as the comity of the Reagan era fades. Mr. Gingrich is somewhat more conservative than Mr. Michel, and he is more closely associated than Mr. Michel with Republicans like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp who promote supply-side economics.
 
'This Aura of Purity'
 Asked if most House Republicans supported the Gingrich tactic of aggressively politicizing the bank scandal, he said, "You better be doggone sure you are pure yourself before you take on all this aura of purity." He was clearly referring to Mr. Gingrich, who after several days of blaming Democrats acknowledged that he had overdrawn his own House bank account about 30 times, and to other prominent House Republicans who have written checks against insufficient funds.
"There are some in our side who say when they are on the ropes, push them over and revel in it," Mr. Michel said. By contrast, he said he himself had "devoted my entire professional life" to the House and concluded that "politics can be a respected profession."
Asked to comment on Mr. Michel's remarks, Mr. Gingrich said: "That's a very honest assessment. We are very different personalities. I tend to be more aggressive and risk-taking."
"I think Michel intellectually believes it is possible to have an honest bipartisan relationship with the current Democratic leadership, and I believe and have for a number of years that one of our major institutional obligations is to end a 38-year monopoly of power," he said. But he said he and Mr. Michel "coordinate on dozens of things" and that he hopes to someday serve as majority leader when Mr. Michel is Speaker.
Some Republicans are plainly uncomfortable with Mr. Gingrich's attack on Werner W. Brandt, the newly appointed acting sergeant-at-arms, who he suggested without offering evidence may have been involved in a cover-up of cocaine selling by an employee at the House post office.
"Nobody is comfortable with all the finger-pointing because clearly a sufficient number of prominent Republicans have become entangled," said Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois. "I'm speaking particularly of the Cabinet members whose embarrassment has been demonstrated. I rather think Mr. Gingrich started down the bobsled course before he realized the nature and extent of this entire debacle."
Three of President Bush's Cabinet officers called news conferences this week to announce that they, too, had overdrafts while they were House members.
At the same time, Mr. Hyde said that "some people feel Bob is too nice for his own good." Mr. Michel's remarks today, according to some members, could help toughen up his nice-guy image a bit.
 
Trying to Define Himself?
 "He's trying to define himself," said Representative Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican who thinks differences between Mr. Michel and Mr. Gingrich reflect a similar division over tactics and ideology in the national party. "There's a kind of leadership combat going under way."
The skirmishing comes as Mr. Michel is negotiating with Speaker Thomas S. Foley over working out a new system of House administration. Democrats hope to enlist Mr. Michel, thereby driving a wedge between Republican conservatives and moderates.
Mr. Gingrich has publicly said that he, too, is willing to work with Democrats as long as they are willing to share full responsibility and powers of administration, a position the Democratic leadership finds unacceptable.
Mr. Michel wants to create the post of chief financial officer, who would watch over the financial accounts now under the control of the House clerk. Democratic strategists think Mr. Michel's proposal has some merit, though they say his demand that the officer be selected by a two-thirds majority of the House would weaken Democratic control of the chamber. But Mr. Foley said today that he is prepared to compromise with Mr. Michel.
Privately, Democratic strategists say they expect that Mr. Gingrich will not allow Mr. Michel to compromise with the Democrats, since that would undercut efforts to exploit the bank affair and elect a Republican House majority in November.
At the breakfast today, Mr. Michel said he did not know if Mr. Gingrich planned to challenge him and run for leader after the election. Most Republicans say they do not believe Mr. Michel can be unseated, and they noted that White House officials have urged Mr. Michel to run for re-election and continue in his post. But a few Republican members say that Mr. Gingrich could gain the advantage and win the top leadership post should the Democrats win the White House, and House Republicans feel they need a more partisan and aggressive leader.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrowed In January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The merchandise trade deficit narrowed slightly in January to $5.77 billion, even though American exports fell for a third straight month, the Government said today.
The Bush Administration called the weakness in exports temporary, but private economists worried that the lull could prove more lasting and imperil chances to mount a sustained recovery. 
 The Commerce Department said the January trade deficit was 3.9 percent lower than December's $6 billion imbalance. Imports, held down by weak demand in the United States, dropped 1.4 percent, to $41.30 billion, while exports fell 1 percent, to $35.54 billion.
 
January Improvement Hailed
 The Administration, attacked on the campaign trail for failing to do enough to fight unfair foreign trade practices, hailed the January improvement in the overall deficit.
The new Commerce Secretary, Barbara Hackman Franklin, insisted that the long-term trend for American exports was still bright because of "growing U.S. competitiveness in world markets."
Last year, the merchandise trade deficit fell to an eight-year-low of $66.26 billion, down from $101.72 billion in 1990.
 
Rising Deficit Foreseen
 But many economists are forecasting that the deficit will resume its upward climb this year as the recovery spurs Americans' demand for imports and spreading weakness overseas cuts into export growth.
"The good news is that our economy has hit bottom and is coming out of the recession, but one of the costs of that rebound will be a wider trade deficit," said Jay Goldinger, an economist at Capital Insight, an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.
John Endean, a vice president with the American Business Conference, a trade group for mid-size corporations, said that United States companies would face growing competition from countries trying to make up for weak domestic demand by export sales.
"Japan and Germany are making no secret of their intention to ignite their faltering domestic economies through more exports and less imports," he said.
As usual, the country's largest deficit was rung up with Japan, at $3.82 billion in January, or two-thirds of the total, although that was down by $645 million from the December deficit. The second-biggest imbalance was with China, a deficit of $1.4 billion.
Japanese officials, concerned about an anti-Japan backlash in the United States, announced that they were lowering their voluntary limit on passenger-car shipments to the United States to 1.65 million a year, down from the current 2.3 million.
But United States auto makers blasted the announcement today, saying it would do little if nothing to lower the trade deficit between the two countries.
 
Surplus With E.C. Climbs
 America's surplus with the 12-nation European Community climbed by $713 million, to $1.88 billion in January. This gain was cited as an encouraging development by Stephen Cooney, trade expert at the National Association of Manufacturers.
The 1 percent drop in exports followed a 2.8 percent December decline and a 2.3 percent November drop. The decline was led by a $270 million decrease in sales of aircraft and parts and a drop of $283 million in farm shipments, reflecting weaker demand for soybeans in particular.
The 1.4 percent decline in imports was led by an 8 percent drop in petroleum imports, which fell to $3.62 billion in January. Non-petroleum imports were down a smaller seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $37.69 billion.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
Keeping tabs on legal fees means going after the people who are hired to go after people.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
"If a client does not complain about a bill, it isn't high enough." This aphorism was part of the lawyerly wit and wisdom John J. McCloy, the former diplomat and New York lawyer, gave each year to the tenderfoots in his law firm.
But such an attitude was by no means limited to Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. Reluctant to dirty themselves on such unseemly matters, lawyers long set their fees arbitrarily, often erring on the side of extravagance. Conversely, clients, either intimidated by counsel or unduly deferential to them, rarely kept close tabs. 
 In the last few years, though, as the economy has slumped, belts have tightened, and sentimental traditions have yielded to hard-headed pragmatism, all this has begun to change. For a fee, a number of companies will now monitor legal bills. The oldest and busiest, it seems, is Legalgard Inc. of Philadelphia.
In its promotional literature, the company describes its mission euphemistically. "Legalgard conducts an objective and detailed review of in-force attorney billing and utilization practices to determine a baseline for billing and case management problems and to identify opportunities for savings," it states. Translated into English, that means investigating ripoffs.
The growth of Legalgard, which primarily serves insurance companies and corporations, reflects the fertility of the territory. Begun only five years ago, it has expanded 300 percent annually ever since. It has opened branch offices in Woodland Hills, Calif., Tampa, Fla., and Chicago and now employs 80 people. Most are lawyers-turned-investigators, presumably familiar with all the fine points of padding.
"Lawyers were the last of the sacred cows, the last people on the face of the earth to be held accountable to anyone," said Legalgard's chairman, John J. Marquess. He recalled how, only a few years ago, a potential client of his balked at second-guessing his lawyer. "He told me, 'If you can't trust your lawyer, it's like not being able to trust your wife,' " Mr. Marquess said. "I told him, 'Based on what your legal costs have looked like for the last five years, maybe you should go home and check what your wife is doing.' "
Mr. Marquess, who practiced law for 15 years himself, said his investigators found irregularities on four of every five legal bills, ranging between 10 and 30 percent of the total. With legal fees in the United States totalling $100 billion a year, he said, "The target market is gigantic."
Since 1987, Mr. Marquess's minions have found all manner of machinations, including these:
*A lawyer in Century City, Cal. who, on three occasions, billed a client for 50-hour workdays. "I don't care what you say, nobody has an excuse for billing more than 24 hours a day," Mr. Marquess indignantly declared.
*A Los Angeles lawyer who charged a client in 135 separate cases for the same piece of legal research: the meaning of a "collapsed" condominium.
*A San Francisco law firm that passed on to clients the $17,000 cost of its program for summer law clerks -- all under the guise of "legal research." "It was really devious," Mr. Marquess said.
*Boston lawyers who billed their clients for the cost of either heating and air-conditioning their offices or commuting between their homes and offices.
*A lawyer in Cleveland who charged his client for the suit, shirts, and underwear he purchased in the midst of a long trial.
*A prominent New York law firm which charged $375 an hour for time spent by one of its partner to make photocopies.
*A Chicago law firm that put 79 of its 82 lawyers, along with all of its paralegals, on a single products-liability case, racking up a $6 million tab for work which, Mr. Marquess estimates, should have cost no more than $200,000. Another Chicago lawyer, he said, charged $25,000 for "ground transportation" during an assignment in San Francisco. "Either the attorney was renting a limousine on top of a rental car or was renting an escort," Mr. Marquess said.
*A firm in New Orleans that routinely billed four hours of work for letters that were one sentence long.
Since he signs confidentiality agreements with his clients, Mr. Marquess would not identify any of the malefactors. But he offered some clues.
Abuses, he said, tended initially to be more novel on the West Coast. But the worst offenders, he said, were the largest and ostensibly the most prestigious law firms, a fact he attributed to a combination of bureaucracy and arrogance.
"The big firms on Wall Street are having it both ways: they're billing $400 an hour and massaging the billings on top of that," he said. Their preferred modus operandi: overstaffing. "A matter that takes 10 lawyers and 3 paralegals in one firm will typically take 25 lawyers and 12 paralegals in New York," he said.

HEADLINE: Paul Ylvisaker, 70, Educator and Urban Planner

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Paul N. Ylvisaker, who championed cities and the urban underclass as a planner, government official, foundation executive and educator, died on Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 70 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
He died of heart failure, his family said. 
 Dr. Ylvisaker headed President Lyndon B. Johnson's Task Force on Cities and helped forge his model-cities program. As the Ford Foundation's public affairs director, he funneled money to social programs predating the Federal war on poverty.
Lamenting the decline of cities, he wrote in Life magazine: "Men may find God in nature, but when they look at cities they are viewing themselves. And what Americans see mirrored in their cities these days is not very flattering."
He taught at Princeton, Yale and Harvard, where he was also was the dean who led the Graduate School of Education in a sometimes wrenching decade of transformation. He remained on the faculty until his death, teaching ethics and philanthropy.
He served as New Jersey's first state Commissioner of Community Affairs. He unveiled a visionary concept of an urban complex for the Meadowlands, then a marshland of foxtail reeds and world-class garbage dumps. He headed a commission that ended decades of deadlock and eventually led to the construction of the stadium, arena and racetrack and nearby stores and housing.
He also proved to be a man of courage and gritty street smarts. Soon after he took office, in 1967, riots erupted in Newark, killing 26 people. In the tense aftermath, the State Police and the National Guard were conducting a house-to-house search for weapons in Plainfield. Leading the contingent were four armored personnel carriers, mounted with machine guns and loaded with soldiers bristling with bayoneted rifles, pistols and submachine guns.
Fearing the ominous symbolism and possible reaction, he ran into the street waving his arms in front of the convoy and shouting, "Stop! Stop! This is a peaceful community." The vehicles halted. After he conferred with authorities, the search resumed, but in less provocative jeeps.
 
Harvard Degrees
 Dr. Ylvisaker (pronounced EL-vuh-saw-ker) was born in St. Paul. His father was a Lutheran minister and college president. He graduated from Mankato State Teachers College in 1942 and at Harvard earned a master's degree in public administration in 1945 and a doctorate in political economics and government in 1948.
Leaving government in 1970, he taught at Princeton and Yale.
He returned to Harvard as dean in 1972, when Federal grants were drying up and enrollment was plummeting. He guided the education school to explore broad education theory and philosophy and child development. In later years, he focused on practicality, with courses on politics, computers, school leadership and community support. He also expanded the ratio of women and minorities among students and faculty.
His wife of 44 years, Elizabeth, died last year. He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth of Meredith, N.H.; three sons, Mark, of Fort Myers, Fla., Peter, of Hightstown, N.J., and David, of Washington; two brothers, John, of Michigan, and David, of Indiana, and two sisters, Elizabeth Brush, of Florida and Barbara Newsom, of New Hampshire.

The Last Picture Show? Not if He Can Help It

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J.

 BODY:
BOB AND ESTELLE SPIEWAK shuffled ahead in the movie line, along with dozens of others outside the Movie City Theater on Cedar Lane here. The line moved unusually fast. In fact, the line itself was unusual in this old dark downtown.
Soon, the Spiewaks confronted Melissa Paget, the teen-age cashier. 
 "Two please," said Mr. Spiewak.
"That's $2," said Miss Paget.
"No," said Mr. Spiewak, controlling his impatience with another moronic youth, "we want two tickets."
"That's $2," repeated Miss Paget, controlling her impatience with another adult who'd yet to hear the good news. "Tickets are $1 each."
Yeah, right, thought the Spiewaks, real New York types who scanned the lobby for the bad news. Perhaps this was a scratchy film print or a benefit for the Reverend Moon. Above the candy counter hung a sign: "Popcorn $1. Drinks $1. Candy $1." O.K., but how long is this suspicious sale?
"It's permanent," said Howard Grant, who ought to know. He's the owner, who's determined to ride the recession into prosperity with a ridiculous, revolutionary thought for an often economically myopic America: lower prices might increase sales in tough times. If New Jersey can survive a gas war with fuel prices below $1 a gallon, how about a movie war with $1 tickets? So far, the first few thousand customers seem up to the shock.
"This is great!" Roger Nelson said. "It gets people out of their homes and we'll have a community again."
"I can handle this," said Benno Groeneveld, who handed Miss Paget a $5 bill and received $1 back with four (!) tickets. With popcorn, drinks and free parking, the entire evening cost his family $12.
And Mr. Grant's three screens are not showing "Godzilla's Revenge" or obscure Angst epics from prewar Sweden. Tonight, he's offering "The Prince of Tides," "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot," "Shining Through" and "Father of the Bride." This weekend's matinees are "Hook" and "My Girl." All shows are $1 at all times.
For $1, who cares about Mr. Grant's economics but, briefly, here's how it works: Movie City gets only 10 percent of the $6.07 after-tax income on a $6.50 first-run ticket. That's about 61 cents. Film distributors keep the rest. On an almost first-run show, one that's been out a month or two, Movie City keeps about 65 percent of the 93-cent after-tax ticket price, or 61 cents.
That's the same. But people weren't paying $6.50 at this theater just west of the George Washington Bridge. Faced with a recession's uncertainties, they stayed home with free TV or rental movies. Movie City routinely closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Other times only a handful appeared. "Many nights," Mr. Grant said, "it wasn't worth turning on the heat." On the weekend before $1 tickets began in February, 212 people paid $6.50.
Last weekend, 3,782 people flowed through the turnstile at $1 each; two-thirds also bought food. "I'm very excited," said Mr. Grant, a pigtailed, 39-year-old cinematic impresario who's loved movies since the 50-cent double features of his youth on the Jersey Shore.
The National Association of Theater Owners says it's been 28 years since movie prices averaged $1 nationally. That was back when "Mary Poppins," "Goldfinger," "Doctor Zhivago" and "Zorba the Greek" packed them in. Today the average at the nation's 23,814 screens is $4.50.
Mr. Grant thinks he may be on to something at his 61-year-old Art Deco cinema, which he bought in 1984. He divided it into three theaters and watched attendance dwindle. "Now," he said, "if we can keep these weekend numbers and boost weeknights, we'll make it work."
He also regards himself as an admittedly less-than-altruistic educator. "People are used to two movie dates," he said. "First-run right away and video rentals months later. Now, I want them also to think of nearly first-run one month later for only one buck."
The words "one buck" seem to spread quickly in the New York area. Movie City's three phones ring constantly. Callers this week even sought directions from Staten Island, where using a bridge for one minute now costs more than a 90-minute movie.
"We've lived here 20 years," said LaRease Limerick, "but we got out of the movie habit. This is fun and exciting. Cedar Lane is full of evening life again."
Here's something else weird. When one $6.50 movie ended, some people always tried to sneak into a second film. But for $1, they're more honest. They actually pay again. "I don't remember when I last saw people make a two-movie night of it," said Mr. Grant, who was smiling as Mr. Spiewak turned back toward the cashier with his two $1 tickets and a question.
"What about a senior-citizen discount?"
"Good luck," Mr. Grant replied.

Long-Term Rates Drop Below 8%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell below 8 percent yesterday, continuing a cautious downward move that began earlier in the week.
Trading volume, however, was once again light, and participants said that despite the improvement the negative tone dominating the market for much of the last two months remained largely intact. 
 Searching for reasons to explain the rise in bond and note prices, traders said much of the move was a correction from oversold positions at the end of last week. And foreign accounts are doing some buying, they said.
"Some overseas demand is showing up, mainly from Europe," one government bond trader said. "Most of those countries are looking at elections of one sort or another fairly soon, and some investors who had been saying they wanted to be in dollar-denominated assets are moving money now. Also, we have heard of Middle Eastern money moving money out of short-term securities and into 10-year and 30-year issues."
 
'No Politicians Were Talking'
 Jay Goldinger, a principal at Capital Insight, a bond brokerage firm in Beverly Hills, Calif., said Japanese investors purchased securities during overnight trading in Tokyo.
Mr. Goldinger and others also said that the market benefited yesterday from the absence of important new economic reports and the increased possibility that Congress and the White House will reach a stalemate over a fiscal stimulus package.
"No politicians were talking," Mr. Goldinger said. "The market has tended to do better when that happens."
Today is the deadline President Bush set for Congress to enact his economic plan to stimulate the economy. An alternative plan forged by Democrats in the House and Senate is almost certain to be vetoed.
Credit market participants have worried for months that lawmakers would cobble together a package so stimulative that it would rekindle inflation and add to the already burgeoning Federal budget deficit.
For the most part, traders shrugged off a drop in weekly unemployment claims and trade data showing that exports fell for the third consecutive month.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10013/32 , up 14/32 , to yield 7.96 percent, compared with 8.00 percent late Wednesday.
It is the first time bond yields have closed below 8 percent in more than a week.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year securities were offered at 9921/32 , up 3/8 point, to yield 7.54 percent. The 6 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 9830/32 , up 6/32 , to yield 7.00 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 9910/32 , up 2/32 , to yield 5.75 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills were unchanged or down slightly.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 4.04 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, or a hundredth of a percentage point, to 4.21 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by four basis points, to a late-offered rate of 4.45 percent.
 
Many Corporate Debt Issues
 Issuance of new corporate debt securities was heavy.
By far the largest amount of new debt priced was a two-part, $2.07 billion offering of securities backed by auto loan receivables from the General Motors Assistance Corporation.
One part of the offering consists of $1.066 billion of senior certificates with an average life of 0.64 years.
These 5.20 percent securities were priced at $100, or par, to yield 5.256 percent.
The remaining $1.012 billion of the issue was sold as senior certificates with an average life of 1.32 years.
The 5.95 percent securities were priced at $99.968 to yield 6.05 percent.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Philip Morris Companies offered $350 million worth of five-year notes through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 7.50 percent notes were priced at $99.50 to yield 7.662 percent, 60 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 6 3/4 percent five-year notes at the time of pricing.
The noncallable notes are rated A-2 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
The Kroger Corporation offered $175 million worth of high-yield junk bonds through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 12-year, 9 3/4 percent securities were priced at $100, or par.
The issue is rated B-1 by Moody's and B by Standard & Poor's.
 
M3 Off $4.2 Billion
 In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply it tracks on a weekly basis rose during the week ended March 9.
M-3, the broadest money measure, fell by $4.2 billion.
The money numbers were in line with market expectations, and had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall In Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The number of workers filing for first-time jobless benefits fell in the first week of March, the Goverment said today, but analysts said it was too early to predict an upturn in the job market.
 The Labor Department said 433,000 people filed new claims for state jobless benefits in the week that ended March 7, down from a revised 460,000 the previous week. 
 The drop of 27,000 was larger than expected, as private economists, on average, had forecast a decline of only 6,000.
 But despite other signs the economy is healing, analysts said they do not expect a significant improvement in the job market until a recovery has been under way for several months. They cite the normal lag between the time business activity picks up and companies start rehiring workers.
 Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International, said it was too early to say whether the claims figure heralded a recovery in the job market. The nation's unemployment rate hit 7.3 percent last month, the highest in six and a half years.
 
 
New Claims Average
 The department said the four-week average number of new claims, considered a more accurate measure of the job market, slipped to 447,000 from 451,750 in the period ended Feb. 29.
 Economists monitor new jobless claims as a barometer of the labor market and the overall economy.
 The department said Michigan, Texas and California reported the biggest drops in new claims. Michigan officials said the 4,423 drop in filings was a result of fewer layoffs by auto makers.
 Missouri was the only state with an increase in claims of more than 1,000. The state said its 1,699 new claims were a result of layoffs in the food processing and transportation industries.

HEADLINE: Job Cuts Set In Bank Deal

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 19

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said today that it expects to eliminate 10,000 to 12,000 jobs over the next three years after its planned merger with the Security Pacific Corporation.
BankAmerica said that the actual number of employees laid off would probably be fewer than 10,000 to 12,000 because of attrition. The company did not say where the job losses would occur. It is expected, though, that a large number will be in Los Angeles, where Security Pacific is based, and also in San Francisco, where BankAmerica has its headquarters. 
 The two banks now have a combined work force of 91,000. In addition to the positions to be eliminated, the work force will be reduced by the sale of branches to satisfy antitrust concerns.
The number of job reductions has been one of the major unanswered questions about the huge merger, contributing to apprehension about the deal, particularly in California, where the economy is already weak and where both banks have most of their employees.
Cutting the work force is key to BankAmerica's plan to save $1.2 billion in annual operating expenses from the combined bank. Without such a saving, the purchase of Security Pacific, which is troubled by bad loans, would be hard to justify.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Carried Higher By Report on Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed up yesterday in sluggish trading, carried higher by the Government's report of a decline in the trade deficit.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit improved slightly in January, falling 3.9 percent from December, to $5.77 billion, the lowest level in two months. 
 Kermit Claytor, a currency market analyst with MMS International, said that the dollar rose on the trade report, but that trading was slow, with traders reluctant to make major commitments.
"We'd need a rather convincing event to break out of the dollar ranges on either side," Mr. Claytor said. "There's more scope for a downside move on a bad number than an upside move on a better-than-expected number."
Dollar trading has been lethargic since last week, when the Government released solid retail sales figures that did not move the dollar as expected.
"It's discouraging when you fail to see a significant rally," Mr. Claytor said.
Some analysts attributed yesterday's sluggish trading to a snowstorm in New York that caused some dealers to head home early.
Another Government report showed that the number of newly laid-off workers applying for state unemployment insurance fell in the first week of March, to 433,000. That represented a drop of 27,000 from the previous week and was a sign of an improving economy, which makes the dollar more attractive to investors.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 133.65 Japanese yen, up from 132.30 late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 132.55 yen from 133.20. Later, in London, it rose to 133.30 yen.
The dollar was also higher against the German mark in New York, closing at 1.67125 marks, up from late Wednesday's 1.6535. In earlier European trading, the dollar closed at 1.6705 marks, up from 1.6500.
The British pound also fell against the dollar in New York, slipping to $1.71075, from $1.7280 late Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.7105, from $1.7320 late Wednesday.

Drug Stocks Slip Into the Doldrums

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
THE big drug stocks got off to a dreary start in 1992, losing more than 11 percent of their value in 10 weeks. Some equity fund managers were quick to cut back their holdings, having profited from strong price rises in December.
Hoping for an economic upturn, many funds moved away from supposedly recession-proof stocks like drugs, food and beverages to cyclicals like autos, banks, chemicals and paper. 
 "It wasn't a dumping of the pharmaceutical shares but a lightening of positions," said Ray Pryor, a partner in New York with McCormick & Pryor, a stock-monitoring and proxy-solicitation firm. "As for the larger companies like Merck," he said, "the funds almost have to own them."
Much depends on when the economy comes back, analysts said. If it does not strengthen, many large investors will probably resume buying drug stocks later this year.
In the scramble, block trading in the 10 largest drug and diversified health-care companies soared to 100 million shares a month in January and February, up from an average of 80 million in 1991, according to Autex, a Thomson Financial Services unit, which records large sales and purchases by institutional investors. John Boehmke, an Autex product manager in Boston, said Pfizer led the group last month with 15 million shares in block trades. Warner-Lambert, hit by disappointing news concerning Lopid, its leading cholesterol-lowering product, was next at 12 million shares.
Anthony Forstmann, a partner in Forstmann Leff Associates, an institutional money manger with $3.5 billion in assets, said his firm had trimmed its holdings in the big drug companies to 8 percent, from 10 to 12 percent in December. "Our biggest position is Pfizer," he said. "We thought the stock was fully priced when it got to over 20 times 1993 estimated earnings." Pfizer has since fallen back to 17 times the 1993 estimate, closing at $70.875 yesterday.
But like many fund managers, Mr. Forstmann is enthusiastic about Pfizer's rich pipeline of new products like Zithromax, an antibiotic that the company started selling this week. "I still love Pfizer long term," he said.
Some of the largest funds, like the California Public Employees Retirement System, are indexed to mirror the entire market and do not follow industry-by-industry investing strategies. Others, like the $45 billion College Retirement Equities Fund, are standing pat, taking a long-range view.
Courtney Kling, a pharmaceutical analyst in New York with the college retirement fund, said it had made no big changes in its $3.15 billion drug portfolio, which included 6.9 million Pfizer shares on Dec. 31. Her fund had the company's third largest institutional holding, according to CDA/ Spectrum, which compiles Securities and Exchange 13(f) institutional portfolio filings. Fidelity was first with 11.8 million shares of Pfizer, followed by Jennison Associates with 6.3 million shares.
Pfizer makes up 11 percent of the $965 million Fidelity Select Healthcare Fund, said Andrew Offit, the fund's manager. Fidelity replaced some drug stocks with other pharmaceuticals, he added. He also likes Upjohn, which he says is undervalued.
Hemant K. Shah, an analyst with HKS & Company in Warren, N.J., projected the average earnings growth for the big pharmaceuticals to be a strong 12 percent in 1992, down from 15 percent last year. He said stock prices were rising on average by about 7 percent, down from 10 to 12 percent increases in 1991.
Drug prices are under growing pressure from large buyers like hospitals and insurers, which can often choose among similar products and cheaper generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection. "The decline will have a big effect on their bottom lines," Mr. Shah said. He recommends Upjohn, Warner-Lambert and Glaxo P.L.C. "American Home Products, with a 3.4 percent dividend yield, is an opportunity for a conservative investor," he added.
Neil B. Sweig, an analyst with Brenner Securities in New York, said the three months ending March 31 "will probably turn out to be one of the worst quarters for drug stocks in the past 10 years." He likes American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly and Syntex for the short term, adding Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer as longer-term choices.
Mr. Offit at Fidelity looks at a brighter side. Although his health-care stocks have declined by about 10 percent since Jan. 1, he said, they had risen about 15 percent in December. He added, "This is hardly the end of health care."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Forecasting Tool Gives Nod to Bush

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WILL the moderate economic recovery that now seems to be getting under way be enough to keep President Bush in the White House for four more years?
The answer is yes, according to an econometric forecasting equation developed by Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale University. The Fair equation, estimated from data covering all Presidential elections from 1916 through 1988, predicts that Mr. Bush will win 57.2 percent of the popular vote in November on the assumption that the American economy grows by only 1.6 percent this year, the latest consensus forecast of the 51 leading economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. The consensus is for 3.1 percent inflation this year. 
 The Fair equation derives its predictions of Presidential elections from three major factors -- the growth rate of real per capita gross national product in the second and third quarters of the election year, the rate of inflation during the two-year period prior to the election and a one percentage point bonus for incumbent Presidents or candidates from their own party.
In the last 19 Presidential elections, the equation, applied retroactively, made only three wrong calls, each in very close elections. In 1960, John F. Kennedy defeated Richard M. Nixon by winning 50.1 percent of the popular vote, not losing by the predicted 49.2 percent. In 1968, Hubert H. Humphrey lost to Mr. Nixon, getting only 49.6 percent, not the model's predicted 51.3 percent. And in 1976, Jimmy Carter beat Gerald R. Ford, winning 51.1 percent of the vote, more than the predicted 49.6 percent. If the one percentage point bonus for incumbency had been left out of the equation, the model's predictions would have been right for all three elections.
The model has hit the last three elections almost on the nose. It predicted that Ronald Reagan would defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980 by 55.4 percent; Mr. Reagan actually got 55.3 percent. In 1984, the equation predicted 58.3 percent for Mr. Reagan over Walter F. Mondale; Mr. Reagan actually got 59.2 percent. And in 1988, the model predicted that Michael S. Dukakis would get 46.8 percent of the two-party vote against Mr. Reagan; Mr. Dukakis actually got 46.1 percent. Thus, in these elections, the Fair equation called the point spreads with average errors of less than six-tenths of 1 percent.
How reliable is the Fair equation likely to be in predicting that President Bush will beat Gov. Bill Clinton, who now seems to have the Democratic nomination sewed up after Paul Tsongas's withdrawal yesterday?
Mr. Fair states that the equation would have to be off by a bigger margin than it has ever been since 1916 for Mr. Bush to lose. Its biggest error was in 1964 when it predicted that President Lyndon B. Johnson would defeat Barry Goldwater by just 54.2 percent of the two-party vote; Mr. Johnson actually got 61.3 percent, a 7.1 percentage point miss. A miss of that size in 1992 would bring Mr. Bush's winning margin down to 50.1 percent.
But that prediction is on the assumption that the economy continues to advance in the second and third quarters. Even so, according to Mr. Fair, "It takes a very bad economy to defeat a Republican incumbent running again." With inflation low and likely to stay low, he contends that the only way Mr. Bush would be in danger of defeat would be if the economic recovery aborted, as it did last spring, and fell back into recession between now and November. The Federal Reserve is not likely to let that happen.
Is there, nevertheless, a chance that this time the Fair model could be wrong, even if the economy continues to advance at a moderate pace and the inflation rate stays down?
One reason this business-cycle-based political forecasting equation might be wrong is that this has not been a characteristic short-term recession but a long-term period of structural adjustment, to which the model might not apply in catching the mood of the electorate. During Mr. Bush's first three years in office, the economy has had one of the slowest growth records in its history: 2.5 percent in 1989, 1 percent in 1990 and negative seven-tenths of 1 percent in 1991. If the real growth this year comes in at 1.6 percent, the four-year average for Mr. Bush's first term would be just 1 percent per annum -- not enough to sustain the growth of the labor force.
Another reason is that the recovery is extremely uneven. Some states like New York, California and Connecticut still seem in deep trouble. Defense cutbacks are hurting some areas. With unemployment last month at 7.3 percent, its highest level of this recession, some big manufacturers like General Motors have announced big plant closings and layoffs still to come. Worries about America's role in the world economy intensify uncertainties.
The Fair model's bonus to incumbent Presidents may apply under normal circumstances, but this year there appears to be what many commentators are calling an "anti-incumbency" mood among voters, who could make this election exceptional. It seems too soon to lock up the November election in a forecasting equation.

HEADLINE: Review/Opera;
A 'Coq d'Or' That's Plain But Not Bad To Look At

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
Cultural adversaries for so much of this century, Russian and American music have tended to sin in the same directions: toward love of size, the pursuit of technique for its own sake, the confusing of pressure and intensity with beauty.
Indeed, when the Bolshoi Opera brought "Eugene Onegin" to New York last year, many listeners were unhappily surprised to find Tchaikovsky's delicate domestic drama smothered, and all but lost, in a gargantuan set and sprawling production. For operagoers knowledgeable in Franco Zeffirelli's inflations of Puccini and Verdi at the Metropolitan Opera, the experience was not the delight of discovery but disappointment born of the depressingly familiar. 
 Now comes the mild and modest St. Petersburg National Opera, formerly, and better known as, the Maly Opera and a David among Goliaths in the current war of touring Russian companies. The second item in the St. Petersburg's three-opera repertory at the New York State Theater had its first showing on Wednesday night: "Le Coq d'Or" by Rimsky-Korsakov. Reversing the established process -- a slender framework burdened with grandiosity -- this ensemble takes a work aspiring to spectacle and reduces it to living-room size.
This postage-stamp "Coq d'Or" is often wise, but it is a wisdom in part forced on it by hard times. Without the visual means to render Arabian Nights settings in all their luxury, the St. Petersburg looks to dependable singing and a staging that catches the sly humor of Pushkin's original. City walls are formed by patchwork drapes that rise and fall. King Dodon's beloved bed assumes wheels and becomes his war vehicle. It is a deft little touch of surreality that also doesn't cost much.
Mythic beasts, winged and with bulging breasts, parade with modesty. The golden rooster of Rimsky-Korsakov's title has wings made to flap endearingly as it signals the approach of enemies. Dancing girls create simple patterns on this smallish stage. The men -- from simple warriors to the King himself -- move in a measured, high-stepping prance that is perhaps the Slavic equivalent of Groucho Marx's famous gait.
This is an opera about stupidity in high places, which may account for its trouble with government censors of the time. (The premiere of "Le Coq d'Or" was withheld until a year after Rimsky-Korsakov's death in 1908.) Its performance problems are at the same time its greatest assets as an opera: the need for singers who can dance. For when they are found, the dancing serves as a powerful illusion of dramatic continuity, keeping our eyes occupied when the music stops for a vocal set piece.
Valery Kochkin as King Dodon galumphs nicely in his balletic scene. He is subtly, not blatantly, ridiculous and the frayed tone and intonation are happy representations of befuddled middle age.
One rejoiced in the clear, healthy tenor of Anatoly Voropayev, yet such a young sound emanating from such an aged Astrologer was a little disconcerting. As the Queen of Shama khan, Yelena Ustinova found the high notes, but her paleness of sound and an unhappy habit of drifting into sharpness gave her performance an ephemeral, uncentered quality.
Aleksandr Nenadovsky (Prince Afron), Aleksandr Petrov (Prince Guidon), Leonid Gladkov (General Polkan), Tatyana Cherkassova (the Rooster's voice) and Nina Potasheva (Amelfa) were all strong performers. Vladimir Ziva conducted an orchestra whose lightness and clarity matched the stage with some exactness.
Those expecting visual tricks -- and there are arguments that grand opera owes us a few -- will find none here. The Queen disappears not in a cloud of smoke or through some trapdoor but simply behind a crowd of courtiers. We are also deprived of the rooster's deadly attack on Dodon; he is revealed after the fact, an inanimate prop perched on his forehead. Perhaps this production does err on the side of simplicity; but if its means approach primitiveness, its execution does not. The St. Petersburg National Opera offers a stage work, stripped of its fancy clothes. The bare body revealed is not at all hard to look at.
"Le Coq d'Or" repeats twice on Sunday, again on March 28, and then again on April 2 and 3.
 
Le Coq d'Or
Opera in three acts by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, libretto by V. Belsky, after a story by Pushkin; conductor, Vladimir Ziva; director, Stanislav Gaudassinsky; sets by Aleksandr Gorenshtein; costumes by Yekaterina Rapai. Performed by the St. Petersburg National Opera at the New York State Theater.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 7.15 Points, To 3,261.40

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday in heavy trading as investors bought into the market for a number of reasons, including a strong bond market, a larger-than-expected drop in weekly jobless claims and a rebound in the Tokyo stock market.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.15 points to finish at 3,261.40, with buying sustained by professional traders ahead of the "triple witching" expiration of certain options yesterday and today. 
 The rally in the bond market pushed the yield on the Treasury's long bond below 8 percent for the first time in days, making it a less attractive alternative to stocks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy, at 197.3 million shares, up from 194.1 million on Wednesday, as advances outnumbered declines by 926 to 781.
Some investors were on the sidelines ahead of yesterday's portion of the triple witching, anticipating increased volatility at the end, but some traders noted that over that last few years the unwinding process, or closing of positions, had begun to take place days before the deadline.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.65 point, to 409.80, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 1.20 points, to 402.17. In Nasdaq trading, the composite was up 1.02 points, to 625.96, with the Russell 2,000 up 0.32 point, to 208.47.
Bernard Spilko, a senior vice president at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer, also noted the lack of volatility at the end of the session. "S.& P. put-call ratios were about even," he said. "Therefore, little volatility is expected today."
Helping to shore up stocks here is the "nervousness in the Euromarkets, coupled with anticipation of a continuing strong U.S. dollar, which is bringing foreign investors into the U.S. equity market," Mr. Spilko said.
"This market is likely to trade in a range of 3,200 to 3,300 on the Dow for the next several months," he continued."The upside potential is limited because the market is ahead of itself, and the downside is cushioned by investors looking for better yields than six-month maturities are offering."
In trading yesterday, takeover rumors were behind Warner-Lambert's rise of 1 1/2, to 65. Talk among the trading desks had it that Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. planned to make a bid to acquire the seventh-largest pharmaceutical company in the United States, which declined comment.
But Kent Blair, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., said he did not believe it likely that Glaxo was interested, because it had repeatedly said it did not want to make a major acquisition outside the pharmaceutical industry.
Ford Motor jumped to its highest level in a year on expectations, traders said, that the auto maker would turn a small profit in the first quarter, after incurring $2.8 billion in losses over the last five quarters.
On Wednesday, Jack Kirnan, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said Ford should report a profit of 25 cents a share, based on improved margins and lower incentives. The stock closed at 40 1/8, up 1 1/8, on nearly five million shares traded.

HEADLINE: Mr. Tsongas Departs, Gracefully

 BODY:
The fatal flaw in Paul Tsongas's campaign was that his message never reached much beyond well-educated, upper-income voters. But there was something unusually principled about his quest for the Democratic Presidential nomination. He was consistent, honest, uncalculating. His presence will be missed in the forthcoming Connecticut and New York primaries.
Mr. Tsongas ended his campaign yesterday, citing a depleted war chest. He may also have decided he could not recover from his poor showing in Illinois and Michigan. Whatever the reason, his withdrawal becomes him. He never pretended to be other than what he is, a public-spirited citizen with interesting ideas, an understated style and a self-deprecating sense of humor. In the same spirit, he concluded that it would be dishonorable to masquerade as a viable candidate when all he could really be was a spoiler. 
 Mr. Tsongas refused to alter his positions to satisfy different constituencies. He broached the possibility of reducing cost of living increases for Social Security recipients, though that was political suicide in Florida. His call for sharply higher gasoline taxes alienated voters everywhere, though it's the best energy policy imaginable. And he resisted the shameless strategies of other Democrats for a nearly useless middle-class tax cut.
But in the end his remedies for reviving the economy were too one-sided to build a broad coalition. His basic solution was to boost corporate investment. Yet when Bill Clinton urged investment in people as well -- through retraining and broader educational opportunities -- Mr. Tsongas's program seemed narrow by comparison.
There is little doubt, however, that Paul Tsongas is a decent man with much to offer. With characteristic humor, he said yesterday that though he was no longer available for the Presidency he would happily become president of the Speedo bathing suit company -- a reference to photographs showing him doing laps in the pool, fully recovered from the cancer that forced him to leave the Senate.
Here's a better suggestion: Why not contrive another way back to public service? The country would be richer for it.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
The Exclusive, Haute Training of Arazi

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAMORLAYE, France, March 19

 BODY:
A videocassette is making the rounds in this small, thoroughbred-rich community an hour's drive north from Paris. It is a cassette containing footage of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in Churchill Downs last Nov. 2, a race in which a Lamorlaye resident named Arazi exploded past 13 other horses to win by 4 3/4 lengths and become an instant Kentucky Derby favorite.
"We've all seen it five or six times," said Yves de Chevigny, director of the training sites in Lamorlaye and nearby Chantilly. "Arazi was the Porsche. The others were the motor scooters." 
 Robert Durepaire, Arazi's assistant trainer, prefers another analogy: "It was like an American film. The horse starts in last place to build the suspense. Then he blows everybody away for the happy ending. I just hope this film isn't finished."
Durepaire need not worry; the suspense is building again. Arazi, the Kentucky-born chestnut colt with the extra gear, has resumed full workouts in Lamorlaye under the watch of his silver-haired French trainer, Francois Boutin. Horse and trainer spend the early morning on an enormous, rolling expanse of terrain called "Les Aigles," a short walk from Boutin's estate and 200-horse stable. Arazi spends the remainder of the day in an inconspicuous barn at the end of a narrow street lined with middle-class residences.
 
Trying to Be a European First
 No European-trained horse has won the Kentucky Derby (the British-trained Bold Arrangement finished second in 1986), but an Arazi victory would be more than a coup for Old World racing. It would set a precedent for economical preparation. American-trained 3-year-olds normally race three, four or five times before trying the mile-and-a-quarter Derby. Arazi will only race once: in the 1,600-meter Prix Omnium in Saint Cloud, France, on April 7.
That race, like most in this country, will be on grass. Boutin selected it, in part, because Saint Cloud is the only major French track where horses run clockwise, as they do in the United States, instead of counterclockwise.
According to Churchill Downs records, which date only to 1955, no horse has raced in the Kentucky Derby with only one start as a 3-year-old. Fifteen have raced with two starts in that span, including one winner, Sunny's Halo in 1983.
"I think that for Arazi, one race is enough," said Boutin. "Maybe I'm fooling myself, and if things don't work out, people can say it's my fault. But Arazi is a horse who ran a lot as a 2-year-old. He doesn't need a lot of racework to show what he can do. He prepares very quickly. He's not a horse to put on weight. This should be no problem for him."
 
Was This Really Necessary?
 Boutin, 55, is a farmer's son from the Normandy region who has been one of France's top trainers for the last decade. He expressed confidence in the health of his colt, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery in Kentucky to remove bone chips in his left and right forelegs just four days after his Breeders' Cup victory.
"He's fine. I see no difference," Boutin said. "But I must admit that personally, I was against the operation. It wasn't necessary. He wasn't
suffering in the least."
The decision to operate was made by Arazi's co-owners: Allen E. Paulson, an American aerospace executive, and Sheik Mohammed ibn Rashid al-Maktoum of Dhubai, who purchased a half share of the colt last October.
"After we bought our share, we had Arazi X-rayed all over, and they picked up some small lesions on his knees," said Anthony Stroud, a Briton who manages Sheik Mohammed's breeding farm in Newmarket. "The veterinarians recommended arthroscopic removal, and we believe in listening to veterinarians."
 
Safe in His Stall
 Arazi resumed light workouts in France in mid-December and resumed full workouts on Feb. 15. The two thick bandages he wears in his stall are the only physical evidence of the operation. "Just a precaution," Durepaire said. "We don't want him banging into anything."
The majority of Arazi's work is done on the sand tracks that rim Les Aigles, which is the centerpiece of a thoroughbred community that includes 100 trainers and over 3,000 horses. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, Arazi takes to the grass, where he runs in a group of other horses in an attempt to simulate competition. This approach is rare in the United States, where horses often train alone on the same dirt tracks where they race.
Although Arazi will not race on dirt before the Derby, Boutin plans to run him twice on the dirt track in Lamorlaye, which is the only dirt track in France and based partly on the design of Santa Anita in California. Arazi trained there before the Breeders' Cup.
 
A Smooth Transition
 "I think Arazi already has proved that he can make the transition from grass to dirt," said the American trainer Charlie Whittingham. "He blew by them others like they were tied."
While Americans are busy comparing him to Secretariat and Swaps, the French are busy comparing him to their Sea Bird, who in 1965 won the Epsom Derby, the most prestigious race in Europe. "We see a horse like this once every 30 years," said de Chevigny.
The French are quick to point out that his sire, Blushing Groom, and mother, Danseur Fabuleux, each trained for a time in France.
"Arazi is really very French in his style," Boutin said. "In my mind, he's most marked by Weld Risk, a French horse who was the grandfather of Blushing Groom. I knew Weld Risk well. He could handle distance, and I think Arazi can, too."
Arazi came to Lamorlaye in December 1990, after Boutin picked him out of a group of Paulson's yearlings who had been selected for their "European" potential. "Mr. Paulson's manager showed me 12 horses, and I was permitted to choose five," Boutin said. "I liked Arazi from the start."
The colt placed second in his first race as a 2-year old and then won his next six starts -- all on grass -- heading into the Breeders' Cup. His first victory came in a low-level 1,200-meter race; his last three came in Grade I events, including the 1,600-meter Grand Criterium, France's most prestigious race for 2-year-olds.
"He's got a big engine, simple as that," said John Hammond, an Englishman who is one of the top trainers in France. "And like all great horses, he has a marvelous turn of foot." Arazi also appears to be blessed with a fine temperament. First-time visitors to his stall are greeted with a rub of the nose and a lick.
"He's very curious about everything around him and extremely easy-going," said Raymond Lamonarca, Arazi's groom and exercise rider. "He can fall asleep in a flash. Nothing seems to bother him. You put some horses on an airplane, and they panic. You put Arazi on an airplane, and it's just like another day in his stall."
Arazi has grown about a half-inch and gained some weight in his haunches since his 2-year-old campaign but remains a colt of average size and unremarkable appearance.
"He's not a whole lot to look at," said jockey Steve Cauthen, who won the Triple Crown aboard Affirmed in 1978 and will ride Arazi for the first time in Saint Cloud. "But once he starts moving, he's exceptional. He reminds me a lot of Affirmed in comportment and demeanor and intelligence. My only hope is that I get to ride him more than once."
 
Two Jockeys, Two Continents
 Because of a pre-purchase agreement between Sheik Mohammed and Paulson, Cauthen, who is based in England and under contract with the Sheik, will ride Arazi only in Europe. When Arazi races in the United States, he will wear Paulson's colors and be ridden by Paulson's jockey of choice, Patrick Valenzuela.
"It would, of course, be better to have just one jockey," Boutin said. "But what can we do?"
The more provocative question is what Arazi will do if he wins the Kentucky Derby. Paulson would like Arazi to race for the Triple Crown, but there is a strong possibility that the colt would skip the final two legs and return to Europe to train for the Epsom Derby on June 3 in England. No horse has ever won the Kentucky Derby and Epsom Derby.
"We will discuss it with Mr. Paulson prior to the Kentucky Derby and probably won't arrive at any decisions until after," Stroud said. "Obviously, we would favor a European campaign."
Whatever Arazi does this summer, he will spend the bulk of his future in Europe. As part of the purchase agreement, he will stand at stud for Sheik Mohammed in Newmarket. "We feel he will greatly enhance the breed in Europe," Stroud said. "That was our main reason for going ahead and buying part of this horse."
For the moment, however, Arazi's spirit belongs to neither Paulson nor the Sheik. It belongs to Lamorlaye and the region of Chantilly, where thorougbreds have been training and racing since the early 19th century.
"This is really marvelous," de Chevigny said. "We are beginning to believe that our community is home to the best horse in the world."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 21, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
A sports article yesterday about the French race horse Arazi referred incorrectly to the track where he will make his competitive debut as a 3-year-old. The track, Saint-Cloud, is the only major one in France where horses run counterclockwise, as they do in the United States.

HEADLINE: A Film Series With an Eye For Offbeat Relationships

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
CHRISTOPHER MUNCH'S sweetly intimate film, "The Hours and Times," takes a footnote from the history of the Beatles -- a 1963 weekend getaway to Barcelona, Spain, by John Lennon with the group's manager, Brian Epstein -- and spins it into an imaginary portrait of a relationship. One of the aims of the trip is to explore the boundaries of a friendship that is as complicated as it is close. Epstein is in love with Lennon, who doesn't return his passion but is open-minded enough to consider the possibility of sexual involvement. Finally, in an awkward encounter in a hotel bathtub, the boundaries become more set.
"The Hours and Times," which will be shown in the New Directors/New Films series on April 3 and 4, epitomizes the attitude of many of the films to be presented in this year's festival, which begins screenings this evening at the Museum of Modern Art. At a time when the mass media's portrayal of the world tends to put everyone into cliched niches, many of the film makers are looking at relationships in ways that are far more problematic than Hollywood's cookie-cutter mentality admits. 
 The Australian Jocelyn Moorhouse's film "Proof" is similarly open-ended in its darkly comic portrayal of the relationships among a blind photographer, his love-smitten housekeeper and a waiter who helps the photographer to take his pictures.
"The film is about three people who see themselves in a very negative light, as powerless," Ms. Moorhouse says. "What interested me most was the concept of someone shut off from the visual world most of us share, but who refuses to accept that. At the same time, I didn't want to sentimentalize blind people, for I don't believe a handicap automatically ennobles someone." Ms. Moorhouse's film opens the series, which is jointly presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the department of film of the Museum of Modern Art. For the next two and a half weeks, New Directors will present 22 programs, representing 14 countries, at the museum's Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters.
One of the most prestigious international showcases of film-making talent, New Directors usually offers an overview of the economic state and the artistic mood of the international film business.
The movies' financial well-being is often determined by political events. The fact that there are no films this year from Poland and Czechoslovakia suggests that financing has temporarily dried up there.
And the outlook of this year's two Russian selections, "Satan" and "Hey, You Wild Geese," is bleakly pessimistic.
Elsewhere in the series, however, the mood is both rebellious and introspective. More than in previous years, sex and issues of sexuality are recurrent themes.
Four films -- "The Hours and Times," "The Living End," "Swoon," and "Le Ciel de Paris" -- have some sort of gay content. And except for "Le Ciel," a French film whose director, Danniel Danniel, died of AIDS last July, they are American films.
In others, like the Spanish director Vicente Aranda's steamy film noir "Lovers," sex becomes a metaphor for something else. In "Lovers," it is a response to the dreary repressive climate in Spain under the Franco regime in the 1950's. "I find that a great many of the films and film makers represented this year are dealing with interpersonal relationships," said Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center. "Many of these relationships are intense. You have an almost classical sense of creating characters who are well rounded and even contradictory. The gay film movement, if you want to call it that, has reached a kind of maturity in the sense that you have artists who no longer feel obligated to make 'gay is good' films. They can make extremely problematic, controversial films like 'Swoon' and 'The Living End.' "
 
Attacking a Myth
 "Swoon," by Tom Kalin, a 30-year-old film maker who lives in New York, explores the notorious 1920's case of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, well-to-do Chicago youths who were homosexually involved and who kidnapped and murdered a young boy. The events helped inspire Alfred Hitchcock's film "Rope" and Meyer Levin's best-selling novel "Compulsion." In Mr. Kalin's film, the events are re-enacted in a style that mixes period and contemporary elements along with vintage documentary fragments.
"The Leopold and Loeb case is the place where homosexuality and pathology became linked in the American mind and in psychoanalytic discourse," Mr. Kalin says. "It was used as evidence that when two men get together and have a tangled relationship, it will inevitably lead to violence. I wanted to unpack that myth in a way that separated the pathology from the homosexuality by showing that the two had different motivations for what they did. The film also questions the way history is written."
 
Despair Over AIDS
 Gregg Araki's "Living End," which might be described as a gay, post-punk "Thelma and Louise," couldn't be more different in temperament from Mr. Kalin's film. Using a post-punk cinematic vocabulary, it follows the chaotic journey of two young men, both of them H.I.V.-positive, who hit the road from Los Angeles, have adventures and end up in the desert contemplating a sex-and-death ritual.
What the director describes as the film's "living for the moment urgency" was inspired by the AIDS crisis and by alternative underground rock music.
"I don't see any movies, hardly watch TV and rarely read, but I'm into alternative industrial music," says the 32-year-old director. "There is also a romanticism in post-punk nihilism. One of my favorite genres from film school was the couple-on-the-run movie, in which a hostile, irrational universe descends on the two doomed lovers. Although my film has its angry side, I always thought it was a love story at its core."
Unlike Mr. Kalin and Mr. Araki, Mr. Munch, the director of "The Hours and Times," insists that his film is largely unconcerned with sexual politics.
"The overriding consideration for me was just to paint that emotional reality as accurately and as uncompromisingly as I could," Mr. Munch says. "Obviously, we don't know the specific facts about what happened on their actual trip to Barcelona. But I think the film is faithful to the emotional content of their friendship. Most of all, the film tries to deconstruct stereotypes in people's minds about compelling friendships that don't fall into any easily identifiable category."
 
No Apologies
 In other films, that sense of rebellion against stereotypical attitudes extends beyond matters of sexuality. Camille Billops and James Hatch's film, "Finding Christa," is a documentary account of Ms. Billops's reunion with the grown-up daughter whom she had given up for adoption because she didn't want to be saddled with a baby at a young age. Far from an apology or an admission of any kind of failure to take responsibility by Ms. Billops, the film offers a joyful portrait of her daughter who, in meeting her biological mother, finds a second family that is as warm and loving as the one that raised her.
"It is a hard film, because a lot of people will not accept the reasons I didn't want to be a mother," Ms. Billops says. "But I perceive of it as a heroic film and the giving up of my daughter as a heroic act. I wasn't broke, I wasn't crazy, I just didn't want to be a mother. I wanted the adventure that men enjoy. I tell my daughter that I'm sorry about the hurt I caused her but not the act, because everyone is not meant to be a mother."
"Finding Christa" is on the same program with "June Roses," a semi-autobiographical feature by Christine Noschese that also deals with a woman's defiance of convention. It is set in Brooklyn in 1952, and portrays a smart, artistically inclined housewife and mother of two whose nervous breakdown is remembered through the eyes of a young daughter whom she has pushed into taking ballet classes. The movie uncannily evokes both the look and the oppressively conformist mood of the McCarthy era.
"The film has to do with what made me a feminist in the sense of what I saw when I was growing up," Ms. Noschese recalls. "Back then, women were getting electric-shock treatments for wanting things. A lot of people today don't realize the frustrations that drove a lot of us into the early women's movement. We saw our mothers as very intelligent but still unable to fulfill their dreams, and saw how they put all that energy on their kids. But living your life through someone else is no way to live."
 
More Mean Streets
 Although Brooklyn is also the setting for Nick Gomez's "Laws of Gravity," the two films are so unlike that they might as well be set on different continents. Mr. Gomez's film, which was shot entirely with hand-held cameras and takes place in the present, follows the meanderings of a bunch of petty criminals and their girlfriends in Brooklyn's Greenpoint section. Stylistically, the movie is reminiscent at times of Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets."
"I think I'm more of a chronicler than Scorsese, whose interests are more personal and psychological," says Mr. Gomez, who grew up in Somerville, Mass., in an environment not unlike that of his film.
"I didn't intend to make a statement," he continues. "For me, the challenge was to try to depict people whom the average person on the street wouldn't find appealing. I see the characters as sort of modern-day frontiersmen in the way they live a hand-to-mouth existence under extreme conditions."
Mr. Gomez's film, which will be shown tomorrow and Sunday, is one of seven feature-length selections by American directors in the series. The number of American works attests to the vitality of this country's independent-film movement at a moment when Hollywood is feeling the pinch of recession. The number of quality American films submitted for New Directors this year was so large that there was even some discussion about the possibility of making the series all-American.
According to the selection committee, the flowering of American independent films can be traced back to the success three years ago of Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," which helped loosen the purse strings of both independent producers and private foundations.
"What has developed in the American independent cinema is a very savvy generation of producers," says Mr. Pena. "They are people who are good with money and who understand that it's not a privilege but a business. They also understand the international scene and how to work the festival circuits. It has made all the difference."
Others say they believe there has also been a shift in the artistic climate. The more formulaic Hollywood becomes, the more room there is for films that do not chase after mass-market success.
Laurence Kardish, of the Museum of Modern Art's film department, discerns in all this vitality the completion of a cycle.
"Something happened to independent film 20 years ago," he says. "There was a conservative backlash in which we didn't see the promise of the late 60's and early 70's realized. Now it's finally happening."

HEADLINE: Short Positions at 19-Month Low on the Big Board

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
With many bears running for cover, the number of shares in New York Stock Exchange-listed companies sold short and not yet covered has fallen to a 19-month low, the Big Board reported yesterday.
The exchange said that on March 13, the short position was down 4.3 percent, to 691.1 million shares, a drop of 30.9 million in a month and the lowest since Aug. 15, 1990, when the figure was 669 million. 
 The short position represents the number of shares that have been borrowed and sold short, normally by traders who hope the price will decline so that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price. In total, the short position sometimes serves as a contrary indicator. By that measure, when the shorts are most active, stock prices may be set to rise, while prices may be vulnerable when short-sellers are least willing to place bets against stocks.
 
Position in August 1990
 In August 1990, when the short-position was low, stocks were beginning a rapid decline, brought on by the beginning of the recession and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. By December of that year, the number of shares sold short had risen to 855.8 million, a 28 percent increase, and the stock market was poised to rise sharply.
The American Stock Exchange reported a smaller decline in short interest, of about five-tenths of 1 percent, or 300,000 shares, to 62.3 million on March 13. The figure was the lowest for the Amex since January 1990.
Stock prices did not rise sharply from mid-February through mid-March, the period covered by the report, but many short-sellers had been devastated by the rapid rise in prices that began in mid-December.
 
BankAmerica at Top
 The largest short-interest position was in shares of BankAmerica, where the position rose by 5.5 million shares, to 17.8 million. Much of that increase no doubt related to merger arbitrage connected with its pending acquisition of Security Pacific.
Arbitrage, in this case related to a new issue of convertible preferred stock, may also have played a role in the 4.5-million-share rise in the short interest at Chrysler, which left the auto maker with a short position of 10.8 million shares, the second largest. But negative sentiment about Chrysler, which had its bond rating lowered, also played a role. It appears that the shorts did not score a winner with that one, as the shares rose for much of the period.
Citicorp, a longtime favorite of short-sellers, rose sharply early in 1992 and has held on to the gains. In the most recent month, the short position was reduced by 3.3 million shares, to 7.3 million.
Short-sellers raised their bets against Sears, Roebuck, raising the short position by almost 50 percent, to 2.3 million shares.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Economic Issues;
TAX BILL IS PASSED BY THE DEMOCRATS AND BUSH VETOS IT

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Clearly foreshadowing the general election campaign to come, President Bush and Congressional Democrats slugged it out today over taxes, spending and the affections of the middle class, their favorite election-year economic issues.
Aside from an exchange of sharp attacks intended to portray Mr. Bush as a lackey of the rich and the Democratic Congress as more interested in "pork" than progress, the Democrats passed a tax bill that Mr. Bush promptly vetoed, and he proposed spending cuts that he expected them to resist. 
 The compelling undertone in today's shrill exchanges was the issue of responsibility for the flabby economy, historically the worst issue an incumbent President can face. As it was framed today, Democrats said Mr. Bush had ignored it; he said they were holding the economic recovery "hostage" as they pursued partisan gain.
 
Majorities Are Slim
 By majorities slimmer than their margins in both houses, the Democrats passed a bill that would provide tax credits to families with incomes of less than $70,000. But those credits were to be financed by increasing the maximum tax rate to 36 percent, from 31 percent, and by a surcharge on incomes over $1 million. Mr. Bush said those increases were intolerable.
Mr. Bush denounced the measure and complained that Congress had refused to pass his seven-point economic growth program by today, the deadline he set in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 28. And he carried the attack to Congress by demanding that Congress withdraw $4 billion in Federal spending it had already approved. Mr. Bush called them "items of pork," and drove the attack home by assailing "a Democratic caucus which cannot manage a tiny bank or a tiny post office."
 
Clinton Backs Concept
 At the White House, in a speech to an invited audience of Republican loyalists, Mr. Bush said he had signed his veto message even before the bill reached him, because "raising taxes will not create jobs." He has been under intense criticism from conservative Republicans, especially Patrick J. Buchanan, his challenger, for abandoning his 1988 pledge of "no new taxes" and agreeing in 1990 to raise the maximum rate to 31 percent.
Although the bill passed with majorities too slight to override a veto, the issue will persist into the fall Presidential election campaign. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic front-runner, has supported tax cuts for the middle class paid for by higher rates at the top.
Mr. Clinton had no direct comment on the bill today. But a spokesman in Little Rock said that while he supported the general concept of the bill, he did not endorse it in its entirety.
Mr. Bush complained that Congressional Democrats were allowing the recession to drag on by not acting on his program, but in Congress Democrats concentrated on their theme of fairness, to be achieved by taxing the wealthy to help the middle class.
Just before the House passed the bill, 211 to 189, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, insisted, "We're simply asking the wealthiest people in the country, the people who have done the best, to pay their fair share of the tax burden in this country."
While Mr. Bush complained of inaction on his anti-recession proposals, most of them were included in some form or other in the Democrats' $77.5 billion, five-year tax bill, hammered out Thursday night between House and Senate negotiators.
 
Difference on Capital Gains
 But its capital gains tax cut was far less generous than Mr. Bush's, providing little or no reduction for the wealthiest taxpayers. Its accelerated depreciation provisions were slimmer than his. And it omitted entirely the $5,000 tax credit he proposed for first-time home buyers. Other provisions aiding corporations, real estate and home building were included much as he wrote them.
The middle-class tax cut in the bill married the approaches of Democrats in the House and Senate, who have sought to make that cause an issue since last spring.
The bill provided, for 1992 and 1993, a tax credit of up to $150 for single people and $300 for working couples, a stripped-down version of the House provision. For 1994 and thereafter, it would shift to a permanent tax credit of $300 for each child under the age of 16, which was the Senate plan proposed by Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee. These credits would not be available to taxpayers with incomes over $70,000.
Over five years, the cost of those credits would be $42.4 billion. But that would be more than paid for by raising the top tax rate to 36 percent, a rate that would kick in for individuals with taxable income of $115,000 and couples with $140,000, and by the surcharge of an extra 10 percent on all taxable income in excess of $1 million. Those increases would raise $60.2 billion.
These provisions provoked some of the sharpest debate. Representative David Dreier, Republican of California, discerned a "manifesto for class warfare." Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, called them "job-destroying tax increases." He said, "Rather than put people back to work, the Democratic leaders have attempted to create a bogus political issue for November."
But Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, said, "Only 1 percent of all taxpayers would have a rate increase under this bill, only 1 million of the richest taxpayers in this country." And Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said Republican Administrations always wanted tax cuts for the wealthy, advocating a "trickle down" economic theory. "The American people have been trickled on for 12 years," he said.
 
67 Cuts Proposed
 Even before the bill got to him to veto, Mr. Bush sent Congress 67 messages proposing $3.6 billion of cuts in spending of money that had already been appropriated. Most of the total, $2.96 billion, would come from halting spending on two SSN-21 Seawolf submarines. Other targets ranged from agricultural research projects relating to blackbirds, Vidalia onions, Appalachian hardwoods and lowbush blueberries, and other items like the Alliance of Residential Theaters in New York.
If Congress does not agree to these cuts within 45 days his proposal will have no effect. But Congressional Republicans could force votes on them. Mr. Bush told a cheerful White House audience that applauded repeatedly, even at references to generally obscure court decisions and laws, that he would work with Republicans to guarantee such "line-by-line votes on items of pork."
 
More Cuts Threatened
 But House Democrats said the Appropriations Committee would consider his requests promptly and might add other items of its own, especially from Defense Department spending. "We will reach the same bottom line number that's being proposed by the President," said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Panetta said Mr. Bush had always had authority to propose rescissions, as these cuts are called, but was doing it today only because "he needs a little diversion so that the American people don't notice that veto" of the middle-class tax cut legislation.
 
Other Major Provisions
 But there was far more than that to the hefty tax bill. Its other major provisions, though largely ignored in today's debate, included these:
*Reducing taxes on capital gains, though not as much as Mr. Bush wanted. The bill would have reduced them to zero for families with incomes under $34,000, but left them at 28 percent for upper-income taxpayers. Mr. Bush wanted a maximum rate of 15.4 percent. The bill would also have cut them to a maximum of 14 percent on investments in new small businesses held for at least five years.
*Restoring complete deductibility, at all income levels, of up to $2,000 in contributions to individual retirement accounts. The bill would also create a new kind of I.R.A., with tax-free status for withdrawn income if left on deposit for at least five years.
*Repealing the luxury tax on yachts, planes, furs and jewelry and indexing for inflation the tax on expensive cars.
*Allowing an extra 5 percent of depreciation for this year and next on new business investment in plants and equipment.
The conferees dropped a Senate provision on health insurance. It would prohibit insurance companies from canceling coverage or excluding members of small groups because of existing health problems or prior claims, and try to eliminate gaps in coverage for workers changing jobs. It would also seek to end the wide disparities in health insurance premiums.
But that measure is likely to be seen again before Congress adjourns this fall, as are many of the smaller items in the bill Mr. Bush rejected. While there is no Congressional timetable for action, a number of popular tax preferences expire this summer, and they are likely to be adopted again, along perhaps with easier provisions for the real estate industry and possibly the repeal of the luxury taxes.
But just as a White House aide predicted that Mr. Bush would seek to get Congress to vote on spending measures again and again, everyone expected the political arguments to be repeated, and repeated.
Mr. Bentsen scoffed at Mr. Bush, saying: "The talk is, he wants to re-create the 1948 campaign, when a feisty Harry Truman came from behind by attacking a 'do-nothing' Republican Congress. Well, I knew Harry Truman. I worked with Harry Truman. And George Bush is a decent man, but he's no Harry Truman."

HEADLINE: Iraq Agrees to Destroy Missiles To Meet U.N. Cease-Fire Terms

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 20

 BODY:
Faced with veiled American and British threats of military force, Iraq has backed down in its latest confrontation with the Security Council and agreed to destroy its ballistic missile equipment as required by the cease-fire resolution that ended the Persian Gulf war, a Council official announced today.
Rolf Ekeus, head of the special commission set up by the Council to oversee the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the war, said Baghdad also agreed Thursday night to provide full details next month of its programs for building nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. 
 President Saddam Hussein's Government refused last month to discard its buildings and equipment for producing and repairing ballistic missiles, saying it wanted to convert them to civilian use.
 
Suspicions Are Confirmed
 Confirming the Security Council's suspicions, Iraq also admitted Thursday night that it had concealed about 90 ballistic missiles, though it asserts that it eventually destroyed them last summer, Mr. Ekeus said. He said Baghdad also revealed that it had a large number of chemical warheads that could be fitted onto its Scud and longer-range missiles.
Mr. Ekeus described the developments as "good news" and said they appeared to indicate a "change of policy" by Baghdad.
Mr. Ekeus said Iraq had made the disclosures and communicated its new position Thursday night in a letter presented by its United Nations representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari. A team of United Nations ballistic missile experts is to arrive in Baghdad this weekend to oversee the destruction of some of the equipment and to check out Iraq's disclosures about concealed missiles and chemical warheads, Mr. Ekeus added.
The Bush Administration reacted cautiously to Baghdad's pledge of cooperation. A spokeswoman for the State Department in Washington, Phyllis Young, said tonight: "We have a copy of the letter and we're examining it. We're in touch with the U.N. special commission. The special ballistics team goes to Iraq tomorrow, and we want to see how Iraq cooperates and what they can achieve."
 
Military Contingency Plan
 Tensions over Iraq's refusal to destroy the equipment or to disclose full details of its programs for building weapons have risen steadily in recent weeks. Only today, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, told a Senate committee that the United States had prepared contingency plans for a military strike on Iraqi weapons sites.
Months of intransigence led to a direct confrontation here last week between an increasingly irate Security Council and Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz. The meeting ended with Mr. Aziz's assuring the Council of Iraq's "good will" and promising wider cooperation.
"We now have some reason to take Iraq's assurances of good will more seriously," Mr. Ekeus said today.
The special commission on eliminating Iraqi weapons had given Baghdad until the end of next week to prepare the equipment for destruction as the United States and Britain hinted that they might do the job themselves with a military strike.
In his testimony today before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Powell made clear that the armed forces were ready to enforce the Security Council's orders if Baghdad continued to stall.
"We have a variety of tools available to us to make sure that Iraq does comply -- diplomatic tools, economic tools, political tools, yes, the armed forces of the United States," he said. "And I can assure this committee that if we are called upon to be a part of this solution, we will perform our role in an absolutely professional way with desired results."
General Powell was responding to questions from committee members about a report in The Washington Post that said he opposed another strike against Iraq.
He added later: "The United States armed forces are prepared to execute any mission given to us by the President of the United States. You can be sure that we have thought through how we would accomplish any mission given to us by the President."
The latest showdown between Baghdad and the Security Council follows the pattern of previous confrontations, with Iraq initially refusing to cooperate with its orders and claiming it had no weapons of mass destruction, then being forced into a humiliating retreat when confronted with overwhelming evidence of its deception or threatened with another strike.
 
Doubts After Gulf War
 Iraq had reported last year to the commission that it had only 64 ballistic missiles, but the panel suspected that President Hussein was probably still hiding others. The doubts arose after the commission compared the total of 800 that the Soviet Union said it had supplied to Baghdad with estimates of the number fired last year during the Persian Gulf war and in Iraq's eight-year war with Iran.
Iraq's disclosure that it had a large number of chemical warheads that could be fitted on its Scud and longer-range al-Husseini missiles contrasted with its earlier reports that it had only 30 such warheads, a figure judged by many experts to be suspiciously low.
Baghdad promised to submit full details on its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs in April. United Nations officials said they had demanded that Iraq disclose the existence of any hidden nuclear reactors or storage sites in the desert, as well as complete information on foreign companies that have supplied them with relevant equipment and technology.
Iraq has already handed over a long document in Arabic that it says provides information about its military industries. The special commission had asked for the information so it could draw up plans for monitoring production to insure Iraq does not try to make prohibited weapons again.
 
Some Conversion Permitted
 If Baghdad follows through on its commitments, it will soon be stripped of all its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as its ballistic missiles and the plants and equipment used to make them. Most of Iraq's nuclear equipment has already been destroyed.
The newly declared chemical warheads will be added to other chemical weapons stocks that the United Nations is currently destroying. Some of the plants used to make those weapons are also being dismantled, although Iraq is being allowed to convert some chemical equipment for civilian use.
Iraq has been authorized to keep all of its tanks, artillery pieces, mortars and missiles with a range of under 90 miles, as well as lighter arms left over from the gulf war, though it is banned from importing any military equipment.
The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's nuclear program, will decide this weekend how much of Iraq's nuclear weapons plant at Al Atheer must be destroyed. The plant, about 22 miles southwest of Baghdad, escaped damage in the gulf war, and Iraq has sent a team to Vienna to plead for its conversion to civilian ends. The United States is demanding its destruction.
 
Lingering Disputes
 The true purpose of the plant at Al Atheer, where Iraq intended to assemble and test its first nuclear device, was only discovered by the allied military coalition after the end of the fighting last year. Most of Iraq's other weapons plants were hit during the allied bombing campaign.
While officials say Iraq appears to be starting to comply with the Security Council's cease-fire terms in a serious way, other areas of potential dispute remain.
Baghdad still has not formally accepted the Security Council resolution calling for long-term monitoring of its military factories, although it appears now to be cooperating with the inspections. And it has not formally accepted the Council resolution laying down rules under which it can sell oil to finance imports of food and medicine and to compensate the victims of its invasion of Kuwait.

Iraqi Warheads Destroyed
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 20 (Reuters) -- A United Nations team announced today that it had completed its mission of destroying 500 leaking nerve-gas rockets in southern Iraq with cooperation from Iraqi authorities.
"We destroyed 500 warheads, rockets and partial missiles, each one containing 6.1 liters of chemical agent," said Michel Desgranges, who led the team.
The chemical in the rockets was Sarin.
He said the rockets, destroyed at a site near Nasiriya, 180 miles south of Baghdad, weighed 150 pounds each and had a range of up to 20 miles.
 Mr. Desgranges said that the mission was a success and that relations with the Iraqi authorities, which provided workers to help the United Nations team, were "good and normal."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Working on Soviet Aid Package

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The State Department is working on a large-scale aid package for the former Soviet Union, but the White House remains hesitant to move forward on the multibillion dollar package, Congressional and Administration officials said today.
But several of the officials said they expect President Bush, who was embarrassed last week by former President Richard M. Nixon's criticism of American policy toward the former Soviet Union, to begin pushing for the package over the next few weeks or months. They said the White House is taking a warmer view of more aid to Russia and the other newly independent republics after shying away from foreign aid increases because of election-year accusations that it was focusing on foreign affairs to the detriment of domestic concerns. 
 State Department officials said the package would probably involve a $12 billion contribution to the International Monetary Fund, $645 million in humanitarian aid already announced, and part of an estimated $6 billion fund that several industrial nations are planning in an effort to stabilize the ruble.
One senior Treasury official said the ruble stabilization fund could be established in May or June, a move that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia says is crucial to increase confidence in his nation's currency and fledgling market economy.
 
Senators Lobby With Baker
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who is a member of the Foreign Relations Commitee, and two other senators met with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on Wednesday to urge him to step up efforts to aid Russia and the other republics.
"Baker indicated that the Administration would be asking the Congress for support on I.M.F. replenishment," Senator Lugar said in an interview today. "He understood that it was controversial."
Mr. Lugar and Mr. Nunn and the two senators who accompanied them on a recent trip to Russia and Ukraine -- John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico -- are scheduled to meet with President Bush on Monday to press him on aid.
"The question really is with the President and the White House," Senator Nunn said in an interview today. "State is ready to move out though they're not really organized yet."
"The problem," he added, "is getting leadership on this issue."
 
Prod From Nixon
 A senior State Department official said the department has not finished its internal review of an aid package. The official said another factor Mr. Baker has to decide is whether to push the package as part of a resolution to continue foreign aid that expires at the end of this month or whether to wait for another opportunity.
Last week, former President Nixon called on President Bush to take a vigorous lead on the issue, saying America's aid to the former Soviet Union has been "pathetically inadequate."
At a conference in Washington sponsored by the Nixon Library, Mr. Nixon threw President Bush on the defensive on the issue of aid to Russia, and many liberals and conservatives joined the former President in saying that more aid was vital to shore up Russia's economy to insure the former Soviet Union does not become fertile ground for a new dictatorship.
President Bush responded that he recognized Moscow's needs for assistance, but pointed out, "we're living in a time of constrained resources," and defended his own actions by saying, "I don't have a blank check." Many supporters of increased aid were disappointed by Mr. Bush's response, saying that Mr. Nixon had given him an opportunity to make a major speech calling for large-scale aid.
An Administration official said today that the White House has long been working on aid to the former Soviet Union, noting the $645 million in humanitarian aid that President Bush announced in January. The official said there was no dramatic shift by the White House on aid to Russia.
"It's evolutionary," the official said. "This is what the President has been saying all along."
 
Congress Urges Aid Package
 Several Senators have urged the Administration to develop an aid package so that it could make one big drive to push the aid plan through Congress, rather than pass different pieces at different times.
"There is going to be only one chance for a package that will move in a comprehensive way to address most of the problems within the republics," said Senator Lugar, referring to the former Soviet Union. "It will have to be multidisciplinary."
He said he thought the President would push an aid package in April, May or June, but some officials said it could come as early as next week when the Congress is expected to take up continued spending for foreign aid.
Lawmakers have been reluctant to increase spending abroad during a recession at home and one White House official sought to play down the cost of aid to Russia today. He said the $12 billion contribution to the I.M.F. would in effect be an interest-paying deposit in the international lending organization. The contribution to the stabilization fund would be like a loan that would be drawn on only if the fund had to be tapped to defend the ruble against depreciation, he added. According to the I.M.F. about $6 billion would be needed to finance such a fund.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics professor who is an adviser to Russia and a supporter of aid to the former Soviet Union, estimates that the United States and Japan would each put up $1.2 billion for the stabilization fund, while the countries of Western Europe put up $3 billion. The remainder, he said, would come from other countries.
Administration officials have long said that a stabilization fund should not be set until Russia has slashed its budget deficit, reined in its fast-growing money supply, removed price controls and taken other painful steps to set up a market economy.
But Russian officials have complained that the Group of Seven major industrialized countries sometimes seem to want Moscow to create so much economic stability before a stabilization fund is set up that by that time such a fund would be unnecessary.
"The Russians are moving very fast," said Stanley Fischer, a former World Bank chief economist who is now a professor at the Massachusetts Institue of Technology. "They have done a lot on the budget side. They have tightened their monetary policy. With external support they can go the last few yards."

HEADLINE: Kohl Is Expected to Act as Trade Envoy in Talks With Bush

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, March 20

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is emerging as Europe's most powerful leader, is expected to play the role of trade envoy this weekend in private talks with President Bush at Camp David, Md.
Although trade matters will be at the top of the agenda and foreign-policy issues will be discussed, the talks on Saturday and Sunday are being described as a personal meeting. 
 But Mr. Kohl will also be acting as an unofficial envoy of European countries who are at odds with the United States over trade and economic issues.
Aides say the Chancellor and Mr. Bush will try to forge a compromise that could lead to the long-delayed completion of the latest round of international trade negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
 
European Farm Subsidies
 The latest round, which involves 108 nations and began in Uruguay in 1986, was scheduled to have been completed in Brussels in December 1990. But the conclusion has been blocked by the refusal of France and its partners in the European Community to cut heavy subsidies to their farmers.
The United States and other nations that are dependent on agricultural exports have pressed the Western Europeans to cut their farm subsidies by as much as 36 percent.
 
Corn Gluten Dispute
 The main commodity holding up agreement is corn gluten, a cereal substitute that is a major export item. American farmers sold $696 million in corn gluten to Europeans last year and could sell more if subsidies were discontinued.
Lobbyists for American farmers like the U.S. Feed Grains Council say they will fight to insure rejection of "the whole agreement" if it includes a compromise that limits their access to European agricultural markets.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is on the House Agriculture Committee, wrote in a letter to a Bush Administration official, "Any agreement which puts a cap on corn gluten exports will severely upset Midwestern agricultural interests since this is the type of value-added export we are trying to increase."
In Washington, a senior official in the Bush Administration said that Mr. Kohl should expect a "blunt" message from Mr. Bush on the agreement this weekend. He said the German Chancellor had promised to press the French on the issue of agricultural subsidies two years ago but had failed to produce a compromise.
 
Aid to Ex-Soviet Lands
 "The Administration had commitments from Kohl to work this issue going back to 1990, but Kohl felt he couldn't make a move then because of German reunification and elections coming up," said the official, who insisted on not being identified. "Even in the wake of all that, he hasn't been able to move the ball forward."
Nonetheless, the Administration does not expect Mr. Bush to win much more this weekend than another promise from Mr. Kohl to urge France to be more flexible, the official said.
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the situation in the former Soviet Union. Germany has provided about 60 percent of all Western aid to the former Soviet republics and wants the United States to contribute more.
Mr. Kohl is also expected to urge Mr. Bush to avoid further reductions in the number of United States troops in Europe.
President Bush plans to reduce American military strength in Europe to about 150,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen by 1995, fewer than half the number that were there in late 1989, when the Berlin wall came down.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Democrats;
Clinton Says Golfing at All-White Club Was Mistake

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 20

 BODY:
After months of presenting himself as a Southern candidate with a good civil rights record, Gov. Bill Clinton has suddenly found himself under criticism for a classic gesture of racial separation: playing golf at an all-white country club.
Mr. Clinton was chided by a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Little Rock and by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia for playing golf on Wednesday at the Country Club of Little Rock, an upper-crust bastion in the Arkansas state capital. The rebuke by Dale Charles, president of the Little Rock chapter of the civil rights group was first reported on Thursday by The Washington Times. 
 Mr. Clinton quickly admitted that he had made a mistake and vowed never to play there again until it was integrated.
He said as part of his defense that his chief of staff, William Bowen, was leading an effort to integrate the club. Mr. Bowen said he and others were sponsoring nonwhite candidates for membership in the organization, but no application had been acted on yet. Club officials did not return telephone calls today.
"I'm going to do something unconventional for a politician -- when I make a mistake, I'm going to say I made a mistake, not go into some long, labored exercise," Mr. Clinton said today as he campaigned here, speaking of his efforts to "unite the nation across racial and economic lines" and accusing President Bush and the Republican Party of dividing the country racially.
 
Call to Wilder
 Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Wilder today, apparently to express the same kind of regrets he expressed publicly here, and he also met with members of minority groups in Hartford and New Haven as he campaigned for Tuesday's Democratic primary.
By offering a swift mea culpa, the Democratic front-runner was clearly hoping to minimize the incident as quickly as possible as he tries to focus on strengthening his sudden position as the seemingly unassailable leader in what is now a two-man race for the Democratic Presidential nomination.
But Mr. Clinton's own explanation made it clear that he was aware that the country club, where he is an honorary member as Governor, has no nonwhite members. "A guy asked me to play nine holes of golf," Mr. Clinton said. "It was the only place we had time to play. I should not have done it."
Mr. Bowen said Mr. Clinton played this week with Mark Grobmeyer, a Little Rock lawyer and longtime associate.
 
Action Contradicts Campaign
 The Governor's misstep seemed especially maladroit given his effort to take a strong stance favoring civil rights in the campaign and to overcome the issues of personal conduct that have periodically troubled his nomination bid. In addition the Clinton organization has shown an obvious concern to calculate the political ramifications of virtually every move the Governor makes.
Mr. Wilder seized on that point in a statement he issued Thursday in response to Mr. Charles's criticism of Mr. Clinton.
"Governor Clinton, a man besieged with stories about his personal life in the past few months, has taken to lecturing Americans about personal responsibility," he said. "All I can say to Governor Clinton is, doctor, heal thyself."
Mr. Wilder said, "It is inconceivable to me that a sitting Governor would either accept membership or recreate in a club that openly discriminates against blacks and other minorities."
Glenn Davidson, Mr. Wilder's spokesman, said he did not know what Mr. Clinton told Mr. Wilder in the telephone call."
The issue of membership at country clubs and golf clubs has been a delicate topic for decades, and an obvious trap for politicians. Candidates routinely review their memberships and other contacts with private organizations to insure that they are politically clean. In December 1990, Vice President Dan Quayle came under fire for playing at the Cypress Point Club in Pebble Beach, Calif., which had been ruled ineligible for a major golf tournament because all its members were white.
Mr. Quayle's office declined comment today on Mr. Clinton's actions.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Connecticut;
To Cheers, Brown Jabs Campaign 'Gong Show'

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn, March 20

 BODY:
Edmund G. Brown Jr. came to City Hall here today, declaring at a noontime rally that being Governor of California was "the major leagues," that the United States should build "B-2 bullet trains instead of B-2 bombers," and that the campaign for President is "a Gong Show" run by the wealthy.
He was cheered long and loudly. 
 Taking aim at politics as usual, Mr. Brown and his politics-as-the-unusual campaign bore down today as he sought to take advantage of Paul E. Tsongas's withdrawal from the Democratic race only days before Connecticut's Presidential primary on Tuesday.
If his attacks on the establishment have made some critics call him a "political terrorist," the rally here and others in Hartford and New Haven on Thursday showed that he continues to appeal to voters who feel left out of the country's economy or shut out of its discourse.
The crowds that came to hear him seemed convinced that he was genuine, that he was a career politician who, as he says, "rubbed my nose" in big-money politics and now has crossed the street to join the real people. They laughed as he derisively recalled the critics, when he was Governor, who called him Flake and Moonbeam.
"Jerry Brown seems to be the only one speaking to the population I serve," said Vonda McKeithan, a 24-year-old Y.W.C.A. worker in Bridgeport. "What makes him crazy? That he's different? I'd think that would appeal to young people."
In the next two weeks Mr. Brown, who has made strong showings in several states, hopes to establish his candidacy in votes in Connecticut on Tuesday and in New York and Wisconsin on April 7.
This is their opportunity, staff members said, to disprove the political experts who immediately concluded that Mr. Tsongas's withdrawal had delivered the Democratic nomination to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
On Thursday, only hours after Mr. Tsongas suspended his campaign, Mr. Brown complained to labor leaders in New Haven that the first question a reporter asked him was, "When are you going to withdraw?"
 
Party Chiefs and Bolsheviks
 Referring to pronouncements that the campaign was all but over, he told the Bridgeport crowd: "We have a media and party hierarchy that actually wants to shut down debate. It reminds me of the Bolsheviks."
What Mr. Brown still has to overcome at the national level, he effectively manages each day at rallies like the one here, in the Common Council chambers where Bridgeport's bankruptcy crisis was played out nearly a year ago.
He attributes the country's economic problems to a ruling elite that is out of touch because it spends its time with wealthy contributors who finance its campaigns with $1,000 checks, "the people who always figure out a way to prosper even as more Americans suffer."
He asks people to raise their hands if they have never given a candidate $1,000, the maximum under Federal law, and when all hands are up, he says, "People like you are not the kind of people most successful Presidential candidates spend time with."
He accepts no contributions larger than $100, and each rally ends with him reminding people of his "800" telephone number for contributions and with volunteers passing around buckets to collect checks or cash.
 
The 'Moonbeam' Question
 Mr. Brown takes care of the Moonbeam question -- whether he is a "serious" person -- by reviewing his record as Governor of California, "the major leagues" compared with certain other states, like Mr. Clinton's.
"I think he'll make a wonderful President," said Louis Costanzo, a retired union carpenter from Bridgeport, adding that he was especially impressed by Mr. Brown's record as Governor. "That speaks for itself," he said.
And Mr. Brown offers visions of how the Federal Government could create jobs by converting military programs like the B-2 bomber to the manufacture of high-speed bullet trains like France and Japan have, and creating a construction program to make the nation's homes, factories and offices energy-efficient.
As people walked out of City Hall today, some were chuckling over Mr. Brown's visions. "Imagine promising Bridgeport a bullet train," one man said. But across the lobby, a table staffed by volunteers was ringed with people waiting to contribute money.

HEADLINE: Powell Criticizes Further Military Cuts

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, today issued the sharpest criticism to date of a plan in the House of Representatives to double the size of military budget cuts the Bush Administration had proposed for next year.
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Powell said a move by the House to cut an additional $7 billion from the Administration's proposed $281 billion military budget for the next fiscal year could threaten American military readiness. 
 A senior House aide rebutted General Powell's assertion, saying the Pentagon was using scare tactics to discourage serious debate on deeper reductions in military spending.
 
'Discredited Tactics'
 "The Pentagon is resorting to the old discredited tactics that any defense cuts will have dire consequences," said Vernon A. Guidry Jr., an aide to Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee.
Mr. Guidry said additional cuts could be made in areas like Pentagon supply inventories and overseas installations without hurting American military readiness.
Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, along with six Republican committee members today sided with General Powell's criticism of the House plan, foreshadowing an impending clash in the Senate and House over the size and pace of additional reductions in military spending.
Senator Nunn said in an interview after the hearing that it "would be difficult to make substantial" cuts beyond what Mr. Bush had proposed in the fiscal year 1993, which begins on Oct. 1. But he said additional reductions were likely after 1993.
 
Putting Pressure on Lawmakers
 General Powell said today that the House plan would force the Pentagon to cut 300,000 additional troops. The general's testimony today, capped by a five-minute videotaped interview of Army soldiers at Fort Bragg, N.C., lamenting their uncertain futures, represented an escalation in a carefully calculated public-relations campaign he and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney have waged with lawmakers in recent weeks to illustrate the potential risks to larger cuts in military spending.
Lawmakers have become increasingly nervous about cutting back more deeply in troop strength and possibly adding to unemployment lines during a recession and election year.
General Powell said today, for example, that further cuts in troops would drastically cut training for pilots, sailors and soldiers, and possibly even lead to higher casualties from peacetime training accidents.
Led by Mr. Aspin, House Democrats have said Congress can trim the Pentagon's fiscal 1993 budget without cutting more troops or jeopardizing their training.
Mr. Aspin has proposed several alternatives to the Pentagon's budgets through 1997, and recommended the cuts in the fiscal 1993 budget that were eventually adopted as the basis for the House budget resolution.
 
List of Savings
 At today's hearing, Senator James Exon, Democrat of Nebraska, said he would soon compile a list of $4 billion in potential savings from as many as 150 medium- and smaller-size weapons and weapons research programs.
General Powell also criticized Mr. Aspin's proposed alternative "base forces" of active Army divisions, Navy ships and Air Force wings for the rest of the decade, as "fundamentally flawed" and "overly simplistic."
Mr. Aspin favors cutting the Army's 12 active divisions to nine, cutting the Air Force's 15 tactical air wings to 10, and slashing the Navy fleet to 340 ships, from 450 ships that the Pentagon proposes, by 1995.
General Powell said the Pentagon's proposed base force "anticipated the breakup of the Soviet Union." No Defense Department official has ever claimed to accurately predict the Soviet demise.
Under repeated questioning from Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, General Powell backpedaled slightly, saying that Pentagon planners had anticipated a "fundamental, historic realignment" of the former Soviet republics.
Later, after Mr. Levin left the hearing, General Powell said in response to a follow-up question from Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, "I did not know it would break up."

HEADLINE: Chinese Smugglers' Lucrative Cargo: Humans

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 20

 BODY:
In growing numbers, ships from mainland China are sailing toward America, their holds packed with a frightened and seasick human cargo destined mostly for labor in the restaurants and sweatshops of New York's Chinatown.
Five ships carrying a total of about 600 people have been discovered since January and as many as nine more are being monitored now as they head for Los Angeles, said Bruce J. Nicholl, an official at the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. 
 The new tactic represents a major expansion of the far-flung smuggling networks that for years have brought small groups of Chinese laborers to the United States through Canada and Central America.
International Chinese crime syndicates, many with roots in ancient secret societies called triads or tongs, have begun to add their resources and muscle to the enterprise of human smuggling, Mr. Nicholl said.
The immigration service is barely keeping pace, and even in cases where immigrants are caught here they often are released pending hearings, or for lack of detention centers, and simply disappear into an underworld of forced labor, drug dealing and crime.
"This is kind of 19th-century stuff now where the tongs are not just shipping illegals but trafficking in people as human slaves," said Peter Kwong, a professor of political science at the State University of New York College at Old Westbury.
For a price of $25,000 to $30,000, part of which goes to bribe Chinese officials, poor farmers and laborers from southern China are following earlier immigrants in search of prosperity in America. And like their predecessors who helped build the nation's railroads, most are destined for years of servitude as they labor to pay off the cost of their passage.
"Most of them end up in pretty squalid conditions as indentured servants in restaurants and packing houses and garment factories," said Mr. Nicholl, who is the immigration service's expert on Chinese smuggling. Others "can end up actually enslaved to the triads as prostitutes or enforcers or drug runners or pickpockets."
He said as many as 25,000 Chinese have entered the country illegally, mostly smuggled in by air, in the last three years; the ocean routes appeared to have been put into operation about a year ago.
Most of the new immigrants come from Fujian, a southern coastal Chinese province with a history of migration and human smuggling, and most are headed for the Fujianese enclave of New York's Chinatown, he said.
 
Kidnapped and Beaten
 There, Mr. Kwong said, they are subject to exploitation and to a growing wave of violence by the syndicates enforcing the repayment of their debts with torture, kidnapping and sometimes murder.
"Mostly they are handcuffed within an apartment and severely beaten with anything from claw hammers to sticks," said Lieut. Joseph Pollini of the New York City Police Department. "They are told they have to pay $10,000 or $15,000 above their original fee, and a lot of drastic things take place."
Just today, he said, the last of eight men was convicted of kidnapping in the first such incident to have been uncovered, in November 1990. Since then, arrests have been made in seven similar kidnappings.
Partly because of the violence surrounding the smuggling operations, the department is forming a new unit to deal with Asian organized crime.
"The tragic thing is that these illegals are so desperate to get money that they are willing to work at any price," Mr. Kwong said. "So the situation in Chinatown is that wages are getting lower and lower."
A Fujianese service economy has sprung up in New York, including "travel agencies" that help coordinate contacts and payoffs to the smugglers.
"I heard of one woman on East Broadway who emptied her village, which was about 2,000 people," Mr. Kwong said, "and she was not the only one doing that."
The Fujianese are known as tough and hard-working, he said, and those who have paid off their debts after several years of labor are beginning to enjoy the rewards of their rough passage by opening Chinese takeout restaurants, mainly in poor areas of New York City.
 
Dreams of Success
 Dreams of such success inspired the 84 men packed for 50 days into the fetid hold of the 150-foot Taiwan-registered trawler Jinn Yin No. 1, which was seized off the California coast last month.
"It was my goal and my dream to come to the United States," said G. Ling, a 22-year-old student who comes from a family of truck drivers and who is now being held at an immigration service detention center in Long Beach pending a hearing on his status. "But we suffered so much: so crowded, so cold in the ship, not enough food, no water to drink, no place to wash."
C. Chen, 31, a professional diver who, like Mr. Ling, declined to give his full name, said the terrified passengers wept, prayed and vomited as the rusting boat, with its crew of seven, struggled through a typhoon and survived two fires.
He said many people from his grandparents' village near the Fujianese city of Fuzhou had come to America and prospered and that some of these had returned home for visits, tempting others to follow with stories of prosperity.
"Since the day I was born I wanted to come to America," Mr. Chen said, speaking through an interpreter. "We wanted to apply to the United States government to come the legal way, but too many people want to come. With so many people in China how long would it take us? The rest of our lives?"
In 1990, the most recent year for which figures are available, 31,800 people succeeded in immigrating legally to the United States from mainland China, putting that country in sixth place as a source of legal immigration.
Gu Kechen, a 21-year-old carpenter, said he had made a $2,500 down payment in China and that relatives in New York had guaranteed the balance of his $25,000 passage. "I don't know how I will pay them back," he said. "The important thing was to get to America."
Though they are now subject to deportation, the men under detention here still stand a chance of completing their journey to New York. Many will be released on bond either because of overcrowding at detention centers or because they apply for political asylum, officials and immigration lawyers said. When that happens, the chances are that they will simply disappear.
The results are hundreds of millions of dollars in profits for the traffickers, who operate what Mr. Nicholl called "the most sophisticated and largest and most expensive smuggling operation that exists in the world today."
As of last year, he said, "We have identified as many as 30 different smuggling routes coming into the United States."
People who cannot pay the full price for passage, Mr. Kwong said, sometimes travel as couriers on a drug-smuggling run from Fujian through Burma and Thailand, with stops in Latin America.
"Every time we get a handle on what they are doing and how they are doing it, things change," Mr. Nicholl said. When the first shipload was captured off Los Angeles last September with 118 smuggled passengers, he said, "We were sort of in a state of shock."

HEADLINE: Review/Pop;
Evoking A Youthful Sinatra

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
If he wanted to, Harry Connick Jr. could ride his Frank Sinatra imitation toward a lucrative career of singing old pop standards for nostalgic fans. He refuses to do so, a choice that bolstered his concert on Thursday night, the opening of a sold-out, 15-show engagement through April 7 at the Paramount.
The Sinatra imitation is only passable; it helps that Mr. Connick is skinny and looks good in a tuxedo. Like the young Mr. Sinatra, Mr. Connick is a baritone, and he has picked up the Sinatra style of widening the vibrato as a sustained note goes on. (He also has some of Mr. Sinatra's arrogance, boasting between songs that after he told off some audience members in Atlantic City, they lost $100,000 gambling.) But he can't match the young Mr. Sinatra's effortlessness, his precise pitch, or, most important, the sense of storytelling in a song. Regardless of what he's singing, Mr. Connick usually sounds emotionally nonchalant and musically studious. Yet on Thursday, the crowd burst into applause whenever Mr. Connick started a song like "All of Me" or "It Had to Be You." 
 In a show that lasted more than two hours, Mr. Connick flaunted other skills. He played piano improvisations that juxtaposed modern-jazz harmony and florid New Orleans barrelhouse style. He sang his own songs from the album "Blue Light, Red Light" (Columbia), often with lyrics by Ramsey McLean, that harked back to prerock pop. He briefly danced and played drums. He paid tribute to New Orleans jazz and sang a mildly risque version of "Sheik of Araby." And he directed a 17-piece big band in his own arrangements. He even tried to sing gospel in a finale that brought together his band and the opening act, Raymond Myles, a gospel-pop tenor with a 20-member choir. Mr. Connick's churchy benevolence cracked, however, when he called someone in the stage crew "you stupid fool" for nearly raising a curtain too soon.
Mr. Connick does best in his most thankless job, as band leader and arranger. He drew split-second accuracy from his musicians in arrangements that were both demanding and ingenious. He has assembled strong soloists, including Russell Malone on guitar and banjo, Leroy Jones on trumpet, Louis Ford on clarinet, Lucien Barbarin on trombone and Shannon Powell on drums -- not coincidentally, the makings of a traditional New Orleans jazz combo -- and Jerry Weldon on saxophone.
Mr. Connick leads a big band in the era of music video and sound bites, and he knows it. Band members, equipped with wireless microphones, roamed across the stage and into the audience; computerized spotlights bathed the bandstand in hot pastels. Often, Mr. Connick seems to have calculated his arrangements for a short attention span. In almost every song, fast or slow, a high-note trumpet climax brayed that the band is, indeed, big and brassy. Yet between the blares, Mr. Connick came up with finely balanced reed-section filigrees, subtle brass support and clever tempo shifts.
The opening overture, jump-cutting between be-bop dissonances and swing-era harmony, suggested that Mr. Connick is torn between sure-fire crowd-pleasing and modernist adventures, and the concert reinforced that impression. Mr. Connick would allow himself some brooding piano improvisations, to the audience's indifference, then turn "Sweet Georgia Brown" into a Liberace-like showpiece, drawing shouts of pleasure.
The crooners and composers of the big-band era were also entertainers, of course. But it's not the 1930's anymore, even with a recession economy. It may be beyond Mr. Connick to heal the rift between modern jazz and more popular entertainment that arose after World War II, especially with a strategy that depends so heavily on looking back. Still, it's encouraging that he isn't twice as corny.

HEADLINE: Volunteer Ambulance Corps Fill the Gaps

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
The Tri-Community Volunteer Ambulance Corps officially came into being at 5:36 last Saturday evening when its only ambulance responded to its first emergency -- a car accident on Clarendon Road in Brooklyn. And, as the crew merrily pointed out, they beat the Emergency Medical Service to the scene by a good 20 minutes.
"That's why we're here," the corps' ebullient driver, Darryl Ellis, said as he climbed back into the ambulance to wait until another emergency call sputtered over the police radio. 
 He did not wait long. By night's end, the ambulance had careered back and forth on the hard streets of Brownsville, East Flatbush and Crown Heights. Two more car accidents. A crack addict with a cracked rib. An alcoholic's seizure. A man collapsed on a sidewalk.
In an area where poverty and violence are adding more strain to an already burdened Emergency Medical Service, the city's newest volunteer ambulance corps is offering some relief. For the volunteers, it also offers something else: a sense of neighborhood pride.
"We saw them in all the other neighborhoods," said the corps' founder and president, Granville Barrett. "But there was nothing in this neighborhood. If they could have them, we thought we could have the same thing here."
There are 39 volunteer ambulance corps in New York City -- most of them in Brooklyn and Queens. Some corps have been around for years, including Bravo in Bay Ridge and the College Point Volunteer Ambulance Corps, the city's oldest, which was founded in 1942.
But there has been a surge of new corps in recent years, beginning with the creation of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer Ambulance Corps in 1989. What was once a fixture of rural and suburban communities and New York City's more remote neighborhoods has increasingly come to be seen as a necessity everywhere.
Besides Tri-Community, two other volunteer corps -- in Park Slope and East New York -- have applied to the State Department of Health for licenses and expect to begin operating in May and June. There are also plans to start services in Cypress Hills and East Harlem.
"Communities are recognizing that the resources are dwindling and there is a need to supplement existing services," said Steven E. Glass, the president of the Park Slope Volunteer Ambulance Corps, which, when approved, will respond to emergencies in an area from Third Avenue to Flatbush Avenue, including Prospect Park.
All the new corps were born of a feeling that the E.M.S. -- which answers a million emergency calls each year with 335 ambulances -- has become too overwhelmed to answer every call, in every neighborhood, at every moment.
For its part, the E.M.S. has by and large welcomed the new corps. A spokeswoman, Lynn Shulman, said that while the volunteers answered only about 20,000 calls last year, they filled in important service. "They're very important for their communities," she said. "And they help us out at times, too."
 
No Charge
 The ambulance corps, whose volunteers are certified paramedics and emergency medical technicians, do not charge to treat or transport patients. They do not compete with the E.M.S., but rather augment it, helping to better allocate service.
"Minutes count when it comes to lives," said Mr. Barrett, a tall, soft-talking immigrant from Jamaica who has himself been an emergency medical technician at the E.M.S. for 10 years. "Seconds do."
Mr. Barrett and John Bell, a Brownsville real-estate agent and landlord, decided to form Tri-Community in 1990. Following the example of the Bedford-Stuyvesant corps, where Mr. Barrett often volunteered, they began raising money and support. Until they received a $40,000 grant from the Robin Hood Foundation last year, a lot of expenses came out of their own pockets, including the $1,000 fee to apply for a license.
Last October, they bought a used ambulance for $2,000 at a lot in East New York. The ambulance was refurbished by Hatzolah, the volunteer ambulance corps whose response to the car accident in Crown Heights last August that killed Gavin Cato and touched off three days of violence angered many blacks in the community.
 
'More Than an Ambulance'
 The corps' headquarters is a rented storefront on 93d Street at Rutland Road in Brownsville. It is sparse, with second-, maybe third-hand furniture that starkly contrasts the neat, sterile packages of bandages, oxygen masks and other medical supplies. Duct tape holds maps and posters to the cinderblock walls. A police scanner sits on a dusty table, a coat hanger as its antenna.
Mr. Barrett envisions great things for the space. "We want to be more than an ambulance," he said. "We want to be a center for learning, a center for the community."
Already Medgar Evers College in Crown Heights holds classes there on Mondays and Wednesdays for students seeking general equivalency diplomas, and a cadre of neighborhood youths have made it a hangout. Mr. Barrett, a certified instructor, plans to hold classes to teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other life-saving procedures, hoping volunteers can train to be emergency medical technicians and find jobs in a community where unemployment is high.
Finally, last Saturday, after two years of preparation and paperwork, the corps was ready to roll. The volunteers -- 7 of a total of 15 -- arrived early. They put on their uniforms. They checked the ambulance.
Mr. Barrett drew the crew together for what amounted to a roll call (except everybody knew everybody). He turned to the driver, Mr. Ellis, who by day is an elevator mechanic in Manhattan.
"Don't be a Speedy Gonzalez," Mr. Barrett told him. "Stop at red lights. Remember, you don't have the right of way."
"We're here to help people, not hurt them," said another volunteer, Gladwin Thornhill.
"Besides," Mr. Barrett said. "It's our only ambulance."

HEADLINE: Confidence Indexes Show Brighter Consumer Outlook

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumer confidence, which had remained gloomy even as consumer buying had begun to rise, appears to be moving up again after a long slide.
The University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment, which edged up a bit in February, spurted more than 8 percent in the first half of March to 74.6 from 68.8. 
 Two other widely followed surveys are giving off small signs of growing optimism but have yet to show a decisive upturn. The weekly ABC/ Money Magazine poll, which has been hovering near its recession lows, perked up a bit in the last week. The Conference Board will not release its March figures until the 31st, but the February responses were more positive late in the month than they had been earlier, said Fabian Linden, executive director of the organization's Consumer Research Center. The index fell sharply in February.
The confidence measures are cheering forecasters, Bush Administration officials and marketers who have been watching the readings as anxiously as intensive-care nurses monitoring vital signs. The downbeat mood earlier this year had seemed to contradict statistical reports and anecdotal evidence of renewed spending. To economists, improvement in the confidence indexes is critical evidence that the recent jump in retail sales was not a fluke and that the economic recovery is not necessarily doomed to fizzle.
"I look for confirmation of other reports that the economy is improving," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence. "We economists need all the help we can get."
Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, said, "It helps make you comfortable with the idea that there's something real going on." Goldman now predicts that consumer spending will rise at a nearly 5 percent clip after inflation, which would lift the overall economy.
Economists had worried that consumers' pessimism could turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. A DRI/McGraw Hill calculation showed that if consumers remained deeply worried, retail sales would be $20 billion lower, and 100,000 fewer cars and 40,000 fewer houses would be sold this year.
This is not the first time that consumers have begun to open their pocketbooks before their spirits brightened. In 1991, for example, retail sales surged in February but confidence did not revive until a month later. One reason that moods take longer to mend than actual spending at the end of a slump: consumers can no longer postpone increasingly urgent purchases, like new tires, and there are plenty of bargains to tempt them.
 
Ups and Downs
 "Our data are much more precise in indicating the timing of a downturn, rather than an upturn," Richard Curtin, the director of the University of Michigan survey, acknowledges.
It is also not that unusual for the different polls to be out of line with one another for a month or two because they collect their data differently. The Conference Board, for example, gathers data by mail surveys, sending out 5,000 questionnaires every month to a revolving pool of families drawn from a larger pool, while the University of Michigan conducts a longer telephone interview with 500 families in a random sample drawn from across the United States. The margins of error built into any survey can also show up as differences.
Of course, confidence measures have never been a perfect predictor of consumer spending. But recent academic studies of the two longer-running polls conclude that factoring in confidence does make spending forecasts more accurate.
 
Discretionary Dollars
 The mood of consumers affects discretionary spending on everything from air-conditioners to cruises, and, according to Morgan Stanley, discretionary spending accounts for about one of every three dollars consumers spend.
The predictive record is especially good regarding spending on long-lasting big-ticket items, according to Adrian Throop, an economist at the San Francisco Federal Reserve. James Wilcox, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has also found a significant correlation between changes in consumer sentiment and total spending a quarter later.
"Confidence isn't as important as some other factors," said Richard Hagenauer, a market analyst at Whirlpool. "But it can make the difference for us between a good year and a not so good year."

HEADLINE: Informal Latin Economy Saves Day

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia

 BODY:
On every downtown city block here, men and women sit hawking their wares. From Bic lighters to Snickers candy bars to Brut shaving cream to Japanese television sets.
This helter-skelter commerce is only the most visible part of a vast informal economy that includes home building in Brazil, large parts of the bus system in Lima, Peru, and textile manufacturing in Bolivia. 
 Economists say that in the aftermath of a coup attempt in Venezuela earlier this year that has many politicians wondering how to strengthen the democratic process here, this segment of Latin America's economy, once scorned for evading taxes and fees, has become government's best friend.
The reason: Many Latin governments are in the delicate and lengthy process of reordering their economies, laying off tens of thousands of workers and cutting back on social programs. But that is not resulting in long lines of the unemployed because the informal economy is creating millions of jobs, feeding families and generating some of the most vibrant economic growth on the continent.
In industrialized countries, such marginal business activity might be shut down and outlawed. But not here. More and more politicians are realizing that letting the informal economy alone buys them much-needed time to attract new foreign investment, modernize industry and find new sources of development, without fear of social pressure that might push them back into the days of military government and subversive terrorist groups.
"This part of the economy is one of the most socially stabilizing factors in Latin America," said Grisela Mendoza, an economist with the consulting firm of Muller & Associates in La Paz. "These are some of the most robust segments of our economies."
Businesses in the informal economy often pay no taxes, have no licenses, offer no social security or medical benefits and sometimes deal in smuggled goods. But they also buttress parts of the formal economy -- so much so that governments are increasingly using a hands-off approach in dealing with the unlicensed, tax-free sector.
"Governments are finding that many of these companies over time tend to integrate naturally" with established businesses, said Francisco Leon, an economist with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.
In Chile, for example, he said many small businesses that do not pay taxes make goods that they then sell to large tax-paying companies. Those transactions separate the informal economy from a pure black market, bolster the industrial sector and help the informal sector to grow and mature.
 
Sharp Recent Growth
 The informal sector, though long a part of Latin American commerce, has grown sharply in the last decade. In Bolivia, economists calculate that if the informal economy did not exist, the country's unemployment rate of 7 percent would jump to 35 percent.
"I think it's safe to say that if you didn't have the informals you would have riots in the street in many capitals," said Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist and former adviser to President Alberto Fujimori.
A recent study by the United Nations Regional Program for Employment in Latin America and the Caribbean found that employment in the informal sector had risen to almost 35 percent of total urban employment,from 20 percent at the end of the 1970's. At the same time, urban unemployment fell to about 5 percent, from a peak of nearly 10 percent in 1983.
The informal economy represents up to 40 percent of urban employment in many countries, and in Peru economists say the figure is closer to 70 percent. This implies total employment at close to 40 million. Exact numbers are next to impossible to calculate by the very nature of this sector.
"You can't afford to crack down on these people," Mr. de Soto said. "They are in the informal sector because they have no choice. They have no access to credit. They cannot get their business application approved. Or they are just prohibited from opening such a business. They have nowhere else to go. If you start to crack down on them, they are bound to explode into political or violent opposition."
 
How It's Defined
 How economists define the informal sector varies widely. Most include only companies engaged in legal activities but not registered with the government because of excessive red tape, that do not pay taxes and fees, and do not provide their workers with required social security benefits and health coverage.
Still others include those involved in contraband trade and even drug trafficking and money laundering. Some economists say contraband trafficking -- excluding the cocaine trade -- accounts for only 11 percent of the sector's economic activity.
Many companies try to show at least some form of adherence to the laws. The United Nations study, for example, found that in Mexico only 27 percent of its small, informal-sector companies had not at least tried to register with the Government.
It is precisely the slowness with which government agencies move that leads many companies to work outside the law.
 
Long Waits Are Common
 In Ecuador, for example, it takes 180 to 240 days for a manufacturing company to register with the Government. In Venezuela, it takes up to 310 days; in Guatemala, up to 525 days.
Brazil, Mexico and Chile all require more than 20 applications before a company can be approved for business. This leads to tremendous start up costs, which make it nearly impossible for small entrepreneurs to follow the rules.
Moreover, complying with government regulations can be prohibitive. The United Nations labor group found that the cost of running a business in a number of Latin American countries could be as high as 70 percent of the company's annual revenues.
So businessmen skirt the law.
In Uruguay, a common practice is getting permission to manufacture, say, cosmetics, a license relatively easy to obtain. The business then manufactures a broad range of industrial chemicals, which it can argue are either integral to cosmetics or an offshoot of that business.
 
'License Pending'
 In Venezuela, small entrepreneurs often apply for a license to do business and then put in their windows a sign that reads "License Pending."
"They just make the application once and do nothing more," said Victor E. Tokman, executive director of the United Nations Regional Employment Program. "So when the inspector comes around they point to the application."
While some have argued that informal sectors are bound to disintegrate because they pay low wages, that contention has been disputed by some economists. Mr. Tokman says that on average, informal-economy wages are roughly comparable to minimum wages in Latin countries. Muller & Associates found that in comparing worker wages in the formal sector with those of the informal sector, the informal-sector workers often earned as much as $7 a month more.
"In one poll we found that 38 percent of those interviewed said that they preferred the independent work of the micro-entrepreneur," the firm said. "The informality offers a flexibility and independence that the formal companies cannot match." Formal employment relationships do provide health care, vacation and other benefits, but government clinics provide low-cost health care to all people.
 
Challenge for Governments
 The challenge for Latin governments, as they grow, is to incorporate the informal sectors into the mainstream of their economies, reducing tax evasion and enabling governments to crack down on illegal activities.
Mr. de Soto argues that while the informal economy offers governments a breathing space, sooner or later these entrepreneurs will get tired of not have legal title to land and businesses and of being locked out of credit.
"These people are getting very politically active and they are not taking things so easily any more," he said. "If over time they still cannot get a loan, or title to their land, you will find them moving toward guerrilla groups, to the side of certain military factions, to downright criminal activity."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Drop

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday, and long-term interest rates moved back above 8 percent.
Sellers emerged early in the session, in response to rumors that an account was unloading $500 million worth of bonds. Subsequent sales of corporate bonds by retail accounts forced the securities firms that bought the corporate debt to sell additional Treasury securities as a hedge against those purchases. 
 "The market is having a tough time again," one Government securities trader said. "It was starting to ignore bad news, but all of a sudden when a seller shows up, people run for cover. There is a lot of supply coming, and people are sitting on their hands."
Next week, the Treasury will sell $14.75 billion of new two-year notes and $10.25 billion of new five-year securities, record amounts for both issues.
 
 
Thin Volume
 Analysts said the size of yesterday's price decline -- as much as 7/8 point for some long-term securities -- was exaggerated because trading volume was extremely thin.
"The market was coming off of three days when it did pretty well, and had pretty much burnt off what had been an oversold position," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a firm in Princeton, N.J.
Mr. McCarthy said a surprisingly large improvement in a March survey of business conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia provided another excuse to sell.
The Philadelphia Fed's survey, which covers businesses in the Mid-dle Atlantic States, is seen by some as a fairly accurate early indicator of the better-known monthly survey of the nation's purchasing managers, which will be released on April 1.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 9917/32, down 7/8 point, to yield 8.04 percent. That compared with 7.96 percent late Thursday and 8.06 percent on March 13.
Among outstanding Treasury note issues, the 7 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 996/32 late yesterday, down 15/32, to yield 7.61 percent. And the 5 3/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 997/32, down 3/32, to yield 5.80 percent.
 
 
Short-Term Rates Move Up
 Short-term Treasury bill rates inched higher.
Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at 4.05 percent, up a basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 4.22 percent.
In the corporate bond market, the Tosco Corporation offered a total of $300 million worth of 12-year and 5-year high-yield bonds through an underwriting group led by Lehman Brothers.
The $200 million worth of 12-year first-mortgage bonds were priced at $100, or par, to yield 9 5/8 percent. The remaining $100 million worth of five-year 9 percent securities were also priced at $100.
All of the securities sold are non-callable for life.
The issue is rated Ba-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed Amid Concern About U.S.-Iraq Tensions

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in choppy trading yesterday amid concerns about the Middle East and rumors of possible central bank intervention in the markets.
The dollar, extremely sensitive to news and rumors regarding Iraq, was driven up by reports of a possible United States-Iraq face-off over United Nations demands that Baghdad destroy its remaining weapons of mass destruction. 
 Later, the dollar declined after reports that Iraq had apparently headed off a confrontation by making disclosures about its Scud missile and chemical weapons programs and promising to permit United Nations demolition of both, said Mike Faust, a currency market analyst with MMS International.
The dollar tends to rise when international tensions increase and fall when those tensions show signs of easing.
Mr. Faust said there was also mild talk in the market early yesterday -- when the dollar was up against the mark and the Japanese yen -- that the Federal Reserve might sell dollars against both currencies to bring the dollar down.
The Fed and the Bank of Japan intervened in January to try to stop the dollar's advance against the yen, which was falling in response to the weakened Japanese economy.
The dollar rose as high at 1.6840 German marks, breaking through the psychologically important 1.6800-mark level, Mr. Faust said. But the dollar then fell back to finish only slightly above Thursday's levels.
The dollar closed at 1.6730 marks in New York, up from Thursday's 1.67125. In earlier European trading, it closed at 1.6785, up from 1.6705.
The dollar closed at 133.85 Japanese yen in New York, up from 133.65. In Tokyo, markets were closed for a national holiday. In London, the dollar rose to 134.05 yen from 132.55.
The British pound rose against the dollar in New York, closing at $1.7120, up from $1.71075. In London the pound fell to $1.7045 from $1.7105.
In the precious-metals market, gold continued to rally in Europe on tensions between Iraq and the United States but then fell in New York as Iraq seemed closer to complying with United Nations demands. The metal is seen as a safe haven for investors during times of international strife.
Gold is still trading at its lowest levels in almost six years. On Thursday, it rose for the first time in a week.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold closed at $338.20 an ounce, down 60 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $338.25, off 50 cents.

HEADLINE: Tax Bill Veto Is No Loss

 BODY:
Congress worked feverishly and successfully to pass an economic recovery plan before yesterday's deadline set by President Bush in his State of the Union address. It need not have bothered. The bill provided paltry relief for middle-class families, no relief from the recession and virtually nothing to spur long-term growth. Worse yet, it reinstated a bevy of tax shelters of the type that were demolished by the glorious 1986 tax reform.
Mr. Bush's veto of the measure, though delivered for all the wrong reasons, was therefore welcome. 
 Congress won't let matters stand. But what in the bill is worth saving?
For starters, Congress can forget about trying to jump-start the economy. The economy has already begun to revive, if only slowly. Any stimulus Congress could now deliver would come too late.
The centerpiece of the tax bill is a dollar-a-day cut for middle-class families, paid for in part by raising the tax rate on the highest-earning families to 36 percent from 31 percent and by imposing a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million.
This approach is wrong-headed. Incomes of middle-class workers have indeed stagnated for two decades. But the problem is low wages, not high taxes. The answer is more investment, both public and private, so that work is more productive. Eventually this will require higher taxes.
The tax bill seeks a misguided cut of the tax on capital gains. Nearly every analysis concludes that it would have a minuscule impact on savings and investment -- especially so because Congress insisted on applying the tax cut to past investment. That's a nonsensical way to spur future investment and would shower well-to-do investors with windfall profit.
Another irresponsible provision is the so-called backloaded individual retirement accounts. Here, investors would be allowed to earn tax-exempt interest. But the provision would open a gaping budget deficit after five years or so, forcing a future Congress to raise taxes or slash public spending.
The bill, dishearteningly, rebuilds tax breaks for real estate and other special interests. Once this starts, there's no telling where it will end.
Sprinkled amid all the bad are a few provisions worth fighting for. The bill would wisely make permanent the low-income housing tax credit, which promotes new home construction in urban ghettos. It simplifies the earned income tax credit -- an effective income supplement for low-paid workers -- so that more eligible families will get what's due. And some of the new subsidies for corporate investment may be worth keeping, provided they fit into a plan for comprehensive reform of the corporate taxes.
But the list of good reforms is appallingly short. Mr. Bush vetoed the bill because, he contended, taking back part of the huge tax cuts that were handed to the wealthy by Mr. Reagan would imperil the economy. Absurd reason. But right outcome.

HEADLINE: Wrong War, Wrong Weapons, Wrong Thinking

BYLINE: By Adlai E. Stevenson; Adlai E. Stevenson, a Democrat and Senator from Illinois from 1970 to 1991, is chairman of an international merchant banking firm.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
President Bush and Congress have declared war on recession. But they are fighting the wrong war, and, as in yesterday's tax cut jousting, both sides are using the wrong weapons.
Though the recession may be receding, the real weaknesses in the economy are structural and not amenable to quick fixes. The real war is over economic competitiveness; the trouble with fighting this real war is that it has been a loser politically. Competitiveness is not a tidy subject that readily captures the public's imagination. 
 Economic adjustment and diversification, the development of skills, energy policy, public investment, capital formation, the regulation of financial services, technological innovation, foreign marketing, financing trade -- these are elements of the war to improve competitiveness. But it has been difficult for Presidential candidates to communicate more than simplicities and imagery.
Almost 20 years ago, Congress held hearings and began studies on competitiveness issues involving such sectors as steel, cars, consumer electronics, semiconductors, as well as emerging industries. Reports, speeches, legislative initiatives followed. Academicians weighed in.
But as the challenge from abroad materialized, energies seemed to dissipate. Economic reformers in Congress were denigrated as "neo-liberals," and "industrial policy" was characterized as "picking winners and losers." Then came the "magic of the marketplace," the Reagan era's casino economy and, today, still more competitiveness studies.
In the meantime, other countries, led by Japan, focused on improving their industrial competitiveness. Typically, the U.S. bailed out Chrysler instead of helping to modernize the auto industry. Restraints on Japanese auto exports enabled Japan's producers to increase prices and profits and invest in U.S. production, seizing a larger market share. And now , as Japan imposes more restraints on itself, Detroit still isn't satisfied. Today, Congress and President Bush propose tax reductions that could increase the Federal debt and long-term interest rates, weakening the dollar without stimulating an economy that isn't responding to the stimulus of a deficit approaching $400 billion.
President Bush has offered no long-term measures to arm us for this competition other than banking reforms. Other leaders seek votes with expedients like unemployment benefits while threatening trade retaliation, blaming other nations for our own failures.
More foreign competition is on the way. Europe is integrating. Less developed and former Communist countries are reforming. China is on the move. In East Asian capitalist countries, policies are based more on economics and less on domestic politics, and the economics are not based on free-market orthodoxy. Growth and competitiveness drive these governments. They foster savings, production and exports, something we don't do. Elite bureaucracies in close cooperation with industry formulate and carry out economic policy for the long haul.
Segments of U.S. industry are adjusting to the foreign competition and becoming more efficient, and some business leaders are learning from Japan. But it is still difficult to detect rational policy making in Washington. It remains more responsive to political pressure and opportunism than economic necessity.
The early hearings in Congress helped a few reformers realize that the U.S. in effect had an industrial policy -- a complex web of tax concessions, loans, grants, guarantees and selective trade protection. But it was a de facto industrial policy -- unsystematic and politically motivated. We concluded that the most important thing to do was simply to get politics out of Government decision making and inject economic pragmatism into it. The net result would mean less Government intervention, not more.
Bashing President Bush and Japan has not gone over with many voters. If Gov. Bill Clinton can focus on the real war, articulate a vision of America's place in the future and lead us toward the next century, not just the next election, he will give Americans more confidence in themselves. Paul Tsongas, one of the early reformers in Congress, resisted quick fixes. He was ahead of his time then and now.

HEADLINE: The Fed Is Investigating Dealings in U.S. Note

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York confirmed yesterday that it was conducting an investigation into a possible squeeze of seven-year Treasury notes.
Reports that the New York Fed and the Treasury Department were asking major government securities dealers about a squeeze were initially carried late Thursday by the Bloomberg News Service. 
 Concern about the possible squeeze prompted the Fed to send letters on March 10 to all primary dealers -- the 38 banks and investment firms approved for direct dealing with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York -- requesting daily information since March 11 on each firm's immediate and net forward position in the 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes. The request sought information on notes held or controlled through repurchase transactions.
 
An Active Market
 The seven-year notes, which were auctioned in January just as interest rates bottomed, have been trading expensively in the repurchase market since February and have become more difficult to borrow since the New York Fed's letter was mailed, traders said.
In the overnight repo market, in which firms use securities as collateral for an overnight loan, the seven-year security is in such demand that it now trades at 3/4 of 1 percent, compared with an overnight financing rate of 4.15 percent. That means a trader who wants to borrow the seven-year notes to satisfy a customer order or cover a short position must agree to lend money at less than 1 percent to the dealer who has the notes.
Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Fed, acknowledged the letters had been sent. Officials at the Treasury Department declined comment.
The inquiry is representative of the New York Fed's shift in responsibilities from surveillance of the primary dealers to market surveillance, Mr. Bakstansky said. That change was prompted by the Salomon Brothers scandal that erupted in August and the resulting changes in the government securities market recommended in a January report by the Fed, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Salomon admitted in August that at an auction of two-year notes on May 22 it had bought almost 94 percent of the offering, an amount far in excess of allotments allowed by the Treasury to any one securities firm.
 
Conducting an Inquiry
 Mr. Bakstansky said of the current investigation on the seven-year note, "We are suggesting there is a squeeze." "
Credit market participants said reasons for the apparent squeeze had more to do with natural market forces than with any deliberate manipulation.
Most investors who own the 6 3/8 percent issue are probably unwilling to sell, analysts said, because the price of the security in the cash market has fallen sharply since it was auctioned.
Late yesterday the 6 3/8 percent securities were offered at a price of 94 26/32 , to yield 7.35 percent.
Under the new market guidelines, the Treasury Department could decide to "reopen" the issue and sell more of the seven-year notes to eliminate the shortage.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 23, 1992, Monday / April 8, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's investigation of the market for seven-year Treasury notes omitted a word and thus misstated the bank's position on the inquiry. While confirming that the bank had asked 38 dealers for information on their holdings of the notes, a bank spokesman, Peter Bakstansky, said Friday, "We are not suggesting there is a squeeze."
An article in Business Day on March 21 about trading the day before in the credit markets misstated the amount of two-year Treasury notes purchased by Salomon Brothers at an auction on May 22, 1991. Salomon bought more than the 35 percent allotment allowed by the Treasury, but not as much as 94 percent.

HEADLINE: Technology Hasn't Kept Its Promises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Cut Off from the New Reality" (Op-Ed, Feb. 23), David Gelerntner laments the decline of science and technology as American ideals: artists and visionaries nowadays ignore the glamour of new inventions, students avoid science courses, commercial desktop computers sit idle, and no one looks forward anymore to a future made brighter by jet planes, atomic power and robots. 
 He's right. In the 1950's, atomic scientist ranked with cowboy and fireman as typical responses when boys were asked what they wanted to be when they grew up. In 1957 Sputnik added paranoia to fascination as fuel for our romance with science. As late as 1980, when the computer made the cover of the major news magazines, there was a widely shared expectation that computers would rapidly revolutionize educational and domestic life in the United States.
No such revolution has happened. On the contrary, far from bringing us to a utopia where, for example, electricity is too cheap to meter, our scientific achievements have become objects of suspicion.
People ask why, if our computers and machines are so proficient, we have 33 million poor, faltering schools, 20,000 toxic waste sites, a $3.5 trillion national debt and this lingering recession. There is a growing intuition, more unspoken than articulated outside of academe, that the technology-dominated textures of our culture are poisonous to people's deepest sense of the richness and worth of their own lives.
The chief benefits of most domestic technology are efficiency and pleasure. Both, though addictive, quickly reach a point of diminishing returns when pursued to satisfy the needs of the spirit.
The youngster who spends a fine spring day playing computer games alone admits to a certain unspoken rage, in that the day was not spent bicycling country roads with friends or building a treehouse. Children who witness parental divorce in a household full of state-of-the-art appliances wonder what real human purpose, finally, all those machines have.
Mr. Gelerntner is right about the effects of our apathy toward technology, but wrong about the causes. It does not proceed so much from laziness or ignorance as from a sort of desperate wisdom.

HEADLINE: CAMPUS LIFE: S.M.U.;
The Student as Tutor And Also as Neighbor

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Four Southern Methodist University students here are taking their education a step further in a new course this semester by living in an urban neighborhood to learn about urban living firsthand.
The students are living in what had been a crack house in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood, East Garrett Park, which is being renovated by Dallas Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit housing agency that builds homes with low-income families. Each family has to devote 400 hours of work to building their own home. 
 While living in East Garrett Park, which is minutes away from the campus, the students provide tutoring for neighborhood children.
Cris Lake, a senior political science major from Dallas, who began the program, said that living in a community takes tutoring a step further. He said that when his tutoring sessions are finished, the university students do not turn their backs on the children, leaving them "to the drug dealers and prostitutes."
 
Learning Way of Life
 "These kids face things that college students never faced," Mr. Lake said. "If college students can't get a very good grasp of what's going on, then how can we possibly consider trying to work on these problems?"
"The first day of my senior year, the first person I spoke with when I moved in, was a prostitute," he said. "That's what these kids have to face every day."
These students are enrolled in "Problems in American History: Studies in Urban Culture," a history course that explores the development of urban culture. Marilyn Johnson, the assistant professor of history who teaches the course, said the class explores urban politics, economy and social relations, migration and the development of minority neighborhoods in American cities.
The 14 students taking the course must devote a minimum of six hours a week to tutoring inner-city children. The four students living in East Garrett Park are doing so on their own; the university does not sponsor this part of the project because of the liabilities involved, the administration said.
 
'Real-Life Skills'
 Another student living in the East Garrett Park house, Cris Crane, a senior anthropology and sociology major from Austin, Tex., said, "It's really important to us that we live down here."
Kelly Perkins, a senior history major who is also from Austin, said she valued the course because she was learning "real-life skills."
The associate dean of undergraduate studies and administration, James Hopkins, said the course was an acknowledgment of the university's responsibility to the community.
"Universities in urban centers must form a creative partnership with their cities," he said.
 
Neighbor Is Excited
 One neighborhood resident, Donna Ortega, a 29-year-old whose daughter participates in the tutoring sessions, said she had been excited about having the students living next door.
"To me, it's been a huge difference," she said. "I feel a whole lot better in my house at night. I feel like they're going to look over me."
Alfredo Regalado, a 12-year-old who attends the tutoring sessions, said he had grown close to the students living nearby.
"They're always around," he said. "They help you and they go and chitchat with you. It's kind of safer because they're always passing around. They're your buddies."
But the future of the program will be in the students' hands. Mr. Lake said: "The burden is on us to insure that students continue living out here next semester. But we're extremely hopeful that with the increasing interest, we'll be able to convince the administration that this is a program S.M.U. should embrace."

HEADLINE: NEXT LEVEL;
Clinton Turns His Energies To Bush Battle

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
After all the candidate forums, all the Holiday Inns, all the box lunches, all the tarmac news conferences, all the panic and the exhaustion and the adrenaline buzz of watching large groups of people whipsawed by gossip and rumor and personal attacks, the Democrats finally seem close to choosing a nominee.
Sometimes it felt like Lonesome Dove, a cross-country cattle drive with amphetamine timing. Now, of course, it will begin anew. 
 Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas was making all the appropriate comments last week, saying that he took nothing for granted and would continue to campaign hard for the nomination in the remaining 21 primaries and caucuses. But former Senator Paul E. Tsongas's rueful withdrawal after his losses in Illinois and Michigan left the Governor from Arkansas as the presumed nominee, with seven times the delegates of his remaining rival, the maverick former California Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr.
Already, Democratic leaders, who created this jam-packed primary schedule in hopes of producing an early nominee -- and, miraculously, seem to have achieved just that -- were turning their attention to George Bush.
Over at the Democratic National Committee, where memories of how the Democrats were out-campaigned and out-researched in 1988 run deep, they have been clipping and studying and looking for booby traps in the Bush record. Down at Bush-Quayle headquarters, similar "opposition research" is under way on the Democrats. Out on the campaign trail, the shape of the coming debate is already emerging.
If Mr. Clinton has his way, this will be an election about change -- yes or no. The 1980's, he argues, are over, their economic policies repudiated, and the country desperately needs a fresh new direction. He campaigned against Mr. Tsongas by calling him a man who wanted to continue "trickle down" economics, notably a cut in the tax on capital gains, rather than redress the inequities of the decade with measures like a middle-class tax cut and greater investment in education and training.
Mr. Clinton's aides believe his message needs fairly little retrofitting for the general election. From their perspective, he has simply left behind the body double for the real thing. "George Bush is the ultimate believer in the 1980's and the ultimate believer in trickle down," said James Carville, a top strategist for the Clinton campaign. "George Bush wouldn't know change if it ran over him."
Robert Teeter, the chairman of the Bush campaign, counters calmly that it will be easy to avoid getting trapped in the role of Mr. Status Quo Incumbent, a role that every incumbent who can read polls desperately fears this year. "The obstacle to change is Congress," Mr. Teeter said in an interview on Friday. "Every poll shows that the number of people who recognize that is increasing. And it's not a Republican Congress."
The Republicans, in other words, are not foolish enough to cede this ground to the opposition. It may be harder for a party in power for 12 years to present itself as an agent of change, but Ronald Reagan did it deftly in 1988: "We are the change," he told the Republican convention in New Orleans.
 
Ready for Something New

 As Mr. Bush vetoed the Congressional tax measure late last week, asserting that it would not ease the nation's economic plight, there were a lot of references to change.
"If the Democratic leadership that runs the status quo Congress will not help us change America, we have to change it without them," he said. "Change is nothing to fear." The idea behind all this, of course, is simple enough: Eight out of ten Americans in recent polls say the economy is in bad shape, and huge majorities have told poll takers that they think the country is headed in the wrong direction. Change is the last thing they fear.
Oratory can only help an incumbent President so much; what Mr. Bush probably needs most is continued improvement in the economy. He has other, related needs: His approval ratings have been hovering at 40 percent. The old Reagan coalition seems to be fraying badly; in the 1980's, a growing economy helped keep socially liberal baby boomers and conservative Christians under the same tent. And Patrick J. Buchanan's angry primary attacks casting Mr. Bush as a man who breaks his word and jettisons his principles have opened some wounds.
Still, Mr. Clinton's path is anything but clear, beginning with the approaching primaries in Connecticut and New York. To begin with, there is Mr. Brown, who shows very little inclination to fade away. The endgame with him may not be as difficult as the endgame was with the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, because it will not involve the sensitive issue of racial respect; the political always seemed fused with the personal when a nominee negotiated with Mr. Jackson.
 
Why Democrats Worry
 Still, Mr. Brown is viewed by many Democrats as a dangerous opponent because he seems to revel in throwing bombs. The Clinton forces will be trying to undercut his "we the people" appeal by focusing on his support for a flat tax, which they will present as a giveaway to the rich -- which, of course, fits neatly with their general election themes.
The deeper issue for Mr. Clinton is the fear within the party that some new character issue will emerge. Even those who dislike Mr. Clinton are somewhat amazed at his ability to plow through charges of marital infidelity, of manipulating his draft status to avoid Vietnam, and, most recently, of conflict of interest stemming from the partnership of his wife, Hillary, in a law firm that does business with the state of Arkansas.
But Democrats still worry. Many in the party believe that anything that distracts the public's attention from the economy this fall will hurt the Democrats' chances.
The Clintons seem to be trying to appeal to generational solidarity: if the standard is perfection, Mr. Clinton asks, who could pass? And, by extension, should the messy lives of the baby boomers forever foreclose them from power?
For all of that, Mr. Clinton has been given a great gift. This was a short campaign, waged largely by Presidential novices who were always scrambling for money and the limelight; they fell quickly and they fell hard. They also left with considerable grace, as Mr. Tsongas did last week.
Always left standing was Mr. Clinton, maneuvering through the complicated politics of South Florida or Chicago's City Hall, picking up endorsements wherever he went, eyes glittering and very, very hungry.
For all the talk of demographics and the broad forces of economics and culture, Mr. Clinton's campaign teaches once again that simple fire in the belly can do a lot. After the emotional detachment of Michael S. Dukakis, after the ambivalence and calculation of the Democrats who pondered a race last year but decided against it, Mr. Clinton and his crew provide a dose of political id for the Democrats.
They want the White House and they want it bad.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Israel Confronts the Idea of Life Without Washington

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told a couple of American journalists half a dozen years ago that he wanted to be remembered after leaving office as the Israeli leader who "kept things quiet."
When it comes to Israel's most important relationship, that with the United States, events obviously haven't worked out quite the way he hoped. Today, relations between the two countries are an unquiet mess. 
 Inevitably, there are sharp debates over whether blame lies with the Shamir Government, for showing capital-lettered intransigence on settlement construction, or with the Bush Administration, for its equally bone-rattling coldness toward a democratic ally.
Either way, this is perhaps the lowest point in the decades-old partnership, serious enough to persuade some Israelis that there is a Humpty Dumpty break that cannot be put back together again. At least not in quite the same way. Israel's strength has "always depended on our alliance with a strong and supportive superpower," wrote Gidon Samet, a columnist for the newspaper Haaretz. "Now it is gradually withdrawing that support. In the long run, the end result will be to reduce not only Israel's ability to honorably support itself financially but also to defend itself."
One obvious reason for the gloom was that, after months of sturm und drang, Mr. Bush last week drove a stake through the heart of Israel's request for $10 billion in United States loan guarantees to resettle Jewish emigres from the former Soviet Union. The aid was doomed because Mr. Shamir, defying the President's objections, insists on continued Israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories. Shamir loyalists now grumble that the Administration never intended to provide the loan guarantees in the first place. The rift leaves Israeli economic planners to contemplate the likely consequences, with most predicting that belts are going to be worn tighter around here by next winter.
A second big worry set in over the last 10 days, affecting Israel's top priority: security. A spate of reports by American news organizations said the Administration was disturbed that Israel may have played fast and loose with promises not to hand third countries the arms technology it gets from the United States unless Washington approves. One accusation was that Israel had given China technology from the Scud-bumping Patriot missile. Other stories told of missile components, cluster bombs and assorted hardware going on to South Africa, Chile and elsewhere.
 
Israeli Denials
 The Israeli response, unequivocally, is that the charges are bunk. Why, officials ask, would they pass along technology that could let China develop better missiles that could then be sold to Arabs?
A common view here is that the sudden American press leaks must be part of a get-Israel campaign, possibly aimed at hobbling the country's arms imports and defense industry exports. A few military specialists say the strategic relationship with the United States may be at a turning point. For most Israelis, that is not comforting. They were hardly reassured after the United States Navy lost track of a North Korean ship suspected of carrying missiles to Iran and Syria. Nor are they soothed by the Americans' threat to bomb Iraq again to get rid of Saddam Hussein's remaining weapons of mass destruction. That, Israelis fear, could send more Iraqi Scuds their way, and this time they cannot be expected to absorb the blows without retaliation.
As it is, many Israelis feel they are already in a war. Arab attacks in and around the occupied territories have risen sharply in the last month, and there is a new readiness of the Israeli Army to shoot on sight. Last Tuesday, in Jaffa, two Israelis were killed and 19 wounded by a knife-flailing Palestinian from the Gaza Strip. Then, later that day, a bomb devastated Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires, killing at least 29 people, including 4 Israelis. The disaster put many here in a wagons-in-a-circle mood, bitter enough even to blame the United States for inspiring the violence by allowing Arabs to think, in the words of a high-ranking official, that "the Americans have thrown Israel to the dogs."
Passions like that, born of grief, may subside. Israel is at the edge of a campaign for June national elections, and the opposition Labor Party can be counted on to turn its fire on Mr. Shamir and his Likud Party. While Labor was quiet in last week's funereal climate, its new leader, Yitzhak Rabin, has argued in the past that Likud is to blame for the perilous shape of relations with the United States. Indeed, should a who-lost-America debate develop, many Israelis (and many American Jews) are ready to name Mr. Shamir himself -- for poking his thumb in Mr. Bush's eye over settlements and for suggesting that he cares more about his ideological right wing than easing the financial pain of Soviet Jews.
Some opinion polls give Labor a slight edge. But political experts caution that, besides the obvious fact that Election Day is three months away, Israeli voters are capable of an emotionalism that tends to favor Likud when they feel the way many did last week -- resentful and convinced that forces out there are trying to wash them away. Even now, some in Likud are saying that Mr. Rabin is really Washington's candidate.
A Likud victory would leave the Bush Administration with everything it presumably does not want: Mr. Shamir still in power, an active settlements policy still in effect and an Israel so distrustful that it will take no security risks for peace with the Arabs. And that would be hard for Mr. Bush to boast about come November, when he must face his own electorate.

The Latest Technology Fuels the Oldest of Drives

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
As increasing numbers of Americans, searching for intimacy in the age of AIDS, turn to computer keyboards to aid their fantasies, computerized sex play is becoming a growing issue for the companies that sell on-line information services. The possibility of increased law-enforcement surveillance and new restrictions could hamper the electronic networking that the computer industry sees as one of its most promising vehicles for new economic growth.
Last fall, a 42-year-old man in Fremont, Calif., using a nationwide computer conferencing system, posed as a 13-year-old homosexual boy. He said he was electronically approached by someone identifying himself as a 50-year-old New Yorker who tried to arrange a meeting. In Massachusetts in January, a man was indicted for raping a 12-year-old boy whom he befriended through a computer bulletin board. 
 While computer video games with sexually explicit cartoon-like animations have been available and routinely exchanged over networks for a decade, these incidents arose from a newer phenomenon -- an emerging form of interactive computer sex play. Like telephone encounters, in which people dial 900 numbers to listen to fantasies described by an anonymous sexual surrogate, computer bulletin boards and conferencing systems permit individuals who don't know each other to "meet" and exchange intimacies by typing messages back and forth.
Unlike telephone conversations, however, which convey some information about age and sex, the computer permits people to hide their identity entirely. At a computer keyboard it is possible to assume any identity and change roles on a whim.
The user of a computer connected to a data network can simply type messages that show up instantly on the screen of another user around the corner or hundreds or thousands of miles away.
Bulletin boards or "chat" systems provide an important source of revenue for many on-line computer services like Compuserve and America Online. (Prodigy, a joint venture of Sears and I.B.M., does not permit a chat feature and discourages electronic messaging with high fees.)
Until Minitel, the French computerized information service, began cracking down on the so-called "Rose" services, the sex-oriented messages constituted more than 20 percent of the usage on its conferencing system. They dropped to less than 10 percent in the last year.
Yet in the United States keyboard sex-oriented communication is on the rise. "There is a lot of heavy clicking out there," said Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for the Future in Silicon Valley, who studies the impact of computer technology.
One recent evening, users of the America Online network had the opportunity to visit a series of "rooms" offering, for example, "Naughty Girls," "Romance Connection" and a "Gay Room." After meeting electronically in the public room -- actually a window in which comments from many users scroll by -- new friends adjourned to private rooms for intimate conversations, often using noms de plume or "handles."
Roger Dietz, the man from Fremont, Calif., told newspapers and television stations that he has been in contact with 20 to 30 pedophiles using America Online.
Mr. Dietz, a computer designer for a Silicon Valley company, said in a phone interview that he had subscribed to the service to see if child pornography was being traded, as he had heard. "For me child pornography is where the line is crossed," he said.
After the incident America Online turned over computer files that contained pornographic materials to the F.B.I. The company said it prohibits messages that are defamatory, obscene, profane, racially threatening or illegal, but that it does not, and cannot, monitor private electronic mail. "It's none of our business and it shouldn't be our business," Stephen Case, the company's president, said.
Gerard Van der Leun, a spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a public interest computing group that has focused on civil liberties, said that his organization has heard from people concerned about sexually explicit photographs being transmitted via computer networks. "These people have been up and transmitting since the technology first existed," he said. "If someone wants to see erotic pictures it's much simpler to go to any newsstand in America."
Future computer conferencing promises to become even more graphic. This fall Sierra On-Line, a software publisher in Coarsegold, Calif., began commercial service of a network that lets subscribers control animated graphic simulations in interactive versions of the company's computer games.
Many, such as chess, checkers or simulated airplane dogfights, are familiar and aimed at all ages. But one will be an interactive version of its best-selling adult software program, Leisure Suit Larry. In the personal computer version, a computer user can control an animated cartoon-like character through a set of interactions with female characters. In the network version, to be called Larry Land and restricted to people who sign a statement that they are 18 or older, users will be able to configure the appearance of their own characters and engage in a variety of adventures with cartoon characters controlled by other users. When sex takes place, only faces will be visible on the screen, said Kenneth A. Williams, Sierra On-Line's president.
"We want it to be G-rated," he said. "On the screen you will see a close-up of your partner's face and you will have buttons to control your own facial expression."
He said he realized the service might prove controversial. "It's going to pose some interesting social questions," he said. "Will real-life spouses get jealous? It's going to cause more than one divorce, I suspect."
Mr. Williams said that he had attempted to interest the software industry in a rating system, similar to the system used by the movie industry. But officials at the Software Publishing Association said there was little need for it because sex and violence are not generally part of commercial software. "We may have to re-evaluate this with the advent of multimedia," said Kenneth Wasch, president of the Software Publishers Association. Technology is rapidly leading to a new generation of software that runs television-quality animations coupled with sound and data capabilities, he said.

Bush's Other Race: Defeating the Recession

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
With the Presidential race now narrowed, almost certainly, to George Bush versus Bill Clinton, another race is shaping up as critical: George Bush versus the sluggish American economy. The question is whether Mr. Bush can make the economy strong enough fast enough to insure his re-election.
No business cycle in America is more predictable than the four-year political one: Presidential election years are, with rare exceptions, years of economic expansion, and 1992 looks like no exception. 
 As this year's campaign warms up, the economy is showing signs of warming, too. One indicator, released last week by the Commerce Department, was a jump in housing starts of 9.6 percent in February over January, which itself was higher than first estimated. The spurt lifted private housing starts to an annual rate of 1.3 million homes -- 29 percent higher than a year earlier.
Other signs have been the rise in retail sales at seasonally adjusted rates of 2.1 percent in January and 1.3 percent in February, after zero growth in the fourth quarter of 1991; the uptick of industrial production by six-tenths of 1 percent in February, after an eight-tenths of 1 percent decline in January; and the increase in payroll employment by 164,000 jobs in February after a drop of 149,000 in January.
Yet, until now, the pace has been too slow to bring down the jobless rate. Unemployment jumped to 7.3 percent last month, the highest since the recession began in July 1990. The economy will have to run much faster than it has in the now-ending first quarter, when it scarcely grew at all, to reduce unemployment before November.
Will that happen? Only the naive believe that the customary economic expansion in the fourth year of the political business cycle is a happy coincidence arranged by a Providence smiling on Presidential incumbents. Most skeptics, economists and Presidents themselves believe, as Franklin D. Roosevelt said, that "we planned it that way" -- or at least tried.
Bringing the economy in stronger is harder than it used to be, partly because of the estimated $400 billion deficit, which inhibits big tax cuts or spending increases, and partly because a more sophisticated public would look cynically, even fearfully, at a Federal Reserve Board that tried to jazz up the money supply to keep a President in office. If expectations of inflation rose, banks and other lenders would raise interest rates to compensate for the loss of value of their principal. And rising interest rates could spoil the recovery.
Such concerns have not deterred President Bush, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady or Michael J. Boskin, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, from pressing Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, for an easier monetary policy and lower interest rates. They contend that, with so much spare industrial capacity and unemployed labor, inflation is not a problem. Many Democratic Congressmen and economists have joined them to prod the Fed.
 
The Fed Gets Aggressive
 The conservative and anti-inflationist Mr. Greenspan was extremely cautious about easing monetary policy until late last year, while maintaining, in Congressional testimony a year ago, that the Fed had eased "aggressively." But a leading monetary economist, Prof. Benjamin M. Friedman of Harvard, contends that the decline in short-term rates last year, roughly one and three-fourths percentage points, may represent, given lower inflation, "little decline, and perhaps none at all, in the real interest rates that primarily matter for either stimulating or retarding business activity."
On the threshold of the Presidential election year, however, the Fed did move. Just before Christmas, it cut the discount rate it charges commercial banks by a full point to 3.5 percent, its lowest level in a quarter of a century.
Although short-term, inflation-adjusted interest rates are still historically high, there is little question that the Fed has become more aggressive. It has increased its purchase of Treasury securities in the open market, injecting more cash into banks and increasing their lending ability. From the first quarter of 1990 through the final quarter of 1991, the Fed's holdings of Treasury securities increased by one-third, from $233 billion to $312 billion.
 
Politics and the Money Supply
 Some conservative economists harshly criticize the Fed for moving too fast to do the President's bidding and fear that converting too much of the national debt into cash will kick off inflation again. This is a familiar story, says Prof. Thomas Havrilesky of Duke University. In "The Federal Reserve Chairman as Hero: Our Defense Against Monetary Excesses?" in the current issue of The Cato Journal, a conservative publication, he concludes that "over the last 40 years political pressure on Federal Reserve officials has grown intense" -- and has usually succeeded.
The politicization of monetary policy, he argues, was set up by the Banking Act of 1935, which increased the power of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee at the expense of the regional Federal Reserve Banks; and the Fed's ability to contain monetary excesses was further weakened by the Full Employment Act of 1946.
"The historical record shows that the great money expansions under Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Carter and Reagan were preceded by signals to the Federal Reserve to do something about adverse movements in interest rates or exchange rates," Professor Havrilesky said. Because the lag between rapid monetary growth and rising inflation is likely to be a year or more, Presidents, whatever their political ideology, can hardly resist pressuring the Fed in election years.
However, some economists, including pragmatic conservatives like Mr. Boskin, the President's adviser, as well as liberals and middle-of-the-roaders, believe that pressure for greater monetary growth is a healthy corrective for the conservatism of central bankers in times of unemployment, overcapacity, recession or sluggish growth with low inflation.
During the Great Depression, the Fed was timid even when deflation was the problem. But this time the Fed appears to have eased money in time for the November election; the reductions in interest rates are starting to percolate through the system, especially by raising housing construction. This will affect lumber, concrete, steel, plumbing fixtures, furniture, streets, sewers and other public works, and perhaps even autos.
Whether the spur will be strong enough remains to be seen. The economy is not some great mechanical instrument, like a mighty Wurlitzer organ, on which the Fed can reliably play first on the high notes to stimulate the economy and then on the low notes to slow it down. The Fed cannot precisely control the money supply or the speed at which it turns over. Meanwhile, monetary policy is the only lever for an Administration seeking to boost economic growth. President Bush proposed a fiscal package including a cut in the capital gains tax, a $5,000 credit for first-time homebuyers and tax breaks for professional real-estate investors but Congress rejected it.
Then the President vetoed on Friday a Democratic bill, by Representative Dan Rostenkowski and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, similar to his own but callingfor a cut in middle-income taxes to be offset by a rise in upper-income taxes. Mr. Bush, challenged by the right-wing Republican Patrick Buchanan, said his worst mistake was forsaking his "no new taxes" pledge and that he would never do it again.
To punish the Democrats for not giving him his self-described stimulative tax program by March 20, the President has promised to knock out $4 billion of what he considers waste; desirable as that might be for the long haul, it would not speed recoveryin the short run.
But the President's willingness to take that chance implies his confidence that Mr. Greenspan has delivered on the Fed's commitment to get the economy growing again -- and, implicitly, to keep it growing through 1992.
There is nothing Bill Clinton can do or, probably, would do to prevent a recovery, even if he could. He might wish, like St. Augustine, to be made "virtuous, but not yet." But his commitment to business, farmers, workers, the middle class and minorities is to unite them in an effort to improve the economy and to attack social, educational, environmental and industrial problems, to advance living standards and make America more competitive. He's got to be for more growth and more jobs now.
And the more that actually happens, the more Mr. Bush is likely to win in November. That's the real advantage of incumbency in an election year -- and the real explanation of the four-year political business cycle.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Political Ads May Wound, But Not Win Races

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
By most accounts, it was during the 1988 Presidential campaign that media consulting really triumphed over message. Together George Bush and Michael S. Dukakis spent a record $50 million on television advertising and it is widely believed that the Republicans' notoriously inflammatory Willie Horton ad helped seal the doom of the Democratic ticket.
This year, not surprisingly, the Presidential candidates have already spent millions on commercials and seem on their way to matching the 1988 total. Commentators have dusted off their warnings about the power of advertising. 
 There are reasons to believe, however, that these warnings may be overstated. Political scientists who have explored the subject have, so far, failed to discover any direct connection between running ads and winning votes. Some have even concluded that television advertisements are a relatively ineffective use of resources.
"Advertising is something you've got to do," said Michael Robinson, a professor of government at Georgetown University. "But it is clearly the single most overrated club in a candidate's pack."
Professor Robinson examined the correlation between winning and spending on advertising in the last two Presidential campaigns and found that the connection was, at best, weak. In 60 primaries in the 1988 campaign -- 30 in each party -- in which one candidate significantly outspent the others, the big spender won only 40 percent of the time.
In the Georgia primary, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee outspent the Rev. Jesse Jackson 5 to 1, but Mr. Jackson still won. And in Maryland, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas outspent George Bush by 2 to 1 and still lost.
Because many of the primaries had three or more contestants, Professor Robinson concluded, "one could say that big spenders did better than expected. But they did not do very well -- better than chance, but not much better."
Big spenders have also had their shares of losses in 1992. While the final figures are not yet available, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska is believed to have waged the most expensive media campaign in New Hampshire; he came in third.
Measuring advertising's effects is a lot like studying the ties between television violence and crime: there are so many other factors at work that it is tough to draw neat conclusions. During a campaign, voters learn about the candidates from a range of sources as diverse as their surroundings: local politicians, friends, news reports, televised debates and, of course, commercials.
Darrell West, a Brown University political science professor who studied 40 years of Presidential campaign advertising, said that what ads do best is raise issues that may influence votes. In the 1964 campaign, he said, commercials that President Lyndon B. Johnson ran with pictures of nuclear explosions turned the hawkishness of his opponent, Barry Goldwater, into a central campaign issue.
But, Professor West said, it is hard to find connections between ad campaigns and victories and, in the end, the best indicator of whether the incumbent's party will win is the state of the economy.
"Ads are incredibly influential in shaping campaign dynamics," he said. "But they're not nearly as influential in terms of the final vote."
One of the first systematic studies of Presidential campaign advertising was done in 1972 by Tom Patterson, a political science professor at Syracuse University. He analyzed the ads that candidates were broadcasting and the news the networks were airing, then assembled panels of voters and asked them what they knew about the candidates.
Professor Patterson concluded that messages in the ads came across more clearly to voters than messages on the news, and that ads communicate most effectively to people who do not watch the news. But from this, he said, it is possible to demonstrate only that advertising conveys information, not that this information translates into votes.
"There's an effect there," Professor Patterson said. "But I certainly wouldn't say advertising decides elections."
The putative power of advertising reached its height in 1988 with the Willie Horton ad, which showed a black man who had been given a weekend pass from a prison in Massachusetts while Mr. Dukakis was governor. While on furlough, he viciously raped a white woman and beat her fiance. The advertisement was aired in September by a political action committee supporting President Bush, and was followed by another ad with the same theme -- but without Willie Horton -- aired by the Bush campaign itself.
In the aftermath of the election, critics of television-driven campaigning often credited these attack ads with President Bush's victory. But several researchers argue that the connection -- if there is one -- is indirect. They note that Mr. Bush's most significant surge in the polls took place around the Republican convention in August -- before the Horton ads began. And the most important factor in this surge, they say, was not advertising, but the news coverage of the convention.
"It's a myth that these ads elected George Bush," said Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. "Free media is more important than paid media. These moments when you see big shifts in the polls you can usually associate with something that is happening in the news."
Professor Robinson of Georgetown also argues that news coverage helped President Bush more than commercials did. In general, he says, Presidential candidates would be better off focusing less attention and money on advertising.
"The first thing I would say to candidates," he said, "is 'See if you can buy some journalists.' "

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK REGION;
New York Medicaid Strained by Newly Poor

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
BARRY T. BERBERICH, the director of long-term care for New York's Medicaid program, has a favorite horror story.
It involves a New York City woman who qualified last year for Medicaid by impoverishing herself a few weeks before applying. To get Medicaid to pay for the health-care services she was receiving in her home, the woman transferred her assets -- enough to generate $168,000 in annual interest income -- to another person. 
 The horror was not so much that a New Yorker would brazenly abuse a tax-supported public health program. After all, thousands of middle-class and wealthy people in New York State and elsewhere, aided by a cottage industry of lawyers, have taken advantage of state and Federal loopholes to qualify for Medicaid benefits when they needed long-term health care.
The real horror, at least for a state in fiscal distress, has been the lack of political will in both Albany and Washington to close the loopholes.
Many advocates for the poor, who are fighting budget cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs for the truly needy, see that as evidence of an insidious syndrome. Although long-term care is the most costly and fastest growing part of the state's Medicaid program, it has enjoyed a measure of political protection because it is largely a middle-class entitlement program, they say.
Some state officials concede the point.
"It is often much easier from a political point of view to deal with issues that are just perceived as welfare," said Michael J. Dowling, director of health, education and human services for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. "With long-term care, you are dealing with a clientele that is largely not the traditional welfare population. They are getting public assistance, but the public doesn't perceive the welfare population as being the elderly and disabled."
Yet Medicaid spending on the elderly and disabled, who make up a quarter of the state's Medicaid recipients, accounts for two-thirds of the state's Medicaid costs.
Many are middle class or wealthy people who qualify for Medicaid after transferring their assets or taking advantage of other loopholes. About 500 New York City residents qualify each year for Medicaid after shielding assets in trusts, which is allowed by Federal law. Others are covered because state law grants Medicaid benefits to anyone whose spouse simply refuses to pay health-care costs. New York law also allows residents to qualify for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care while a spouse keeps up to $66,000 in assets.
This year's fiscal crisis has made long-term care far more vulnerable than in the past. Budget negotiations in recent weeks have included discussions on whether to increase taxes on nursing home revenues, clamp down on the use of trusts and other loopholes and restrict the number of hours that Medicaid will pay for attendants who cook, clean and shop for the homebound.
Carl S. Young, president of the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, said such cuts will almost certainly put some of the state's 630 nursing homes out of business. Nursing homes already have lost $200 million to state budget cuts in the last three years, and the state's recent decision to delay Medicaid reimbursement payments by two weeks left some nursing homes on the brink of insolvency, he said.
"There are facilities that are so close to the bone that they send couriers to pick up Medicaid reimbursement checks from the state rather than waiting for them to come by mail," Mr. Young said. "It's the only way they can make their payrolls."
Whatever the condition of the nursing homes, Medicaid spending on long-term care has not been subjected to the same political assault experienced by programs that solely benefit the poor.
The highly public campaign being waged by the Republicans who control the State Senate has focused on proposals to fingerprint welfare recipients, restrict Medicaid coverage for the able-bodied poor and cut welfare grant levels.
The Senate Republicans refer to New York as "the Cadillac of welfare states," a claim that Mr. Cuomo ridicules given that welfare recipients live well below the poverty level. What is less arguable is that New York provides Cadillac long-term care coverage, and that it is long-term care costs that are driving the explosive growth in Medicaid spending.
From 1986 to 1990, Medicaid spending for long-term care increased by 82 percent, to $4.9 billion, while all Medicaid spending grew by 65 percent, to $11.6 billion, according to the state Department of Social Services.
A recent study by Jane S. Little, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, showed that New York's spending on its average Medicaid recipient in 1989 was 48 percent above the national average. Its Medicaid spending on recipients in skilled nursing facilities was 122 percent above the national average.
The high costs were not simply a reflection of health care in New York. The state's per capita health care bill for all residents was only 16 percent above the national average.
Assembly Majority Leader James R. Tallon, Jr., a Binghampton Democrat and an expert on Medicaid, said one reason for the high cost has been the rapid expansion of programs to care for long-term care patients at home.
But Mr. Young attributed the high spending rates to the costs of labor and state regulation. "New York State as a government has never met a regulation it didn't like, and that's not always bad," he said. "But there's a cost attached to that."

HEADLINE: The Young Face of Inner City Unemployment

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 21

 BODY:
Salvador Martinez ran a hand through his short-cropped hair, smoothed his freshly ironed T-shirt and walked through the warehouse door of the Vargas Furniture Manufacturing Company, hoping to find work as a laborer.
An 18-year-old high school dropout from one of the poorest neighborhoods of Los Angeles, he has never held a steady job, and the more he looks for one the more he thinks he never will. 
 Economic analysts say he may well be right. It is no surprise that as jobs become harder to find at every level, the people who are hurting the most are those who have always had it hardest: young members of minorities from the inner cities.
Almost half of the teen-agers in urban poverty areas are without jobs, with young blacks having the highest rate of unemployment, said John Bregger, an assistant commissioner in the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington.
And as jobs become scarcer, economists say, poorly prepared black and Hispanic young people are being pushed off the bottom rung of the economic ladder by working-class whites who are themselves being pushed down the same ladder.
A few days on the streets with some of these young men and women showed how ill-prepared they are not only for the workplace but for the job hunt itself, coming as they do from communities where unemployment is often handed down from generation to generation, like a trade.
A former gang member with a bullet wound, gang tattoo and a jail record as his resume, Mr. Martinez said he had been trying to find work for four months to help support his parents and the child his girlfriend is expecting.
He had already tried most of the factories, warehouses and meat markets in the area, but he nurtured a special hope for Vargas because his father had once worked in a furniture factory.
"I wonder if you've got any more applications," Mr. Martinez said, taking a deep breath and peering through a small plate-glass window at the Vargas warehouse.
"We're not giving them out," came a voice from inside.
"O.K., thank you," Mr. Martinez said, and the job interview was over.
"Another usual day," he said, climbing into the cab of his father's pickup truck to continue his search. "Most of the places I go, they say they have no openings right now. Some other places say, 'I'll give you a call.' That's all I ever get."
Back at Vargas, the woman inside the window, a telephone operator, said young men like Mr. Martinez came by all the time to look for work.
"If I gave this boy an application, the whole area around would hear about it and people would appear out of nowhere," said the telephone operator, Marilyn Raygoza. "When we do have jobs, we post them, and we get scores of people, lines and lines of people around the block."
If Mr. Martinez had asked when applications would be given out or had asked for the manager or had even asked for the manager's name, she said, she might have taken more notice of him and given him some help.
But everywhere his father drove him on this usual day, his questions were the same and the answers were the same.
"Got any applications?" he asked at the Tampico Spice Company, where the air was thick with the mingled smells of cumin, bay leaves and coriander.
"No, we don't," said the warehouse supervisor, Aurelio Cardenas, looking up briefly from his lunch.
"O.K., thank you," Mr. Martinez replied, and left.
Perhaps, Mr. Cardenas said, if the young man had gone around back to the manager, he could at least have learned when applications would be given out. "You've got to keep coming back," he said. "It's the only way."
Last year, the unemployment rate for black teen-agers in poor urban areas was 43.4 percent, said Mr. Bregger, the Labor Department analyst.The figure would be even higher if it included those who make do with part-time work and those who have given up the job hunt altogether. "This is the highest unemployment-rate group you are going to find in the country: young blacks living in metropolitan poverty areas," he said.
The unemployment rate for Hispanic teen-agers like Mr. Martinez in poor urban areas was 28.6 percent last year.
 
Scarlet Letter
 One contributing factor is a dropout rate that rises from 60 percent to nearly 80 percent in some largely black and Hispanic high schools in Los Angeles. Many of these dropouts can barely read and write, said James Johnson, an expert on urban problems and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Those inner city young people who do stay in high school will at least be taught how to fill out a job application, although, said one teacher, Connie Covert, "I'm not sure all of them realize the importance of it."
"They may also have a prison record -- the scarlet letter of unemployability -- and they are locked into communities where there are no opportunities, no jobs," he said. "I don't think many of them find employment."
In the Nickerson Gardens housing project in Watts, not far from Mr. Martinez's home, idle young men stand about in groups or wander among the purple two-story buildings, stopping sometimes to swing on the swings of a playground.
Managers of the project estimate that 60 percent to 75 percent of the 1,061 families here receive some form of government assistance.
One unemployed resident is Sean Neal, 19, a gang member since the age of 14 who has already spent a year and a half in a juvenile detention center and who lives with his mother, who is also unemployed.
He has rarely ventured beyond the project, and the very idea of hunting for a job is almost beyond him. "I heard about a company where they make plugs and things," he said. "But I don't really have time right now to go check it out. At least, I don't have transportation to go."
Another is Shamiena Byrd, 17, who quit school three years ago because that was what most of her friends were doing. She is now working toward a high school equivalency diploma and holds a part-time secretarial job at a day-care center in the project.
There are few businesses here in Watts, and beyond its boundaries young black people looking for work in fast-food restaurants or elsewhere carry with them the stigma of where they are from.
"A lot of times, the system doesn't look at who you are but where you come from," Miss Byrd said. "Because of the reputation that Watts has, they usually think anybody that comes from Watts, they're bad."
And many times, she said, they are right.
"I have to say most girls -- most women -- around here, they are on welfare. Most of the guys, they sell drugs. That's just how it is," she said. "A lot of people, they feel like, 'Working at McDonald's, that's not going to get me the new car I want, or clothes.' But selling drugs, that's quick money, that's easy."
She said such people sometimes filled out a job application simply to continue receiving unemployment benefits, and some employers said many applicants were clearly more interested in the application forms than in the jobs.
Miss Byrd said it was also not unusual for young people to use their unemployment checks as seed money for drug dealing.
"If you was raised up in Watts, people put you down," said David Harrell, 19. "You've got to know somebody to have a good job, and I don't know anybody."
 
No Fast Food
 A job counselor at Community Youth Gang Services, a city-financed social agency, said it was often difficult to persuade young people from the projects to look for work, particularly when they have so little chance of finding employment.
"They don't want to work at fast food; that's not cool," said the counselor, Terri Holmes. "They prefer to do laborers' jobs in warehouses, or be baggage handlers at the airport.
"But a lot come in and tell you they can make a better living selling drugs," Ms. Holmes said. "To them, they are working. If they are out selling drugs, that's a job. It takes talent. It's not easy selling drugs. You have to look over your back constantly. You could be arrested or killed."
When Mr. Martinez came by her office for help, Ms. Holmes sent him to a United Auto Workers office that referred him to two auto-parts supply outlets for job interviews.
"I told them I just need a job," he said later. "I told them the truth. I told them I don't have experience, but I know how to stack stock. It's not that hard a job. They just said there's no jobs, that's all."
Mr. Martinez once worked for nine weeks as a laborer for the city Department of Public Works, but as so often happens to day laborers, he was dropped when the work ran out.
"You get frustrated," he said. "When I was at the D.P.W., two of my friends were there trying to get jobs like me, but they gave up. They're selling drugs right now. It's like the last possibility, the only way you're going to make money."
Mr. Martinez knows that life. He joined the Florence Southside gang at the age of 13, served six months of a two-year sentence for assault with a deadly weapon when he was 15, and was shot through the upper arm in a gang confrontation when he was 17, the year he dropped out of high school.
Some of his friends, observing his futile job hunt, have urged him to join them selling drugs. But he said he had seen enough of life to know that that option was "just a ticket to go to jail."
On the other hand, the only work Mr. Martinez has had in recent months is 28 hours of unpaid labor to work off a $138 traffic violation.
 
Dream Job
 Asked about his ambition, Mr. Martinez laughed. "I don't have an ambition," he said. "I just want a job."
But then he let himself dream for a moment.
"When I used to have part-time work here in the meat market, I used to be a box boy. That was nice," he said.
"What I'd really like is, I'd like to work for the city. I enjoyed the nine weeks I worked for the city. I used to clean up the streets in a crew van, cut the edges of the grass that grows in the alleys. That would have been just perfect."

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
New Kind of Potomac Fever Is Caused by Spartan Living

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
A guillotine has not yet appeared on the Potomac, but the mood here is very tense.
For years, the capital has had a caste system that allowed its top officials immunities and emoluments and deference and perquisites. 
 Now that voters have sent a message that they are fed up with pampering, preening and prodigal behavior among the Washington aristocracy, many here are gloomily assessing whether it is worth living in a world where they are expected to behave like ordinary mortals.
 
Des Moines or Albany?
 "You might as well be in Des Moines," grumped John C. White, a lawyer and former Democratic Party national chairman.
Joseph Canzeri, a public relations consultant who was an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller, complained, "It might as well be Albany."
Tom Korologos, a Republican lobbyist, said, "Why not just go to Salt Lake City and open a gas station?"
Jack Brooks, the cigar-chomping veteran Texas Congressman, said he was not enmeshed in the House banking affair but that he was disgusted with what he sees as the sanctimonious tone of the debate on privilege.
"There is a move afoot to destroy the Congress as we know it," he drawled. "In the future, the kind of people who run for Congress will be coming up here living in sleeping bags and sleeping in their offices and riding bicycles to work."
Pause for effect. "Or they'll be right-wing extremists getting chauffered around in Cadillacs," he went on, in a cutting reference to Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip who has been prodding the Democratic leadership on the scandal but who wrote overdrafts himself and still rides in limousines.
Mr. White, another ebullient Texan, agreed that "the Great Man syndrome is important."
"They've already taken the sex and drinking out of politics," Mr. White said. "Hell, if they get this thing to where you can't exhibit a little sense of power -- that's what drives this city," he went on, a bit tongue in cheek. "If you don't have a policeman to stop traffic to let you walk across the street like you are somebody, how are you going to know you're somebody?"
And with that insight into the psychology of power, Mr. White raised intriguing question about politicians' struggles to take a more spartan stance to appease voters whose tempers are ragged from the long recession: How can Beltway mandarins who signal their status through their trappings and perks feed their egos in a no-frills universe?
Or could the zealous reformers be going too far? Is it so wrong for members of Congress to have, say, free use of a gym, and a modest one at that?
"Clearly, the bloom is off the place, so far as members feeling fed up with having to put up with this kind of nickle-and-dime criticism," said Representative Charlie Rose, a Democrat from North Carolina. "A member of Congress from a sun belt state came up to me today and said: 'I gave up a good job as county executive with good pay to come up here in the middle of all of this. I could be playing golf this afternoon if I was home.' "
 
The Good Old Days
 Mr. Canzeri, in a burst of wheeler-dealer nostalgia, agreed: "Give me some smoke and some back rooms."
Under Washington tribal customs, there were always supposed to be Mr. Fixits like Bobby Baker to provide anything a legislator desired, from a bag of cash to a willing young lady, or men like Jack Russ, the recently deposed sergeant-at-arms responsible for the House bank, who rose by making life a bit easier for his 435 bosses.
Now, such faciliators and fixers are scarcer. After Mr. Russ's ouster, the House postmaster, Robert V. Rota, resigned. Representative Bill Thomas of California, the ranking Republican on the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over the post office, said the resignation signaled the "post-plantation" mentality in Congress. And Mr. Rose, the chairman of the committee, said the problem with "Can't Say No Rota" was an "overabundance of trying to be helpful to everybody.
 
A World Turned Around
 That used to be the whole point. But when practices that are de rigueur in one era suddenly seem sleazy in another, Washington power figures can get caught in a political and moral wind shear.
All last week, Representative Jim Nussle, a 31-year-old freshman from Iowa and the youngest member of Congress, sat in his office like Robespierre, scribbling a bill that would ban all luxuries for House members, from free flowers from the Botanical Garden to free prescription drugs to cut-rate haircuts.
When Speaker Thomas S. Foley announced on Friday that he was ending many of the perquisites that Mr. Nussle and other young legislators had complained about, Mr. Nussle was jubilant. "This is a red-letter day for the Nussle reform movement," said Mr. Nussle, who wore a bag on his head on the floor of the House a few weeks ago to show how embarrassed he was about the bank scandal.
 
Thomas Hearings Pivotal
 Mr. Nussle said that, for his constituents, the last straw was the Judiciary Committee's televised hearings last autumn on Prof. Anita F. Hill's charges of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas.
"That really woke them up that we needed sweeping reforms," he said. "They didn't realize that those guys in Congress were that old or that they can't talk off the cuff anymore."
Mr. Nussle's ideas are embodied in "The Nussle Congressional Reform Package," which he says has been written in language he picked up from his constituents. Typical chapter headings are: "New Blood," "Use a Stamp" and "Go Home.
Mr. Nussle's efforts are playing well at home. The Waterloo Courier ran a picture of what it called THE BAG used by Mr. Nussle, who says he has had inquiries about whether it belongs in the Smithsonian as a symbol of the voter uprising of the 90's.
 
Clean, as in Cincinnati
 Representative John Boehner of Ohio, another of the freshmen Republicans who call themselves the Group of Seven, who are rebelling against privilege, agreed that the American people now realize that politics does not have to be like it is in New York and Chicago, where "people almost expect politicians to be less than honorable." Instead, he said, politics can be "clean and decent, like where I come from in Cincinnati."
Self-indulgence is fast becoming unfashionable. In tune with the new puritanism, the caricature of pot-bellied lawmakers pursuing young women on Capitol Hill is fast fading with the chilling effect of the Thomas hearings and the undoing of Senator Brock Adams of Washington amid accusations of sexual misconduct.
"There's a mortal death fear sweeping Washington that the voters have finally figured it out, that they've discovered they can take matters into their own hands," said Michael McCurry, a Democratic consultant. "Politicans are afraid that the game is up."
 
Time to Clean House?
 Mitch Daniels, a business executive in Indianapolis who worked as the political director in the Reagan White House, said that every few years, Washington goes through "tremors" on the issue of cleaning house in "the Club," as the old boys' world of Congress is known.
This time, Mr. Daniels said, he believes that "this could be the year the tremors get a little more seismic."
Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican consultant, said many political observers are predicting that there may soon be as many as 90 to 125 new members of Congress after November.
"It will be interesting as we go to a perkless society," Mr. Duberstein mused. "Will they turn the House gym into a day-care center?"
 
Down-to-Earth Carter
 When he was President, Jimmy Carter tried to cut back on imperial perks. He wanted to carry his own bags, and he even wanted to give up the Presidential limousine for a regular old car, until the Secret Service told him to forget it.
But he fell victim to the entrenched ways of Washington. When Mr. Carter's approval ratings dropped and his friend Charles Kirbo asked a group of Washington's "wise men" for advice, he got some from Jim Rowe, a former aide to Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was that Mr. Carter should "abandon his cardigan-sweater routine and seem more Presidential," as Harry McPherson wrote in his memoir, "A Political Education."
Richard M. Nixon, on the other hand, went too far in the other direction. When he ordered that the White House guards wear uniforms modeled after those of European palace guards, including parade caps and braided shoulder pieces, critics pounced on them as too imperial and they were quickly dropped (and later lent to the Southern Utah State College marching band.)
Michael R. Beschloss, the historian and author of "The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960 to 1963," said that Americans were ambivalent on this point, because they have two opposing longings: "They are very distrustful of authority, and like Jefferson, they want to throw everyone out every 20 years, and they have a longing for a monarch."
But while Americans may not want to see a President carry his own bags, even in the present anti-privilege mood, they do think the House of Representatives should be the least lordly institution.
 
Putting Green Donations
 Although Democrats threaten to make the privileged backgrounds of President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle an issue in the general election, the White House does not seem overly concerned.
A White House official told a House Appropriations subcommittee this week that a putting green and a swimming pool have been built on the grounds of Mr. Quayle's official residence, paid for from a fund of about $390,000 in "private donations" for renovations desired by the Quayles.
As if the source of the money mattered. Everyone in Washington knows that when private donors give for a putting green they know this is not one of the thousand points of light. They want something in return, whether it is a chance to be heard on business regulations or an invitation to a state dinner.
Even Ralph Nader does not believe that Washington will ever become a Naderville, where the President must do without official flower arrangers.
 
Comment by Nader
 Mr. Nader evoked the days of Thomas Jefferson, who walked out of the White House after his inauguration and went back to the boarding house where he had lived to have supper with his fellow tenants.
Mr. Nader knows those days are gone forever. "There will always be powerful men with minute minds trying to kick over the ship of state trying to get another freebee or perk or another $25,000 on their salary," said Mr. Nader.
Mr. White predicted that "we'll get tired of showing off in our hairshirt and move on to something else."
Charlie Rose agreed. "I doubt," he said drily, "if we will ever be called the nation's monk class."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Israel at Sea

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21

 BODY:
At a convention here last week for young American Jewish donors to Israel, the Israeli Ambassador, Zalman Shoval, made an impassioned and revealing appeal to get United States-Israel relations back on track.
Pointing to the Muslim republics of Central Asia that were once part of the Soviet Union, Mr. Shoval asked, "Is there not a danger that they will become fundamentalist and anti-Western and present a danger to the Middle East more than the Soviet Union once did?" Therefore, he continued, is it wise for the Bush Administration to "disregard" Israel as a strategic ally at this time? After all, he concluded, "the strategic relationship between the United States and Israel now is as important as it ever was -- even more." 
 The urgency of Mr. Shoval's appeal was revealing: Israeli leaders seem to be recognizing belatedly that with the end of the cold war a sea change has taken place in their relationship with Washington and they can no longer argue as effectively as before that they are a "strategic asset" for the United States. The Israelis are scrambling to find a new basis for the relationship with Washington.
Differences over what that relationship should be are at the core of all the recent tensions between the two countries -- from loan guarantees for housing immigrants to charges of improper sales of American arms technology.
 
Old Politics in New Era
 The Israeli Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, "is still trying to play cold-war politics in a post-cold-war era, and it just isn't flying," said Steven L. Spiegel, a historian of the United States-Israel relationship. "In the old days, the two sides would have a fight, and then make up, usually on terms acceptable to Israel. But that isn't happening now because the whole context for the relationship is changing. Shamir still wants to play football, and Bush is telling him the football season is over. Now we are playing basketball."
To be sure, American officials say, the Middle East remains an unstable area and Israel a potentially useful ally, but against whom? Because the threats have grown so much more nebulous, the value to Washington of any particular strategic ally is also more nebulous. Also, with the end of the cold war, Washington is concerned much less with military alliances generally, and much more with a country's economic importance or its efforts to promote stability in its neighborhood.
Further, President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, all come from a wing of the foreign policy establishment that never believed Israel was a strategic asset -- an assumption they feel was confirmed by the Persian Gulf war, when they had to spend their energy keeping Israel out of the fighting so they could keep the Arabs in. Added together, these factors mean that Washington has a very different idea of what the relationship with Israel should be in the wake of the cold war.
The situation, a senior Administration official said, can be summarized this way: Israel wants to continue acting as America's policeman in a region where it is convinced American and Israeli interests face real threats -- even if they are not immediately apparent. But Mr. Bush wants the Israelis to be America's catalyst for a peace process that he is convinced can promote real regional stability -- even if that is not immediately apparent.
 
'Shared Values' Needed
 "The Israelis are deluding themselves if they think that strategic politics alone has been or ever will be enough to make this relationship work," said a senior policy maker dealing with the Middle East. "Like any special relationship, it has to be based on something more -- shared values."
Before the 1980's, shared values between two democracies were indeed the foundation of the United States-Israel relationship. But the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the Israeli crackdown on the Palestinian uprising and the rise to power of an Israeli Likud Government driven by a religious-nationalist agenda have combined to make it very hard for some Americans to feel the sense of shared values with Israel that they once did.
In the early 1980's, Likud leaders understood that, and they began to emphasize the role of Israel as a strategic asset for the United States against the Soviet Union. This dovetailed neatly with the interests and obsessions of the Reagan Administration. This strategic argument, though, was like a blanket that was keeping the relationship warm; once it was removed at the end of the cold war, both sides discovered that underneath the old relationship had badly eroded, American officials say.
When this is coupled with the general turning inward by Americans today, and the fact that neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Baker came into office with a deep emotional commitment to the relationship with Israel, it accounts for the increasing alienation between the two countries. This alienation was starkly apparent in the dispute over Israel's request for loan guarantees, which Mr. Bush refused to grant unless Israel froze settlement-building in the occupied territories.
Administration officials have been pointing out to leading American Jews that something very unhealthy, even dangerous, has happened in the fight between Israel and the Administration over this issue: The case for Israel has increasingly become the almost exclusive preserve of American Jews, rather than the cause of a broad consensus of Americans.
The fact that an American President would reject loan guarantees for Israel -- in an election year -- and find overwhelming support for his position in all national polls, suggests that Israel is badly out of step with the public mood. Samuel Lewis, a former American Ambassador to Israel, said: "When it gets down to just the American Jewish community as the only ones ready to go out and fight Israel's battles, that is very dangerous for Israel and for the role of American Jews in American society."
The end of the cold war requires Israel and many other American allies to shift ties with Washington from "a politics of shared enemies to a politics of shared opportunities," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. "That is what our leadership, and the American Jewish leadership, have not understood."
 
The Peace Standard
 Since the end of the cold war, the United States has increasingly judged allies on whether they are promoting peace and stability in their region. Administration officials insist that by putting together the Arab-Israeli peace process that started in Madrid, they have given Israel a new lease on a special relationship, by basing it not on a shared enemy, but rather on a shared opportunity for peace. The deal proposed by Mr. Baker after the round in Madrid included a freeze on Israeli settlements in return for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel and a suspension of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. While both Mr. Shamir and the Palestinians rejected it, the Administration focused more of its wrath on Israel because it expected more.
"What seems to rankle Bush and Baker is that for them everyone is changing and adapting -- except Israel," Mr. Spiegel said. "When they look around, every country they deal with, from South Africa to the Soviet Union and from Albania to Nicaragua, has a new policy, but Israel is behaving as if the Berlin wall was still up and as if Madrid never happened. I think that is what is grating on Bush, and he is saying to Shamir: 'You don't want to see the world has changed? Then boom, I will hit you over the head with it.' "
Hope for the future lies with the Madrid process, said Stephen P. Cohen, of the Montreal-based Center for Middle East Peace. The importance of that process, he said, is that "it brings together both values and strategy" -- that is, it holds out the prospect of a Middle East based on Arab-Israeli reconciliation, in which Israeli and American moral values and strategic interests are in harmony, rather than clashing.
 
Importance of Cash
 But Madrid is not a cure-all, because post-cold-war foreign policy relies not only on strategy and morality, but also on cash, which is in increasingly short supply in the United States. The loan guarantees were killed not only by settlements, but also by the general American aversion to foreign aid in an election year.
The recent charges of improper Israeli transfers of American arms technology to third countries are also related to the financial issues growing out of the end of the cold war. Israeli arms companies, like their American and Russian counterparts, must now increasingly try to sell weapons abroad not for foreign policy reasons but for profits, because without the cold war all domestic arms budgets are being reduced.
American officials say that they have known for years that Israel was probably crossing the line in reselling American technology, but that they looked the other way. Now that the world's total arms-sale pie has shrunk and Israel is seen as a more significant competitor, many American military officials are no longer willing to avert their eyes. And this will be a constant source of tension.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Clinton Starts Setting Sights on Fall and Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton campaigned across New York and Connecticut yesterday, courting teachers' votes, fighting off Edmund G. Brown Jr. and asserting that President Bush vetoed the Congressional tax and economic growth package as "cover" for a reluctance to raise taxes on the upper class.
Starting his day in New York City, Mr. Clinton collected the endorsements of local members of Congress and the New York State United Teachers union. He also used the Bush Administration's decision to relax restrictions on abortion counseling in federally financed clinics as a chance to needle the President on an issue that has divided Mr. Bush's own party. 
 "On this issue, as on so many others, it's hard to divine a real conviction on the part of the President," the Arkansas Governor said.
But even as Mr. Clinton kept his eyes focused on the President and the fall election, he also did some local campaigning aimed at the primary next Tuesday in Connecticut and the one on April 7 in New York. He strolled through downtown New Haven, ate pizza and then flew to Buffalo, where he engaged Mr. Brown in a debate.
The dual aims of Mr. Clinton's campaigning reflects the unsettled position of his campaign as it scrambles to reshape its strategy for a political landscape that has shifted dramatically in recent days.
For months the Clinton organization focused on a multi-candidate struggle for the Democratic nomination. Now it has suddenly turned into a lopsided race between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Brown. The former California Governor is far behind in the struggle for delegates to the Democratic National Convention in July.
Though his aides said he was hoping at first to take some time off after former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts suspended his campaign on Thursday, Mr. Clinton decided to continue on the primary trail to avoid giving the appearance that he was taking the nomination for granted.
Tailoring the schedule literally on the fly, campaign aides said today that they would not begin any major strategy shifts until after the New York and California primaries, the latter on June 2. But the shift in Mr. Clinton's focus and his growing stature as the primary spokesman for the Democrats was evident as he assailed Mr. Bush for vetoing the emergency economic measures offered by Congress on Friday.
He asserted that Congress was trying to "give some modest relief to middle-income families whose incomes have gone down while their taxes have gone up" and that Mr. Bush offered objections to the Democratic plan as "cover for the fact that he simply cannot bear to raise taxes on the upper class."
Mr. Clinton also delivered a strong attack on the Administration's policy on Israel, a perennial political issue in New York. "All they have done is hit on Israel," he said. But Mr. Clinton denied he was tailoring his remarks for his New York audience, saying, "I don't think I've pandered on this issue."
At the news conference he received endorsements from three Democratic lawmakers from New York , Representatives Charles E. Schumer, Ted Weiss and Jose E. Serrano.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE SHIFTING THEIR INVESTMENTS BACK TOWARD HOME

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 21

 BODY:
After investing hundreds of billions of dollars abroad during the 1980's, Japan has reversed course and is pulling money into the country at a rapid rate.
Japanese banks are lending less to foreign customers, particularly in places where business conditions are difficult, like California. Japanese corporations are building fewer plants abroad and acquiring fewer companies. And big Japanese investors are selling, rather than buying, the American securities they spent nearly a decade buying in large sums. 
 At the same time, foreign investors have become the largest purchasers of Japanese stocks and bonds. The result is that instead of $100 billion or more flowing out of Japan each year, $30 billion to $40 billion a year is flowing in.
 
The Tide Shifts
 The sharp and unexpected swing in Japanese capital is putting upward pressure on interest rates in the United States and making it tougher for other countries -- including Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union -- to import the money they need to grow, some economists say.
With the flood tide of Japanese money having dried up, these other countries must find alternative sources of money, reduce their demands or compete harder for what money is available by offering higher interest rates to attract investment.
During the years of enormous Japanese investment in the United States, some economists warned that the United States was left vulnerable to an abrupt withdrawal. If the Japanese merely slowed their purchases of United States Treasury bonds, the economists cautioned, it might cause havoc in the markets.
 
Recession Eased Withdrawal
 What has spared the United States such withdrawal symptoms has been the American recession, said Kenneth S. Courtis, an economist in Tokyo with Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, because the slowdown reduced demand for money.
But as the American economy struggles to shake off recession, the pinch may be felt more. "It is not a matter of pulling the trigger in Tokyo and having the gun go off in New York," Mr. Courtis said. "It's more like a slow squeeze."
Last year Japan brought home $36.6 billion more than it invested overseas. (Figures are not yet available on the flow of money between the United States and Japan.) That was the first time since 1980 that Japan imported more long-term capital than it sent abroad.
Long-term capital involves acquisitions of real estate, stocks or bonds and investments in companies, the building of plants and long-term bank lending. These include the construction of large automobile plants by the big Japanese auto makers and such prominent takeovers as the $2 billion purchase of Columbia Records by Sony in 1988, the $6.13 billion acquisition of MCA by Matsushita Electric Industrial in 1990 and the $846 million deal for control of the Rockefeller Group, the owner of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
While some experts thought the 1991 figures might be temporary, many economists are concluding that the flood of money Japan sent abroad during the 1980's was an aberration that may not be repeated soon.
Two years of volatile declines in the Japanese stock market and a looming economic slump here are accentuating this trend by making the money supply much tighter at home.
From 1985 to the end of 1990 Japan exported an astounding $596.2 billion in long-term investments, helping finance the United States budget deficit, corporate takeovers, construction of Japanese auto plants abroad and a host of other investments around the world.
One broad lesson is that in an era when borders are increasingly open to large shifts of money, often with a few keystrokes on a computer in a brokerage house trading room, the flow of money can change direction swiftly than most people had thought possible. The United States in particular is finding out that the huge flow of Japanese investment, on which it came to depend, is not a given.
"What you saw in previous years was in some senses not a normal situation," said Hirohiko Okumura, a former Bank of Japan official and now chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "It is not well-appreciated on Wall Street or in Washington, but the character of Japanese money is changing. It is not automatic that that money will flow to the United States anymore. Japanese investors are getting more sophisticated, and more cautious."
The huge shift by no means suggests Japan is getting poorer or losing its ability to influence the global financial markets. Indeed, Japan remains the world's largest creditor nation.
What is in some ways puzzling about the trend is that Japan's trade surpluses, which helped fuel the original investment boom, are swelling to record levels after narrowing briefly in the late 1980's. Last year Japan's trade surplus with the world reached $103 billion, and it is expected to grow this year. Forty percent of the surplus comes in trade with the United States.
But Japan is now marshaling its money for use at home, as it nurses a creaky financial system, awakens to the sobering reality that many overseas investments were ill-advised and tries to revive a slowing economy with heavy Government spending. The Government announced Thursday that the economy actually shrank slightly in the fourth quarter of 1991.
 
Economy Slows Sharply
 "The first priority should be to provide money to Japanese borrowers, even though loan demand in Japan has not been very strong," said Yoshihiko Miyabe, deputy general manager of the international planning department of the Yasuda Trust and Banking Corporation. "No bank can increase its exposure overseas now."
The poor planning behind many investments is another factor. For example, a Japanese investor recently suffered what is believed to be a $340 million loss after owning the famous Pebble Beach golf club for just 18 months. Many wealthy Japanese have lost so much money at home as stock market lost nearly half its value in the last two years that they have no means or appetite for investments overseas.
Billions were also lost through the purchase of foreign stocks and bonds because of sharp swings in the value of the yen against other currencies. Many big Japanese investors were relatively new to international investment and failed to protect themselves by hedging their investments.
 
Insurers' Heavy Loss
 The clearest sign of this came after 1985, when Japan and the United States agreed to halve the value of the dollar against the yen in an attempt to reduce the American trade deficit. A weaker dollar makes it less expensive for foreigners to buy American goods. Japan's life insurers reported losing from 1985 through 1987, in yen terms, the equivalent of about $30 billion in the value of their American securities holdings, because of the decline in the dollar's value.
"Life insurance companies normally do not like taking risks," Josei Ito, president of the Nippon Life Insurance Company, the world's largest insurer, was quoted as saying in an interview earlier this year. "It was unusual that they were investing so much of their capital overseas."
And Mr. Miyabe of Yasuda Trust added: "We have to be much more careful about foreign exchange risk than we were. That is the biggest reason we are not going to increase our allocation for United States securities in the near future."
Other big Japanese financial institutions are following that strategy.
From 1988 to the end of 1990, Japanese investors put about $52 billion into the United States, snapping up everything from tire makers and real estate to new factories. In the first nine months of last year, that figure plummeted to $2.3 billion. The Japanese made a net investment of $30.7 billion in United States Government securities in 1988, the peak year; they are now net sellers of government securities.
The ailing Japanese stock market is clearly reflecting and contributing to the new approach, economists say. Last week the stock market was flirting with a five-year low.
 
'A Winding Down'
 Because Japanese banks have a major portion of their basic capital -- the safety cushion they have against bad debts -- invested in stocks, they have been hit particularly hard.
"You're seeing a winding down of the positions that the Japanese banks established abroad," said Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia. "It's happening at a rapid pace."
Mr. Okumura of Nomura Research said the shift in the flow of money is also a sign that Japanese investors have moved into the second phase of their international financial expansion. Japanese banks, insurance companies and brokerage houses at first merely wanted to build up substantial portfolios, Mr. Okumura said, no matter what the exchange rates were. Now, he said, they are managing and shifting those assets, rather than increasing them sharply.
If exchange rates are unattractive, as he contends they are now, the institutions will keep their money in Japan.
"America automatically expected Japan to recycle its surpluses to the United States," Mr. Okumura said. "But that is not going to happen, at least at these exchange rates."

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Once the votes are in, political consultants and journalists know exactly what it took to win a campaign. They can often explain it all using one or two television images: a brilliantly uplifting or nasty commercial, a blunder in a debate, a humiliating shot on the evening news, a sound bite like "Where's the beef?".
But this year's Democratic campaign looks inconveniently complicated even in hindsight. If there was one dominant image on television, it was the calm smiling face of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, but you couldn't really call that a defining moment because it lasted more than two months, through moment after moment that would have defined other politicians as ex-candidates. 
 Mr. Clinton persevered with a fairly consistent and straightforward message in debates, sound bites, and commercials. It was a carefully calculated strategy, right down to the timing of his television appearances on election nights, but he avoided obvious gimmicks like the "pander bear" that former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts held up at a press conference or the protectionist commercial that had Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska in front of a hockey net.
 
Serenity at Work
 And Mr. Clinton had the serenity to make the message work on television, whether he was speaking directly to the camera in his commercials or fending off reporters asking about the latest scandal. Sometimes he looked too smug -- his self-satisfied look didn't seem entirely appropriate during his confession of marital failings on CBS's "60 Minutes" -- but at least he didn't look terrified or defensive.
He repeatedly put on performances like the one at the airport tarmac in Houston just before the Texas primary after an article appeared in The New York Times about a real-estate partnership involving him and the owner of a savings and loan in Arkansas. Local newscasts featured live reports from the airport describing the article as yet another blow to Mr. Clinton.
But Mr. Clinton looked unscathed as he walked through the reporters shouting questions about the article. "It's not right," he said, smiling and shaking his head. He promised to issue a rebuttal promptly, but there was nothing combative in his tone or his face. It was a kind, helpful look that seemed to say: Don't worry, they got it all wrong, but I'm sure they meant well. Everybody makes mistakes, and we'll get it straightened out in no time.
 
A Reagan Approach
 Mr. Clinton occasionally turned defensive, such as when he tried to blame his problems on a Republican conspiracy, but he generally avoided the Nixon approach to the press. His was more like the contented, unflappable style of Ronald Reagan, and to some viewers he seemed to be too much of an actor.
Mr. Clinton's fondness for statistics and think-tank jargon helped allay suspicions that he was too smooth. Maybe he seemed like a game-show host, but at least it was an intelligent game show. His approach also suited the mood of this year's voters, according to academic researchers who have been conducting focus groups around the country.
"People are looking for issues and serious messages," said Marion Just, a political scientist directing a project at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. "In our focus groups the people got bored very quickly with clips from the evening news about who was ahead in the horse race or who staged what event that day. But when we showed them the campaign ads, they got interested because the ads offered focused information about the candidates' positions."
Mr. Clinton's commercials featured biographical information about him, shots of him talking about his proposals, and text on the screen offering specific critiques of his rivals' proposals. He combined his economic proposals aimed at the middle-class with promises to help the poor, and Dr. Montague Kern, another political scientist, found that the combination worked well.
 
Effective Commercials
 "The men in our focus groups tended to respond to the economic proposals and to his promise of welfare reform," she said, "while the women responded more to promises of providing better health care and education. His ad showing him with a family that couldn't get health insurance was very effective. When you combine the message he got across with the good political organization he built, you've got a powerful force."
Mr. Clinton also seemed to benefit from the unprecedented number of nationally televised debates this campaign season. ABC, NBC, PBS and CNN each carried one, and there were a half dozen others on local television and the C-Span public-affairs cable channel.
It is difficult to gauge the impact of debates during the primaries. Although this year's attracted millions of viewers -- the one on ABC got a larger audience than the "Tonight Show" during that time slot -- these viewers tend to be political junkies who already have opinions about the candidates.
But then, these political junkies also tend to have a disproportionate influence on primary elections, particularly when the turnout is as low as it was this year, and they apparently liked Mr. Clinton's polite, articulate style in the debates. According to exit polls in New Hampshire, Colorado, Illinois and Michigan, voters who listed the candidates' performance in the debates as a major factor in their decision were more likely than other voters to favor Mr. Clinton.
What seems to have distinguished Mr. Clinton most was his steady performance through all the debates and all the campaign.
"This campaign wasn't won by a dramatic moment on the airwaves," said Leslie Dach, the communications director for the 1988 Dukakis campaign. "Inside the Beltway the most talked-about ad was the one that didn't work, the one with Bob Kerrey in front of a hockey net. What mattered was that Bill Clinton stuck to his guns and his message about the economy. He wasn't fazed, even in adversity, and he did everything with a smile."

HEADLINE: New York Tourism Supported

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Tourism will continue to be a growth industry for New York City through the end of the decade, a yearlong study commissioned by the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau says. But it adds that growth could be stifled by high taxes as well as by public and private indifference.
The 62-page study, titled "New York Tourism 2000" and released yesterday, was prepared by Hunt & Hunt, an international tourism industry consulting organization, under guidelines developed by 21 New York tourism and community leaders. 
 New York's 25 million tourists in 1990, including 5.6 million foreign visitors, generated more than 124,000 jobs, or about 3.5 percent of the city's total employment. "Without these visitor-supported jobs," the study says, "New York City's 1990 unemployment rate of 6.8 percent would have stood at approximately 10.1 percent." It said tourist spending should reach $16.5 billion in the year 2000, 71 percent higher than in 1990, and generate $825 million in city taxes and $660 million for the state.
But because tourism is discretionary, the study warns, New York could suffer from the perception that it is expensive and dangerous. In fact, the city ranked 30th in the F.B.I.'s total crime index in 1990, it said, and its visitors bureau should do more to correct the false impression. And New York's reputation as expensive would be reduced if New York State repealed its recent 5 percent occupancy tax on rooms costing $100 or more. Pointing out that the tax falls most heavily New York City hotels, the study calls it punitive and counterproductive.
 
Marketing Neighborhoods
 The report also recommends establishing an official tourism policy at both the state and city levels, and encouraging the development and marketing of neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. Last Wednesday, the city announced a $250,000 program of matching grants to enable community groups in each borough to promote tourism in their neighborhoods.
The study also recommended that the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center explore ways to accommodate additional conventions and trade shows, which draw a high percentage of overnight visitors, rather than hold so high a percentage of public shows, which attract local visitors who use fewer hotel rooms and spend less money.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: Coaches Howard and Foote Offer Advice With a Capital Hey!;
For the Yanks, A Hitting Tutor Who's a Jolly Good Bellow

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
The voice bellows from everywhere: from the coaches' room in the clubhouse every morning, from the back field beyond the left-field fence at Fort Lauderdale Stadium, from the covered batting cages near the grandstand. It's always there.
Frank Howard, the Yankees' ubiquitous hitting coach, is the first to arrive and the last to leave each day at spring training. He will hit fungoes until it is too dark to see the ball. He will offer advice and counsel to every last hitter in camp, from Andy Stankiewicz to Kevin Maas. He will never stop moving, consoling, teaching. 
 "Hondo gets instant respect and earned respect," Buck Showalter, the rookie Yankee manager, said not long ago. "He has a high level of intensity, great work habits, loyalty and a big heart. I've never seen a man stay focused for nine innings like he does."
Howard, known throughout the clubhouse as Hondo, seems focused every waking moment. There is no wasted time, no unnecessary talk, no uncertainty about what is happening -- only the basso-profundo voice directing things.
"We call it Camp Hondo," outfielder Bernie Williams said of Howard's back-field workouts, far from the view of spring-training fans. "It's hectic, but it's enjoyable."
The 54-year-old Howard is beginning his 34th year in baseball. Half of that time, he has been a coach. As a player, he hit 382 homers, playing most of his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Washington Senators. As a coach, he is known as much for his enthusiasm as his work ethic.
Some young players, given the option of making a three-hour bus ride for an exhibition game or staying behind to work out with Howard, prefer the bumpy trip.
"I treat them all the same," Howard said of the players in camp. "My philosophy -- and they know it -- is that I understand if they make a mistake because I probably made the same one. If they give us a good effort and are dedicated, we've got to do everything we can to help them. If they don't, then we've got to make them aware that there are 20 million kids who want to play major league baseball, but only 600 of them do."
Howard's primary theories about the game come from the old school, but he also concedes that modern technology has made the game better. His only complaint: too much practice, not enough games.
"Sometimes," he said, "we get into a category of what I call practice players. Today's kids work longer, have better instruction, better training facilities and equipment than we ever had the luxury of having. What they don't have is the chance to play enough ball games so they can learn how to handle pressurized situations.
"I've felt that all my life. I believe in instruction, but if it were up to me, I'd have a kid playing a doubleheader every day."
 
A Man of Imposing Size
 There is also this about Howard that commands respect: his size. He is 6 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 300 pounds, but he calls himself "a pussycat."
"People say, 'You're such an intimidating force because of your size,' but it doesn't even enter my mind," he said. "Intimidation is just a word. I call it being a big leaguer. It's more than ability; it's a state of mind."
In his time, there has been a scuffle here and there. As a Met coach, Howard once lifted Craig Swan by his lapels after the pitcher berated Manager George Bamberger on a charter flight. "You shouldn't be talking that way to the skipper," Howard gently scolded Swan, whose feet dangled above the ground.
"I've seen Hondo mad maybe twice," Showalter said. "It's scary."
Showalter also remembers coming to the clubhouse early one day last season thinking the place was empty. It wasn't. Soon enough, he heard the clanging of weights nearby. He peeked around a corner, saw Howard seated, half-clothed and covered with perspiration, pumping a pair of dumbbells.
"He was saying: 'C'mon, Hondo, be the best you can be. Work harder, harder. Be the best coach you can be,' " Showalter recalled. "I just sat there for a half hour, listening and watching him."
And loyal: When Dallas Green was dismissed as manager in 1989, Howard, the hitting coach, was offered a chance to become the manager at Class AAA Columbus by George Steinbrenner. Howard refused, even though the decision left him unemployed. "I came to the dance with the man," he said of Green, "I'm going to leave with him."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 ANDY STANKIEWICZ hit a grand slam homer in the eighth inning to lift the Yankees to a 13-10 victory Saturday over Minnesota in a split-squad game at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami. The 27-year-old Stankiewicz has never played in the majors. Starter ED MARTEL tossed four impressive innings, but is a long shot to make the rotation. DON MATTINGLY took an airplane flight from Miami to Tampa after the game, avoiding a four-hour bus trip.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Making the Islanders Their Business

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
The four investors about to take control of the Islanders do not have extensive backgrounds in professional hockey management, but all have learned about the sport in peripheral ways.
If their partial purchase of the troubled franchise is approved, as expected, this week, they will attempt to turn around a sports business that has plunged in less than a decade from one of the most successful in the sport to one of the worst managed in the front office and least effective on the ice. 
 All four executives-in-waiting say they are aware of what is wrong and are eager to begin the process of change.
Although novices in the hockey business, they are successful in the world of finance, well-grounded on Long Island and at least acquainted with the world's fastest team sport and how it is presented at Nassau Coliseum.
Here are quick introductions:
*Robert Rosenthal, who will become one of two co-chairmen, lived in a Westbury apartment building with several members of the expansion Islanders in the early 1970's. Back then, he sat in season-ticket seats behind the penalty box and occasionally debated the rules with Philadelphia's Dave Schultz, the biggest and baddest of the Broad Street Bullies. "I have never been known for not being vocal," Rosenthal said in a recent interview. "That's why they made the glass higher behind the penalty box. To protect me."
*Jerome Grossman, who will become the new team president, learned the sport at the amateur level by driving his child to practices and games at all hours of the day and night. His offspring still plays occasionally: She is a defensewoman.
*Stephen Walsh, set to become the other co-chairman, is the son of a Ranger fan and is a former ticket buyer at the Coliseum who perceives things through the eyes, and ears, of a customer. He wants to change plenty of things, starting with the organ music, which, he said, has always "bugged" him. "It sounds like I'm at a roller-skating rink," he said. "I want it different, more upbeat. More fun. I don't want to listen to 1940 organ music, plain and simple."
*Ralph Palleschi, who will become the executive vice president, is learning the business from the ground floor, literally. Last weekend, when he and his partners posed for photographs in front of one goal at the Coliseum, Palleschi was impressed by the size of the playing surface from that perspective. "I never realized how long the ice was," he said.
All four should learn plenty of things in the very near future. Although they are believed to be buying only 10 percent of the team from John O. Pickett Jr., they have options to buy up to 50 percent. Most important, all parties say, they will have full control to operate a franchise that needs direction and focus.
A decade ago, in the era from 1980 through 1983, the Islanders won the Stanley Cup in four consecutive seasons and sold virtually every ticket for every game. They were considered a model franchise for a league on the rise. And the Long Island economy was booming.
This season, if they don't make the playoffs, they will have missed post-season play in three of the last four springs, the time of year when most franchises make their biggest profits. Their attendance average is less than 10,000 a game, the lowest in the league. Their planned new practice headquarters remains only partially built and stalled by financial problems.
The team's radio network barely covers parts of recession-plagued Long Island and is impossible to hear in some sections of the primary market. Star players like Bryan Trottier, Pat LaFontaine and Brent Sutter have left the roster under less than happy circumstances. Around the troubled league, people ask, "What's wrong with that franchise?"
"We view the Islanders as an under-utilized, under-managed business franchise, brand name, whatever you want to call it, with a great recognition factor and a great market," Walsh said. "We know we have a good opportunity here. All business goes through cycles. The Long Island economy is going to come back. Maybe the resurgence of the Islanders will be coincidental with the resurgence of Long Island."
Certainly the new bosses know plenty about economics. Rosenthal and Palleschi are former executives with Entenmann's, the bakery, and now operate First Long Island Investors. Walsh and Grossman have Wall Street backgrounds and currently play major roles with Walsh, Greenwood & Company, an investment firm.
The four came together last summer after Walsh and Rosenthal played golf at a country club and began talking, as businessmen will, about deals. All four live on Long Island and are involved in many charities and civic institutions. They say their stewardship will be a contrast to that of Pickett, who lives in Florida and is rarely seen or heard from.
"We are very much aware of the past reputation of the ownership being inaccessible," Rosenthal said. "We are four Long Island business people and four Long Island fans rolled into one. We are going to be energetic, enthusiastic and we recognize there is a big challenge for us to conquer."
As president, Grossman will work out of Nassau Coliseum and handle the day-to-day operations of the club. Palleschi will handle the financial affairs. Walsh and Rosenthal will concentrate on the involvement of fans and businesses from the Island community, a far-flung and diverse collection of quaint villages and modern subdivisions and farms and mansions and shopping malls and often-clogged traffic arteries. The executives plan to meet at least once a week.
"The Long Island community is a difficult community to put your arms around because of the geography of Long Island," Rosenthal said. "We embrace Long Island, and Long Island embraces the Islanders."
Bill Torrey, currently the chairman of the board and general manager, has been asked to remain as general manager, but hasn't given the new group his response. Because the general manager will name the coach, this leaves the future of Coach Al Arbour in question.
In interviews last week, the new executives all said they approve of Torrey's trade-based overhaul of the roster this season and they said they have faith in both Torrey and Arbour.
The details of their financial deal with Pickett are also somewhat murky. Neither Pickett nor his new partners would name the percentage of the team being sold or the amount of money changing hands. The N.H.L.'s president, John Ziegler, through a spokesman, Gary Meagher, said last week that the piece is 10 percent. In that most hockey franchises are valued between $50 million and $100 million, a 10 percent share of the Islanders should be worth between $5 million and $10 million.
In addition to the four executives, there are an unspecified number of other investors but they have no control of team operations.
Pickett, in a telephone interview from his home in Florida last week, said that "the new group has the right to buy up to 50 percent any time they want -- it's their timetable." Can the new partners go beyond 50 percent? Do they have first option to buy Pickett's remaining percentage if another buyer approaches him?
"We have a right to buy from him before he can sell to anyone else," Grossman said.
But doesn't Pickett, the majority owner, have final approval over the operating budget?
"There are certain things they would probably want to discuss with me," Pickett said, "but I want to stress that I can't think of a single thing I wouldn't want them to have free will in. If you don't do that, you might as well be there running it yourself."
 
Getting Started
 Islander executives of the future were in Chicago on Friday for what they hoped would be approval of the Board of Governors.
Because the players union set a March 30 strike deadline on Friday morning, the collective-bargaining crisis dominated discussion and partial transfer of Islander ownership was tabled until this week, Ziegler said, adding that the board liked the Islander proposal and that the delay in no way signaled disapproval.
In some ways, the new group is already behaving as if it is in control. Current employees are acting on "suggestions" from the new executives involving ticket prices for playoffs and promotions for later this month. The new executives say they will freeze most ticket prices, lower some others and consider plans for remodeling the Coliseum or for building a new arena.
Grossman has traveled with the team to road games on its chartered airplane and up the Coliseum stairs to interview fans in the back rows. He's been asking for their suggestions. They've been giving him an earful.

Wall or Ceiling Projects Not for Inexperienced

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
INEXPERIENCE can be a harsh teacher, as when a seemingly straightforward project like remodeling a wall or ceiling by attaching paneling or new wallboard goes awry because of uneven surfaces underneath.
Unless the surfaces for new wall and ceiling materials are flat and smooth, and either plumb in the case of walls or level in the case of most ceilings, panels will not fit squarely, nor will they mask the bumps and hollows they are intended to conceal. 
 The solution is to install a grid of narrow wood strips called furring strips against the existing surface before attaching the new material. During construction, wood wedges called shims are placed behind parts of the grid to create a fastening surface.
To determine the need for furring strips, assess the surface. Check first for flatness by stretching a string across the surface between diagonal corners and between the sides and ends at several places.
Hold or attach identical small blocks of wood beneath the ends of the string to keep them away from the surface by a uniform amount. Note the distance between the surface and the string in each position.
If the distance varies less than a quarter-inch along the string's length, consider the surface flat. If further tests reveal no other flaws, furring strips are probably unnecessary, except to provide a fastening surface.
Check walls to see whether they are plumb. Hold a carpenter's square against the corners -- the square should fit if the corners form right angles -- and use a plumb bob to determine whether the walls are vertical. Hang the bob from the ceiling to the floor from a point about an inch from one wall. Measure between the string and the wall at the ceiling and floor. If the measurements are the same, that section of the wall is vertical. Perform the process also in the middle of the wall and near the other end.
Check ceilings to see whether they are level. That can be done at the same time that they are checked for flatness by attaching a line level, a small vial containing a bubble, to the string. If the ceiling is level, the bubble will be centered in the vial during all measurements.
Be practical when evaluating both tests. Generally, installing furring strips over a flat surface is worth the effort only when surfaces are out of alignment by more than three-eighths of an inch.
Furring strips for frame walls and ceilings usually consist of 1 x 3-inch lumber. Economy grade is usually adequate, provided the boards are not warped.
On walls, the principal or longest strips of a grid are customarily fastened to lie perpendicular to the long edges of the paneling or wallboard sheets they will support. The strips are spaced so that their centerlines are 16 inches apart, and extra strips are added, if necessary, to lie beneath the sheets' long edges. With standard sheets, which are four feet wide, extra strips should not be needed.
On ceilings, the principal strips are perpendicular to the joists at intervals of 12 inches between the strips' centerlines. If plumbing or wiring is attached underneath joists, a double layer of strips can be installed. That will lower the finished ceiling a few inches.
That is done by attaching the strips of the first layer to the joists, but spaced so that the centerlines are 24 to 32 inches apart. Then the strips of the second layer are attached across the first group, parallel to the joists, at intervals of 12 inches between centerlines.
With all arrangements, the grid is completed by attaching short strips perpendicular to the principals to support the sheets' remaining edges. Short strips can also be added elsewhere for additional support.
Start installing furring strips by attaching a principal strip across one end of the surface. Use pairs of drywall screws at least two inches long to anchor the strip temporarily to the studs or joists behind it. Leave room between the screws in each pair so that their heads will not interfere with the fasteners to be driven into the middle of the strips to secure the new wall or ceiling material.
Use a long level or a straight-edged board to make sure that the strip is flat. Loosen screws to straighten the strip wherever necessary, and insert shims to fill all gaps between the strip and the surface at stud or joist locations.
For shims, use pairs of wedge-shaped cedar-shingle scraps. To install a shim, slide a pair of shingles toward each other from opposite sides of the strip so that their tips overlap between the strip and the surface.
Install and shim another strip the same way across the opposite end of the surface, and a third one near the middle. Determine the exact location according to the centerline spacings for all the strips. Repeat the tests for flatness, plumb and level, and adjust all three strips until the surface they form is acceptable.
Finish fastening the strips and use them as guides for adding the remaining strips, the principal ones first and then short strips. Be sure to fasten strips around the perimeters of windows and doorways.
When installing a double layer of furring, use just principal strips for the first layer. Install the short strips and extras with the second layer.
For furring masonry, 2 x 2-inch strips and masonry nails are recommended. Cover the surface first with a vapor barrier of plastic sheeting or liquid and then mount the strips. But adjust and test their alignment before driving fasteners completely home.

HEADLINE: End Kashmir's Misery

 BODY:
When imperial Britain agreed to partition India and Pakistan, some 562 princely rulers had to decide which country to join. The Maharajah of Kashmir, a Hindu, couldn't make up his mind. As he hesitated, his predominantly Muslim subjects rebelled in favor of Pakistan and their cause was taken up by invading Muslim irregulars.
This marked the beginning of a bitter conflict that has bred wars between Pakistan and India, and brought misery to the people of Kashmir. In a transformed world, both countries would benefit from a solution, preferably under U.N. auspices. Washington could help by discreetly nudging two proud countries toward settlement. 
 India's claim to Kashmir stems from its military rescue of the Maharajah, who then agreed to Kashmir's accession to India. Lord Mountbatten, India's Governor General, said that when order was restored, Britain hoped that a plebiscite would determine Kashmir's future.
In 1948 India promised a vote, but never delivered. Three wars and innumerable skirmishes have been fought over Kashmir, whose western third has come under Pakistani control while the rest of the old princely realm forms Jammu and Kashmir, India's only state with a Muslim majority. Periodically, Kashmir erupts into violence.
Islamabad and New Delhi accuse each other of fomenting terrorism, abusing human rights and flouting world law. As the dispute sputters on, Kashmiris endure mass arrests, diminished citizenship and economic collapse. Srinagar and the Vale of Kashmir, once magnets for tourism, have become forlorn zones of strife.
India insists that a solution lies in direct talks with Pakistan, without U.N. involvement. It no longer holds to its old promise to let Kashmiris decide their own future in a plebiscite. That's no longer necessary, New Delhi argues, because Kashmiris can vote in local elections and because a defeated Pakistan signed a 1972 accord in Simla committing the two countries to a bilateral settlement.
For its part, Pakistan wants a settlement based on U.N. declarations calling for a plebiscite. But it would not be a true plebiscite. Pakistan would limit Kashmiris to choosing between it and India. This ignores a surge of support for independence. If Pakistan is serious about self-determination, then six million Kashmiris deserve that choice, too. And if India is serious about seeking a permanent seat on the Security Council, why scorn the U.N. in its own region?
In a changing world, the Kashmir dispute belongs higher on the agenda. The old security concerns that drove India toward Moscow, and Pakistan toward Washington and Beijing, have lost their intensity. India, as the paramount power in the subcontinent, would enhance its stature by moving to a U.N. settlement.

HEADLINE: Where Was the Crime in House Bank Affair?;
Too Many Privileges

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The so-called bank scandal involving overdrafts by members of the House of Representatives would not be significant if it did not taunt us with the reminder of the much wider problem of elected officials who horde privileges for themselves that they deny the average citizen, whose interest they claim to represent. 
 Free short-term loans from the House bank pale beside the costs and insult of their first-class travel, personal use of Congressional staffs, entertainment excesses and gifts from powerful influentials who seek favor.
But what galls many of us most is that members of Congress, along with the President and ranking figures in his Administration, all reserve one of the most enviable and expensive perquisites conceivable. These Government elites enjoy superb, cost-free, health care from one of the finest systems of socialized medicine in the world, while fiercely opposing it for massive numbers of Americans who face a frightening health care crisis.
This cornucopia of privileges for top Government officials increasingly insulates them from the realities of American life and is fast disqualifying them from representing us. We implore Congress -- and the President -- to join the rest of us in the personal sacrifice needed during this recession. For the poor and newly unemployed this is more accurately a depression.

HEADLINE: Is the Recession Over?

 BODY:
Retail sales are up. Industrial production is up. So are housing starts, non-farm employment, exports and business confidence. Even department store sales in the New York area are finally turning around.
At the same time, inflation, interest rates, new jobless claims and personal debt are all, gratifyingly, down. 
 Is the recession over? Finally, after 19 months, the answer appears to be yes.
But before anyone gets too excited, a dose of reality. The difference between recession and recovery may be little more than a statistical technicality. The economy may not be falling, but neither is it rising very quickly.
The outlook is for more of the same: slow, perhaps even glacial, improvement. Unemployment may continue to rise for three to six months, perhaps longer. And there is always the possibility that the recovery will abort.
Still, moving up beats moving down. There is light, if only dim, at the end of the economic tunnel.
The U.S. economy has been wallowing in recession for more than a year and a half and stagnating for about three years. Output hasn't fallen very much -- the drop has been only half the size of recent recessions. But it has sent more than a million Americans onto the jobless rolls.
Only last fall did the Federal Reserve Board turn from mouse to tiger -- pushing down interest rates in order to jump-start the economy. In February the Fed followed with a cut in reserve requirements, which freed banks to lend more money.
Last spring, the economy also ticked up, only to turn back down again during the summer. There's no guarantee that a 1992 recovery won't also abort. But that's unlikely because the Fed's new policy should keep sectors that depend on low-interest loans -- residential housing, consumer durables and corporate investment -- healthy. Another optimistic sign: Inventories are low, so as retail sales pick up, stores will have to send orders to factories to speed up production.
Not everything is rosy. Robert Gordon, an economics professor at Northwestern University and a member of the committee that determines the stop and start dates of recessions for the National Bureau of Economic Research, says one-third of the economy will continue to stagnate. Commercial real estate is dead; until vacant office space is filled, there won't be new construction. And the defense industry is headed down, fast. Even exports -- which have been the main source of new jobs during the last few years -- will probably slow because the Japanese and German economies are running into trouble.
Mr. Gordon predicts that output will grow by 2 or 3 percent a year. That is about half the rate of a normal recovery and barely enough to keep unemployment steady. Indeed, Mr. Gordon expects unemployment to hover around 7 percent, then fall by the middle of next year to around 6.5 percent -- more than one percentage point above the rate that prevailed before the recession.
The best guess is that unemployment will stay steady or edge a bit higher because companies are unlikely to make permanent hires until they're convinced recovery is for real. When might that be? Perhaps early fall. Just in time to affect the November elections, one way or the other.

HEADLINE: Do Teachers Lead The Greediest?

 BODY:
Each year, newspapers run a section on the "neediest" people in the community. I propose an additional list of the "greediest" people. Until recently that dubious honor would have gone to the top political people in the Nassau government. But now they have accepted 5 percent cuts in salary (it should have been at least 10 percent, but let's be thankful for small favors), and the teachers and administrators in our school districts are winning the title of "greediest" hands down.
We have been hit with a severe recession. Woolworth's, Grumman, Newmark & Lewis, General Motors, Pan-Am, Macy's, etc., have been closing shop or reducing operations and firing people left and right. Many local stores on Long Island, unable to keep up with the unending tax increases and reduced sales, have gone out of business and lie empty. 
 But the teachers and administrators, who have constantly demanded and gotten annual raises of two and a half times the increases in living costs, laugh at the unfortunates and insist they will accept no cuts in salaries and benefits, no freezes, only more and more increases. It has been shown that school districts on Long Island have half the number of pupils they used to have, yet spend twice as much and keep the same number of administrators and the same inefficient number of small districts.
Public-school teachers who have reached the 15th step now get approximately $77,000 a year in salary and benefits. They enjoy short workdays, are on the job only nine and a half months a year and thus earn $2,160 for every week they work. Many end up with more than $77,000 and also receive handsome extra fees from students from their building whom they tutor after school.
It was therefore, unconscionable of John F. DeGregorio, regional director of the New York State United Teachers' Union, to state that teachers have the right to keep seeking large increases because "they are not going to take the position of subsidizing the place they work." ["School Boards Face Hostility as Teachers Seek Raises" Feb. 2.] Mr. DeGregorio is standing truth on its head.
It is the hard-pressed taxpayers who have been subsidizing well-heeled teachers. Furthermore, when he says that the "possibility of strikes always exists," he neglects to mention that in return for receiving all kinds of special privileges, the teachers' unions accepted the state law making strikes by them illegal. They flout the law by frequently threatening to strike, thereby cowing P.T.A. people to support them, lest they take it out on their children.

HEADLINE: Garbage Could Raise Taxes 40 Percent

 BODY:
"Soaring Garbage Fees Plague Town Officials" [March 1] accurately reflects the dilemma of towns' attempting to satisfy New York State mandates that balloon local taxes.
New York State law essentially says that towns must dispose of garbage in one or more high-tech ways or ship it out of state. The usual high-tech solution is incineration, with the residual ash going to a double-plastic-lined landfill. As your article points out, that costs about $500 per household each year. Shipping garbage across the United States is no solution. It is expensive, environmentally irresponsible and will not be tolerated for long by the importing states. 
 Imagine what a $500-per-household tax increase will do to a small rural town like Southold. The town tax bill will increase by 40 percent. Could Southold make some wise choices and do it more cheaply? Not likely, with a small dispersed population, no economies of scale and remote distance to garbage plants elsewhere on the island. Everyone acknowledges that Long Island taxes are already among the highest in the nation and driving out large numbers of our residents. Certainly they are a major deterrent to the relocation of new businesses and residents to our towns.
And what will we get for this record 40 percent tax increase? In the case of Southold, there is no benefit at all. The town recently completed a detailed D.E.C.-authorized study of the ground-water leaching from our open landfill and found no significant contamination. Why require a municipality to spend $500 per household per year in the name of environmental protection when there is no significant environmental benefit?

HEADLINE: Getting to Work: Other Views

 BODY:
"Getting to Work Will Never Be the Same" does not note a critical additional option open to many employers, and even to some of their employees. Leave.
Environmental pollution most assuredly is a critical issue. But those planning to solve the problem must take into account this opt-out option. 
 Furthermore, as we proceed in the name of free trade to open our markets to goods and services from all countries, regardless of their environmental practices, we inevitably encourage the opt-out option of importing rather than producing domestically. Importing is not confined to manufactured goods, but is spreading now to services as well.
Data can be manipulated as easily in, and transmitted from, far-off places as here at home. No commuting subsidies are required for workers in Mexico, India, Ireland or the Caribbean. Companies forced to deal with this here may well find this a significant addition to their cost of production calculations, especially when measured against their offshore competitors.
One hopes that those planning our noncommuting future recognize that unemployment also has a quality-of-life cost. Telecommuting sounds good when the commuters are local people working at home. How good will it sound to New Jersey when the commuters are offshore and pay no taxes?

HEADLINE: A $78 Million Year: Steve Ross Defends His Paycheck

BYLINE: BY ROGER COHEN; Roger Cohen is the European economic correspondent of The New York Times, based in Paris.

 BODY:
Steve Ross looks like a humbled man. Slumped in a leather chair, the chairman and co-chief executive officer of Time Warner, the world's largest media and entertainment company, winces as he reaches for a glass of water. His smile is wan, his jowls sag, his once athletic frame appears bloated. "It's been a rough couple of years," he says in a voice that sometimes descends to a Brandoesque murmur. "I've been hurt tremendously."
The physical pain Ross feels is concentrated, excruciatingly, in his back. Every movement is cumbersome; rising to his feet an intricate maneuver. Although his office, with its paintings by Mark Rothko and Arshile Gorky, suggests a life of sumptuous ease, Ross's appearance amounts to eloquent testimony that money is not everything. 
 In fact, although he is not yet aware of this, his backache is caused in part by cancer. A prostate tumor has been pressing on his spine. Indeed, this rare interview last November in his 29th-floor office overlooking Rockefeller Plaza will be his last before doctors order him to undergo chemotherapy and confine him to his homes on Park Avenue and in East Hampton, L.I.
From Ross's words, it is clear his physical distress, while severe, is only part of a deeper pain. At the age of 64, a time when most self-made millionaires are looking back in satisfaction at their achievements, Ross -- or Steve, as he prefers to be known -- seems far from a man at peace. "I've never known him so upset and frustrated," says an old friend, Gershon Kekst, who owns a public relations company. "The cancer and chemotherapy are nothing compared to the way he feels about the abuse he's suffering."
For Ross, once the debonair darling of Wall Street and Hollywood, the trouble began more than two years ago, after he agreed to let Time Inc. pay $14 billion for Warner Communications, the company he had built over three decades from a Manhattan funeral-parlor-cum-rent-a-car business into a global entertainment conglomerate. The last big deal of the 80's, the Time Warner merger was supposed to be the career capper for Ross, a man who grew up in a poor Jewish family in Brooklyn. The deal placed him at the head of a $12 billion company, with assets ranging from Time magazine to Batman. Ross, it appeared, was going to be the king of the Brave New World of global communications.
But instead of crowning his life's work, the merger proved a morass. It saddled Ross with myriad new problems -- not the least of which was how to deal with the $11.4 billion of debt incurred by Time to complete the transaction. More personally, it burdened him with a co-chief executive, N. J. (Nick) Nicholas Jr. of Time, whom Ross did not particularly like from the outset and later grew to distrust. Only after two trying years -- and with the threat of his death from cancer hanging over the company -- was Ross able to engineer an extraordinary boardroom shake-up last month, ousting the secretive, bean-counting Nicholas and replacing him with Gerald M. Levin, a more accessible and extroverted executive who had been Time Warner's vice chairman.
"With Steve's cancer, we all felt, my God, what if we're left with Nicholas?" says one Time Warner executive who's worked under Ross for a decade. "In two years here, I'd seen Nicholas for 20 minutes. None of us knew what he was doing."
Yet Ross's problems went far beyond Nick Nicholas. While the Time Warner deal was conceived in the gung-ho 80's, it was born at a moment when debt and greed were going out of fashion. As the deal drew increasing criticism, Ross, already one of the most famous chief executives in the country, found himself on the hot seat. He was vilified not only as America's leading symbol of lavish executive compensation and exploited shareholders, but also as the man who had demeaned an American institution, Henry R. Luce's Time Inc. Steve Ross joined Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky in the pantheon of avarice.
"I don't blame Ross as much as the Time board," says Andrew Heiskell, the company's former chairman. "But if I do blame him, it's for epitomizing the 80's disease that said money, money, money is the only thing that counts."
Ross seems weary. The tall, unfailingly ebullient, painstakingly coiffed corporate chieftain who steered Warner to so many years of remarkable growth is a different man. The eyes are plaintive. Some people who have spent long hours with him, and remain skeptical, warn of the "poor-Steve ploy." But as Ross awkwardly pulls his chair closer to the table in front of him, he seems sincere when he says: "When you're constantly attacked, you wanna go out and shoot yourself."
Shaking his head, he goes on: "There is malice and forethought in the inaccurate attacks on my compensation. Nobody wants to understand that the money was my reward for 30 years work at Warner. Still, given the value of these assets we've put together in Time Warner, you've just got to pay the piper."
With the $78.2 million he received in 1990 alone -- more than any other executive of a public company -- Ross can afford to pay several pipers. This sum included a one-time payment of $74.9 million for Ross's interests in Warner, but that fact tends to be glossed over. Coming shortly before 605 staff members of Time Warner's recession-hit publishing division were laid off last year, the payout made him a villain to many of his own employees. "Ross's 1990 pay was two and a half times the combined salaries of the people laid off," says Key Martin, president of the Newspaper Guild at Time Warner. "That's absurd."
"Steve's pay has become a lightning rod," says Reginald K. Brack Jr., the chairman of Time Inc. and the man who actually ordered the 605 layoffs. "It's hard to even fathom that kind of money."
The excoriation has been deeply wounding for Ross, a man far more accustomed to being hailed as a media visionary -- renowned for having bet on videos, MTV and Nickelodeon when most other corporate leaders thought cable was just a piece of thick wire.
Friends say Ross has taken the criticism especially hard because of a surprisingly strong need for affection. As one Time Warner board member puts it: "Steve wants to be loved and he's being hated." And Felix G. Rohatyn, a senior partner at Lazard Freres, the Wall Street investment bank, says: "Steve bleeds internally a lot, and takes criticism very hard while trying not to show it. But these are things that have affected his health."
Now spending most of his time at Cody House (Cody is Ross's nickname for his wife, Courtney Sale), a lovely but not extravagant home overlooking East Hampton's Georgica Pond, he has plenty of time to ponder these problems. In December, Ross's wife cut short a planned yearlong world tour with their 8-year-old daughter, Nicole, and returned home to care for him. A total of six chemotherapy sessions have been scheduled through the end of next month. "Chemo," Sale says, "is no picnic.
As Ross goes through this wrenching period of self-scrutiny, a number of questions are swirling around him and his empire. His critics say he is perhaps America's most greedy and manipulative businessman. His admirers say that, in the backlash against 80's excesses, he has been unfairly crucified for compensation due him in accordance with a basic precept of American capitalism: that the marketplace rewards merit. Which view is true?
The myth of Steve Ross's invincibility -- one of the business world's most enduring -- has taken a pummeling since the Time Warner merger in January 1990. Can Ross's ultimate deal, the creation of Time Warner -- a company that lost $326 million in the last two years and still groans under the weight of enormous debt -- be made to work over the long term? Finally, can Steve Ross, who suffered a serious heart attack in 1980, bounce back one more time?
BORN STEVEN JAY RECHNITZ IN THE WORKING-CLASS Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Steve Ross knew hardship early. Two years after Ross's birth in 1927, his father, a builder, lost his money in the Depression. Changing the family name to Ross in order to find work, his father struggled for the remaining years of his life. On his death bed, he summoned his son to offer a piece of advice: There are those who work all day; those who dream all day and never do a thing, and those who spend an hour dreaming before going to work to fulfill those dreams. "Go into the third category," his father said, "because there's virtually no competition."
This tale -- which bears the sentimental, almost schmaltzy, stamp of most Ross reminiscences -- has assumed a central place in his life story. "Dreamer" is the term Ross uses most often to describe himself, along with "visionary" and "risk taker." "If you're not a risk taker," Ross says, "you should get the hell out of business." Ross believes that the nuts-and-bolts manager, obsessed with the short term, is the bane of American business. This, in essence, was his problem with Nicholas.
Ross was street smart by an early age. At 8, he was carrying bags of groceries in exchange for a nickel. He would also borrow money from his father, walk 20 blocks to a supermarket selling cut-rate cigarettes by the carton and then resell the cigarettes to his father by the pack for a profit. "I think, subliminally, I learned a lot about expanding a business when I was very young," Ross says.
Entirely self-taught, Ross has never had much time for conventional management, and an aversion to administrative detail has persisted throughout his career. As one former employee notes, "I doubt that Ross could manage a candy store day to day."
A remarkable gift for numbers appears to have buttressed his swaggering, macro approach. Indeed, David Geffen, a former Ross protege who had a falling out with his boss in 1989 during negotiations over the value of the record business he'd built at Warner, describes talking numbers with Ross as being "about as evenly matched as playing tennis with Boris Becker."
Armed with these talents but scant higher education, Ross went to work for an uncle in Manhattan's garment district. He was penniless. But, at the age of 26, he married well. His wife -- the first of three -- was Carol Rosenthal, whose father, Edward, owned the Riverside Memorial Chapel, a successful funeral-parlor business.
According to a story that has become legendary in the business world, his wife's uncle, who provided limousines for funeral services, asked Ross to take a look at his limousine company, which was losing money. Ross went up to the Bronx and watched for a couple of days. "I saw the cars go out for the funerals at 7:30 in the morning and come back at 4 in the afternoon," Ross recalls. "And then I saw the cars sit there all night. So I called up Carey Limousine and asked: 'Suppose I could rent you limousines? Isn't your busiest time the evening, when people go to the theater?' "
An agreement was reached. The funeral limousines were rented out at night to Carey. It was the first of many deals for a man who would become widely known as a consummate deal maker. "Steve loves making deals," says Barbra Streisand, a longtime friend whose films have sometimes been produced by Warner, "whether with Time or bracelet makers in the Caribbean."
The ability to charm prospective business partners -- some say beguile and then skewer -- stayed with Ross. "He speaks softly, he's congenial," Geffen says. "But he's a killer who's happiest when taking your pants down."
Ross quickly applied his business gifts. In the late 50's, he started Abbey Rent-A-Car. Later, he added a parking-garage business called Kinney and an office-cleaning operation. The company went public in 1962. Renamed Kinney Service, this hybrid corporation, with its hodgepodge of businesses, had a market value of $12.5 million.
In this unlikely way was created the company that would become Warner Communications -- producers of Madonna, "Dirty Harry" and "J.F.K." But a look back at the way Kinney was run in 1962 offers important clues to Ross's future successes and difficulties.
Though a public corporation, Kinney was operated very much like a family company by a close-knit group of scrappy Jewish entrepreneurs. It was short on controls, long on trust and freewheeling ambition. The prevailing view, as Ross puts it, was that "errors of commission would not sink you, errors of omission might."
By 1966, Kinney had decided to expand into entertainment. A first step was the purchase in 1967 of the Ashley Famous talent agency, whose owner, Ted Ashley, was struck by one thing Ross said: "Get me in a room with somebody who wants to make a deal, and I'll find a way to make the deal."
He had the talent to do so. Ross was a brilliant head of Warner Communications Inc. -- as Kinney was renamed in 1972. Three years earlier, Ross had succeeded in buying the ailing Warner Brothers-Seven Arts studio and record business for about $400 million. After selling off the old Kinney businesses, Ross put good people in charge of his new media properties and let them run. By granting autonomy and implementing an incentive-based compensation system, he commanded loyalty in a fickle industry. Frank G. Wells, who worked as an executive at Warner in the 70's and is now president of Disney, recalls Ross giving him just one piece of advice: "Make your own mistakes and don't give me any surprises."
When movies flopped, Ross told his people not to worry: the next one would do better. He almost never interfered in the making of a film. When a huge blockbuster, like "Batman," came along, the bonuses were commensurately large. "Incentive compensation," Ross says, "is the most important thing in business."
Robert A. Daly, chairman of Warner Brothers, speaks to the point. "We'll kill for the company," he says, "because everybody is made to feel like principals, not employees." The results speak for themselves. For two decades, Warner has thrived, knowing only two management teams in all that time.
Ross loved working in what he saw as another "people industry." At funerals, he'd had to learn to deal with grief; in Hollywood, with the egos of stars.
Ross took a sugar daddy's delight in making his stars happy -- dispensing extravagant gifts and invitations to weekend trips on Warner planes to Warner villas in Acapulco or Aspen. It was all part of fostering what Warner President Terry Semel calls "the family atmosphere." With Ross seeing little of his own family (he and Carol, who had two children, were divorced in 1978), he seems to have grown increasingly commited to his extended family at Warner.
Jenette Kahn, editor in chief of Time Warner's DC Comics division, observes that "on notes from Steve, if he knows you, he will cross out 'Sincerely' or 'Best Regards' and put 'Much Love.' " Another woman who knows Ross well sees in him not only a need for affection but for something deeper -- love. She believes Ross, having struggled all his life with profound insecurities, has sought from professional relationships what he has not been able to get from personal ones. The photographs in Ross's office -- of the chairman with Dustin Hoffman and Steven Spielberg in Paris one hung-over Christmas morning, of his daughter Nicole posing with Barbra Streisand -- suggest a man whose identity is very much bound up with the friendship of the stars.
Spielberg, who describes Ross as "one of my greatest friends," is one of those who has enjoyed the use of the Acapulco villa. "Look," says Ross, "Spielberg goes down there on the company plane and wakes up in the middle of the night after a nightmare. He can't sleep, and in the morning he gets up and writes the script for 'The Goonies.' That's worth tens of millions to us."
But don't ask Ross how many corporate planes there are. "Jesus, that's a good question," he mutters. "I don't know. I think we've got seven, all over the lot."
Despite such haziness on the details, there can be little disputing that the Ross system has worked. A company worth $12.5 million in 1962 was sold to Time for $14 billion in 1990. Even Graef S. Crystal, a compensation expert who has been extremely critical of the size of Ross's pay, acknowledges that Warner has done better than 88 percent of companies over the last two decades.
It was not just Ross's way with talented people that propelled Warner. He also had a knack for seeing the growth potential in businesses long before others did. Warner bought into cable in 1971 -- when there was still much contempt for the new medium. Ross understood the possibilities of "narrow casting," of reaching target audiences through specialized programming. This was the thinking that led to the hugely successful MTV and Nickelodeon.
Robert J. Morgado, the chairman of the Warner Music Group, which Ross helped build into the world's largest record company, attributes much of this success to what he calls Ross's dependability. "You know there'll never be scapegoats," says Morgado. "He just wants to know, how do we fix things and move forward?"
 AT TIMES IN ROSS'S LIFE, there has been plenty to fix. He has a notable gift for complicating his existence by playing fast and loose with the truth. This gift is evident in such minor matters as mythologizing autobiographical details of his war record and "experiences" as a professional football player -- two points made by Richard M. Clurman in a recent critical book on Ross and the merger.
But there have also been matters of greater gravity. Ross has experienced two major disasters in his career. The first, known as the Westchester Premier Theater Affair, was a bribery and racketeering scandal involving Warner officers and close friends. The second was the off-the-cliff collapse of the company's Atari video-games business. In both cases, Ross was guilty, at the very least, of misjudgment and negligent management.
"Atari," Felix Rohatyn says, "showed serious weakness in Warner's management structure. Ross was too trusting of the people around him. He did not want to impose controls."
Both problems hit Ross in the early 80's -- a time when he was recovering from a heart attack and in the midst of a bitter divorce from his second wife, Amanda Burden. Nothing in Ross's life had provided stronger proof of his heady social ascent than his marriage to Burden, the daughter of Barbara (Babe) Paley, the second wife of the late CBS chairman, William S. Paley. But the 16-month union was apparently based on little more than a fleeting infatuation.
Emanuel Gerard, Warner's former co-chief operating officer, remembers the whole period as "horrendous. Ross was like a rat in a hole." Ross had good reason to feel cornered. In the Westchester theater case, two Warner officials were indicted for their part in a racketeering scheme involving a mob-connected theater in Tarrytown, N.Y. One Warner officer, Solomon Weiss, was convicted and received a sentence of five years community service and a fine of $58,000. The other, Jay Emmett, who pleaded guilty in exchange for his cooperation, received a suspended sentence. At the time, some observers, including the chief prosecutor, Nathaniel H. Akerman, contended that the two men had taken the fall for their boss, but this allegation was never substantiated.
"I knew nothing about Westchester," Ross insists today. "The first thing I did when I heard about it was report it to the lawyers and outside directors on the audit committee." He pauses, then adds: "I haven't the slightest idea why the innuendo keeps coming back. It hurts me, because I live by my integrity."
Ross was also roundly criticized for his role in the Atari debacle. Acquired for a song in 1976, Atari video games would experience a rise and fall of Hula-Hoop-esque proportions. In a few tumultuous days in December 1982, the precipitous decline of Atari's business in the face of new video-game competition wiped out nearly 50 percent of Warner's share value and ultimately cost the company more than $1 billion. But Gerard, the Warner official overseeing Atari at the time, was not fired. "Ross's way of dealing with things tends to be not to deal with what is unpleasant," says Gerard, who left the company in 1984 of his own volition. "Mr. Tough Guy, he's not."
A real Mr. Tough Guy was soon to appear on the Warner horizon. He was Herbert J. Siegel, the chairman of Chris-Craft Industries -- a no-nonsense executive whowould eventually threaten Ross's hold on the company. When Rupert Murdoch made a run at Warner in late 1983, trying to buy cheap after the Atari-linked stock slump, Siegel had come to the rescue, acquiring about 20 percent. But once inside, Siegel went into a state of shock. "Atari was losing $1 million a day, including  weekends," he recalls. To the ultraconservative Siegel, the company seemed to be operating under "no controls and no desire to control."
Over the next five years, the differences between the two men intensified, pitting Ross's prodigality against Siegel's pay-as-you-go parsimony. The bickering continued until the merger with Time, when Siegel cashed in, making a profit of more than $2 billion. "My job is to build businesses," says Ross. "But to Siegel, a plane was lavish."
 THE ROSS-SIEGEL conflict foreshadowed the clash of corporate cultures that emerged soon after the merger was finalized. Nick Nicholas, Ross's new co-chief executive, was as uncomfortable as Siegel with Warner's free-spending, undisciplined ways. There was also a collision of styles between the low-key Ivy League Time-Incers (as they liked to be called) and the glitzy Warner executives.
Still, the deal looked good on paper. Warner's business was 40 percent international; Time's, just 9 percent. Warner had no magazines; Time Inc. had a 23-title stable, including People, Sports Illustrated and Time itself, the three biggest advertising draws in American publishing. Time Inc. had no music; Warner had the world's largest record business. Both were big in cable, a capital-intensive business that would be strengthened by joining forces.
From both sides, the deal seemed to make perfect sense. To J. Richard Munro, the former chief executive of Time Inc., it was a long-term way of protecting a publishing giant that enjoyed "a monopoly on print in a world going toward video and movies." To Ross, it provided further proof of his apotheosis. What Amanda Burden had been to the New York social scene, Time Inc. was to corporate America.
The corporate marriage, however, turned out little better than the personal one. Indeed, the two companies have yet to integrate. Fierce partisanship, a media recession, the Ross-Nicholas misalliance and the inherent difficulties of blending entertainment with journalism have all contributed to this impasse. While individual businesses have done well, the much vaunted concept of corporate synergy, repeated like a mantra by Time Warner executives, has proved empty. "There's been little merging of cultures," says Michael J. Fuchs, the head of HBO.
Nowhere have these problems been more apparent than in the issue of church and state -- the Lucian terms forever invoked by Time-Incers to describe the editorial and business sides of their operations and the sacred importance of keeping them separate. "We've had church and state up to here," says one Warner director, reflecting the exasperation of his colleagues at being repeatedly warned not to interfere in Time's editorial operations.
"At Warner, I never interfered on the artistic side, never saw a movie before it came out," Ross says. "Yet here I'm under these ludicrous attacks that I'll ruin church and state. With all this bull, I even feel apprehensive about going over there to the Time-Life Building." (Ross and other top executives are in the former Warner Building, renamed Time Warner, because, as Nicholas once explained, "We just couldn't rename the Time-Life Building.")
Ross has also been blamed -- unjustly, it appears -- for allegedly trying to influence coverage of stories in which he has a personal interest. Last May, when the compensation expert Graef Crystal encountered problems with his annual chart in Fortune detailing how much chief exeuctives are paid, he assumed the objections were coming from Ross. Only later did he hear that the source was Nicholas, who apparently wanted his 1990 pay -- estimated by Crystal at $17.5 million -- downplayed. In the end, Ross led the compensation table, while Nicholas's pay package was revised downward to $7.4 million and relegated to a footnote. "It was all about protecting Nick, who did not want to look like a big pig," says Crystal, who quit in protest. (Nicholas denies any interference in the compensation table.)
Still, Ross is clearly ill at ease about being close to journalists. "I think it's very difficult now that I'm on the inside of a journalistic company to do a lot of other things," he says. "You're always being scrutinized. And you've got a lot of competitors out there."
Many journalists in the Time magazine group are equally uncomfortable about their proximity to Ross. They believe the magazines have gone soft, reduced to what Ross knows and loves: entertainment. "Jesus," says one senior Time writer on the West Coast. "We had a memo last year saying news pegs were no longer important for stories. We almost have to give excuses if we write a story with a peg."
Tensions between the two organizations have put a decided crimp in Ross's unorthodox style. At Warner, he could do what he liked. At Time Warner, however, the fact that his chief financial aide, Oded Aboodi, collects a Time Warner salary, while simultaneously charging the company fees and doing independent work, raises eyebrows. "I have a nonexclusive contract," Aboodi explains. "It's nice to have my health benefits and office paid by Time Warner."
Nicholas was unused to such cozy arrangements. His precision and thriftiness clashed with Ross's largesse and unstructured ways. When Nicholas reacted to the news of Ross's cancer last November by behaving as though he were the sole skipper of the ship, it was the final straw. As he had with Siegel, Ross was able to draw on the unshakeable loyalties of the old Warner board members to force Nicholas out.
The ouster dramatically demonstrated Ross's still formidable power. But the compensation issue still hovers over him, as it does, to a lesser degree, over the other key executives who profited so much from the merger. To a man, Ross, Munro, Nicholas and Levin all lay the blame for the opprobrium they've suffered at the door of Martin S. Davis, the chief executive of Paramount. Acknowledging that his rejection of Davis's bid of $200 a share for the company inspired an explosion of stockholder outrage, Munro still defends the move as being in the best interest of Time. "Martin Davis is not the kind of fellow I would have wanted to get into bed with," he says. "It's that cut and dried."
The rejection of the offer, however, was anything but cut and dried. The original plan for a debt-free merger of Time and Warner had to be scrapped, because it would have had to be put to a shareholders' vote; Time shareholders would no doubt have opted for the sale at the $200 price. Instead, in order to avoid the clutches of Paramount, Time was obliged to buy Warner for $14 billion and incurred $11.4 billion of debt. This heavy leveraging so depressed the stock and limited the corporation's maneuverability that, in the view of one Time Warner director, it delayed "for five years what would have been a company that had the financial freedom to really go global."
Since the price of Time Warner shares has been well below $200 the last couple of years and is now at about $105, Time shareholders, many of whom are employees, have been angry ever since the Paramount offer was rejected. Much of their anger has been directed at Ross.
"I can understand why Time shareholders are still miffed," says Gordon Crawford, a senior vice president of Capital Research, a California group heavily invested in Time Warner. "But they should not blame their management's decision on Ross. He took very good care of his Warner shareholders. He never turned down $200 a share from Parmount. It irritates the heck out of me."
It is true that Ross took care of Warner shareholders, who got $70 a share from Time. Some of them, who had been there since the days of Kinney, became rich. Ross himself received a total of $196 million -- to be paid out over several years. "Look," Ross says wearily, "without that phony $200 offer from Davis, my contract and all the other contracts would hardly have come under scrutiny. But people are frustrated, I understand that." Davis, for his part, insists his offer was bona fide. He describes the Time Warner management contracts that were part of the merger agreement as "a rape of shareholders."
One of the most generous contracts went to Munro, a major architect of the merger. He retired in May 1990, but is currently earning $750,000 a year plus bonuses for chairing the Time Warner executive committee, which meets no more than once or twice a year. "I'm embarrassed by the question of 'Should I be paid this money?' " Munro says. "This is a terrible moment to be quote overcompensated, when people are being fired."
Ross, seeking to vindicate himself and the deal, has "worked harder than ever before in his life," says one friend, the attorney Arthur Liman. For much of the last two years Ross has been on airplanes, criss-crossing the world in a search for strategic partners. Finally, last October, he secured a $1 billion investment from two Japanese companies, the electronics giant Toshiba and the C. Itoh & Company. A similar deal is supposedly in the works with a European partner.
And, after a bungled attempt at a rights offering featuring a coercive formula that only exacerbated shareholder enmity, the company did manage to raise $2.7 billion last year with a revised offering. All this has reduced the debt level to $8.7 billion. In the last couple of months, Time Warner stock has surged about $25.
But the question persists: Is Ross worth all that money? Ross and his aides point to the $135 million Steve Jobs made by selling his shares in Apple, the $327 million Lew Wasserman earned by selling MCA to Matsushita and to Bill Gates, who became a billionaire with the success of his software giant, Microsoft. Surely, they argue, Ross deserved his $78.2 million paycheck in salary and bonuses in 1990 -- $74.9 million of which represented a one-time payout for his interests in Warner, the company he had built from a hollow shell?
It is a specious argument, however. To call Ross, as he and many of those around him do, a "company founder," like Jobs or Gates, is not accurate; Warner Brothers Pictures was started in 1923 by Jack, Harry and Albert Warner. More importantly, most founders own a big chunk of stock in their companies, which assures their fortunes if their enterprises succeed but also puts them at great risk. Throughout his career, Ross never owned more than about 1 or 2 percent of the companies he ran.
"I was so busy, I never got round to it," Ross says. "I never looked after me all these years."
Ross did not exactly live like a pauper, however. During the early years at Warner, he had a salary of about $300,000 and lavish perks. It was not until the late 70's that Ross engineered the first of his multimillion-dollar annual contracts, but his conflict with Siegel in the 80's put these big payouts on hold. "When you finally have a partner who starts irritating the hell out of you," Ross says, "you start thinking, hey, I had better start planning my future financially."
To rectify this, Ross began to insist on increasingly elaborate contracts filled with bonuses, massive stock-option plans and other intricate financial devices. Apparently, Ross wanted it both ways. Such compensation packages, which cost nothing and carry no risk, and actual stock ownership, prey to the ups and downs of the market, are completely different.
As Graef Crystal points out: "The annoying part of owning stock is that if the market sinks, you lose real money." Indeed, if an Atari-like disaster had befallen Bill Gates at Microsoft, his fortune would have been decimated. But Ross never placed himself in harm's way. "Ross has tended to prefer a safety net under him when he walks across Niagara," Crystal says.
The most elaborate safety net of Ross's career was provided by the 55-page, 10-year Warner contract, which he signed in February 1987. That board-approved agreement was then adjusted to become his much-discussed contract at Time Warner. As Ross's aide Aboodi concedes, "This 1987 contract was an attempt to make up for lost time."
The 1987 contract guaranteed Ross, who at the time owned less than 1 percent of Warner, about $14 million a year over a decade -- provided Warner's stock and earnings rose 10 percent annually. Vehemently opposed by Siegel, it was a labyrinthine concoction of stock options, bonuses, deferred compensation schemes, golden parachutes and posthumous guarantees.
What ultimately grates on many people is that the $74.9 million payout Ross received in 1990 and the additional $121.1 million he will earn over the next several years was not in consideration of Warner stock he owned. Rather, it was a payment for Warner stock options and other performance bonuses he had secured in the controversial 1987 contract. Then, on top of all this, he won another 1.8 million stock options from the Time Warner merger agreement. These options are not worth anything now (their exercise price is $150) but may be worth a lot one day. (Stock options, usually granted for a 10-year period, lock in a share price. If the company's stock goes above that price, the owner of the stock options profits but loses nothing if the stock fails to reach that price.)
Again, Ross has set up a scenario with no downside risk and great upside potential. The spectacle of huge rewards without corresponding performance or risk appears to be feeding the current outcry against the excesses of executive compensation. Founders, dreamers, risk takers and visionaries make their fortunes a slightly different way from Steven J. Ross.
THE SETTING SUN sends a shimmering glow over the partially iced surface of Georgica Pond. From his house in East Hampton, Ross has a beautiful view across the water. Here, his illness has reunited him with his family. Everywhere, there are photos of his children and grandchildren. The air of tranquility is occasionally punctuated by a boistrous African parrot named Mini, who is wont to squawk obscenities.
"I'm a family person," Ross says. "I hate parties. That's another thing people misunderstand."
According to those close to him, the chemotherapy is going well. The first session halved the tumor's size. There is no indication that the cancer has spread. Ross feels terrible sometimes and his hair has fallen out. But, says his wife, Courtney, "he is very motivated to get well."
He remains confident about the future of Time Warner. Beneath the debt, Time Warner has a remarkable set of assets, which produced operating income of $2.3 billion last year. Interest payments, tax and other charges wiped all that out, leaving the company with a net loss of $99 million -- a sharp improvement, however, on the previous year.
As the debt load eases, the underlying earning power of the magazines, music, movies, programming and cable will likely prevail. And, with the departure of Nicholas and installation of the highly regarded Levin -- whose allegience is clearly to the joint enterprise -- it may finally prove possible to really merge the two companies.
Levin, an affable intellectual with a strong commercial sense, believes that Time Warner has a sure winner in cable. Penetration (of households with television sets), now at 60.6 percent, will go to 85 percent, he predicts. As that happens, cable advertising, now at about $2 billion a year, will grow rapidly. Seldom, according to Levin, has a business been such a mathematical certainty. Wall Street already appears to be taking note. "Time Warner is the best positioned of all international media companies," says Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber.
The company has also started putting a 150-channel interactive cable system into Queens that Ross believes is a precursor of a world in which the television set will become an all-purpose computer-cum-entertainment box. He contends that the new technology will ultimately encourage reading, but he gets lost as he tries to explain it. "So anyhow," he says, "getting back to . . . I don't even know what we were talking about . . . The written word is the key." Later, he says something "has just slipped my word." He often meanders in a disturbing way.
Ross is a sick man fighting for his life. He is due to leave the job of chief executive to Levin on July 24, 1994, but friends say he may do that sooner now that he has his man in place. Certainly, to continue the frenetic pace of the past two years seems unthinkable.
The task confronting him remains enormous. Warner was a morale-driven company, but today "morale is terrible," admits the publishing group chief, Brack. Before his removal, Nicholas insisted that Henry Luce would have been "ecstatic if he saw the company today." Few would agree.
Ross, ever mistrustful of journalists, has no one to blame but himself for now living in a house full of them. Before the Time Warner deal went through, his friend Liman had warned him: "We're not in our teens any more. You've got a great company with Warner. Do you really want this -- a co-C.E.O., a different board, a different culture?"
Ross thought he could live with all that, if it enabled him to fulfill his ambition of building the world's mightiest media and entertainment company. Now he is not so sure. "A million things hit us," he says.
In difficult moments, Ross says, he remembers the lines in "Hamlet" of Polonius to Laertes that his father used to quote to him. One of the lines is "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." Another is "This above all: to thine own self be true."
As he recites the verses, there is no flicker of self-doubt or irony on Ross's face. He believes he has lived his life this way.

HEADLINE: Pondering the Riddle of Creativity

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN; Daniel Goleman is the co-author, with Paul Kaufman and Michael Ray, of "The Creative Spirit," the companion volume to the four-part PBS series of the same name beginning April 2.

 BODY:
There is something bedazzling about the creative act: always a surprise, it shocks with its unimaginable perfection, its strange eloquence, its balance between the fresh and the familiar. Perhaps it's because we want to make such magic ourselves that we are so intrigued by how others do it. And so we turn to psychology to unravel the mysteries of creativity.
But despite a long fascination with the creative mind, psychology has been singularly uncreative in explaining it. There is, for example, the popular if romanticized view that takes van Gogh as its prototype of the creative genius: an emotional cripple who, if cured of his neurosis, would lose his talents. That theory, with roots as ancient as Aristotle, has gone out the window with findings that show creativity flourishing with emotional maturity (though a little manic depression in the family may not hurt, especially for writers). 
 Other theories try to reduce the creative act to elementary abilities. One such theory was "divergence," a knack measured by how many novel ideas one could come up with for using such items as a junked car. Such theories merely trivialize the topic.
In recent years these piecemeal approaches have been rejected by a new generation of psychologists who seek more satisfying understanding of the creative spirit, whether it is embodied in the young artist starting in the proverbial garret or a titan like Martha Graham, innovating into her 90's.
Three major new theories of creativity nest inside one another like Russian dolls. One focuses on the role of the sheer pleasures of creation during the inspired moment. A second tracks the forces at work in the lives of creative geniuses like Eliot and Picasso, Einstein and Gandhi, people who have risen beyond the top of their form to recreate the form itself. A third steps back to assess the social forces that give rise to a renaissance.
These theories signify a sweeping shift in the study of the imagination. Rather than seeing creative ability as something akin to intelligence, something like a creative I.Q., psychologists are examining the creative moment itself. Glimpses of the lives and work of three creative artists -- the realistic painter Gregory Gillespie, the film maker George Lucas and the Polish playwright Janusz Glowacki -- illuminate these theories.
 
 
Gregory Gillespie
The Thrill Of the Moment
 Consider the artist Gregory Gillespie in his studio in a meadow near Amherst, Mass., pondering whether to add images of himself and hisdaughter, Juliana, to a life-size super-realistic nude portrait of his wife, Peggy, sitting on a kitchen stool. At times like this, when he contemplates the intricacies of composition or is rapt, putting brush to canvas, Mr. Gillespie says he feels "super-alert." Time dissolves, and a day passes like an hour.
That elastic sense of time -- vanishing into a kind of hyperspeed or crystallizing into stop-frame slow motion -- is a mark of what psychologists call the "flow" state, an altered awareness found in people performing at their peak. First discovered in studies in which people from rock climbers to chess masters described moments when they had outdone themselves, flow is now being charted as the thrill that motivates artists to keep at it year after year.
Mr. Gillespie's paintings are now in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum and the Hirshhorn. But when he began he was willing to live in near-poverty rather than work a full-time job so he would have time to paint. "I loved it," says the artist, who is 55. "I felt painting was the greatest job I could have, even though I wasn't making a cent from it."
Such early disregard for financial reward is a hallmark of nascent artists who later have successful careers, according to Prof. Mike Csikzentmihalyi, a University of Chicago psychologist who has led the research on flow and creativity. He and his colleagues studied 200 artists, first in art school, and then 18 years later. Those who had most savored the joy of painting itself, valuing the process more than the product, stayed with it; from their ranks eventually emerged the most successful. But those who had been spurred by fantasies of fame and wealth had largely disappeared from the art world soon after graduation.
"Painters must want to paint above all else," says Professor Csikzentmihalyi. "If the artist in front of the canvas begins to wonder how much he will sell it for, or what the critics will think of it, he won't be able to pursue original avenues. Creative achievements depend on single-minded immersion."
Flow hooks artists on their medium in the first place, but it also drives them to push beyond their limits, to innovate and experiment. The Chicago researchers find that flow occurs when a person's skills are in exquisite balance with the challenges presented. If the challenge is too easy, there is boredom; if it's too taxing, anxiety results.
A novice musician feels "in flow" performing a well-rehearsed repertory; a master musician needs the most technically challenging pieces to get in flow; the world-class musician ups the ante by interpreting those most challenging pieces.
The signs of such an evolution are evident in the retrospective survey of Mr. Gillespie's self-portraits from 1969 to 1991, now at the Forum Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. The earliest work is technically primitive, using tight, restricted brushstrokes to depict the artist at 33. The portrait shows a man who seems to be glowering with intensity at the struggle to master his medium. "I was just learning how to make it look realistic," Mr. Gillespie recalls.
By 1975 a self-portrait is so vividly realistic that at first glance it could be taken for a photograph. But soon after mastering that hyper-realistic technique, Mr. Gillespie moved on to a signature style, a visual equivalent to magical surrealism in which murky Rorschach-like subworlds lurk in the corners and shadows, populated by a mix of fetuses, torsos, genitalia and intestines: the tension betwen id and ego made visible.
Recently, Mr. Gillespie has moved on again. "I lost interest in being able to render microscopic detail," he said. "What challenges me now about painting a figure is using a looser technique -- bigger brushes, broader strokes, painting more quickly."
He also uses life-size cutouts of painted objects, trying them out in several of the many paintings he works on at once. He welcomes visitors' suggestions about what elements to put where. Says Mr. Gillespie: "I'm always on the lookout for something new to try. It keeps it fresh for me."
 
George Lucas
Challenges Over a Lifetime
 The lifelong trajectory of creative geniuses, fueled by the pursuit of flow, is the focus of the second new theory. That theory encompasses the psychological and social forces at work in such a life, and such phenomena as the so-called 10-year rule, the natural rhythm at which artists seem to have breakthroughs.
The 10-year rule has emerged from a major study by Howard Gardner, a psychologist at Harvard University. Professor Gardner examined the lives of a handful of virtuosos, each of whose work has transformed its field. For example: T. S. Eliot, who graduated from Harvard in 1910, had completed a draft of "The Waste Land" by 1921. Picasso, who left art school to live as a painter in Barcelona at 17, painted "Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon" at 26. Stravinsky, who began his apprenticeship as a composer with Rimsky-Korsakov in 1902, stunned the musical world with his score for "The Rites of Spring" just a decade later.
In the realm of American movie making, George Lucas entered film school in 1964 at the age of 20, finished his breakthrough movie "American Graffiti" just eight years later and turned to work on the "Star Wars" trilogy soon after that. Now 47, he will be given the Irving Thalberg award during the Academy Award presentations on March 30, in recognition of his creative innovations in film.
Typically high-level creators have come from geographical regions removed from the centers of power, and from families that valued discipline and achievement. "There's something to be said for being a big fish in a little pond when you're young," says Professor Gardner. "It gives you a certain feeling of invulnerability" that, along with self-discipline, shields an artist from the rebuffs that, predictably, assail every revolutionary creation.
Mr. Lucas, who grew up the son of a businessman in rural Modesto, Calif., stresses the importance of perseverance in his own success. "Persistence and tenacity are the reasons I've come this far," he said. "In film, especially when you are starting out, everyone says, no, you can't possibly do it that way."
That happened when Mr. Lucas was seeking financing for "American Graffiti." "No one would touch it; it took two years of pounding on doors," said Mr. Lucas. "For one thing, I was telling four separate stories simultaneously, intercutting them into a single whole. Now it's a standard style, especially on TV shows. Then it was an experiment in editing."
The second objection Mr. Lucas faced was to the film's soundtrack. "It was a musical montage. I structured each scene around a song. I took an operatic format and converted it to the modern cinematic medium. I was told it would be too disturbing, that people wouldn't sit still through 110 minutes of music."
But Mr. Lucas persevered, with the encouragement of close friends. That, too, Professor Gardner finds, is a common element in the careers of the highly creative: they rapidly bond with a set others who are exploring new terrain within their field, and who offer one another crucial support, exchanging ideas and boosting morale. For Mr. Lucas, the band included his mentor, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, all starting out as young film makers.
Until then, Mr. Lucas recalls, the film industry had been largely closed to those who were not shaped by the culture of the studios. Such marginality is another theme in the lives of the highly creative, Professor Gardner finds, even after their breakthrough has won them acceptance and influence. Continuing to seek a marginal status helps the creator maintain a crucial freshness. "Whenever they risked becoming members of the establishment in their field, they would again shift course," says Professor Gardner.
Mr. Lucas has maintained that distance by making Marin County his base of operations. "Once I saw that films could be made anywhere, that you didn't need giant sound stages and big studios, I saw no reason to move back to Los Angeles," said Mr. Lucas. "I felt film making should be decentralized, and that Hollywood was too insulated. It was a 60's philosophy."
Professor Gardner finds another pattern: a second breakthrough, which, he says, is "also noteworthy, but less dramatic -- a kind of coming home that places the person's work in a broader frame, reconciling it with basic values."
To be sure, Mr. Lucas has made several cinematic breakthroughs, not least his "Star Wars" trilogy, in which he created a modern myth. But his biggest recent artistic gamble is his new ABC series, "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" (Wednesday nights at 9). "I'm taking PBS-style 'Masterpiece Theater' and moving it to network TV," said Mr. Lucas. The series tracks the early years of Mr. Lucas's film hero Indiana Jones, the swashbuckling archeologist. In the TV series, he says, "The creative challenge is to tell interesting stories that introduce people to historical figures and deal with larger issues like comparative religion and ecology."
Despite the skepticism of many critics, the first episode placed in the top 10 shows for the week. But whether Mr. Lucas has beaten conventional wisdom with this gamble is not yet clear. Mr. Lucas is aware that he is again battling the mainstream. "TV is a tabloid medium of sorts, wanting the current hot issues rather than the perennial ones," he said. "But you have to do what your muses tell you."
 
 
Janusz Glowacki
Awaiting The Renaissance
 No matter how talented creative artists may be, they are to a degree dependent on the time and place in which they live. Perhaps the most ambitious of the new theories takes the grand view, asking what, over the last 2,500 years of human history, accounts for the rise and fall of golden ages of creativity -- and where we can expect another renaissance. The answers are put forth by Dean Keith Simonton, a psychologist at the University of California at Davis, who predicts that the new republics of the Soviet Union and the newly free nations of Eastern Europe show the greatest promise.
His conclusions: great wealth, geographic expansion, a centralized nation-state and waging wars all have little or nothing to do with producing a creative society. Instead, political fragmentation emerged as the single best social predictor of grand escalations in creativity. For instance, Italy during the Renaissance was not a single nation, but a bevy of city-states vying for power. The Germany that spawned Goethe, Hegel, Schiller, Mozart and Beethoven was made up of myriad small states, adrift from the decayed Holy Roman Empire. Monolithic states, by contrast, squelch creativity.
"The Russification process, where an imperial state gobbles up its neighbors and drives them to cultural homogeneity, can undermine the creative potential of the entire society," Professor Simonton says.
Typically a creative upsurge takes place about 20 years after a rebellion, as the first generation of artists matures free of the paralyzing limitations of a restrictive, monolithic power.
"You shouldn't expect a golden age overnight, but I'd predict one could begin in the second decade of the next century," says Professor Simonton. "First the emerging republics will have to re-establish their unique cultural identities and build up their economies. While wealth does not breed creativity, poverty pretty much prevents it."
Poverty is why, in the short term, many Eastern European artists are pessimistic about the creative climate. "It's such a huge financial mess in Poland now that independence has been a big disappointment for the arts," said Janusz Glowacki, a Polish playwright who spends time in both Poland and the United States. "They've been closing theaters and firing actors. Even very good writers are having trouble getting publishers. Mostly everyone's just trying to survive."
If it is any consolation, Professor Simonton has also found, in an analysis of 1,935 compositions in the classical repertory, that those pieces created under conditions of civil unrest were most likely to have lasting popularity.
That may be good news for Mr. Glowacki's own work. The 53-year-old novelist and playwright emigrated to the United States in 1981, when martial law was declared in Poland and the Solidarity labor movement was outlawed. He is best known for his plays "Cinders" and "Hunting Cockroaches," both of which have been produced Off Broadway and in many theaters throughout the world, including in Eastern Europe.
"Hunting Cockroaches," presented in 1987 at the Manhattan Theater Club with Ron Silver and Dianne Wiest, is a semi-autobiographical work about a writer and his wife, an actress, who have fled Poland and are adjusting to life in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. "Cinders," produced at the Public Theater in 1984 with Christopher Walken, revolves around a staging of "Cinderella" in a girls' reform school and addresses how a totalitarian regime breaks the will of its critics.
These days in Eastern Europe, says Mr. Glowacki, while novelists and playwrights "can write without censorship, they're being censored by the economy. The first rank of writers are suffering a lot."

Newness That Makes No Apology

BYLINE: By Edward Rothstein

 BODY:
The lobby of the $72 million Wortham Theater Center in Houston is peculiarly revealing about that city's cultural life. The main entrance to the three-acre complex, which houses both the Houston Grand Opera and the Houston Ballet, opens almost immediately onto a grand escalator flanked by enormous sculptures of banners and torches. But on reaching the top, one can only gasp in surprise. There is no statuary as at La Scala, nor is there the cramped artificiality of the Metropolitan Opera lobby. The entrances to the 2,176-seat Alice and George Brown Theater and to the 1,066-seat Lillie and Roy Cullen Theater are nowhere to be seen. The reception area is simply an enormous empty space.
A football field further in (or so it seems), there are a coffee bar and souvenir stand, a winding line of cushioned benches and a small cafe, all dwarfed by the room itself. Walking through it is like entering a train station. This is a place, it seems, built for thousands of commuters, all on their way somewhere from someplace else. Despite the escalator's heraldic sculptures, this entrance does not really serve as an induction into a particular world; it makes no claim on one's attention aside from its sheer size. It is, curiously, a monument to the transience of its visitors and seeming testimony to the impermanence of the artistic objects contained within. The lobby is simply a celebration of newness. 
 It is a monument that is not undeserved, for Houston, lacking long and deep artistic traditions, is a typical American city. The opera company was founded in 1955; the symphony goes back to 1913, but only during the last two decades has it had a year-round program; a chamber-music organization, Da Camera, is just in its fourth season.
Yet Houston's artistic achievements have an unusual range. In 1987, the Wortham Center was built with private financing as an imposing home for the performing arts. (In the same year, the distinguished Menil Collection opened, a museum housing artworks collected by Dominique and John de Menil.) During the last 20 years, with David Gockley as director, the Houston Grand Opera has achieved a worldwide reputation for the presentation of new works and important productions of mainstream repertory. Last month, for example, Robert Wilson's eccentric, haunting version of "Parsifal" was given its premiere. (The band in the pit was the Houston Symphony under its music director, Christoph Eschenbach; it could easily have competed with more tradition-bound European ensembles.) As for Da Camera, its director, the violinist Sergiu Luca, has put together programs that should be the envy of other groups -- a concert of works written during composers' final years, a concert juxtaposing the music of Elliott Carter and Olivier Messiaen, or a concert of music influenced by Goethe.
There is also a wide range to these artistic enterprises. In the Houston Grand Opera, in fact, Mr. Gockley has combined various aspects of the New York City Opera, the Met and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He is fast on his feet, smart in his marketing and musically ambitious. The company has an astonishing track record even outside the boundaries of traditional opera. It brought "Show Boat," "Hello, Dolly!" and "Porgy and Bess" to Broadway. Its international status has partly come from avant-gardish championing of works by Meredith Monk, Philip Glass and John Adams. Da Camera also has crossover programs (combining jazz and classical) and is founded on the notion that widespread problems plague programming -- a perspective gained from being on the outskirts of a culture.
It is as if the absence of long social and musical traditions has led to great freedom. The arts are less imposing here, so more accepted and exploratory: a cabdriver told me, as if fulfilling his typical role of journalistic touchstone, how much he had loved Mr. Wilson's "Parsifal." Such an atmosphere can lead to greater adventurousness; it can also lead to shallower effect as I found in Gretry's "Beauty and the Beast" and Robert Moran's "Desert of Roses," two other productions I saw last month.
Shallow roots also fail to provide assistance in difficult times. The late 1980's marked a vast expansion of Houston's cultural life just as its economic boom was ending. The impact has been delayed. This season, the Houston Grand Opera, after growing from a $420,000 budget in 1972 to an $18 million budget in 1991, is contracting. The Da Camera society is in imminent danger of extinction; it cannot offer donors social cachet or attract the sustained support the Grand Opera is struggling for, though its demise would be a serious debit for Houstonian culture. In seeking new audiences, the opera company has just announced Opera New World, a program that will attempt to create diversity in audiences and programming -- a risky procedure. Its success will depend on whether the emphasis is on the education of newcomers to the operatic tradition, or whether, in a contemporary cliche, the tradition itself is viewed as irredeemably elitist.
In all these respects, in its failures and its successes, its promises and its ominous rumblings, Houston may be archetypally American, demonstrating possibilities and risks inherent in fast growth. It also raises questions we must face if art-music traditions are to have a future in their American incarnations. In the meantime, we seem to wait in a cultural train depot like Wortham's lobby, spotting new arrivals, then casually moving on in search of newer charms.

Sonyma Drops Its Rates

 BODY:
With 30-year fixed rate mortgages offered by New York banks edging upwards -- the average rate was 9.15 percent last week and is expected to go to 9.25 percent this week -- low- and moderate-income homebuyers may be tempted by the latest offering from the State of New York Mortgage Agency (Sonyma). The agency dropped its rate last week to the lowest level in eight years -- 7.25 percent for the first five years and 8.20 percent for the remaining 25 years.
"Things were slow," said John N. Spano, a vice president at Sonyma, explaining that the agency's loans had dropped from $412 million in 1990 to $350 million in 1991. 
 By Jan. 10 of this year, regular mortgage rates hit an 18-year low, averaging 8.42 percent, according to Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage information service in Butler, N.J. At those levels, Sonyma's loans had lost their competitive advantage. Historically its rates were two percentage points below the market.
The loans are available to first-time homebuyers and others, with income limits that vary from county to county. (For details, call 800 382 HOME.)
State mortgage rates may also come down in New Jersey and Connecticut. The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, now offering 8.8 percent mortgages, plans to drop rates in about a month. The Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, with fixed rates from 8.0 to 8.5 percent, is now considering ways of remarketing its bonds and lowering its rates.

HEADLINE: Is It Time to End Rent Regulation?

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
FOR almost half a century, rent regulation, which has provided virtual lifetime guarantees of inexpensive or below-market-price apartments to hundreds of thousands of families, regardless of means, has been politically untouchable in New York City.
In the last year, though, a rising vacancy rate, the city's urgent need for more tax revenues and studies projecting that deregulation would have a limited impact on most apartment residents have brought hope to landlords and fear to tenants that the controversial system will soon be reconsidered, if not revamped. 
 "As the economy changes, as circumstances change, then we have got to look at the rules and regulations," said Councilman Archie H. Spigner, chairman of the City Council's Committee on Housing and Building. "Personally, I'm happy to see the vacancy rate go up. It means the citizens have more options."
Apartment vacancy rates lie at the heart of the struggle over rent regulation. The system, enacted in 1943 as part of a wartime emergency housing act, is designed to prevent landlords from gouging tenants when there is a shortage of rental housing. Under the state's Emergency Tenant Protection Act, the City Council must determine every three years whether the vacancy rate is still below 5 percent. If it is, rent regulation remains in effect. But some classes of apartments that have vacancy rates above 5 percent, such as luxury units, can be excluded.
The vacancy rates are calculated triennially for the city by the Federal Bureau of the Census. In 1987, only 2.46 percent of two million rental units were found vacant. In 1990, though, the bureau could not conduct the survey because it was busy with the decennial national census. Instead, city officials relied on first-quarter 1990 figures from a smaller-than-usual Census Bureau survey of about 2,000 apartments. This showed a vacancy rate of 4.2 percent, allowing the city to renew rent control for 155,000 apartments and rent stabilization for 900,000.
Rent controlled apartments are those built before 1947 that have been continuously occupied by a tenant, or a legal successor, since 1971. When rent-controlled apartments are vacated their rents rise to market level and they become rent stabilized. Apartments built between 1947 and 1974 are also rent-stabilized, as are those built afterward under the city's tax abatement programs. The stabilization ends in new buildings when the abatement expires after 10 or 12 years.
In May 1991, the Rent Stabilization Association, an organization of property owners that opposes rent regulation, sued the city to end controls. It argued that the 1990 survey was invalid and that even if it was valid, the city should have used figures from a similar small survey done in the fourth quarter of 1990, which showed a 5.2 percent vacancy rate.
The matter rests in State Supreme Court in Queens, and lengthy appeals are likely regardless of the outcome.
Further complicating the issue, the Census Bureau did a full survey of about 18,000 apartments in 1991. The vacancy rate shown by that survey was 3.78 percent, the highest since the bureau began the studies in 1960. Details, which will provide vacancy rates for individual classes of apartments, are not expected to be released until late summer.
"WE have never seen the vacancy rates like this before, and it makes you wonder why we should continue rent control and who it benefits," said John J. Gilbert 3d, president of the Rent Stabilization Association.
Mr. Gilbert said the association plans to petition the city later this year for a recalculation of the 3.78 percent vacancy rate. He cited a 4.1 rate in the 10-year census survey, the decline in rents in the city and the increasing ease of renting an apartment.
The association is also appealing the outcome of a 1987 action in which it sued the city for not ending rent regulation on apartments renting for more than $1,000 a month. In that suit, the association cited the 1987 census survey that showed vacancy rates of 5.8 percent to 6.5 percent for those apartments, even though the overall vacancy rate was only 2.46 percent. The State Supreme Court ruled against the association because, according to Mr. Gilbert, the association had made a technical error in its supporting statistical evidence.
"All trends point to a line piercing the 5 percent mark within three years," Mr. Gilbert said. "You would think that the city would be looking at ways to phase out rent regulations."
Supporters of rent control dispute Mr. Gilbert's assessment of the vacancy rates. And even if the rate has surpassed 5 percent, they believe this is a glitch caused by the recession and the glut of unsold co-op and condominium apartments that have been turned into rental units.
"It's cyclical," said Michael McKee, chairman of the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition. "We went through the same things in the 60's, a glut caused by overbuilding. But the glut we see now will not be forever; it will be absorbed."
Mr. McKee also opposes partial rent deregulation, such as on luxury apartments. He questioned what would constitute a luxury-level rent, citing, for example, several roommates living in a $2,000-a-month apartment. "Four or five people paying $500 aren't exactly rich," he said.
He also said that decontrolling property classes with a vacancy rate above 5 percent would only lead to a reinstatement of controls at a higher rent level when the vacancy rate falls. As for a means test, he said, it would be difficult to administer and lead to a chipping away of the political support for rent regulation for middle-income and lower-income tenants.
More important, perhaps, Mr. McKee and many supporters of rent regulation oppose deregulation on philosophical grounds; they believe is a right and units should be built and regulated by government edict.
"It is absurd to think that at 4.5 percent we have a housing emergency and at 5.2 percent we don't," Mr. McKee said.
Supporters of decontrol, however, believe strongly in private property rights. They also contend that the city and state, rather than property owners, should provide the means for affordable housing. "Rent subsidies and payments would work better," Mr. Gilbert said.
Although supporters of rent regulation believe that abolishing the system would force thousands of tenants, many of them with low incomes, from their long-held apartments, a study released last month by the Rent Stabilization Association found that for most of the city outside of Manhattan the impact would be minimal. The study was done for the association by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University
According to the study, based on the differences in rents between unregulated apartments and rent-stabilized dwellings in the same areas, there is now little difference between regulated rents and market rents in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. And in some places, such as Lower Manhattan and several neighborhoods in Brooklyn, regulated rents are higher.
In most of Manhattan, though, the study found that rent control and stabilization provide subsidies for renters of up to $63 a month in northern Manhattan, $434 a month on the Upper East Side and $599 a month in Turtle Bay.
"Four out of five boroughs do not benefit from rent regulation and would not be affected by decontrol," Mr. Gilbert said. "Even in Manhattan, rent increases could be minimized by a broad decontrol measure."
He also blamed rent regulation for increases in building abandonments and the rising number of delinquencies showing up on the city's property tax rolls. Other complaints include the economic disincentive to landlords for making repairs, renovations or improving services.
Then there is the annual $24 million cost of having the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal administer the program, which has long been criticized as ineffective in resolving grievances and rent disputes.
Of that $24 million, $8.5 million comes from landlords who pay $10 a unit. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's 1992-93 budget request calls for increasing the fee to $15 to generate an additional $4.6 million to avert a 3 percent staff reduction that could further slow the administration of rent regulation.
"The cost of administering it has jumped from $7 million in 1984," said Jack Freund, director of research and development for the Rent Stabilization Association, which administered the rent-stabilization program for the city before the state's involvement.
The Commissioner of the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, Angelo J. Aponte, said the increases came because of rising labor costs and additional responsibilities imposed by the Federal Government. He also said that many of the division's administrative problems stemmed from a backlog of cases it inherited when, in what is now widely considered a failed effort at reform, it took over rent-regulation from the city and the Rent Stabilization Association.
Mr. Aponte added that changes in New York City's system of rent control were needed to make it easier to administer, but he opposes scrapping rent regulation outright. He dismissed a means test because it would increase the department's administrative burden. And luxury decontrol, he said, is a minute issue unworthy of consideration.
"There is a need to have tenant protection on the books," he said.
Mr. Gilbert, however, noted a growing trend in the nation, in places like San Francisco and Brookline, Mass., to repeal or reject rent-regulation laws. "Deregulation, it is coming, it is happening, and it will continue to come for the rest of this decade," he said.
He added that a bill sponsored by Senator Joseph L. Bruno, Republican-Conservative of Rensselaer, was approved by the State Senate's Housing and Community Development Committee two weeks ago. It would end rent regulation in one year for tenants with annual incomes of more than $100,000 and for apartments renting for $2,000 or more a month.
The bill made it through the committee last year but was not voted on by the full Senate.
"There will be a vote this year," said Edward Stahr, director of research for the Legislative Commission on Public-Private Cooperation, which is headed by Mr. Bruno and which drafted the bill.
MR. GILBERT also said that a report released last year by the Citizen's Budget Commission projected that the city could collect an additional $80 million to $100 million a year in property taxes if rent regulation was removed from high-income households upon vacancy.
"Decontrol can help prevent abandonment and provide New York City with desperately needed revenue to pay for police, firemen and sanitation workers," he said.
Besides the Rent Stabilization Association, pressure to phase out rent regulation is coming from newly formed alliances between the owners of co-ops and rental buildings.
"It is a phenomenon that is increasing now," Mr. Freund said. "There is a mutuality of concerns with rising taxes and the remaining rent-controlled tenants left in buildings."
But even those who wish to dismantle rent regulation believe it is not politically practicable to eliminate it entirely. Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island said the City Council should begin exploring options such as decontrolling apartments when they become vacant, applying a means tests for tenants or imposing decontrol only on the small number of rent-controlled apartments that rent for over $750 or $1,000 a month.
Tenants in rent-controlled apartments have a statutory right to occupy their apartments for as long as they want without a lease. Once a rent-controlled apartment becomes vacant, its rent may be raised to market level and made subject to rent-stabilization, with a limit on annual rent increases based on an index of operating costs.
"There is enough sentiment today to pass some legislation, but we are not sure how far we can go," Mr. Molinari said. "We are playing around with threshold figures, maybe $750 a month, maybe $1,000. We read about these stars who are making millions of dollars and living in a rent-controlled apartment. That's immoral."
Indeed, there are myriad, well-publicized cases of the rich and famous paying far below market rents for large apartments, thanks to the city's rent-regulation system. Or of single retirees living in regulated apartments that could be used to house large families. Or of tenants who use their regulated units as pied-a-terres. A Southampton, L.I., family of five, for example, was recently evicted from a rent-controlled, 450-square-foot studio apartment in Manhattan that they contended was their primary residence.
In recent weeks, rent-control critics have also cited the case of Herbert and Dorothy Vogel, the retired postal clerk and retired librarian who amassed a world-class art collection and donated it to the National Gallery in Washington. The couple live in a rent-controlled Manhattan apartment that, at least in part, is thought to have given them the financial freedom to pursue their passion for paintings.
Mr. Gilbert has argued that such an example is a gross misuse of rent control because it is meant to provide the poor and middle class with affordable housing -- not make them Medicis. He added that the Vogels' situation drew little criticism because they donated much of the proceeds of their lifetime rent subsidy to the public rather than frittering it away on sports cars, fur coats or second homes in the Hamptons.
The Vogels declined to be interviewed, except about art. The Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which keeps records about tenants who live in rent-regulated apartments, would not release any information about the Vogels' rent and the size and location of their apartment.
Many tenants lucky enough to live in rent-regulated apartments insist that the system, while helping them, also helps the city by keeping them from fleeing for the suburbs.
Catherine Saxton, for example, has been living in a six-and-a-half-room duplex apartment with a garden on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for the last 18 years. The monthly rent started at $350 and now is $650.
"The only reason I have been able to do what I have done -- run a business, meet a payroll -- is because I have a rent-controlled apartment," said Ms. Saxton, who owns a public relations firm and lives alone. "I feel sorry for the people above me. They pay two to three times as much."
Regulation supporters also note that the median annual income for households in rent-controlled apartments in 1986, the last year for which figures are available, was $10,182. For rent-stabilized units, the median income was $17,000 in pre-1947 buildings and $24,400 in post-1947 buildings.
"ThE profile of rent-regulated tenants is, from our point of view, working people, elderly and poor," Mr. McKee said. "The myth about the major beneficiaries being upper-income white Manhattanites is a vicious effort by the real estate lobby to misrepresent who lives in rent-regulated apartments."
Opponents of regulation, though, said that most of the high-end rent-regulated and rent-stabilized apartments -- those 72,000 units that rent for more than $750 a month -- are occupied not by low-income families seeking affordable housing but by one- and two-person households that have a median annual income of $47,000.
"You have plenty of housing in New York, but you have the wrong people living there," Mr. Gilbert said.
One of the strongest supporters of rent regulation, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, would not say if she would back a means test or any form of decontrol, even if the vacancy rate rose above 5 percent.
"People point out the inconsistencies and irrationalities in the system, and I think they need looking at," she said. "But you can only raise questions about the city rent-regulation program in the proper context and that is affordable housing. Until we have the systems and procedures in place for affordable housing, there is likely to be very little change."
Rent-regulation opponents, however, counter that such sentiments are merely a smoke screen designed to keep the system in place.
"The obstacles to radical change are merely political -- no one wants to offend rent-controlled and stabilized tenants," said Robert Cicchillo, of the Alexander Brett real estate management company in Manhattan. "But the current economic climate and the general realization that rent control has not helped those it was intended to help suggest that changes could take place very quickly."

HEADLINE: Tsongas Departure Changes the Game For State's Moment In the Political Sun

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
THE state's Democratic Presidential primary campaign changed abruptly last week, leaving supporters of Paul E. Tsongas, the former Massachusetts Senator, adrift and available to be courted all over again by the remaining candidates.
Mr. Tsongas, a native of Lowell, Mass., had been heavily favored at one time to win the Connecticut primary on Tuesday. But he dropped out of the race on Thursday, saying his campaign was running out of money. 
 Mr. Tsongas's announcement left an unknown but certainly large proportion of the state's 654,532 registered Democrats, who may have stopped listening to the other candidates, starved for information. Democrats are now left to choose between Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the party's clear front-runner, and Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former California Governor, who attracted large numbers of disaffected, angry working-class votes in the primaries in Michigan and Illinois, when Mr. Tsongas was still in the race. Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton had announced ambitious campaign schedules in Connecticut even before Mr. Tsongas's departure.
Mr. Tsongas may get a large number of votes in the primary despite his withdrawal. Because he dropped out too late to have his name removed from the ballot, residents will still be able to vote for him, and some of his supporters will be working precisely toward that end. Delegates pledged to Mr. Tsongas in the primary would go uncommitted to the Democratic convention in Manhattan this summer. Other names on the Democratic ballot include Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, both of whom abandoned their campaigns for the Presidency. For the remaining candidates, the task changed overnight. Mr. Clinton, who had sought to challenge Mr. Tsongas in the New Englander's own backyard, became the Connecticut front-runner who had to watch out for a challenge by Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown, meanwhile, was given an opportunity to cast himself as the sole alternative to Mr. Clinton, who is now considered the almost certain Democratic nominee because of his previous victories in primaries around the country.
"The choice is between business as usual and real change," Mr. Brown said.
But even if the game has changed, the backdrop and the issues -- especially the state's battered economy -- have not. In 1988, when Connecticut last stepped into the brief national spotlight of a Presidential primary, the economy was flush, and the state was viewed as a ripe source of campaign contributions. George Bush, then the Vice President, called Connecticut a sterling example of the fruits of economic growth that Republican policies had fostered.
Since the recession began in 1989, the state's residents have seen home prices fall with the health of the construction industry. Homelessness, unemployment and business failures have all soared, and uncertainty about job security has become the angst of the hour.
"People in the state of Connecticut are looking to government for answers," said the state Democratic Party chairman, Edward L. Marcus. In 1988 "things were acceptable to people economically," Mr. Marcus said. "Now they're totally unacceptable. There's anger and there's disappointment."
But upon whom do the voters take the anger out? Do the men bringing their presidential ambitions to the state this week offer real solutions for Connecticut?
Is it better to stay the course with a vote for President Bush or embrace the middle-class tax cut proposals favored by Mr. Clinton? Would the so-called peace dividend from cutbacks in military spending be better used to fuel investment in industry or to encourage private consumption that could stimulate the economy?
And then there is the even trickier question, which candidate do the voters believe? "I'm tired of the promises, the promises, the promises," said Angelo Brown, a Hartford resident who confronted Mr. Tsongas at a campaign stop at the Polish National Home in the city on Wednesday. "What makes you so different?"
 
'No Prince Charming Out There'
 But other residents said they were pleased just to be able to vent some steam at the candidates and said Connecticut was still getting at least an airing of the issues.
"There's no Prince Charming out there this year, but I think we are getting a good discussion of the issues," said Ernest Kulka, a Torrington Democrat who said he was uncommitted but leaning toward a vote for Mr. Brown, "because he's more radical."
Mr. Clinton has centered his campaign around what he calls "the forgotten middle class." He would push for an immediate 10 percent income tax cut. And to help states like Connecticut make the transition from the cold war economy, he outlined a four-point plan that he said would help workers, companies and communities make the adjustment, through training and assistance programs.
"For 10 years, the middle class has declined, poverty has exploded, and only the rich are doing better," Mr. Clinton says in his campaign literature. "Together we can take our country back."
 
Protest Among Republicans
 Mr. Brown also favors cutting taxes, but he has also pledged to "move off the backlog every single public works project in America to put people to work." He would also reduce foreign aid and invest the money in improving the economy.
President Bush, who is not campaigning actively in the state, outlined his economic proposals in his budget plans announced in January. They include cutting the capital gains tax rate and raising the personal tax exemption for middle-income families with children to $500 for each child.
Neither of the President's rivals on the ballot, Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, or David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, has actively campaigned in the state and have no organizations here. Because the other contenders have not sought votes, any votes for Republican other than Mr. Bush could be viewed as a protest.
"The higher the protest vote, the more that people are looking for a change, almost any change," said Robert G. Jaekle, a former Republican leader of the State House of Representatives who is seeking the Republican nomination to challenge United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd in November. "But I don't see it as much anti-Republican or anti-Democrat as anti-incumbent."
The measures of what might constitute a no-confidence vote for Mr. Bush also vary greatly. Mr. Marcus at the State Democratic Party said that given Mr. Buchanan's low profile in the state and Mr. Bush's historic popularity and family ties, anything higher than 15 percent against the President would constitute "a defeat." The President grew up in Greenwich and his father, Prescott Bush, was a United States Senator from Connecticut from 1952 to 1963.
 
Looking at the Turnout
 The state's Republican Party chairman, Richard Foley Jr., said that localized votes against the President will be the thing to watch.
"If Buchanan is getting a 20 percent statewide average, and in some areas he's getting 40, it's time to take a look," Mr. Foley said.
Political leaders said that one of the other factors to watch would be the turnout. In 1988, 36.8 percent of the 660,848 people listed as registered Democrats in the state came out to vote. (Michael S. Dukakis, then the Governor of Massachusetts, won; the Rev. Jesse Jackson came in second.) Republicans only saw a 23.8 percent turnout out of 439,053 registered party members, with Mr. Bush receiving more than 70 percent of the votes.
Most politicians in the state say the turnout could be even lower this year, perhaps below 20 percent in both parties. But much, as always, is decided in the final days, as candidates succeed or fail in sparking voters' imaginations.
The polls will be open from 6 A.M. to 8 P.M. on Tuesday. At stake are 53 Democratic and 35 Republican delegates.
Because no other state has a Presidential primary this week, the eyes of the nation will be on Connecticut.
"The fact that it's a stand-alone primary guarantees it its 15 minutes of fame," said Mr. Foley.

Calculating Co-op Tax
 
Question: We are a small 16-unit co-op. As a non-profit corporation we have a small interest-bearing savings account and an account that holds maintenance money to cover the cost of repairs. If there is no money in our account at the close of our fiscal year can we avoid incurring either Federal or state tax obligations? . . . Isabel Hall, Jackson Heights, Queens
 
Answer: No. Your tax liability would have less to do with the balance in your accounts at the end of the year than with how the income was earned. Robert Kobel, a spokesman for the New York office of the Internal Revenue Service, said Federal tax rules give residential co-ops options in calculating their income taxes. As a corporate entity you could elect to be taxed as a regular corporation according to a graduated scale based on income. Using this formula for calculating your taxes would require that you file forms 1120 or 112A.
I.R.S. rules give co-ops the ability to exempt certain types of income like shareholders' maintenance from their taxable income. However, other income, such as rent from any commercial space, fees from building concessions or interest earned on savings accounts or investments, would be taxed at a flat 30 percent rate. A co-op taking these deductions would file using Form 1120H.
New York state tax policy follows the Federal rules in what it allows co-ops to deduct for unrelated business income. The basic corporate tax rate in New York state is 8 percent on taxable income under $290,000 and 9 percent for income above that level. But the taxable income of most co-ops is so small that the majority end up paying only the minimum flat tax required of all corporations, which is $325.
Currently in effect is a 10 percent temporary surcharge for tax years ending between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1993, as well as a 15 percent Metropolitan Transportation Business surcharge that would apply to co-ops in the M.T.A.'s 12-county commuter region.
More information on New York State tax rules is available by calling 1-800-225-5829.
 
Breaking a Lease
 
Question: I am 23-year-old person in-between jobs. In an effort to cut down on expenses, I have considered finding a cheaper place to live. My lease runs for several more months. Would I face monetary penalties if I moved out? . . . Kevin Curton, Stamford, Conn.
 
Answer: Not penalties, but the laws that govern residential leases in Connecticut make tenants responsible for the rent, during the term of their leases, until the landlord finds a new tenant. However, Victor Feigenbaum, the attorney who is in charge of the Housing Session in Connecticut State Court, said that in this situation a landlord has the obligation to mitigate the tenant's losses by making an effort to relet the apartment. The landlord would have to show, for example, that he had advertised the apartment or listed it with an agent.
Some leases have an unemployment escape clause that would release a jobless tenant who moves out from responsibility for the rent, but they are rare. Nevertheless, you should check your lease for such a clause.
 
SCRIE Eligibility
 
Question: I am 67 years old and retired and living on a limited income. I have lived for more than 25 years in an apartment in a two-family house. Do I qualify for the city's Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption program? . . . Eugene Myer, Bayside, Queens
 
Answer: No. According to Roz Post, a spokesman for Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the program is limited to tenants in rent-controlled, rent- stabilized and Mitchell-Lama apartments. Tenants in two-family houses are not covered.
However, you might qualify for assistance under the Section 8 program, a Federal rent-subsidy program. In order to take advantage of it, your landlord would have to agree to participate. If he does, your rent could be reduced to no more than 30 percent of your income. For more information on Section 8 eligibility call 212-306-3000.

HEADLINE: Volunteers Offer Worldwide Advice

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
THREE days a week, Charlie Bevis of Westport drives 30 miles round trip to the world headquarters of the International Executive Service Corps in Stamford, where he puts in a full day of work on various global communications projects.
On two occasions, Mr. Bevis also has spent time on extended assignments for the corps in Belize and Costa Rica, helping improve and expand television operations. The Central American assignments, like his work at the corps' headquarters, entails a great deal of creativity and responsibility. Yet, since joining the service corps four years ago, Mr. Bevis has received no pay. Nor have any of the 41 other executive volunteers at the group's headquarters in the South End of Stamford, including 17 who, like Mr. Bevis, have worked on projects abroad. 
 Most of the volunteers live in Fairfield County, as do 17 salaried executives of the organization, including Thomas S. Carroll of New Canaan, the president and chief executive, who previously held the same titles with Lever Brothers.
 
Expertise Around the World
 Of all the diverse companies that have established their headquarters in Stamford in the last two decades, the International Executive Service Corps may well be the oddest. Not only is it staffed with a large number of highly successful retired executives who volunteer their time, but it includes a "skills bank" of more than 12,000 other retired executives throughout the country, many of whom have worked on some of the 14,000 advisory projects undertaken by the organization in 101 countries.
Determined to stay active after a successful career in a variety of fields, the retired executives are imparting their expertise in countries throughout the world, mainly in less-developed nations. Most of the volunteers are in their 60's and 70's. Kaj Osterfeld, a financial management executive from River Edge, N.J., who worked on more than 20 of the corps' projects overseas, stayed active until he was 84 years old.
Men predominate among the volunteers, although in recent years more and more women have joined the organization, which is financed by the United States Agency for International Development, American corporations and foundations, and overseas clients and governments.
The volunteer executives said they enjoyed the work, even though they receive only travel and living expenses for themselves and their spouses while they are abroad and only mileage and lunch money when working at the Stamford headquarters.
"It's a challenge, and I like challenges," said Mr. Bevis, 75, a former vice president for the National Broadcasting Company who runs his own advertising and public relations company out of his Westport home. "American business has been very good to me and has taught me a lot. If I can share my expertise and help other countries save money in a time of debt financing, it is very satisfying."
"Giving money to other countries in itself is not always the answer," Mr. Bevis said in an interview at the Stamford headquarters. "Sharing knowledge can be just as important, and sometimes even more so. By doing what we do overseas, we also project an image of America that is good. For too many years, Americans went abroad and took and took from other countries, leaving many of them barren. Now we at I.E.S.C. have he opportunity to give something back. Besides all that, staying active with I.E.S.C. keeps me going and out of a rocking chair."
 
TV Station in Belize
 During a two-week assignment in Belize in 1990, Mr. Bevis, who was with NBC for 30 years, helped establish a new program schedule for a television station there and aided in the start of transmitting and receiving programs by satellite.
In Costa Rica, where Mr. Bevis and his wife, Connie, spent three months in the fall of 1990, he analyzed the operations of the main television station and then made suggestions and demonstrated new techniques, which he said were eventually adopted.
"For one thing, I noticed that the anchor men all wore dark suits and were very somber," Mr. Bevis said. "I suggested that they lighten up and even laugh occasionally. And I recommended that they wear brighter clothing, more like what typical Costa Rican business people wear."
He said the Costa Ricans welcomed his suggestions about their on-camera demeanor and clothing. "It made a big difference," he said. "They also appreciated some other suggestions, like the one I made that they use a helicopter in covering a road race."
Like many spouses of volunteer executivesabroad, Mrs. Bevis found a volunteer job on her own in Costa Rica, working in a library. A number of wives, like Berni Walter of Southbury, have taught English overseas. During tours in Indonesia and Bulgaria, Mrs. Walter, a former preschool teacher in Wilton, taught English to adults, and in the Philippines she worked with children at a day-care center. Following a month in Bulgaria with her husband, Dawes, last fall, Mrs. Walter wrote an orientation manual for future volunteers in that country.
 
5 Projects in 7 Years
 Mr. Walter, a 66-year-old retired oil company executive with a background in marketing and government relations, has worked on five overseas projects in the last seven years. They have included helping decentralize the Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines during the final days of the Marcos Government in 1985, designing a career planning and placement center at Trisakti University in Indonesia that now serves as a model for other universities in the country, visiting seven universities in Thailand to determine what kind of management assistance they need to strengthen the country's university system and helping establish a nonprofit political analysis center in Bulgaria to ease the transition to democracy.
"I regard my work as a give-back to the national interest of our country," said Mr. Walter, who was a vice president of the University of Bridgeport from 1981 to 1984 after he retired from the oil business. "My wife and I have met some marvelous people from I.E.S.C. during our trips abroad, and we've been able to have a lot of fun and make a lot of friends. And the management of I.E.S.C. is absolutely inspiring. Through our work, I feel that we've become part of an international family."
At the age of 67, when many former business executives tend to restrict trips abroad to pleasure, Frank Barch of Norwalk expects to spend several months in Uruguay and Brazil on volunteer projects this year. A retired operations executive for the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, Mr. Barch has been on assignments for the corps in eight countries in the last seven years.
 
Stock Exchange in Botswana
 In Poland last November, Mr. Barch advised a company that had just been made a private business how to compete in international markets. During previous assignments, he showed a company in Thailand how to improve the quality of diesel engines it was producing, taught workers in El Salvador how to manufacture bicycles to meet international standards (many of the bicycles are now being exported to Spain, Italy and the United States), and taught workers at a Portuguese plant how to increase the production of gym shoes by 22 percent.
"The experiences have been broadening and challenging," Mr. Barch said. "Also, it's been both stimulating and fun."
Many of the executives became involved after friends told them about the organization. One is William McIntire, a retired investment banker who is serving his second term as the Treasurer in Darien, where he lives with his wife, Patricia. During three assignments in Africa, Mr. McIntire has helped establish a stock exchange in Botswana, advised officials in Zimbabwe on ways to stimulate manufacturers to produce more goods and aided in developing a capital market in Losotho.
Some of the retired executives' wives have also served as volunteer workers at the group's headquarters. Both John Jinishian and his wife, Lucy, who live in Old Greenwich, spend two days a week at the Stamford offices. Mr. Jinishian, who retired in 1983 as a vice president of Champion International, has worked on projects in Honduras and Costa Rica and is a volunteer recruiter. Mrs. Jinishian, who taught English to adults in Honduras during her husband's assignment, assists volunteers and their wives when they return home.
Another Connecticut couple, Martha and Lawrence Aasen of Westport, are both volunteers with the organization, specializing in public relations, and have worked together on projects in Guatemala and Botswana. In addition, Mrs. Aasen, a former public information officer at the United Nations, spends two days a week at headquarters as an executive recruiter.
"We're both idealists, and we love to travel," said Mr. Aasen who also does some freelance public relations at home. "And we feel we're doing some good."
Mrs. Aasen added, "With us, they're getting two for the price of one."

HEADLINE: Investors Seek Scraps Of Real Estate Empire

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
ON July 12, 1991, Jonathan Googel and Benjamin Sisti sat before a hostile audience in an auditorium at the University of Hartford, taking questions from creditors of their bankrupt company, Colonial Realty. The meeting was led by Hal M. Hirsch, a trustee appointed by a Federal judge to take over Colonial's affairs.
Creditors charged that the company was either an outright fraud or one of the worst-managed businesses ever patched together. Accountants said they could not separate Colonial's finances from those of Mr. Googel, Mr. Sisti and the scores of investment partnerships they had created. 
 After the two partners refused to answer Mr. Hirsch's questions about who had been in charge at Colonial, the trustee listened impatiently as a lawyer for workers at the Summit Hotel, which Colonial had closed in 1990, asked Mr. Googel about a meeting with members of the workers' union.
 
'That Was Worth It'
 Had Mr. Googel attended as a general partner of Colonial Realty? As a general partner of one of his partnerships, Colonial Constitution? In some other capacity?
"On behalf of what entity did you attend the meeting?" the lawyer asked.
Mr. Googel hesitated. Finally he replied, "I don't know what entity I was that day."
"That was worth it," Mr. Hirsch said with satisfaction.
Colonial Realty, based in West Hartford, collapsed in 1990, when Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti ran out of investors willing to buy $50,000 shares in their real estate partnerships, and they could no longer find banks willing to lend to them. By the time the company was forced into bankruptcy, as many as 6,000 people had invested a total of $350 million, and banks had lent hundreds of millions more.
The collapse has spawned thousands of lawsuits, as lenders and investors fight to cut their losses at each other's expense. There is little left to Colonial itself. Last fall its office furniture and other equipment were auctioned, and its interests in 29 real estate partnerships are to be sold next month.
As Colonial's bankruptcy case moves toward its unhappy resolution, however, thousands of Connecticut residents are grappling with the knowledge that they invested large sums in something that, under intense examination, seems hardly to have existed at all. "Colonial Realty really owned nothing -- nothing," said Mark Shipman, a lawyer in Hartford who represented Colonial in bankruptcy until the trustee was appointed. "It was a property manager at the will of the general partners. But they looked at Colonial as something that was much larger and more defined."
So did the investors. John R. Gorman, a lawyer in New Haven who represents investors, said: "If there is a common psychological aspect to this, it is that people beat up on themselves. It's absolutely astounding that people could be the victim of misrepresentation, forgery and fraud and still beat up on themselves."
Within weeks of Colonial's bankruptcy in September 1990, it was evident that Mr. Googel was hardly alone in his confusion over Colonial's many entities. As accountants dug into financial records, they saw that Colonial was little more than an enormous pyramid of debt with almost no assets of its own.
If investors were counting on the personal guarantees offered by Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti, who had represented their worth at more than $75 million apiece, the partners' wealth was nearly irrelevant. They and their creation, Colonial, owed $1.4 billion.
Colonial was unlike many other large real estate syndicators that collapsed at the end of the 1980's, because there was fraud within the company. Its chief financial officer, Frank Shuch, was facing charges of embezzling $6 million when he killed himself on Feb. 11. Lawsuits charge that Colonial falsified financial statements to obtain loans that, in some cases, were secured by forging investors' names to promissory notes.
 
Hopes of Rising Prices
 Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti, the subjects of investigations by the F.B.I. and Internal Revenue Service, blamed Mr. Shuch for the fraud before they stopped discussing Colonial publicly.
But economists and other experts say Colonial was in many ways a common phenomenon of its time, a rank real estate speculation, if not a deliberate Ponzi scheme, that could stay afloat only as long as people believed that the real estate boom of the mid-80's would last forever.
As long as real estate prices kept rising, they say, the actual value of property almost did not matter. Colonial could pay too much for properties, borrow too much on them, take too much of investors' capital in fees and still promise big returns based on 10 more years of rising prices.
Banks lent freely, because they made their profits on lending fees, rather than the properties, while a rising market covered any short-term losses.
"The banks were falling all over themselves to lend them money," Mr. Shipman said. "They were competing, saying, please, take their money.
"You didn't have lending officers in banks. You had salesmen, and their product was money."
 
In the Business of Borrowing
 Individuals were willing to invest, because they saw fortunes rising all around them, as surging prices for houses and other real estate created an estimated $1.5 trillion in new wealth in the Northeast, said Karl E. Case, a professor of economics at Wellesley College. "We began to behave as if we really had that wealth," he said.
Colonial and its partners, however, created deals that could be propped up only with loans and fees taken from new deals, even in a healthy market. Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti were not developers; they were in the business of borrowing money to buy property to resell to others. The falling real estate market that began taking a toll on developers and bankers in 1989 did not cause its collapse, but magnified its cost.
In their last partnership, for example, to syndicate Constitution Plaza, an office complex in downtown Hartford, the prospectus shows that Mr. Googel and Mr. Sisti set out to raise $169 million in mortgages and investors' shares on a property for which they paid $94.5 million. With the plaza's buildings now valued at less than $70 million, $100 million has evaporated in a single deal.
"The simple fact is that we had inflated values that went away, and somebody has to bear that cost," Mr. Case said.
Some people did make money on Colonial's deals, starting with those who sold properties to the partnerships, like the Travelers Companies, which sold Constitution Plaza, and the United Technologies Corporation, which sold the Gold Building, on Main Street in Hartford, which houses its headquarters.
"It's a game of musical chairs," said John Clapp, a professor at the University of Connecticut Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Affairs in Storrs. "The money goes into a round of buying and selling, and the last person to buy is left standing, holding the bag."
 
Emphasized Big Payoffs
 The final tragedy of Colonial is that those left holding some of the heaviest bags, the individuals who invested in Colonial partnerships from 1986 on, are almost the only people who actually expected to make money on real estate. Court papers show that Colonial's partners took as much as $100 million from loans and commissions. Banks took their profits from lending fees. Until Federal tax changes in 1986, even Colonial's investors did not buy shares expecting the deals to make a profit; the investments were tax shelters that paid off immediately in tax writeoffs.
It was only after 1986, as Colonial put together more and larger deals, that its sales force emphasized big payoffs to attract thousands of middle-class people. Many were persuaded to invest by friends, accountants or lawyers, who may have been paid commissions by Colonial.
Most didn't have the assets to qualify as limited partners, but they were never told that securities laws required a means test. Instead, they have found that Colonial employees altered, or forged, their financial statements to show net worths above the required $1 million. Many of the investors now are being sued by banks that want to collect on Colonial's promissory notes.
"It's hard for people now, who feel they got swindled, to recognize that in the early deals people never expected to make money," said Mr. Shipman, an investor in one early partnership.

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
IT is a hell as ferocious as in any city. Nearly everything has been leveled, and the unholy ground has been left fallow for so long that the ailanthus trees grow 25 feet high. The sidewalks have been pummeled to dust; the street is just strips of jagged asphalt.
Only three buildings stand on the block. One has been almost totally consumed by fire. One is empty but for the old couple who have lived there for 45 years but who never come out. 
 Only the last one, a flimsy three-story wood frame building of the type that has fed fires all over Newark, is filled with desperate families who lock themselves in at night and keep their window shades drawn.
It has a name -- Chester Street, between Broadway and McCarter Highway in the rag-tag frontier of Newark's North Ward. But to the people of El Templo Candelero, it is the promised land.
"We could have built somewhere else but we decided to build here," said Victor M. Capeles, turning in the frigid March night to embrace all that he can see on Chester Street. "Our purpose is to help people and the community, not run away from neighborhoods like this."
Mr. Capeles is administrator of an unusual group of Puerto Rican-born Americans in Newark, a city where those who speak Spanish have long been at the bottom of the economic and political totem pole. Roughly 70 people -- old women, young men, children and parents -- who believe they are Jewish in spirit have purchased five city lots on Chester Street and are building the first temple in Newark in more than 50 years.
While few Jews live in Newark today, for many years they were one of the city's most prominent and powerful groups. At the turn of the century, their enclave around Prince Street in the Central Ward teemed with the same outburst of immigrant life as Hester Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side.
Their heyday came in the 1930's, when their neat homes and sturdy synagogues covered most of the Clinton Hill and Weequahic sections of the city. High Street -- now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard -- was a Jewish Fifth Avenue, lined with mansions and imposing institutional buildings that bespoke a people who understood community.
Nearly all of that is gone now; all but one of the synagogues are closed. For many reasons not unique to them, the most successful Jews started leaving Newark right after World War II and moving into expanding suburbs like West Orange and Livingston. Then, after the summer of 1967, when race riots turned Newark into a cauldron of hate and fear, the flight became an exodus.
It is one of the delicious contradictions of urban life that in that same troubled year of 1967 the Templo Candelero -- Temple Menorah -- was established in a three-story building on lower Park Avenue, not far from Barringer High School and Sacred Heart Cathedral.
The ground-floor space that had once held a store was fitted with a tabernacle and a menorah and the sacred ancient writings of the Old Testament, especially the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.
The congregation celebrates Passover, observes the Jewish calendar, keeps the same dietary ban on shellfish, pork and other items listed in Leviticus, sings in Hebrew during ceremonies, even dances the same spirited Jewish dances during celebrations.
But it has never been recognized by any official Jewish organization because the members believe that a Messiah -- Yahshua -- has already come, and He was Jesus.
For 25 years the congregation grew. Last year it decided it was time to build a real temple. Most of the members had been born in Puerto Rico, where the Congregation of Yahweh -- as the religious movement is known -- was begun in 1939, although most were not converted from their native Catholicism or Pentecostalism until they lived in Newark. They spoke English poorly and worked at modest jobs in factories and warehouses. They lived all over Newark.
The leader of the congregation is Jorge Rivera, who is called pastor, not rabbi. He said the members of the congregation had considered many sites in many different neighborhoods, but it became clear once they saw the available land on Chester Street that it was the place for them to send down roots.
They bought five city lots for $50,000, which is some indication of how little anyone else thought of the area. Even some of the members thought building there was a crazy idea.
"I told them, 'Where do you want to go, the suburbs?' " the pastor said. "Who are you going to preach to there? We've got to be in the city where the bums and the drug addicts are so they can see."'
The five lots had been vacant for more than 15 years. A blocklong automobile junkyard is right behind them, and the street was so deserted that it became a favorite place for prostitutes to bring their customers.
A few months ago, the bulldozers came in and cleared the garbage. The ailanthus trees were cut. A foundation was poured, and cinder block walls began to rise on a 50-foot-by-80-foot contemporary-style temple with a tall peaked roof. In an architect's rendering, a hugh menorah embellishes the facade, facing Chester Street.
Getting together the money for such an undertaking wasn't easy. The congregation had $20,000 in its account when work began. It solicited contributions and held auctions and sales to raise more.
The main temple in Paterson, with which Temple Menorah is associated, provided $45,000. Now the pastor and Mr. Capeles are negotiating with the Valley National Bank for a construction loan to complete the project.
Although the night was frigid, the pastor walked hatless and quite proud in front of the construction site. The steel frame rising out of the ground amid so much neglect and ruin might have been taken for an apparition.
"It is our hope, and our faith, that we will be finished by July," he said.
Hope and faith. The emergency survival kit of any city, but an absolute necessity for surviving in a place that has been through as much as Newark in the last 25 years.
The greatest tragedy in Newark came after the riots, when there seemed to be almost no hope there. Everyone had walked away -- from Chester Street and from whole painfully wounded neighborhoods in the city.
Things are different now, in some ways at least. Evidence of this comes when Mr. Capeles goes to City Hall to ask about the many other empty lots on Chester Street, planning at some point to build a day-care center and perhaps some affordable housing for members of the temple and for other poor people in the city.
He is told that he will have to wait until the next auction, when Newark will sell property to the highest bidder. There was a time when the city couldn't give away land.
Mr. Capeles and the pastor are humble men with strong faith, and that makes them bold. Bold enough to believe that what they do on this desolate corner of a big city can change things to such an extent that other people will notice and be changed too.
"Sometimes what people really need is a push from someone else," Mr. Capeles said. "They're afraid to go ahead and walk the first step. It's going to give a push to the whole North Ward when people see the difference we made here."
It just might.

HEADLINE: Den Fujita, Japan's Mr. Joint-Venture

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The first thing you need to know about Den Fujita is that he is the man who made the hamburger a Japanese icon.
In the 21 years since he launched the fast-food phenomenon here in a 50-50 venture with the McDonald's Corporation, Mr. Fujita has so saturated Japan with golden arches that they often seem etched in the popular imagination as deeply as the Imperial chrysanthemum. Many young Japanese would be surprised to learn that the Bi-gu Ma-ku was not invented on the Ginza. 
 This canny entrepreneur has also taken on the traditional notion that Japan is and should remain a nation of small shopkeepers. While American trade negotiators launched a frontal assault, he quietly pressed the Government to ease laws that had made it next to impossible to build large-scale stores. That cleared the way for what is regarded as one of the most promising new retail chains in Japan, Toys "R" Us, in which his business owns a 20 percent stake.
He has brought beef patties and french fries to people who were said to prefer rice. He introduced large-scale discounting to people who supposedly wanted only cozy but high-priced neighborhood shops. In a nation whose economic vigor comes from its exporting prowess, Mr. Fujita is a master importer. In a land of conformists, this virtuoso of self-advertisement is a classic contrarian.
While the Japanese are constantly urged to sacrifice for the collective good, he loudly declares himself a prophet of the cult of money -- a creed he has developed in a series of best- selling books in which he explains, in all seriousness, that he learned his business methods by observing the tactics "the Jews" use to exercise secret control over the world.
The 66-year-old Mr. Fujita, whose fortune is estimated by some at more than $1 billion, has prospered by taking the most un-Japanese ideas and products and making the Japanese love them. That is why even with his curious and some would say insulting philosophy, he is probably the most sought after joint-venture partner for American and European companies trying to make their way in this complex market. His latest joint venture: a deal with Blockbuster Video to develop a chain of 15 rental stores. Three have already opened.
"When I began to describe my views, some people said, 'This is just propaganda,' " the loquacious Mr. Fujita commented during an interview in his 44th-floor office here, decorated with rows of safety helmets because of an obsession with earthquakes. "They don't say that now."
 
A Message for Gaijin
 But there is a subtler reason for the remarkable success this unusual man has achieved, which carries an important message for foreigners trying to do business in Japan, or simply trying to gain a fresh perspective on the sometimes obscure soul of a country that can be as full of contradictions as Mr. Fujita.
Behind his philosophical ramblings and contemptuous remarks about the colorless Japanese business establishment -- he calls its leaders "scrap iron" -- is a lesson in how much change is really taking place under the surface of Japan's economy, and how one can seize the new opportunities. He has thrived not so much by overthrowing the system, but by seeing through many of the outdated myths the Japanese spread about themselves and turning them to his advantage.
Mr. Fujita has also long recognized that the accepted wisdom, even if it is wrong, limits the competition, since so few here are willing to go against the grain. Indeed, beyond the wacky claims -- Mr. Fujita says he believes Osakan businessmen are craftier than those from Tokyo because Jews settled in Osaka about 1,000 years ago, and that the Japanese will become blond if they eat enough hamburgers -- is a bottom-line manager who has found a way to open a seemingly closed system to outside influences.
"In business, the only justice is winning," Mr. Fujita has written. "There is neither clean money nor dirty money. In a capitalistic society, all methods of making money are acceptable."
His foreign business partners generally say they have embraced him because he is so hard-nosed -- and successful. "The truth is that when we came here there were not a lot of people who could maneuver through the bureaucracy," said James R. Cantalupo, president of McDonald's International. "He really knew how to do that. His rare quality is that he can bridge the two cultures."
Asked about Mr. Fujita's odd philosophy, Robert C. Nakasone, vice chairman of New Jersey-based Toys "R" Us, said, "This stuff never seemed to affect his business thinking, frankly. He's very much a pragmatist."
 
Fortunes of War
 There were few signs in Mr. Fujita's privileged youth in Osaka that he would grow to be so different. His father earned a comfortable living as an engineer at a British company. Mr. Fujita went to a prestigious high school and then entered Tokyo University's law department -- the training ground for Japan's government and business elite.
It was around this time that he began to see that change, even under the grimmest of circumstances, offered money-making opportunities. Mr. Fujita said he lost his father and two sisters in American bombing raids. But during the American Occupation, while he was still a university student, he realized that the best wages were being paid to translators working for Japan's former enemies.
His English language skills took him to General MacArthur's headquarters in downtown Tokyo, just across the moat from the Imperial Palace. In 1950, Mr. Fujita stepped off the accepted path for top university graduates and formed his own trading house, Fujita & Company.
Mr. Fujita clearly benefited from the fact that in an economy where most everything was rationed and imports were severely restricted, those who could navigate the barriers enjoyed generally strong demand and little competition. Fujita & Company prospered by importing, among other things, Christian Dior handbags and other women's accessories.
But Mr. Fujita's real break came in 1971, when McDonald's selected him as its partner in Japan. McDonald's wanted a strong entrepreneur who would be completely committed to the hamburger business.
"The Japanese are very hard-working, but very weak, very small and our faces are so pale," Mr. Fujita said without a trace of irony, explaining why he shifted from handbags to french fries. "I thought we had to strengthen ourselves. That's when I thought of beef."
McDonald's learned quickly that once they got past this cosmic reasoning Mr. Fujita was a very practical and stubborn businessman. For example, McDonald's insisted on a suburban setting for the first restaurant -- just like in the United States. Mr. Fujita would hear nothing of it. He insisted on the Ginza, Tokyo's central shopping district. He reasoned that in the context of a country where a love of hamburgers was not a given, a higher profile site was a necessity.
Mr. Fujita won. The Ginza store became one of the world's busiest McDonald's.
McDonald's had trouble lining up franchisees initially, so it kept ownership of most of the restaurants itself, bringing even more profits to Mr. Fujita. Today, only 155 of the 867 shops in Japan are owned by independent franchisees. In the meantime, Mr. Fujita found another way to capitalize on the arrangement. He had the privately held Fujita & Company -- now run by his two sons -- import many of the products McDonald's was using here, from Idaho potatoes to furniture.
What Mr. Fujita did not do was meddle with McDonald's way of making and selling food. The company's manual was imported largely unaltered. A Hanbaga Daigaku (Hamburger University) was set up to train the staff. Other than the Japanese and English on the menus, it was hard to tell the difference between a Japanese or American restaurant -- other than price. A Japanese Big Mac costs 380 yen, or about $2.90 -- inexpensive, given the price of other food; a cheeseburger here is 240 yen, or about $1.80. In Manhattan, a Big Mac is $2.89, a cheeseburger 99 cents.
 
A Man of Influence
 Mr. Fujita's forte was obtaining all the government approvals necessary for running and expanding the business. He brags, in fact, about his political influence, particularly his ties with Michio Watanabe, the current Foreign Minister. Perhaps more important, Mr. Fujita managed the critical issue of finding real estate in a country with some of the most expensive property in the world. Over time he has developed an impressive data base on property across Japan -- an asset that was a particular attraction for his next major partner, Toys "R" Us.
Sales at McDonald's Japan rocketed from 205 million yen that first year to 50 billion yen in 1980 and 207.7 billion yen last year, the equivalent of $1.6 billion. Japan now accounts for nearly 10 percent of McDonald's total sales. Nearly half a billion hamburgers were consumed here last year. McDonald's became Japan's leading restaurant chain in 1982.
"Most people cannot see the future," Mr. Fujita said. "But I am telling you, in 1994 we will make 400 billion yen in revenues. People laugh. You wait. I know how to do it." Sales of Fujita & Company have also zoomed up to 31.7 billion yen in the fiscal year that ended on Feb. 29, from 17.9 billion yen in 1987.
In 1972 Mr. Fujita began his career as a writer. His first book, "The Jewish Way of Doing Business," sold more than 200,000 copies in the first month. The book has been reprinted 63 times, selling more than a million copies. It is a combination autobiography and how-to book that purports to explain the business secrets all Jews know and use.
That was followed by other hits, including, "Stupid People Lose Money," "How to Become Number One in Business," "How to Blow the Rich Man's Bugle Like the Jews Do," and "Using Super-Commonsense in Your Money-Making Strategies." A general theme is that the reader can win wealth and power by emulating the methods used by the great Jews.
"I personally don't pay much attention to that," said Mr. Cantalupo. "You have to put all that in the context of the human being. I have the utmost respect for him as a businessman and he's a pleasure to deal with as a person."
In fact, Mr. Fujita's writings are part of a popular Japanese literary genre. For decades books on supposed Jewish conspiracies have been produced in great numbers in Japan. They generally reflect less on Judaism, about which the authors rarely seem to have a very deep understanding, than on the Japanese themselves. Popular literature often depicts the Japanese as a chosen but embattled people who need to stick together to survive the forces arrayed against them. They identify with the image of the Jews they have produced.
Mr. Fujita insisted that he did not consider it insulting to characterize Jews purely as stereotypes.
"Please don't misunderstand," he said. "I'm trying to do something good for the Jewish people. Most Jewish people speak two or three different languages. They're good at mathematics. The Japanese should learn from that."
Mr. Fujita was catapulted into prominence once again when he agreed to have McDonald's Japan take a 20 percent interest in Toys "R" Us's new Japanese operations. Once again, it was not just another foreign company seeking entry into Japan, but a harbinger of major changes.
 
Skirting Restrictions
 The old laws permitted local merchants to raise a host of objections to the opening of large retail establishments, a kind of veto on competition. It was common for approvals to take 10 years or more. Toys "R" Us decided to challenge the restrictions.
The two problems were attacking the laws and finding a partner. The United States Government began work on the first priority years ago, pressing for changes in trade negotiations. On the second issue, Toys "R" Us, America's largest specialty retailer, pursued Mr. Fujita.
"To be honest with you, we'd followed him and knew about him," said Mr. Nakasone of Toys "R" Us. "He was not only our first choice, but our second, third, fourth, fifth and so on. After our first meeting we felt even more so that he was the right partner. We could see that he was a bit of a maverick. He was not only bilingual, but bicultural. He saw the potential for our business there immediately. He shared our impatience for trying to get it growing."
Mr. Fujita brought to the deal his knowledge of the bureaucracy and, most important, his real estate data base. That has proven valuable to Toys R' Us, which is about to open its third store here.
"This is really a real estate deal, not a retailing deal," said Mike Allen, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities here. "But that does not make it any less important."
Because it has become increasingly difficult to find good sites for new McDonald's restaurants, Mr. Fujita said that as part of his new deal he will be constructing McDonald's at many of the new shopping centers where the Toys "R" Us stores will be located. Each will feed off the traffic created by the other.
Mr. Fujita said he had no immediate plans for new ventures, other than a longstanding desire to purchase a Japanese professional baseball club. But Japanese rules prohibit acquisition of a team by a company with a 50 percent or more foreign interest.
As one might expect, Mr. Fujita is undaunted by the challenge and has already chosen a name for the franchise -- the Bi-gu Ma-kus.
"If you want to understand the way I think, it is this," Mr. Fujita said, gesturing with a finger. "If 80 percent of the people say this is wrong, then you do it. If 80 percent say do it, don't go that way."
 
 
 
CATERING TO RICE LOYALISTS
 One of Den Fujita's concerns has been that McDonald's growth in Japan will level off. So he has constantly tinkered with the menu and considered other measures to maintain strong sales growth, experimenting with such new products as hot dogs, a shrimp burger and fried chicken.
Two years ago, he conducted an extensive survey of customers' desires and discovered that Japanese eating habits had changed dramatically over the past several decades.
"Of the people who eat out in the evenings, 40 percent eat rice, 36 percent eat bread and meat and 24 percent eat noodles," he said. "Before, most people ate rice. So we had really seen a big shift toward meat." More to the point, however, was that MacDonald's was still missing 40 percent of the market -- the rice eaters -- and there were no signs they could be converted to hamburgers.
"I realized that I didn't have to change the whole strategy, but just alter the menu," he said. So McDonald's Japan now features several rice dishes after 5:00 P.M. "If that's where the business is promising, I'll try it," Mr. Fujita said.

 
 
THE UNAPOLOGETIC MEMOIRS OF A 'GINZA JEW'
 Den Fujita's first book "Yudaya no Shoho," or "The Jewish Way of Doing Business," has sold more than a million copies. Some excerpts:
From the time I was small I wanted to be a diplomat. I once told a neighbor who was a diplomat about my aspiration. But he said immediately, "I'm sorry to say, but you won't be accepted. There is an unwritten rule that people who speak Osaka dialect cannot become diplomats."
Just like the Jews, Osaka people are the victims of discrimination, in this case at the hands of people from Tokyo. Just like the G.I.'s I knew, who discriminated against Jews out of fear that the Jews could take away their money, people from Tokyo discriminate against Osakans because they are afraid they cannot compete against Osaka businessmen.
When I was working as an interpreter, I was a student at Tokyo University's law department. Already my father had died and I had to earn my tuition and living expenses. All traditional morals and values seemed to have been destroyed at that time because of Japan's defeat in the war. I had nothing but the fighting spirit of someone from Osaka. We may have lost the war, but I did not want to be beaten by social chaos or hunger or even by G.H.Q. [General Headquarters for the American Occupation Forces]. So I dared to enter the enemy's headquarters for a job.
Business people in and out of Japan call me a "Ginza Jew." I am satisfied with that and even call myself a "Ginza Jew." I am proud of being Japanese, but as a businessman I am happy being known as a Jew. Now Jews from around the world call me a "Ginza Jew," too, and treat me like an insider. They treat me differently than gentiles. The title of "Ginza Jew" is invaluable to me in doing business with Jewish traders who control business life in many countries.
Nonetheless, there is no shortage of examples of how I was laughed at, stepped on and insulted by Jews. But I endured these insults, just like the Jews have endured all their hardships.

In Tokyo's Decline, a Glint of Silver

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Is there any hope for Tokyo? The blue-chip Nikkei index of 225 shares crashed below 20,000 last week and approached 19,457.90, exactly half of what the index was worth at its record high at the end of 1989.
The optimists say the market is down so far that it is poised for a rebound. The Japanese economy is in a slump, but a turnaround should be at hand. The Japanese Government is expected to take actions soon, including cutting official interest rates, to revive the economy and the stock market. 
 But, the pessimists argue, the outlook is even worse than people think because the underpinnings of the economy, like the banking system, are shaky. And the stock market boom at the end of the 1980's happened amid conditions that are not likely to return soon, including very low interest rates.
"The strongest argument for Japan is that it is cheap relative to recent history," said Michael Metz, chief market strategist for Oppenheimer & Company in New York. "But it is fanciful to think that markets are so stable and rational. This will swing to a much more serious undervaluation before it is over."
Given the current gloom in Tokyo, Mr. Metz and other bears sound very convincing these days, but Sander Cseh, who runs his own small investing shop as Cseh International in Berwyn, Pa., is sticking with Japan.
In fact, a month ago he increased his exposure in Japan, bringing the Japanese share of his $55 million portfolio, which is invested entirely outside the United States, up to 29 percent. The fall in the Tokyo market since then has cut the percentage to around 27 percent.
"You are not going to find many people positive on the market at the bottom," he said. "But I think we are close to it." He said he was reassured by the rally on Thursday, when the Nikkei 225 rose 2.1 percent and closed at 20,185.09. The broader Topix index, with 1,222 shares, surged 3.1 percent, to close at 1,451.14. The relatively heavy volume of 550 million shares was also positive, he said. (The stock market was closed on Friday for the vernal equinox holiday.)
Obviously, Mr. Cseh (pronounced SHAY) has not done very well with his Japanese stocks so far. But he takes an approach that shows investors they can minimize their risk in this very volatile market, which on average has had daily moves 50 percent larger than those in the United States over the last 15 months. Through Thursday, Mr. Cseh's Japanese stocks were down 15 percent in dollar terms while the Nikkei index was off 18 percent in dollars. The broader Topix index was down 21 percent.
For starters, Mr. Cseh stays away from the most expensive Japanese stocks. This means stocks that have very high price-to-earnings ratios, for which Japan's market is famous. So he begins by eliminating 60 percent of the stocks in Tokyo. Then he weeds through the 40 percent at the bottom of the price-earnings scale, those that currently have ratios below 34. And here he makes his choices, picking companies that he thinks have better-than-average balance sheets and companies with strong product lines.
Among the stocks he does not have are Japanese banks, which have price-earnings ratios that are seven times those in the United States and Britain.
But Mr. Cseh does end up with stocks that are well known. On his list are Toyota, which has a price-earnings ratio of only 16, and Toshiba, which has a ratio of 26. Fuji Photo, with a ratio of 15, is also on the list.
Among the companies that do most of their business in Japan are Shimizu, a construction company with a rating of 15; Sekisui House, a maker of prefabricated houses, with a 15 price-earnings ratio, and Mabuchi Motors, which manufacturers small motors. It has a 23 ratio.
Over time, with this method he has come out ahead of the Japanese market itself and benchmarks used to measure money managers' performances. His Japanese stocks gained 12.1 percent in 1991, while the Nikkei, in dollars, was up 4.9 percent. In 1990, when markets around the world crashed, his Japanese portfolio fell 21.8 percent compared with a drop of 35.1 percent in the Nikkei.
The Japanese market, as measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index, an important benchmark for portfolio managers, was up 9.1 percent in dollars in 1991 and down 36.3 percent in 1990.
Mr. Cseh's whole portfolio is off 4.5 percent in dollar terms this year through Thursday, in contrast to a drop of 11.5 percent for the comparable Morgan Stanley index for Europe, Australia and the Far East. In 1991 his international portfolio rose 15 percent while the Morgan Stanley index was up 12.1 percent.
Mr. Cseh's performance does not show Toyko is for everyone. But it suggests investing there can be less painful than many people assume.
"The market can go to extremes, so I can be buffeted one more time," he said, acknowledging the deep split with the Tokyo bears. "But I am looking at the second-largest economy in the world and probably the fastest-growing economy of the industrialized countries, and I think that in the long term it is going to be an attractive market."

De Klerk's Mandate Frees South Africa for a New Day 

The new world order made it to South Africa last week when the white minority electorate gave President F. W. de Klerk an overwhelming mandate to end its monopoly on political power. Mr. de Klerk's ruling National Party has been negotiating with other groups, including the African National Congress, headed by Nelson Mandela, to write a new constitution. After a period of transition "it is a foregone conclusion that Mandela will be South Africa's president," said Prakash Sethi, an adviser to a black South African business group. "The transition is likely to be peaceful," he said. South Africa's economy is in shambles from years of sanctions. Though the United States lifted sanctions last year, many states and cities have kept them in place. "The British and Germans who stayed have a large economic base and will increase investment faster than the Americans can get back in," Mr. Sethi said.
 
Japan's Gesture
 
The offer looked generous enough. Japan, which exports cars to the United States under the 1981 Voluntary Restraint Agreement, said last week it would limit the number of cars going to the United States to 1.65 million, down from 2.3 million, the current limit. That gesture, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, would help Detroit's Big Three recover from last year's combined losses of $4.5 billion. But Detroit was skeptical. Since Japan only exported 1.7 million vehicles to the United States last year, its proposal would simply keep the "same volume their auto makers imported into the United States from Japan in 1991," said Harold A. Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company. "So, where is the reduction?" he asked.

No Compromise on Israel

When President Bush rejected Israel's request for loan guarantees last week, he said it was because Israel had refused to stop building settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel wants guarantees so it can borrow $10 billion in the world's capital markets at more favorable rates to build housing for immigrants from the ex-Soviet Union. That is a different matter from settling the West Bank and Gaza, it says. To move beyond the impasse, Congress proposed a compromise. Grant Israel an immediate $1 billion in guarantees, said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, but keep the remaining $9 billion in reserve, subject to Mr. Bush's approval. Mr. Bush said no.
 
A New Export Champ
 
The figures were cheery last week. The trade deficit narrowed to $5.77 billion, a drop of 3.9 percent, the Commerce Department said. But those numbers may actually signal the end of a trend. It takes two years, economists say, for changes in the value of the dollar to affect the balance of trade. Two years ago the dollar started turning up. "From here on out, exports should be petering out," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago.

Losing Money on Herman's
 
Back in 1989, Isosceles P.L.C., the big British buyout firm, snatched up Herman's Sporting Goods when it bought the Gateway Supermarket chain. It made the purchase just in time to see sales drop during the recession. Herman's, which had about $600 million in sales last year, had hefty losses. Last week, Isosceles said it was putting Herman's on the block. "In today's market, I can't imagine they would get $200 million for it," said John Horan, the publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a newsletter based in Glen Mills, Pa. That's half of what Herman's was valued at when Gateway was sold.

Exhausted Honda Executive
 
For the Honda Motor Company it was a big loss. Shoichiro Irimajiri, one of its most important executives, resigned last week. The timing could not have been worse. Honda is in the midst of reorganizing its operations. Mr. Irimajiri, who brought Honda's manufacturing prowess to Marysville, Ohio, and gave its once-stodgy cars a jazzier look "is in a state of such physical and mental exhaustion that he is unable to continue his work," said Shin Tanaka, a company spokesman. "The whole headquarters is in shock," the company said.

What's Slow for Japan . . .
 
Japan is used to loping along at growth rates of 5 percent or more. But last week the Bank of Japan said growth turned negative in the fourth quarter of 1991 -- but barely. Japan's gross national product contracted by 0.2 percent. Over all, growth for the year was still 3.2 percent, slow for the Japanese but a rate the United States still aspires to. "The data indicates growth of just 1 to 2 percent this year," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Macy's Holiday Letdown
 
R.H. Macy & Company slashed prices during last year's holiday season, hoping to raise enough money to keep creditors at bay. The strategy did not work. Sales tumbled and Macy filed in February for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Last week, citing those holiday season write-offs, Macy reported a loss of $671.6 million in its second quarter. In the same period the year before, Macy earned $78 million. About $606 million of the losses resulted from one-time charges. "I think they will have further restructuring charges and, at least in this quarter, their results are likely to be similar to the second quarter," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant. Retail analysts expect to see Macy close more stores.
 
Dow Gives Up Implants
 
Last week the Dow Corning Corporation said it would no longer make silicone-gel breast implants, but would set up a $10 million fund to pay for research and help some women pay to have implants removed. Though it had 30 percent of the market -- 1 percent of its business -- that 1 percent brought most of its recent headaches. The implants have been implicated in a number of health problems.
 
Making a $2 Million Point
 
How much is an idea for a movie that made $350 million worth? Only $150,000, according to judge Harvey A. Schneider of the Los Angeles Superior Court. That is how much he awarded Art Buchwald for an idea that led to Paramount Pictures' "Coming to America," starring Eddie Murphy. "We won the legal case," said Zazi Pope, Mr. Buchwald's lawyer. The victory was not cheap: legal fees were $2.25 million.

Bigger Than a 747
 
The McDonnell Douglas Corporation is rethinking its next commercial plane. Instead of producing the 375-seat MD-12 tri-jet, McDonnell said last week it is looking into a much larger craft. What it has in mind is a 600-seat, four-engine plane that would compete directly with the Boeing 747. "We have said we are looking at alternatives and we have talked to potential airline customers," said John Thom, a spokesman for the company.

Trump's Shrinking Debt
 
In his heyday, Donald Trump bought a lot of snazzy real estate at inflated prices. He paid $409 million for the Plaza Hotel -- all of it borrowed -- which his creditors valued at $260 million. His empire began unraveling two years ago. Last week he agreed to give up 49 percent of the Plaza to a group of banks headed by Citibank; the banks will cancel $125 million of his personally guaranteed debt, plus accrued interest. The deal also offers more favorable terms on the $300 million left on the Plaza's mortgage. In 1990, Mr. Trump was personally liable for $900 million. If this deal goes through, he will owe a mere $115 million.

Colt's in Chapter 11
 
The Colt's Manufacturing Company, whose .45 caliber six-shooter left an indelible impression on the lore of the West, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Colt's, based in Hartford, received a $10 million line of credit from the Connecticut Development Authority and a bank. Colt's lost markets to competitors with more advanced products. Even the Hartford police use Smith & Wesson pistols.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Prices Are Under Control
 
With growth still struggling to get above zero, inflation, at least at the consumer level, remains contained. The Consumer Price Index increased three-tenths of 1 percent in February, the Labor Department said.
 
Which Comes First?
 
It's a case of chicken-and-egg economics. To sustain a recovery, consumers must spend. But before they will, they must have jobs. And companies don't hire until the consumers spend. Too little spending and too little job growth derailed last year's recovery, economists say. Has that changed? "I can't tell you that anyone is suggesting to us that they are in a strong rehiring mode at this moment," said Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. "They are hopeful, but they are also cautious."

An End To Tsongas Economics
 
When Paul E. Tsongas withdrew from the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination last week, he took his lower-capital-gains, no-tax-cuts-for-the-middle-class strategy with him. What's left for the Democrats to debate is far more populist. Gov. Bill Clinton said he would raise taxes on the rich -- those who earn more than $200,000 a year -- and reduce taxes on the middle class. Former Gov. Jerry Brown -- borrowing an idea once espoused by Ronald Reagan -- said he wants to scrap the system in favor of a 13 percent flat tax. But few give Mr. Brown a chance of capturing the nomination.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Weak Europe Could Prevent U.S. Recovery

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
RisinG exports have been one of the few economic success stories for America in the past several years, a sign of "growing U.S. competitiveness in world markets," as Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin put it last week. But now the exports are shrinking, and that fact may endanger the economic recovery.
In January, the Commerce Department reported last week, exports fell for the third straight month, largely because of a fall in shipments of capital equipment used by businesses abroad. The problem does not seem to be American competitiveness, although the stronger dollar is not helping. Foreign economies simply are buying less as they experience their own weakness. 
 Until the recent setbacks, the trade figures had been looking a lot better. With exports rising by 7.8 percent in 1991, the United States moved past Germany to become the world's leading exporter. The trade deficit remains big, but not nearly as large as it used to be.
The fear of some economists is that world markets may soon shrink. In 1991, the total volume of world merchandise trade managed to rise by only 1.5 percent, in contrast to a 13.5 percent gain in 1990. With Germany and much of the European continent in or near recession, with the British downturn dragging on and with Japan's economy looking shakier than it has in years, the prospects for finding buyers for more American exports do not seem bright.
When times are tough, it is common for countries to try to increase exports and cut imports. Obviously, not everybody can do that at the same time, and while economists generally agree that freer trade provides a net benefit for the world, politicians often see it differently. In the 1930's, when the Depression brought on shrinkage of world trade, countries responded with protectionism and competitive devaluation of currencies.
There is a danger that those cycles will be repeated in the current decade, despite the fact that every major government says it is committed to freer trade. The so-called Uruguay Round of world trade talks, which was supposed to reach an agreement a year ago, struggles on. Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, is trying this weekend to persuade President Bush to accept a compromise that could be seen as hurting American farmers. Mr. Kohl's chances of success seem to be slim.
The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that the trade figures are not especially important, especially when there are signs of a consumer-led recovery.
A dissenting view comes from Gert von der Linde, the chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, who notes that in this recession the export sector of the economy has grown to be larger than the combination of housing and autos. He fears the slide in exports will negate other gains and is recommending that investors stay in cash. "We are," he said Friday, "in the early to medium stages of a worldwide recession."

Gridlock at the Chip-to-Microprocessor Intersection

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The push to build ever-faster desktop computers has hit a bottleneck. Microprocessors, the brains of such computers, continue to increase in speed. But like powerful engines that are starved for fuel, these microprocessors are often kept waiting because memory chips, which store information, cannot supply them with data fast enough.
Because of the bottleneck, both semiconductor companies and computer designers are devising faster dynamic random access memories, or D-RAM's, the main type of memory used in computers. They are also devising faster data highways to shuttle information between the microprocessors and the memory. 
 The result, experts say, will be a profusion of new types of D-RAM's in coming years, some tailored for particular processors or particular tasks and all geared for speed. That could represent a big shift in D-RAM technology, which so far has undergone very little basic change in design.
Such developments could also alter the economics of the D-RAM business. Until now, D-RAM's have been the jelly beans of the semiconductor industry, with vendors competing mainly on price. The D-RAM business has become a game for large Japanese and Korean companies that manufacture in huge volumes and can afford to lose money for years. Although it is far from certain, the shift toward faster and more specialized memories might allow profitable niches to develop, where even small American companies might prosper.
This month, Rambus Inc., a Silicon Valley startup company, announced it had developed a fundamental new design for D-RAM's that could increase tenfold the speed with which the memory chips can transfer data to the microprocessor. In an effort to establish its approach as a standard, the Mountain View, Calif., company has licensed its technology to three of Japan's largest chip makers: Fujitsu, NEC and Toshiba.
Other companies are working on similar technologies. And several industry organizations are working on proposed standards for faster D-RAM's and for faster links between memory and the microprocessor.
"Everybody has the problem; so everyone is going to be seeking solutions," said John Moussouris, president of Microunity Systems Engineering of Sunnyvale, Calif., a startup that is working on increasing the "bandwidth" of communications between the microprocessor and other parts of the computer. "What's limiting the speed of digital systems today is not the speed of the transistors but really the speed of the wires, and particularly the speed of the wires that go between chips," he said.
Until now, makers of engineering work stations and high-end personal computers have been coping with the memory bottleneck by storing frequently used information in a smaller "cache" memory made from faster, more expensive chips known as static RAM's. The idea is equivalent to keeping files in a desk drawer rather than back in the main file room.
But S-RAM's make the computer more expensive, and they are tricky to manage. Data must constantly be swapped between the main D-RAM memory and the cache memory to insure that needed information is in the cache memory at the proper time. If the main D-RAM memory were faster, cache memory might be reduced or eliminated and computers could be less expensive. But makers of S-RAM's hope to retain their business by using some of the same speed-enhancing techniques.
A memory chip can be likened to a house with its rooms arranged in rows and columns. Each room contains a single bit of data, either a zero or a one. A megabit chip, which contains more than one million bits of information, has 1,024 rows and 1,024 columns of rooms.
The problem is that the houses have quadrupled in size every few years, so that a house today contains four million rooms compared with only 1,000 rooms two decades ago. Yet the hallways have not been widened commensurately nor has the number of exits increased. Many D-RAM's are still like houses with only one door that is wide enough for only one inhabitant to pass through.
"The D-RAM hasn't changed in its basic configuration since the 4K," said Betty Prince, new-product manager for memories at Texas Instruments. She was alluding to the 4,000-bit memory, introduced in the early 70's.
Meanwhile, microprocessors have been getting faster, owing in part to the development of a technique called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. A microprocessor these days might go knocking on the D-RAM's door for a piece of data every 20-billionths of a second. But it takes at least 50-billionths of a second for the requested data to emerge from the house. Like a boy arriving to pick up his date, the microprocessor is often made to cool its heels.
D-RAM makers have already employed several techniques to speed up the flow of information. One approach has been simply to add another door. The video RAM, a specialized D-RAM used to store information for computer screen displays, is like a house with two doors, said Gene Cloud, vice president of semiconductor marketing at Micron Technology of Boise, Idaho. Information needed by the microprocessor goes out the front door, and information for the screen goes out the back door.
Micron has recently introduced a "triple-port" D-RAM with three doors. Another approach has been to make the door wider, so four, eight or even 16 bits can emerge at once.
In still other cases, all the needed data reside on the same hallway. Once the first room is found, the others can be found and emptied quickly. This technique has been used in what are called page-mode RAM's.
But while these techniques have helped, experts say even-greater increases in speed will be made possible by more fundamental changes in the design of D-RAM's.
Many in the D-RAM business expect that the next big leap will come from what are called synchronous D-RAM's because they operate in lockstep with the microprocessor. Because of this synchronization, the microprocessor knocks on the D-RAM's door only when a bit is ready to come out. The D-RAM is not moving any faster, but the microprocessor does other tasks instead of wasting time in waiting. This results in a sharp increase in computer speed.
Yet another approach is to design a special pathway, known as a bus, to carry bits from the memory to the microprocessor. This is the approach taken by Rambus. Both the memory chips and the microprocessor have to be modified to allow them to spit out data fast enough to use the Rambus pathway. The company said that the special D-RAM's would initially cost 20 to 25 percent more than regular D-RAM's but that the overall cost of the computer might be reduced because less cache memory would be needed.
Many industry experts say that the Rambus approach is clever and that the company is off to a good start by getting three of the largest memory chip makers to incorporate its technology in their memory chips. But some experts say Rambus's technique will be slow to catch on because it requires a complete redesign of computers and because some computer companies might prefer to use the solutions being developed by industry standard-setting groups.
Another question for Rambus and other companies pursuing faster memory technology is whether computer companies will be willing to pay extra for faster D-RAM's. Some experts say that in the past they have been reluctant to do so. "I can guarantee you that most of the industry will vote with their wallet," said Mr. Cloud of Micron.
Speeding up D-RAM's, of course, will not end the quest for faster computers. Something else will then become the bottleneck, the weakest link in the chain.
Indeed, speeding up the memory bandwidth could worsen bottlenecks elsewhere in the computer, said Mr. Moussouris of Microunity Systems. As an analogy, he said, adding exits and entry ramps to speed up traffic on a highway could instead slow down traffic if it causes more cars to bunch together at a narrow spot in the road. "Bandwidth is a discipline that is very unforgiving," he said.

HEADLINE: Keeping the Faith In the Gas Patch

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: THE WOODLANDS, Tex.

 BODY:
This is a cruel season for drillers of natural gas. Depressed prices and revenues have driven hundreds of small, family-owned companies out of business and pushed giants like Mobil, Chevron and ARCO to explore overseas, where costs are lower and big discoveries more likely.
But George P. Mitchell, an iconoclast in the gas patch for more than 40 years, is still at it. Creator of one of the nation's biggest independent producers and processors of natural gas, the Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation, the 71-year-old Mr. Mitchell is laying plans to drill for more gas, not less, near home. He sees the swarming by rivals into South America, Russia and the Middle East as charged with political risks. Computer-enhanced techniques will so bolster the efforts of exploration geologists over the next 10 years, he says, that a dry hole in North America will prove rare in the next century. 
 "We'll give a one-way airline ticket to anybody who wants to go overseas -- to Russia, to Venezuela, or anywhere else," the bald-pated Mr. Mitchell said with a grin. "Leave this country to us. I think the potential of the next 10 years is excellent."
Mr. Mitchell has often taken a divergent path. While other independent gas producers forage in the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico, Mitchell Energy still gets more than 90 percent of gas output from wells in the Southwest. A gas field in Wise County, Tex., northwest of Fort Worth, has been the backbone of his business since he discovered it in 1953. His experimentation with new and unproven technologies has over time allowed Mitchell Energy to tap reserves in these areas that have stymied others -- and at a low cost. And because he has kept control of 63 percent of Mitchell Energy's common shares, valued at about $450 million, he has been able to diversify into areas that might be considered strange by some. For instance, Mitchell Energy owns the 25,000-acre Woodlands development here, 27 miles north of Houston, headquarters to several companies, including Mr. Mitchell's.
Now, he plans to take advantage of the depressed market by snapping up domestic reserves that bigger companies have put on the auction block. Last year, Mitchell Energy paid the Houston-based Enron Corporation more than $11 million to increase its sizable drilling prospects in southeast New Mexico, where it now has 75,000 acres under lease, up from 14,000 in 1989.
Mr. Mitchell's optimism about gas is pegged partly to the hope that the nation will burn more gas as clean-air standards mandated by Congress tighten through the 1990's. Natural gas is cleaner burning than either coal or oil, and cheaper and more abundant in North America than oil.
Then too, Auto plants, steel mills and other fuel-gulping manufacturers have substituted natural gas for fuel oil in the last few years because gas has been cheaper. The biggest potential demand is in the dozens of new electric power plants that the nation will build this decade.
Studies by the National Petroleum Council, a group of oil-industry executives, and the Gas Supply Committee, an industry association, put the nation's potential gas supplies at about 50 years at current consumption rates. And many industry executives and analysts agree with Mr. Mitchell that if prices were to double, to $2.50 or more per 1,000 cubic feet, drilling activity in the United States could triple, multiplying production from existing fields and the finding of new ones.
Prices have remained depressed, and the number of rigs drilling for natural gas is at a 50-year low partly because of a supply glut created by Federal policies that overstimulated gas drilling in the late 70's in hopes of reducing the country's reliance on foreign oil.Other contributors to the glut include improvements in technology that raised drilling success rates, and big companies that produced gas rapidly and regardless of price to generate cash for investing in what they considered brighter foreign projects.
The last decade has been especially brutal for producers in North America, with its aging fields. Even Mr. Mitchell pared his employee count when prices collapsed in 1986. "We thought the gas bubble would be gone three or four years ago, but we were wrong," he said.
The son of a Greek immigrant railroad worker named Sava Paraskivoupolis who later adopted the name of a Midwestern paymaster called Mike Mitchell, Mr. Mitchell is one of a handful of independent oil-and-gas operators who can afford to be patient. "George is a very sharp individual," said Carol Freedenthal, president of the Jofree Corporation, a consulting firm for natural gas producers based in Houston. "He doesn't get caught in a bureaucratic mess like a lot of bigger companies. He can turn around relatively fast when things get tough."
In a year when most energy companies posted lower profits and plummeting stock values because of weak prices, Mitchell Energy's earnings held almost firm, slipping to $44.3 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 from $47.3 million the previous year. Unlike many of its competitors, Mitchell never recorded a loss during the industry's roller-coaster ride through the 1980's. The closely held stock, meanwhile, has been trading in a narrow range around $15 a share.
Its relative health is partly due to Mitchell's long-term supply contracts -- at an average price last year of a healthy $2.80 per thousand cubic feet. More than half of its output is pledged in a contract with the Natural Gas Pipeline, a unit of Occidental Petroleum, which is paying $3.25 per 1,000 cubic feet for gas this year and more in later years. Mr. Mitchell revised terms three years ago on the deal, originally signed in 1977 when gas supplies were tight and prices for long-term contracts exceeded $7.
Mitchell Energy has also been insulated from falling gas prices by its gas liquids processing and transmission business, which accounted for more than half of its operating profits in the year ended Jan. 31. The liquids business prospers when gas prices are low because gas is the basic raw material, and petrochemical plants use gas liquids like ethane and propane as fuel when they are cheaper than crude oil. Mitchell Energy, the nation's 12th-largest producer of liquids, figures it earns 14 cents of profit on a 35-cent gallon of gas liquids when gas sells for $1.50.
Even Wall Street likes gas liquids at the moment. The nation's leader, Phillips Petroleum, plans to sell 51 percent of its gas liquids unit, GPM Gas, to the public. The big gas processing company that Occidental Petroleum sold last year, Trident NGL Inc., just announced plans to raise about $300 million in an initial public offering.
The third leg of Mitchell Energy's operations, land development near Houston, is also doing well. The Woodlands, Mr. Mitchell's visionary planned community that Wall Street said was a costly extravagance in its 1960's infancy, is Houston's hottest housing development. Its operating income rose to $22.7 million for the 1992 fiscal year, from $15.9 million a year earlier before a one-time charge of $11.6 million. About 10,000 people work in the area, and 33,000 live there, numbers Mr. Mitchell expects will multiply in another 30 or 40 years.
Mr. Mitchell has used his huge wealth -- which briefly topped $1 billion and now is estimated at half that, mostly in his company's stock -- to follow his convictions about energy as well as his broader interests in Houston and Galveston real estate, biotechnology ventures, scientific research and politics. (Paid $871,000 by Mitchell Energy in fiscal 1991, the most recent figure available, he also gets nearly $12 million a year in company dividends.)
In gas fields, Mr. Mitchell, a geologist trained at Texas A & M University, has backed untested technology, such as mobile gas processing stations, that has helped cut costs. Mitchell Energy has 57 gas processing plants, most of which can be hauled to other sites when aging wells are shut down. He is experimenting with a technique to free potentially large gas supplies from very hard, or "tight," rock formations by drilling horizontally through cracks in layers of shale.
Mitchell is one of the only natural-gas producers building its own gas storage site, in an underground coastal salt dome. It is also a partner with Conoco Inc. in a new plant to produce a component for cleaner-burning gasoline called methyl-tertiary butyl ether.
Mr. Mitchell, said a Houston energy consultant who has known him since the 1950's, "analyzes an opportunity, and then continues to chip away for five, 10, 15 or 20 years. He is very, very persistent and tenacious. Everything he does is related to building the value of his company."
George Mitchell plans to have virtually all of his Mitchell Energy stock transferred to a foundation after his death. In addition to his holdings, his wife, Cynthia Woods Mitchell, owns more than a million shares. But only one of their 10 children has any role at Mitchell Energy. M. Kent Mitchell, a 38-year-old real estate developer in North Carolina, has been a director since 1988. Mr. Mitchell's other children pursue careers ranging from archeology to marine science to film directing.
Many company employees wonder privately whether, foundation or no foundation, Mitchell Energy will be broken up after Mr. Mitchell departs. For the record, Mr. Mitchell says the growing Woodlands should not be sold for at least another 10 years and he maintains that natural gas -- now supplying just under 25 percent of American needs -- will become the nation's preferred energy source for the first half of the next century.
"It's a tough market out there now," he said. "Everybody is trimming back. But we will not find enough oil in this country to offset the declines in production. Natural gas is the fuel for the next 35 years."

 
 
A VISION SHAPED BY TEXAS
 George P. Mitchell of Mitchell Energy says he has put millions of the company's money into nonenergy deals to spur Houston's depressed economy, help make it less dependent on energy and perhaps lure what he hopes will be growing companies into his Manhattan-sized development, the Woodlands.
A series of investments that Mr. Mitchell organized in small, new biotechnology companies in Houston in the early 1980's apparently is about to bear fruit, he said. Stock in five of 18 companies spawned mostly from research at medical schools and hospitals in the Houston area either has been sold or will soon be sold for the first time this year, he said, with perhaps another three to follow.
He also organized and is a major financial supporter of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a consortium that started with Rice University, the University of Houston, Texas A & M and the University of Texas at Austin and now has nine members.
One of the center's biggest successes was research on magnets and site geology that played a role in Texas's winning of the contract for the superconducting super collider, the $8.4 billion atom smasher being built south of Dallas. Mitchell Energy contributes $3.5 million a year to the research center's $14 million annual budget.
A self-described political independent and an outspoken advocate of fees on cheap oil imports, in 1988 he supported the Democratic Presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis, and his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Senator and long-time Washington ally of Mr. Mitchell on energy issues. But this year, Mr. Mitchell says, he will be in George Bush's camp. One reason is that the President wants to continue Federal funding for the superconducting super collider.
