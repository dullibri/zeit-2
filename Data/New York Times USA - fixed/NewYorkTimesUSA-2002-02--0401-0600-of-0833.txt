HEADLINE: Big Gains In Research Are Aimed At Military 

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
At first glance, President Bush's proposed budget for the 2003 fiscal year includes a healthy increase for scientific research and development: $8.6 billion, or 8.3 percent, to a record $111.8 billion.
 But a closer look shows that the scientific budgets for most agencies will remain level or even decline under the president's plan. 
 The big winners, it turns out, are in just two agencies, each with a heavy emphasis on security in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. One, the Defense Department research budget, would receive $5.4 billion more than in 2002, a 10.9 percent increase, and the other, the National Institutes of Health, would receive $3.7 billion, or 15.7 percent, more. 
Of the overall $8.6 billion increase, more than $3 billion would go to antiterrorism activity like vaccines and treatments for biological attack, and to homeland security, with the health institutes and the Pentagon receiving most of that money. Most of the Pentagon's added research budget is earmarked for weapons.
At a budget briefing last week, Dr. John H. Marburger III, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Mr. Bush's science adviser, said science had done well at a time the country was engaged in a war against terrorism, financing homeland security and dealing with recession. "This is a good budget for science," he said.
Most of the leading departments and agencies that conduct research and development received increases for those activities, Dr. Marburger said, and the administration has proposed a balanced scientific program that meets the nation's needs.
"When we talk about balance, that doesn't mean that everything will go up," Dr. Marburger said. "We need to make the case for what areas of science deserve increases and give them to them."
Others were more critical. Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, said he was pleased with the substantial increase in spending on health research and noted that nonmilitary research would grow 1 percent above inflation. But Mr. Boehlert added that research spending "would remain anemic under this budget" and that increases for scientific work related to homeland security focused too much on immediate results, as opposed to basic research not directed at a short-term outcome.
Mr. Bush called for increases in three multiagency science initiatives with economic effects, including a 17.3 percent increase, to $679 million, for research in nanotechnology, the science of manipulating matter on the molecular scale. The Networking and Information Technology project to advance computing and software would receive an increase of almost 3 percent, to $1.9 billion, and financing for research on global climate change would climb 5 percent, to $1.8 billion.
But some agencies found that increases in their research requests meant that other programs would have to be held in check.
For instance, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would receive a 5.3 percent increase in its research budget, but just a 1.4 percent increase over all. The human space flight allotment, including money for the International Space Station and the shuttle program, would drop by 11 percent, or $700 million. NASA proposed $15 million to start a New Frontiers program for less expensive planetary missions, but canceled its outer-planets program, including the first spacecraft planned to visit Pluto.
The National Science Foundation's budget would increase 5 percent, to $5 billion. Its research budget would rise 3.6 percent, to $3.7 billion. But more than half of the research increase comes from transferring science-related programs to the foundation from other agencies where science budgets were cut accordingly, including the National Sea Grant Program from the Commerce Department, water-science research from the Interior Department and environmental education from the Environmental Protection Agency.
The E.P.A.'s research budget would rise 6.2 percent, to $650 million. But much of that increase would come from $77.5 million designated to study homeland security.
The Energy Department's research budget would fall 8 percent, to $8.5 billion, with military programs suffering the biggest cuts after big increases the previous year for counterterrorism. The agency's Office of Science, which pays for research in physics and basic energy sciences, would receive a modest increase to $3.3 billion, to cover inflation.
Other significant changes in research budgets include a decline of 9.3 percent for the Agriculture Department, to $2.1 billion, and a 1.3 percent decline for the Commerce Department, to $1.1 billion. Pentagon spending on basic and applied research would generally remain flat. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would be an exception, with a proposed increase of 19.2 percent, to $2.7 billion.
The Interior Department's research budget would decline 4.8 percent, to $628 million. The department's largest science agency, the United States Geological Survey, would see its research budget fall 7 percent, to $542 million.

HEADLINE: Prediction of Failure For Airline Contract 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Mechanics with United Airlines will probably reject a contract recommended by a presidential board that fails to guarantee pay and benefits, their union leader said today.
 The union very likely will turn the measure down when it votes on it on Tuesday, Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, told reporters at a briefing. 
The board, which was appointed by President Bush, wants the union to consider returning some of its gains later to help the airline, the operating unit of the UAL Corporation, recover from a record loss last year after the recession and Sept. 11 attacks reduced travel, he said. 
 A rejection of the contract by the 12,800 mechanics and cleaners would give the airline and machinists a week to reach another agreement before workers would become free to strike on Feb. 20, assuming no further government intervention.
"If it doesn't pass, we're going to get right back together with the I.A.M. and work it through with them," United's chief financial officer, Jake Brace, told investors at a Goldman, Sachs & Company conference in Miami.
The presidential panel recommended a 37 percent raise in top pay for mechanics this year, a 13.5 percent increase for the past two years, to be paid later, and other increases of 3.9 percent next year and 2.8 percent in 2004.

HEADLINE: Wendy's Warning About Its Earnings 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
Wendy's International warned today that 2002 earnings could miss the expectations of analysts by as much as 6 cents a share. 
 The company also told investors it would buy a 45 percent stake in Cafe Express, a restaurant based in Houston that offers upscale meals in a fast-food format. 
 Wendy's, the nation's third-largest hamburger chain, said it projects this year's earnings per share at $1.83 to $1.88, below the $1.89 estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Earnings per share in 2001 were $1.65.
"The biggest thing we're worried about is the economy," said Jack Schuessler, president and chief executive.
Shares of Wendy's closed today at $31.63, down 42 cents, or 1.3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Wendy's expects sales to increase 7 percent to 8 percent in 2002 for its hamburger chain and the coffee-and-doughnuts Tim Hortons restaurants. 
The company expects to open 515 to 540 new stores. The largely Canadian Tim Hortons is expanding in northern border states like Michigan, New York, Ohio and Maine. 
This year's advertising campaign will complete the gradual reduction since 1999 of the role of Wendy's founder, R. Dave Thomas, the chief pitchman from the mid-1980's until his death in January. 
Wendy's will invest $9 million to $10 million in the minority ownership of Cafe Express.

HEADLINE: Obscure Olympic Event Energizes a Utah City 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: OGDEN, Utah, Feb. 11 

 BODY:
This is a working-class town, gritty and proud, less a bedroom community for Salt Lake City, 35 miles south, than its own master, with an economic base of heavy industry, small businesses and government jobs.
 Now, Ogden is aspiring for more. 
 With its own sliver of the Winter Olympics as host of the curling competition, Ogden is striving to become a national center for the sport, perhaps the most arcane of the games with a profile somewhere between low and no. It involves players sliding a rock down an ice sheet, using brooms to guide it to the tee in the house, and heaven help the shooter who crosses the hog line. 
Wildly popular in Canada and a few European countries, curling has never caught on in the United States beyond a narrow band of cold-weather towns near Canada. Many of the best American players hail from Bemidji, Minn., 230 miles north of Minneapolis, making Bemidji the current hotbed of curling, said Stacey Liapis, a member of the American women's team, who is from the town.
But the Olympic tournament has spurred so much interest in Ogden, Utah's sixth-largest city, with 77,000 people, that curling has become a civic obsession. Kids play. Old folks play. Ogden now has its own curling club, and as part of the city's annual winter festival, residents play in a tournament, using frozen hams instead of rocks, which cost $600. The winning team keeps the ham.
"Curling and Ogden, we're a team," said Connie Duran, the owner of '02 4 You, an Olympic souvenir shop on 25th Street, the commercial center. "We're proud of curling. We're jazzed. It's exciting to have the venue here. It's attracting people."
Even people who said they had never curled, had never seen curling, had known nothing about it and never intended to curl enthused over its presence for competition that began today with 10 men's teams and 10 women's teams. The United States, which has one of each, is considered a long-shot for a medal, even though the American men's team defeated Sweden, the world champion, 10-5.
Dennis Stephens, a roofing contractor who looked more like a cowboy than a curler as he ate lunch today at Karen's Cafe, said he could not be prouder of Ogden for its inclusion in the Olympics. Not that he hasplans to buy a curling ticket.
"It's good for the town," Mr. Stephens said. "Even though I don't know anything about the sport and I haven't seen it, I'm glad it's here."
It is difficult to measure the tournament's economic impact on Ogden. Some hotels and motels are packed with fans who eat at places like Karen's -- "I know most of the curlers," said the owner, Karen Waters -- and hunt for pins in places like Ms. Duran's.
But the emotional and psychological boost seems more important, as if civic self-esteem were improved even by a connection to one of the strangest of Olympic sports.
Ms. Waters said, "It's definitely raised the profile of the town. We've never had that happen before. I'm thrilled the curlers are here; I wanted them all to stay at my house."
Olympic banners around town, colorful pictures of rocks and curlers on storefronts and the new communal enthusiasm are helping Ogden spiff up -- and improve upon what it has always been, a rugged, Western depot with rail lines carving the valley floor and factories belching smoke to mountain-top heights.
Not that Ogden cannot find other reasons to boast: John M. Browning, the gunsmith, was born here in 1855. The Golden Spike, uniting America by rail, was driven at nearby Promontory Summit in 1869. And the Osmonds -- Donny, Marie and lots of others -- came from here.
Snowbasin, site of Olympic skiing events, is about 17 miles away, so skiing is not really Ogden's event. Curling is, adding new colors to the town plumage, and many residents said they hope it has a lasting effect.
It is by no means a certainty. Along 25th Street, for every new shop with pricey items, there is a boarded-up storefront, and store owners like Mary Malen, a fourth-generation resident who lives near a mountain that bears her family name, said the closing of a Nordstrom's department store three years ago had hurt the city's efforts to improve its commercial viability.
Mayor Matthew R. Godfrey conceded that his city had been undergoing major changes in recent years. Higher-income residents have been leaving for suburbs nearer the Wasatch Mountains, Mr. Godfrey said, with an influx of Hispanics replacing them.
One of Mr. Godfrey's priorities is recruiting new businesses, an effort that became much easier, he said, after prospects learned that Ogden was to be an Olympic city.
"At one time, they wouldn't give us the time of day," the mayor said. "Now, we're a place with Olympic events, and they're interested."
Ogden's civic leaders had envisioned staging part of the Olympic hockey tournament. But when an arena was planned in the early 1990's, long before the 2002 Games were awarded to Salt Lake City, Ogden lacked the money to build one large enough for hockey. So plans were scaled back and the Ice Sheet opened in 1993 with 2,200 seats, too few for Olympic hockey but just right for Olympic curling.
Today the arena was filled with noisy spectators, including Jim and Ruth May, who said they had bought tickets because they could not escape Ogden's curl-mania, and they were curious.
As some of the best women's teams in the world took to the ice with their rocks and brooms, Mr. May looked on with keen interest.
This was all new to him.
"We've always been known for skiing, the mountains, snow sports and having none of the congestion of Salt Lake City," he said. "We're still a small town, a nice town. And now we have curling."

HEADLINE: Texas Casino Shut Down As Hope for Reprieve Dies 

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: EL PASO, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
By midnight on Monday the jingle of 1,500 slot machines had been stilled, felt-covered tables had been cleared of chips and poker hands, and overflowing trash buckets were stacked where bingo players had earlier pored over "Krazy Kash" jackpot cards, hoping for a blackout.
 As employees of the Speaking Rock Casino and Entertainment Center turned out the lights in its cavernous gambling halls for possibly the last time, Jackie Koller, 63, stood outside in a brisk chill, waiting for a taxicab. 
 "It's a dirty shame," said Mrs. Koller, a Buffalo resident who said she loved to gamble at the crowded casino on an Indian reservation 15 miles east of this dusty West Texas border city, when visiting family in El Paso. "Here is this great place, with lots of slot machines and lots of friendly service, and now it's obviously the last time we'll ever come here." 
After nine years in operation, the Speaking Rock -- operated by the Tigua Indian tribe -- was ordered closed on Monday night after the United States Supreme Court refused to grant a stay to let the 70,000-square-foot casino remain in operation while tribal leaders fight a protracted legal battle with state authorities who want the casino shut down.
State officials say a 1987 federal law that recognized the Tiguas as a tribe put them under the jurisdiction of state gambling law, under which casinos are illegal. In a series of lower court decisions leading up to Monday's Supreme Court decision, Texas state officials have been vindicated. While other Indian-owned casinos have been closed, federal officials said, it has usually been because they violated their operating agreements with the states.
The economic impacts of the shutdown are expected to resound far beyond the sliver of Tigua tribal land on El Paso's outskirts.
A state report has indicated that losing the casino will cost this area 2,200 jobs and at least $60 million in payroll at a time when El Paso is already hard hit by the loss of 14,000 jobs since 1995 because of military base closings, global competition and the economic slowdown.
Tigua leaders worry about the effects on the tribe's 1,248 members. Half the tribe's work force was unemployed before the casino opened in 1993. Recently the tribe's unemployment rate was 1 percent.
"Indian tribes are encouraged to become self-sufficient and we're always criticized for expecting federal handouts or state welfare programs," said Albert Alvidrez, tribal governor for the Tigua Indian Reservation of Texas. "But now, when we provide for our own communities, lift ourselves up by our bootstraps and become successful, the government wants to shut us down because of the competition." 
Mr. Alvidrez said state officials wanted to shutter the casino, which provides $55 million to $60 million a year to tribal programs in education, housing, and health care and employs nearly 800 people here, because Speaking Rock competed with the state's own lottery and other sanctioned gambling. 
"The state operates 14,000 lottery terminals, there are 45,000 state-licensed slot machines in Texas, plus horse tracks, dog tracks, carnivals and two other Indian tribes that have casino gambling. Does closing down the Tigua Indians stop gambling in Texas?" Mr. Alvidrez said. "No, it just stops competition on our particular reservation."
Attorney General John Cornyn, who sued to shut the casino in 1999, has said little about the lawsuit. 
But in court filings the state said its objections to the casino were rooted in a complex interplay of state and federal laws. When Congress formally certified the Tiguas as a tribe in the 1987 Restoration Act, the act stated that the tribe, and several others, would abide by state gambling laws. And in Texas, high-stakes gambling is illegal, other than for the Texas lottery, which was established by a constitutional amendment approved by voters in the 1990's.
Roughly 200 other tribes are allowed to operate about 300 casinos in 25 other states across the country, said Kevin Washburn, general counsel for the National Indian Gaming Commission, a federal body established by another act of Congress that regulated tribal gambling, the Indian Gaming Regulation Act. That law requires states to enter into compacts with tribes that want to open casinos.
"But the Tiguas have more specific legislation that says they will be governed by state law, not federal law," Mr. Washburn said. 
Two other tribes have casinos in Texas. The Kickapoos in Eagle Pass are covered by the federal gambling act, but the Alabama-Coushatta tribe in East Texas face problems similar to the Tiguas' and state authorities have already started action to close its casino, which opened in December.
The Tiguas are pursuing their legal efforts and lobbying for state and federal legislation to let them reopen their casino, Mr. Alvidrez said. 
Meanwhile, he said, "we have to do something quickly to meet the tribe's financial and social needs."
Each tribe member receives about $15,000 annually from the casino, and although only 60 work directly for the casino, many are employed by related businesses that will be affected, Mr. Alvidrez said.
One of those affected businesses is Desert Eagle Distributing, which provided Anheuser-Busch products to the casino. Robert Brown, the owner, says that Speaking Rock was the largest account among the 1,200 bars and restaurants the company serves.
"They brought a lot of people here that would never have come to El Paso who now will just go across the state line and gamble in New Mexico," Mr. Brown said. "It's not just the loss of 800 jobs we'll feel, it's the loss of all the other jobs those tourists helped to fund." 
But more than any direct commercial losses, Mr. Brown said, he feared other impacts on the El Paso community.
"It's upsetting, because of what the Tiguas have been able to do with the casino money," he said, "all of the charities that they help, all of the kids they keep in college, all of the affordable housing and medical care they've been able to provide."
For Joseph Morris, 23, the impact is far more personal. A poker dealer at the casino for the last two and a half years, Mr. Morris has two children and a third on the way. Because he was earning $23,000 a year at the casino, he and his wife recently bought a new $79,000 home on El Paso's East Side. 
"We're discouraged and disappointed, but we're trying to keep our spirits up," said Mr. Morris, who will receive a 60-day severance package with benefits from Speaking Rock.
Still, he said, "I've lived here all my life and I know the kinds of jobs that are available. I know that where I was as working is as good as it can get."

HEADLINE: Antibiotics in the Poultry Industry 

 BODY:
It was a pleasant surprise to learn this week that three large poultry companies had greatly reduced their use of antibiotics in healthy chickens, a move that could help slow the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria that cause diseases in humans. Other companies ought to follow the lead of these pioneers, and Congress ought to ban the use of medically important antibiotics in animal husbandry except to cure sick animals.
 Strong action is needed because many germs that infect humans are growing resistant to treatment with antibiotics. Such resistance occurs inevitably over time as an antibiotic kills off susceptible strains of a germ and leaves only the more resistant strains to proliferate. But in recent decades the growth of resistance has been increased by overuse of antibiotics in agriculture, where companies routinely use the drugs to promote growth on less feed and to prevent disease in healthy animals. As a result, some germs that infect both animals and humans have become resistant to antibiotics, and even germs that do not infect humans are capable of transferring their antibiotic-resistance genes to germs that do. 
 That is why the report in Sunday's Times by Marian Burros was so encouraging. She found that three poultry companies that produce a third of the chickens consumed by Americans each year -- Foster Farms, Perdue Farms and Tyson Foods -- had greatly reduced the use of antibiotics in healthy chickens and were using them primarily to treat sick chickens.
There is no reason that other poultry producers could not do the same, and probably the pork and beef industries as well. It is unacceptable that any industry should use medically important antibiotics for the economic purpose of fostering growth. Congress and the Food and Drug Administration need to curtail the use of animal antibiotics that are related to human medicines.

HEADLINE: Chinatown Yearns for a Lucky New Year 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

 BODY:
Carmine Bau, a shy 10-year-old, clutched a bright red paper packet as other children lining Mott Street waved at the passing dancing lion. Yesterday was the beginning of the Chinese New Year, and Carmine's parents, following Chinese tradition, had given her the packet, containing cash, to wish her good luck.
 Last year, the packet held $40. This year, it was $20. 
 Life has been difficult for her parents since Sept. 11, said Carmine, whose father, who works for a car service in Chinatown, lost many downtown customers after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. "But I feel lucky," she said. "At least Daddy isn't jobless."
As hundreds of thousands of Asian New Yorkers celebrated the first day of the Year of the Horse, the celebration in Chinatown was muted. The community continued to mourn the city's wound and its own loss: dozens of young Chinese-Americans died in the attack. And the neighborhood -- home to 100,000 and just 12 blocks from ground zero -- has been hit hard by the economic downturn. 
"A lot of people are in no mood to celebrate," said Yuk-Tsun Wang, a leader of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. "Business hasn't entirely come back. A lot of people have stopped coming to Chinatown to eat or shop, because they are concerned about the downtown air."
Outside his office, Mott Street, which was lined with strings of electric imitation fireworks and colorful lanterns, bustled with people -- in stark contrast to the months after the attack, when the neighborhood resembled a ghost town.
After the attack, the revenues of Chinatown businesses dropped 30 percent to 70 percent, depending on the industry, according to a survey conducted by local business leaders. A few restaurants went out of business. Dozens of garment factories closed. Unemployment worsened when the remaining factories laid workers off as orders dwindled. 
The holiday season and a campaign by the city and community groups to revive Chinatown's economy has brought back some tourists and dollars since December. But business owners still pine for the good old days. 
Andan Lin, the owner of Evergreen Shanghai Restaurant on Mott Street, said: "People are very cautious with their money now. Before, people ordered hundreds of dollars of food for their Chinese New Year dinner. Now they go for the cheap items on the menu, like noodles and fried rice."
The holiday has been a mixed blessing to Yinyin Mui, a 50-year-old former garment factory worker. After Sept. 11, Mrs. Mui, finding herself unemployed, started taking courses to become a home aide. Yesterday, she received her certificate.
And she was thrilled to have all three of her children at home on New Year's Eve, for the first time in eight years. Her sons and daughter had welcomed the new year with friends ever since they left high school. 
But this year, Mrs. Mui's eldest son lost his job, and the younger children, in college, saw their allowances slashed. Broke, all three skipped partying with friends this time. "I was very happy that they were home," she said. "But I'd be much happier if the towers hadn't collapsed."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: EquipmentMaker Has A Loss 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 Applied Materials, the world's largest supplier of chip-making equipment, reported a narrow first-quarter loss yesterday as sales declined 58 percent from the year-earlier period. The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., lost $45 million, or 6 cents a share, for the quarter ended Jan. 27, in contrast to a $157 million profit the year before. 
Excluding one-time items, Applied Materials earned 2 cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectation of a break-even quarter. For the first time in a year, new orders rose slightly over the previous quarter, and the company said it expected them to rise again this quarter. James C. Morgan, the chairman and chief executive, said he saw signs of a recovery, but not for at least several more quarters. "It's still challenging out there," he said in an interview. "We're scratching for every order." Job cuts and factory closings helped offset the decline in sales, which fell to $1 billion, from $2.36 billion a year earlier. Chris Gaither (NYT)

HEADLINE: Jet With 118 Aboard Crashes in Western Iran 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: KHORRAMABAD, Iran, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
An Iranian passenger jet flying in snow and rain crashed today in the mountains of western Iran, and all 118 of its passengers and crew members were believed dead, an official said.
 Residents reported hearing an explosion and seeing the sky light up red as the Russian-made Tupolev 154 went down in the Sefid Mountains outside this city. 
 The jet, leased by Iran Air Tours, a subsidiary of the state carrier Iran Air, had flown just over 200 miles southwest from Tehran and was five minutes from Khorramabad when it lost contact with the control tower, Iranian television reported. 
"I heard a huge, really horrifying sound of an explosion," said Ardeshir Ghiyasvand of Key-Mirzavand, the closest village to the crash site. "Moments later, I saw that the clouds and fog over the mountains suddenly became red, everything turned from white to red."
Fog and snow, suspected as factors in the crash, also delayed rescue workers traveling to the site. Reza Niknam, an adviser to the governor-general of Lorestan Province, said he had seen human remains scattered on the mountainside and believed nobody could have survived.
A government spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, told the official Islamic Republic News Agency that 105 passengers and 13 crew members had been aboard.
Iran Air Tours has in recent years leased mostly Tupolev planes with Russian flight crews. In Moscow, the Tupolev chief designer, Aleksandr Shingart, told Echo Moscow radio that the plane had been thoroughly checked by Russian experts. He suggested the cause might have been pilot error.
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that several Iranian legislators had called for the resignation of Transportation Minister Ahmad Khorram, while Iranian television reported that President Mohammad Khatami had named an emergency committee to investigate. 
In May, a Russian Yakovlev Yak-40 jet crashed in northeastern Iran, killing a previous transportation minister and about 30 other passengers, including seven lawmakers.
Iran also has an aging fleet of Boeings bought from the United States before the Islamic revolution in 1979. The United States, as part of its economic sanctions against Iran, has refused to provide spare parts.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Profit Falls At BP 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 BP reported a 62 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, as energy prices plunged. Net income fell to $1.06 billion, or 5 cents a share, compared with $2.8 billion, or 12 cents a share, in the period last year. 
BP said it increased oil and gas production for all of 2001 by 5.5 percent, in line with the company's own estimates and at a faster rate than its rivals Royal Dutch/ Shell and the Exxon Mobil Corporation. In response to lower oil prices, which have fallen as the world economy slows and the terror attacks in the United States have crimped demand, BP said it would eliminate 15 percent of the jobs in its chemicals unit and an unspecified number elsewhere. The chief executive, John Browne, said he expected supply and demand to be in balance this year. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Economy Falls 4 Percent 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 New York City's economy slid steeply in the last quarter of 2001, even as the national economy edged upward, according to new data from the New York City comptroller's office. The comptroller calculates a measure of all the goods and services produced in the city, which it calls the gross city product, much like the gross domestic product for the nation. 
In the quarter that ended in December, the gross city product, figured over a full year, dropped by 4.4 percent, while the nation's economy rose by 0.2 percent. The last time that the city's economy contracted so sharply was in the second quarter of 1991, when it shrank by 6.9 percent. Personal income tax revenues, a proxy for incomes in the city, dropped a similarly steep 4.8 percent in the period, while the comparable national measure rose 2.9 percent. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

 BODY:
 Households in Battery Park City, hard hit by the Sept. 11 terror attack, will each receive nearly $2,000 in disaster relief as early as June, officials said. 
The money, about $15.6 million in all, will come from the Battery Park City Authority, the state agency that collects rent and payments from landlords in the downtown development. Each household will receive about $1,845, said James F. Gill, the authority's chairman. The authority also said it was pursuing $13 million withheld by more than 2,000 condominium owners who want their ground leases renegotiated and taxes lowered. The withheld payments are a combination of taxes, ground rents and civic facilities fees. Susan Saulny (NYT)

Upgrading of Jewish Educators Is Sought

BYLINE:  By Stephanie Rosenbloom 

 BODY:
Dr. ISMAR SCHORSCH, the chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, says the climate is right to attract an improved generation of Jewish educators: Young, unemployed people are considering further schooling and, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, many are on a quest for spirituality. 
To help solve a shortage of good teachers, the seminary has designated $1.5 million in fellowships that will let students attend its two-year masters in Jewish education program tuition free and has created a $3 million rabbinical school fellowship fund to cover four years of tuition for about 10 students beginning in September. Dr. Schorsch attributes the current lack of strong quality among Jewish educators to postgraduate debt that, coupled with entry-level salaries, makes careers in Jewish education unattractive.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS; 
Jitters About Corporate Accounting Push Down Shares

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks sagged yesterday, eroding two sessions of strong gains, after Nortel Networks warned of weak revenue growth. A day earlier, Nortel announced that its chief financial officer quit over inappropriate trading of company stock.
 "There's a crisis of confidence out there in the very near term," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Fahnestock & Company. 
 Investors are on edge after a series of accounting scandals, starting with Enron and, most recently, Global Crossing. Nortel, which is based in Canada, slumped more than 6 percent, although it said stock deals leading to the executive's departure were not part of a wider scandal.
Lingering nervousness about other potential accounting blowups, uncertainty about the economy, fears of a possible attack on the United States and lackluster trading conditions kept the market under pressure.
"I still think the accounting issues hang over the market like a dark cloud," said Eric Gustafson, portfolio manager at Stein, Roe & Farnham.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 21.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,863.74, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.44 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,107.50. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 12.45 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,834.21.
Trading volumes were moderate as uncertainty kept many investors on the sidelines. On the New York Stock Exchange about 1.1 billion shares changed hands, while about 1.5 billion were traded on Nasdaq.
A warning by the F.B.I. about a possible attack on the United States or its interests in Yemen added more uncertainty to Wall Street.
Concerns about accounting, however, took center stage.
Harley-Davidson fell 6 percent as investors fretted over how the company recorded gains on sales of loans and worried about a possible slowdown in demand for its heavyweight motorcycles. It dropped $3.04, to $50.99.
EMC, the data storage systems maker, dropped $1.04, to $14. The Securities and Exchange Commission last month met with a former EMC executive who accused the company of improperly booking revenue from some customers, according to people close to the situation.
Tyco International, which recently found itself swept up in post-Enron accounting concerns, fell $1.30, to $30.50, and was among the New York Stock Exchange's most-active stocks.
Nortel said its chief financial officer had quit after buying and selling company stock within his retirement plan in violation of company policy. Nortel added in a separate statement that weak customer demand would make it hard to meet first-quarter revenue targets. It fell 42 cents, to $6.42. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall

The 10-year note fell 16/32, to a price of 99 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 4.97 percent from 4.90 percent.
The 30-year bond fell 25/32, to a price of 98 27/32. Its yield rose to 5.46 percent from 5.40 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Pfizer, facing competition from other drug makers, looks for a younger market for Viagra.

BYLINE:  By Melody Petersen 

 BODY:
PFIZER wants men to know that Viagra is not just for the 60-and-over crowd.
 With two competitors fast on its heels, Pfizer is choosing younger and healthier pitchmen for its erectile dysfunction treatment. Advertisements that once featured former Senator Bob Dole, who disclosed at age 74 that he had used Viagra after prostate cancer surgery, now show 43-year-old Mark Martin, a star of the Nascar racing circuit, roaring up in his No. 6 Ford Taurus. 
 In a print advertisement running as Valentine's Day approaches, a handsome, 40-something guy asks, "Think you're too young for Viagra?" 
And in Canada, Pfizer began running television ads last month that show a businessman dancing all the way to work.
But the new ads may be only the beginning. Two new drugs to treat erectile dysfunction could be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year -- a development that is bound to set off a fierce marketing battle in a market that Pfizer has had to itself since it introduced Viagra in 1998.
A drug called Cialis will be marketed by a partnership between Eli Lilly and the Icos Corporation, a biotechnology company in Bothell, Wash. Another drug, vardenafil, will be sold by a partnership of Bayer A.G. and GlaxoSmithKline. Further away from approval is a topical cream aimed at treating erectile dysfunction that is being developed by NexMed, a small biotechnology company in Robbinsville, N.J.
Pfizer's new advertisements appear to be paying off. A growing percentage of the patients who talk to their doctors about Viagra are between the ages of 40 and 59. According to IMS Health, a health care information company, about 50 percent of patients talking to their doctors about Viagra were in that age group last year, up from 42 percent in 1998.
Geoff Cook, a spokesman for Pfizer, said the company was trying to reach all men who might suffer from erectile dysfunction. The problem mostly affects men age 40 and older, he said.
"Any advertising has been aimed at getting men to see their physician," Mr. Cook said.
Pfizer regularly changes the content of its advertising, Mr. Cook said, and the ads have nothing to do with the two new drugs, which are still months away from approval. He said Pfizer did not discuss what it spends on advertising. Pfizer's advertising agency is Cline, Davis & Mann in Manhattan.
Studies have shown that about 30 million American men suffer from impotence, a disorder that Pfizer has successfully educated the public to call the less-stigmatized erectile dysfunction. Only a fraction of affected men are being treated.
Dr. Leonard S. Yaffe, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Banc of America Securities, said that he expected the market for erectile dysfunction drugs to expand quickly with the flurry of advertisements that are expected when the two new drugs are approved.
Pfizer had about $900 million of Viagra sales in the United States last year, Dr. Yaffe said. In 2003, the sales of all three drugs combined could reach $1.8 billion, he said.
All three drugs inhibit an enzyme called phosphodiesterase-5, or PDE-5, and ultimately improve blood flow to the penis. All three drugs have side effects and are not recommended for men who take nitrates for heart problems. Doctors say that the new drugs appear to have fewer side effects than Viagra, although there have been no studies directly comparing them.
Karen A. Dawes, Bayer's senior vice president for marketing in North America, said yesterday that the company expected its marketing campaign for vardenafil to include both television and print advertisements. "It's a logical way to get to consumers," she said.
Bayer is also hiring dozens of sales representatives and is talking to the F.D.A. about a brand name for vardenafil. Several analysts, including Dr. Yaffe, said they believed that the name would be Nuviva.
Icos and Lilly both declined to describe how they planned to market Cialis. But Lilly has told Wall Street analysts that it expects its marketing costs to increase this year as it begins selling Cialis and other new drugs.
Already, both Bayer and the Lilly-ICOS venture have received letters from the F.D.A. warning them to stop certain promotional practices that the agency said were illegal.
Last month, the F.D.A. sent a letter to Lilly and ICOS, saying that two news releases appearing on the companies' Web sites were illegal because they promoted Cialis as being safe before it was approved.
Bayer received a similar warning letter in June for a presentation it made at a meeting of the American Urological Association.
And two years ago, the F.D.A. warned Pfizer that its television ads appearing just before Valentine's Day had failed to warn properly about Viagra's possible side effects.
Dr. Irwin Goldstein, a professor of urology at Boston University's School of Medicine, said the two new drugs work with a much lower dose than Viagra, which could reduce side effects. Vardenafil appears to require the smallest dose to be effective, said Dr. Goldstein, who has worked as a consultant for the companies selling all three drugs.
But Dr. Yaffe said that he expected many doctors to come to prefer Cialis over both vardenafil and Viagra because it appears to work for a longer period of time. Viagra sales should continue to grow, he said, but at a slower rate.
Over the last few years, Pfizer has benefited from Viagra promotions it did not even pay for. One Web site unaffiliated with Pfizer now uses Mr. Martin's Nascar race car to woo patients. And as Valentine's Day has approached, radio ads broadcast in Manhattan have urged men to visit a Web site where they could quickly get a Viagra prescription.
Pfizer said it had nothing to do with either of those recent promotions. Mr. Cook said Pfizer tried to determine whether Web sites or other ads violate its trademarks and often notified government authorities about anything that appeared illegal. Still, he said, there is often little that Pfizer can do.

HEADLINE: Bush May Meet China's New Star 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
President Bush is very likely to meet with Hu Jintao, the man expected to take over as China's supreme leader, during the president's trip to Asia next week, an administration official said today.
 Mr. 
Hu, 59, China's vice president since 1998, is considered the successor to Jiang Zemin, who will retire as head of the Communist Party this fall and then as president a few months later. 
 Mr. Hu remains a mystery in the West and even to much of China. But he is generally considered to be part of the group of Chinese leaders who favor liberalizing the country's economy, although under the rule of the Communist Party. 
Mr. Hu has never been to the United States, although he met last fall with government and business leaders in Moscow, London, Paris, Berlin and Madrid. 
Mr. Bush is to leave on Saturday for a six-day trip to Japan, South Korea and China. The visit is, in essence, a rescheduling of an October 2001 presidential trip to the region that the White House cut back to include only Shanghai because of the Sept. 11 attacks.

HEADLINE: Officials Brace for a Budget That Spreads the Pain Around 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
For weeks now, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been using words like "pain" and "suffering" to describe the cuts that will be needed to close the city's looming budget deficit, and city officials said yesterday that the bare-bones budget proposal he will propose today will more than match his warnings.
 Officials said that they expected the Bloomberg budget to call for more than $1.7 billion in cuts and budget actions to city agencies. There are no sacred cows in the plan, they said; even the Police and Fire Departments will face cuts, despite the increased reliance the city has been placing on them since the attack on the World Trade Center. Bread-and-butter city services like sanitation will be cut, as will city aid to the Board of Education. Under his plan, centers for the elderly would probably be forced to close. 
 The mayor's budget would also cut capital projects by 25 percent, a City Hall aide said, scaling back or delaying construction of schools and roads and saving the city money by keeping it from going further into debt. (The city currently has $40.8 billion in outstanding debt.)
The mayor is also expected to call for using as much as $1.5 billion from a bond sale, one that the city was authorized to make to help cover the costs of the trade center attack, to instead close the budget shortfall, going into debt to cover the city's operating expenses, a practice fiscal monitors usually frown on.
The Bloomberg administration is planning to take such drastic measures as it struggles to close huge deficits projected for the fiscal year beginning July 1. The city has slipped from surpluses to deficits precipitously, feeling the combined effects of the recession and Sept. 11 that have caused tax revenues to plummet. 
Estimates of those budget gaps have risen, with the highest so far expected today as Mr. Bloomberg predicts that the shortfall could reach $4.7 billion, his aides said. 
Just last week, he said that the gap would be $4.5 billion. (The Giuliani administration estimated on Dec. 31 that the deficit would be $2.9 billion.)
This is a significant increase, and it makes Mr. Bloomberg even more pessimistic -- his aides would say more prudent -- than a number of fiscal monitors and budget watchdog groups that are traditionally more conservative than elected officials in their budget projections.
His budget reflects his dire predictions. His proposal to close the $4.7 billion gap will include calls for more than $1.7 billion in service cuts and budget actions, $1.5 billion in debt; $800 million in additional revenues from the state and federal governments and $500 million in productivity gains and givebacks from unions.
He will call for shrinking the city's work force by several thousand people through attrition, but will not seek layoffs, several City Hall aides said. 
Bloomberg officials have been extremely secretive about the budget proposal, and Mr. Bloomberg himself has said little about his plans. "You're not going to get a sneak preview today," he said on Sunday when pressed for details. "I mean, come on. I'm not that stupid."
But in the past two days, the administration has begun to deliver the bad news, briefing deputy mayors, agency heads and elected officials. 
Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, was briefed last night. He declined to provide any details of the plan, but suggested that the Council would take issue with it. "I'll say tonight that I think there's a lot of work for us to do," Mr. Miller said.
Officials agreed that the Board of Education would face cuts, but varied in the details. One official said amount of city aid to the board would decrease by $350 million. Several others said that they were not sure of the dollar figure, but that city aid to the schools would decrease by roughly 7 percent, although some of the lost money could be made up from other revenue sources. A spokeswoman for the board did not return a call seeking comment. 
Mr. Bloomberg will also suggest a variety of new sources of revenues and savings from the state and federal governments, including possibilities of varying likelihoods. In the past he has called for more money from the state to pay for the state inmates that the city houses, and a greater share of a state-imposed tax on cellphone use.
The mayor's preliminary budget is typically the start of a long series of negotiations that produces a further budget proposal in the spring and ends when the City Council adopts it in June.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: IRAQ; 
POWELL SAYS U.S. IS WEIGHING WAYS TO TOPPLE HUSSEIN

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that the administration was considering a variety of options to topple Saddam Hussein, amid indications that President Bush and his top advisers are close to settling on a plan.
 While taking an unusually tough tone toward Iraq, Secretary Powell was careful to draw a distinction between Iraq on one hand and Iran and North Korea on the other, three countries that President Bush had lumped together as an "axis of evil" because of their quest for weapons of mass destruction. 
 "With respect to Iran and with respect to North Korea, there is no plan to start a war with these nations," Secretary Powell said. In contrast, in discussing Iraq, he delivered a stern message. 
"With respect to Iraq, it has long been, for several years now, a policy of the United States government that regime change would be in the best interests of the region, the best interests of the Iraqi people," he said. "And we are looking at a variety of options that would bring that about."
Secretary Powell's comments were made in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee as the administration approached a decision about how to dislodge Mr. Hussein. Senior officials said there was a consensus within the administration that he must be overthrown and that plans to do so are being drawn up. But there no agreement as to how precisely that should be done or how long the United States should be prepared to wait for action. Still, there are indications that the planning is becoming increasingly serious. News analysis, Page A18. 
Next month, Vice President Dick Cheney is scheduled to visit a number of nations that border Iraq, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Turkey. Mr. Cheney also plans to visit Britain, Egypt, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, all of which might provide useful support in a campaign against Iraq. 
At the Pentagon, officials have been drawing up plans for an Iraq campaign. The Iraqi National Congress, as the Iraqi opposition is known, has received a much warmer reception from the administration since the State of the Union speech, though the administration still has not agreed to provide its members with military training. During a recent meeting at the White House, a senior administration official told Iraqi opposition officials that President Bush had decided that Saddam Hussein needed to be replaced. 
"We were told that the president has made up his mind: Saddam has got to go," one opposition official recalled. 
At the hearing today, Secretary Powell stressed that Mr. Bush had not made any final decisions and that military action was not imminent.
Gen. Tommy Franks, the head of the United States Central Command, which is overseeing the campaign in Afghanistan and which would run any campaign against Iraq, said today that a military plan had not yet been settled. 
"I do not think I am at a point where a decision has been made about where to go next, leave alone the precision of how we will be going about doing this," General Franks said at the end of a visit to Kuwait.
One senior administration official said the Pentagon still needed several months to end the fighting in Afghanistan and prepare for a potential military campaign in Iraq. 
Among the issues that officials are wrestling with is the possibility that Saddam Hussein would respond to an attack by using weapons of mass destruction against United States forces and possibly Israel; the extent to which American ground forces would be needed, and how a post-Hussein Iraq would be administered. 
The Bush administration also needs to lay the diplomatic foundation. The British government is still wary of an Iraq campaign, the Turks are fearful that it could lead to an independent Kurdistan, Israel is apprehensive that it may be targeted by Iraq's missiles, and others in the region are skittish about a major American military operation in their backyard. 
Several senior administration officials have begun to talk privately about a two-track approach to deposing Mr. Hussein that would balance military and diplomatic planning. 
The first steps, which could take five months or more, involve working through the United Nations to develop tighter but more focused sanctions against Iraq and demand that it allow nuclear inspectors unfettered access to the country. 
But senior administration officials say they fully expect that such an effort would fail, which would lay the base for a military campaign, one in which the United States would both encourage internal rebellions against the Iraqi leader's rule and use American military power.
"If we put smart sanctions in place in May, then it gets harder for Iraq to make the case that it should not allow weapons inspectors," a senior official said. "But we know that it is only matter of time before the weapons inspections get stopped and we have yet another bit of proof that Saddam will never give up."
Discussing the diplomatic approach, Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, said after a recent meeting with Secretary Powell that he expected that when the United Nations Security Council met in May to renew economic sanctions against Iraq, the United States and Britain could issue an "ultimatum" to Mr. Hussein to let in the weapons inspectors. Mr. Straw said he hoped that Russian pressure would persuade Iraq to cooperate, but unlike hard-liners in the Bush administration, he did not say what action should be taken if Iraq refused to comply.
Though some Bush officials consider that a likely scenario, one senior official said the military and diplomatic tracks were still being developed independently.
Secretary Powell's appearance today was significant because he has long been considered the most cautious member of the administration when it comes to confronting Iraq. By making his statements in a Congressional hearing and making them in a more strongly worded fashion than in similar testimony he gave last week, the secretary of state demonstrated his loyalty to the president and thus gave himself an opportunity to influence the outcome as deliberations continue within the administration. But his comments also indicated that the deliberations over Iraq have a new sense of urgency. 
Senior officials said a consensus was emerging that it is important to take on the Iraqi leader, with the help of allies if possible, and without them if necessary.
Secretary Powell's comments today marked the first time he drew a sharp distinction between the administration's strategy with Iraq and its strategy with the two other countries Mr. Bush called part of an "axis of evil" in his State of the Union address last week.
In Iraq, he continued, "we are always examining options for regime change." Mr. Bush, he added, using a curious time element, "does not have a recommendation before him that would involve an armed conflict tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Democrats Criticizing Bush Budget On Education 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats complained today that President Bush's budget provided far less money than Mr. Bush promised when he signed a landmark education bill just five weeks ago.
 The bill, one of Mr. Bush's top domestic priorities, was adopted in a chorus of bipartisan harmony. In his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Bush hailed two Democrats who helped write the law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative George Miller of California. 
 But today Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Miller attacked the president's latest budget request for education, saying that it failed to provide money for many initiatives in that law.
"The proposed education budget is totally inadequate," Mr. Miller said. "It breaks the promise of education reform. It calls for the smallest spending increase in education in seven years. If we start to renege on the money in the first year, what kind of message are we sending to school districts that we are serious about these reforms?" 
Senator Kennedy said Mr. Bush's budget "fails to provide the resources that were agreed to" in five months of negotiations with the White House last year.
White House officials rejected the criticism. Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the president, said Mr. Bush's budget request for 2003 was 19 percent higher than the amount appropriated for 2001. Mr. McClellan acknowledged that most of the two-year increase occurred from 2001 to 2002. 
Moreover, Mr. McClellan said the president was seeking $11.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion, for the main federal program to help poor children, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In addition, he said Mr. Bush had requested $9.7 billion for educating children with disabilities, an increase of $1 billion.
"Our education problems would have been solved long ago if it were just a question of spending more money," Mr. McClellan said.
But Democrats said Mr. Bush paid for the increases by cutting other education programs.
In the 2003 budget, which he unveiled last week, Mr. Bush sought a total of $2.1 trillion, which is $76 billion more than the government plans to spend on all activities this year. Most of the increase was earmarked for military programs and domestic security. 
With welfare programs as with education, Mr. Bush has said he is willing to compromise with Democrats on policy, but will not increase spending as much as they want.
In recent years, even under President Bill Clinton, Congress has often provided more money than the president requested for education.
Education spending subject to annual appropriations, a widely used measure of federal support for education, more than doubled from 1996 to 2002, growing an average of 13.4 percent a year, to more than $48.9 billion this year. By contrast, for next year, Mr. Bush proposed an increase of 2.8 percent, to $50.3 billion in 2003. This figure would rise to $55 billion in 2007 under Mr. Bush's proposal.
Democrats said that the education bill, a blueprint for the next five years, explicitly allowed, or authorized, much more spending, but they did not say how much.
The friendship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kennedy, scions of two of America's best known political families, has puzzled many politicians, but could yield dividends for both men. In recent weeks, Mr. Kennedy and White House officials have been trying to reach a pact on patients' rights legislation, just as they forged agreement on education last year. 
Democrats disagreed not only with the size of Mr. Bush's education budget, but also with his priorities. Mr. Bush proposed a tax credit up to $2,500 a year to help defray tuition and other costs for a child who moves from a poorly performing public school to a private school or another public school.
The White House said the tax credits would cost more than $4 billion over 10 years.
Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Miller said the money would be better spent on Title I and other programs authorized under the bill that Mr. Bush signed on Jan. 8. They said, for example, that his budget would not provide any additional money specifically to repair dilapidated schools or to reduce class sizes.
But Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Education and the Work Force, said he was satisfied with the president's budget.
"Even in the midst of a war and a recession," Mr. Boehner said, "President Bush kept his commitment to education." Mr. Boehner said the proposed tax credits would help poor families. "Low-income parents in disadvantaged communities with failing schools should have the same education choices as affluent parents," he said.

HEADLINE: Chief Takes Over at Agency To Thwart Attacks on U.S. 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
John M. Poindexter, the retired Navy admiral who was President Ronald Reagan's national security adviser, has returned to the Pentagon to direct a new agency that is developing technologies to give federal officials instant access to vast new surveillance and information-analysis systems.
 The Information Awareness Office, which Mr. Poindexter took over last month, is one of two new agencies that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, created in recent months as part of the Bush administration's effort to grapple with new kinds of military threats after the attacks of Sept. 11. 
 The other new agency is the Information Exploitation Office and is intended to develop advanced computerized battlefield sensor networks to shorten the time between when an enemy target is located and when it is attacked. 
The Information Awareness Office will focus on what the agency refers to as "asymmetric threats," or nonconventional military targets like potential terrorist organizations.
The administration has called for a sharp rise in Darpa's budget in the fiscal year 2003, and the agency is being reshaped to focus on a variety of new technologies, including biological warfare threats and new computer "data mining" technologies. Over the years, Darpa has financed research that led to the creation of the Internet and stealth aircraft. 
Mr. Poindexter, who is 65, was a controversial figure both for his role in the Iran-contra scandals and for his efforts to assert military influence over commercial computer security technologies.
With Oliver L. North, a former National Security Council aide, Mr. Poindexter was convicted in 1986 as part of the guns-for-hostages deal that provoked a Congressional investigation. The conviction was overturned in 1991 on grounds that the men had been granted immunity from prosecution as a result of their testimony before Congress.
Since leaving government in the 1980's, Mr. Poindexter has worked as a military technology consultant, most recently for Syntek Technologies, a military and intelligence-agency consulting firm in Arlington, Va. Since 1995, he has consulted with Darpa on new technologies intended to give military and civil crisis managers access to battlefield and related information.
Mr. Poindexter, who declined a request for an interview on his new position, became closely involved as a contractor in 1995 on a Darpa development project code-named Genoa intended to give national security managers advanced personal computer networks with access to large databases of relevant information.
In recent weeks, Mr. Poindexter has contacted a number of Silicon Valley researchers looking for information on specific technologies. 
Several scientists who are close to the agency said he had returned to government service because he had a passionate concern about assuring that the nation's crisis managers had better computerized systems for communication and data analysis.
"After 9/11, there is clearly a sense you have to present information to decision makers in a coherent fashion," said Shankar Sastry, a former Darpa manager who is now chairman of the electrical engineering and computer sciences department at the University of California.
Mr. Poindexter also consulted on another Darpa project called Command Post of the Future, Dr. Sastry said. The project designed a series of high-technology rooms that surrounded military planners with electronic communication, decision-making and mapping aids.
A component of the new computer information systems being emphasized by Mr. Poindexter's office are "data mining" techniques to scan through vast collections of computer data, which may include text, images, sound and other computer data, and find significant patterns.
"We now have so many sensors that we need new ways of making sense of the information we collect," said Steven Wallach, who is vice president of Chiaro Networks and a member of the president's Information Technology Advisory Committee. "How do you associate a name with a picture taken in Malaysia, a cellphone call in Frankfurt, Germany, and a bank transfer from Pakistan to Chicago? There aren't any perfect answers yet."
The development of such advanced surveillance and data-mining techniques has raised new concerns among civil liberties groups in the United States, and Mr. Poindexter was involved in disputes about the government's role in computer security during the 1980's.
"Mr. Poindexter was responsible for several computer policy mistakes in the computer security realm in the 1980's," said Marc Rotenberg, a former counsel with Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to Mr. Poindexter's policies that shifted control of computer security to the military. "It took three administrations and both political parties over a decade to correct those mistakes."
As national security adviser, Mr. Poindexter was involved with a Reagan administration initiative in 1984 that gave intelligence agencies broad authority to examine computer databases for "sensitive but unclassified information." 
In a later memorandum, Mr. Poindexter expanded this authority to give the military responsibility for all computer and communications security for the federal government and private industry.
Mr. Poindexter, who received a doctorate in physics from the California Institute of Technology, has a deep interest and an advanced understanding of computers and other information technologies, said Victoria Stavridou, a Darpa contractor and director of the Systems Laboratory at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS; 
Excerpts From the Senate Committee Hearing on the Collapse of Enron

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from a hearing yesterday of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee into the collapse of the Enron Corporation at which Enron's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, invoked his right against self-incrimination, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. Among the senators making statements were John McCain, Republican of Arizona; Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois; John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts; John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana; Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon; Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California; Jean Carnahan, Democrat of Missouri; George F. Allen, Republican of Virginia; and Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina.

MR. McCAIN: -- In a speech that he gave on April 6, 1999, at a conference sponsored by the Center for Business Ethics, entitled "Corporate Governance: Ethics Across the Board," Mr. Lay described the qualities he demanded in a board member. I quote: "It's no accident that we put strength of character first. Like any successful company, we must have directors who start with what is right, who do not have hidden agendas, and who strive to make judgments about what is best for the company and not about what is best for themselves or some other constituency." He went on to say: "Once such a board is in place, what does a C.E.O. and in particular this C.E.O. expect from these principled, wise and experienced directors? Again, our corporate governance guidelines are simple and straightforward. The responsibility of our board, a responsibility which I expect them to fulfill, is to ensure legal and ethical conduct by the company and by everyone in the company." As Enron's chairman of the board, and C.E.O. since 1986, Mr. Lay was expected to live up to these principles and ensure that others in his company did the same.
 According to the Powers report, however, senior management at Enron made a mockery of Mr. Lay's words and turned the principles he described on their head. The Powers report indicates that for years, Enron engaged in financial games hiding massive debt from its shareholders and misrepresenting its economic conditions to the public and to many Enron employees. . . .

MR. FITZGERALD: -- Mr. Lay, I've concluded that you're perhaps the most accomplished confidence man since Charles Ponzi. I'd say you were a carnival barker, except that wouldn't be fair to carnival barkers. A carnie will at least tell you up front that he's running a shell game. You, Mr. Lay, were running what purported to be the seventh largest corporation in America.
What's incredible to me is how long you kept it going, and how almost nobody called you on it. There were a couple that couldn't be fooled though, weren't there? Why is it, Mr. Lay, that occasionally some people will take a stand? Sherron Watkins took a stand. Sherron Watkins -- a good life, a nice house, a great kid -- she had everything to lose when she essentially told you that your company was a sham. She had every reason to walk away, but she stood and spoke. 
And you, Mr. Lay, you have every reason to stand and speak, but you will walk away. You will raise your right hand; you will take the Fifth; and then you will walk out that door. And when you walk out that door, it will be a stunning coda to the collapse of Enron. . . . 

MR. KERRY: -- Let me just say that obviously, Mr. Lay, the anger here is palpable.
Companies do come and go, as I think the vice president said at some point, and people understand that when they invest, they take risk. But this clearly is so far beyond any normal market undertaking or opportunity for any investor, and the implications for people who trusted in the system, trusted the nature of disclosure, the nature of audits, and so forth, as Senator Burns has said -- the implications for them are deep. And obviously lives have been ruined -- many lives, at the top and at the bottom.
That's a tragedy in and of itself, but it raises critical questions for all of us.
I mean, the stewardship of a major public corporation, as Senator McCain said, the words he quoted of you, is a major trust. It's a public trust, in its own way. 
And we in this country spend a lot of time trying to convince other nations of the virtue of transparency, accountability. We try to sell that through the framework of our trade regime, of W.T.O., try to spread capitalism around the world, for its virtues. And here is an example of abuse that runs deep, not just within Enron itself, but further than that. I think it's safe to say that no member of this committee believes that Arthur Andersen invented this method of accounting, and that sends shivers through the stock market and elsewhere in this country, as people contemplate what may be behind it.
I just want to direct my colleagues to one particular component of this that I've been harping on for a number of years, because as we fight a war on terrorism, and as we talk about holding other systems accountable, so we can follow the flow of money, we have -- all of us -- in this Congress allowed to stand for too long a system that undermines our capacity to do that, and that's offshore subsidiaries and tax havens. . . . 

MR. BREAUX: -- The final point is that accounting services that are doing audit practices clearly should not, cannot, must not in the future be engaged and also involving themselves with the internal audits of a company or preparing balance sheets for the company, if in fact they are in charge of auditing the company. There has to be a clear separation. The confidence of the capitalistic system in the publicly traded companies in this country are truly at stake. If we cannot rely on outside auditors making statements about the condition of a publicly traded company, then in fact the whole system of how we do business in this country is at stake. . . .

MR. WYDEN: -- Certainly my constituents at home in Oregon who have had their 401(k)'s go from $900,000 to $100,000 in value, their first preference is to try to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. They know that isn't very probable. But now they want an explanation. And at this point, like so many Americans, I'm just incredulous. We're talking about accounting reforms, for example, now in the United States Congress. I wrote a law over the opposition of the accounting profession requiring that accountants look for fraud, actively look for fraud and bring it to the attention of government regulators if they find any evidence that it's taking place. As far as I can tell, that law was honored more in the breach than in the observance in this case; but won't know until we get to the facts.
The fact of the matter is, it's just not possible to determine why the Enron ship is at the bottom of the ocean unless you hear from the captain. And I'm especially troubled that we won't hear today, because of the headlines in this morning's paper. The headlines this morning say, for the first time, for the first time, that Mr. Lay had a direct role in approving one of the most controversial of all the partnerships, the transactions between Enron and LJM2, a co-investment transaction, and for the first time now, there are reports that there is a direct link between Mr. Lay and this particular partnership. . . . 

MS. SNOWE: -- This is a scathing indictment calling into question certainly the legalities of Enron's actions and the failure of top executives to put in place proper safeguards for investors and employees. It certainly shows that corporate corruption can have a profound influence in undermining the public's confidence in the underpinnings of our economic institutions. So the public has a very real and vested interest in getting at the truth -- to know what laws may have been broken, and how we prevent such catastrophe from reoccurring in the future. . . .

MS. BOXER: -- Mr. Lay, my state was bled dry by price gouging. Many pension plans went under -- I shouldn't say went under -- lost hundreds of millions of dollars because there was a limit on what they could put into Enron -- I might say, a limit that I support in 401(k)'s as well. And what you did to the employees was without conscience. That's how I feel.
I'm going to tell this California story in three to four minutes, really using the words of the principals more than anything else. Originally Enron said that California would save billions of dollars by deregulation. This is a quote from Jeffrey Skillings -- under deregulation, California, "would save about $8.9 billion per year." But that didn't happen, Mr. Chairman. As a result of the market manipulation during this deregulation, California paid a huge amount for electricity. And let's look at this.
We went from paying 7.4 (billion dollars) for all of our energy needs, the next year to $27.1 billion. Look at this, a 400 percent increase -- or I should 266 percent increase in spending on electricity and a 4 percent increase in demand.
So while the administration was saying you use too much electricity, we had gone up 4 percent; prices went up 266 percent. Californians were begging for help. We were asking FERC to help us. Right before you and Senator Feinstein did your bill, Bob Filner and I did ours -- the same bill: FERC, please impose some type of cost-based pricing. Nothing really happened.
What was Enron saying during this crisis? Jeffrey Skillings, quote: "We are the good guys. We are on the side of the angels." That's what he was saying in public. But what Enron was really thinking was that California was being played for a fool.
And this is what he said on a conference call: "You know what the difference is between the State of California and the Titanic? At least when the Titanic went down, the lights were on." So in public, we're the good guys; in private, making jokes that our consumers were being destroyed. . . . 
MS. CARNAHAN: -- We want to know how one of the nation's largest corporations, under your watch, evaporated in a matter of months. We want to know -- have an explanation for why the man who was at the helm of the ship allowed it to sink. Like passengers aboard the Titanic, thousands were blissfully unaware that hidden below the water line lurked a danger over which they had no control. Surely you have some explanation for this unparalleled corporate tragedy and erosion of moral values. . . . I will continue to ask the question that I find so terribly haunting, a question that gets to those core values that define us as Americans; I want to know why no one in authority at Enron stood up and said, "This is wrong.". . .

MR. ALLEN: -- This Enron situation and the questions surrounding this financial implosion have shaken the credibility of the current system of securities standards. It has brought to bear questions as to the ethics, the accuracy of accountants' reports, those of consultants, lawyers, and corporate boards, as well as questioning even the safeguards and the people who are supposed to ensure that, whether they are employees and retirees or other investors, have accurate information. And all of this we see with the evaporation of people's retirement savings, with the collapse of the Enron stock.
Moreover, it's been said by Senator Smith, Senator Ensign, and others, is -- what you have here, Mr. Lay, is something that when I speak to Boy Scout groups and others, it's -- I don't know who the quote is from, but here's where the sadness is. There's a saying that when wealth is lost, a little bit is lost. When health is lost, something significant is lost. But when character is lost, all is lost.
Officers of publicly traded companies have a primary responsibility and duty to serve honestly -- serve honestly -- the owners of the company, the shareholders. Clearly, the chief officers of Enron failed in their duty and shamefully breached that trust. That is a sad situation, and it's a responsibility you will bear, maybe not in this committee, but in your conscience and, I know, when you go to sleep every night. . . .

MR. HOLLINGS: -- Well, much has been said about the development of a culture of corporate corruption, but there's also the culture of political corruption. And maybe we can get some good out of this whole situation, in that there's no better example than "Kenny Boy" than cash-and-carry government. I mean, I hope that this shames us into acting over on the House side and then on the Senate side, and sends a campaign reform bill to the president. We've got to clean up our own act, and maybe that's the good we'll get out of this situation. Mr. Lay, will you please take the witness chair there. (Witness sworn.) Thank you. Mr. Lay, do you have a statement for the committee?

MR. LAY: -- Mr. Chairman, I come here today with a profound sadness about what has happened to Enron, its current and former employees, retirees, shareholders and other stakeholders. I've also wanted to respond to the best of my knowledge and recollection to the questions you and your colleagues have about the collapse of Enron. I have, however, been instructed by my counsel not to testify, based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights.
I am deeply troubled about asserting these rights, because it may be perceived by some that I have something to hide. But after agonizing consideration, I cannot disregard my counsel's instruction. Therefore, I must respectfully decline to answer, on Fifth Amendment grounds, all the questions of this committee and subcommittee and those of any other congressional committee and subcommittee.
When providing their instruction, my counsel referred me to an excerpt from a unanimous Supreme Court decision of less than a year ago, "One of the Fifth Amendment's basic functions is to protect innocent men." I respectfully ask you not to draw a negative inference because I am asserting my Fifth Amendment constitutional protection on instruction of counsel.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Plan Would Trim 1,600 Police Jobs via Attrition 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
In a striking signal of New York City's financial distress, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to announce today that he will cut the size of the police force by trimming the jobs of 1,600 officers through attrition, according to officials who have been briefed on the mayor's budget.
 The reduction in uniformed positions will lower the size of the police force to 39,110. The Fire Department, with 11,500 uniformed members, is also scheduled to lose about 275 firefighter positions, the officials said. 
 The cutback would be the first planned reduction in the police force in more than a decade, although the department has struggled in recent years to maintain its strength in the face of a surge in retirements. Department staffing is already being stretched to meet the demand of increased security at landmarks and transportation hubs because of the elevated possibility of terrorism. 
The cutback also would signal a new era in police tactics, distinct from the days of the Giuliani administration when the city was able to rely on an ever-expanding supply of officers to fight crime.
Police officials said recent attrition had already forced them to operate effectively with fewer officers for many months of the year, and they noted that crime continued to decline in recent months. In addition, they said the city intended to hire 800 lower-paid civilians who will assume the clerical and maintenance work now done by officers, freeing those officers to return to patrol. 
"We're prepared to handle this," one senior police official said. "We do not expect a diminishment in services or in crime-fighting."
Budget officials decided personnel cutbacks were the only way the Fire and Police Departments could reduce their spending by 5 percent as Mr. Bloomberg had requested to offset a budget deficit of more than $4 billion for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The $3.3 billion police budget for next year is expected to be trimmed by about $180 million while the fire budget is to be cut by about $50 million. The officials said spending for other agencies were expected to be cut by as much as 20 percent in the budget that Mr. Bloomberg will announce today. Page B4. 
The staffing reduction is likely to stun many rank-and-file officers and firefighters. The police and fire budgets had survived relatively unscathed for much of the last eight years, and both departments are still recovering from the loss of 366 members on Sept. 11.
"The morale is pretty low in the Police Department," said Capt. John Driscoll, president of the Captains Endowment Association, the union that represents many police supervisors. "If this really comes to pass, I think the attitude of officers may be, 'If crime goes up, don't blame me.' "
Since 1992, the police force has been increasing steadily in size, and officials pointed to the larger force as essential to the historic drop in crime. For the last two years, the Police Department has hit a peak strength of 40,710 officers, although it has experienced increasing difficulty maintaining that strength because so many officers are retiring and the number of people interested in replacing them has fallen off.
For example, since July, when the department last reached its peak strength, so many officers have left the department that only 38,100 are on the force now. In other years, the department has struggled to find enough candidates to get back to its authorized strength. Next year, the officials said, they will only try to hire a police class large enough to rebuild the uniform force back up to 39,110.
"As a law enforcement advocate, I don't like to see a reduction in police strength," said Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission. "But there are financial realities that cannot be ignored, and I believe the department is very well managed." 
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has been grappling with the staffing issue since he took over in January, and he has spoken often of how he hoped to retain as many officers as possible. In fact, senior police officials said, Mr. Kelly had argued in budget discussions that it would be difficult to convince business that the city is serious about preventing terrorist disruptions if it cut the force, although he also acknowledged that the city's financial circumstances were exceptional.
Budget officials decided it was impossible to make up the deficit without some sacrifice by the police, especially when other agencies were being cut so severely. 
The Police Department is so laden with personnel expenses, which make up 95 percent of its operating budget, that jobs had to be lost if spending was to be cut substantially, the officials said. 
A month ago, Mr. Kelly acknowledged that a budget cloud was forming over his agency when he conceded that many of his plans would depend upon finding the money to finance them. 
"There are things I would like to see done that at the end of the day may not be able to be done because of the impact on the budget," he said in an interview.
After the reductions, New York City will still have by far the largest police force in the country. Even the per capita ratio for New York is among highest of the nation's cities.
Mr. Bloomberg's decision is a politically treacherous one, nonetheless, because it will allow for second-guessing if crime begins to climb, some members of the department said. 
Not even Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic opponent in the mayoral race, Mark Green, had suggested during the campaign that the police force be cut. After Sept. 11, many people said the rationale for a larger police force had only grown.
The events of that day also significantly hurt the economic engine that the city needed to finance a large force, said Harvey Robins, the city's director of operations under former Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
"I think this is a bold decision but a necessary one given the enormity of the budget gap, which was certainly exacerbated by the terrorist attack," Mr. Robins said.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the effect of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's preliminary budget on the Police Department misstated the proposal for the Fire Department. It calls for hiring 73 more firefighters, not eliminating 275.

Al Gore said last night that the time had come for a "final reckoning" with Iraq, describing the country as a "virulent threat in a class by itself" and suggesting that the United States should consider ways to oust President Saddam Hussein. 
 In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Gore generally praised President Bush's performance since Sept. 11, but raised questions about how Mr. Bush had worked with other nations in the war in Afghanistan and against Al Qaeda. 
 The former Democratic vice president, in the first of what aides said would be four speeches intended to set the agenda for the 2002 Congressional elections -- and perhaps for another White House bid by Mr. Gore -- went to great lengths to avoid being portrayed as criticizing a sitting president during a war.
Nevertheless, his speech marked the first time that Mr. Gore has even hinted at the different ways in which he might have responded to the Sept. 11 attacks had he not lost the presidency to Mr. Bush in November 2000.
In particular, Mr. Gore said the president had not paid enough attention to cultivating the kind of multination effort that Mr. Gore argued was essential to countering a threat of terrorism, instead relying on a unilateral approach.
"The administration in which I served looked at the challenges we faced in the world and said we wished to tackle these with others, if possible; alone, if we must," Mr. Gore said. "This administration sometimes seems inclined to stand that on its head, so that the message is, with others, if we must; by ourselves, if possible. 
"The coalition so skillfully assembled by the president is one that may dissipate as rapidly as it coalesced, unless we make an investment in its permanence, beginning with a more evident respect on our part for the views and interests of its members," he said. 
Mr. Gore, speaking four miles from the ruins of the World Trade Center, applauded Mr. Bush for singling out Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil" in his State of the Union address. But Mr. Gore argued that there were underlying forces in the Islamic world that were encouraging anti-American sentiment and breeding terrorism that the United States needed to urgently address. 
"There is another axis of evil in the world: poverty and ignorance; disease and environmental disorder; corruption and political oppression," he said. "We may well put down terror in its present manifestations. But if we do not attend to the larger fundamentals as well, then the ground is fertile and has been seeded for the next generation of those born to hate the United States of America."
Mr. Gore's speech last night pointed to what aides said would be a new higher-profile chapter in his political life, as he seeks to emerge from the shadows of his defeat and a war that largely froze political activity for nearly five months. "A lot of people have let me know they wished that I had been speaking out on public affairs long before now," Mr. Gore said to a generally friendly audience.
Still, Mr. Gore clearly found himself in a difficult situation as he tried to distinguish himself from an extraordinarily popular president, without seeming to be critical of him during a time of crisis.
The former vice president, who now has a gray beard, drew rolling laugher from the crowd with a series of self-deprecating jokes.
"I am Al Gore," he said with practiced stiffness. "I used to be the next president of the United States."
Mr. Gore's speech lasted exactly 30 minutes. It was written with the assistance of Leon Fuerth, who was Mr. Gore's chief foreign policy aide in the White House.
In advocating that the administration consider whether the time had come to try to remove Mr. Hussein, Mr. Gore seemed to be in line with Mr.Bush's emerging policy.
But if Mr. Gore found himself on the same side as the White House about what to do now about Mr. Hussein, he was sharply critical of the way Mr. Bush's father had handled the matter during the 1991 war against Iraq. Mr. Gore noted that, back then, Mr. Hussein "was allowed to survive his defeat as the result of a calculation we all had reason to deeply regret for the ensuing decade -- and still do."
"So this time, if we resort to force, we must absolutely get it right," he said.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Set to Vote on Newmont MiningDeals 

BYLINE:  By JULIE DUNN 

 BODY:
Shareholders of Newmont Mining are expected to vote today to approve the acquisition of Normandy Mining of Australia and Franco-Nevada of Canada, a near-final moment in the protracted bidding war known as the Battle of Normandy.
 In an interview this week in his Denver offices, Newmont's chief executive, Wayne W. Murdy, discussed the challenges facing the combined gold mining company. "When I look at goals for Newmont going forward, it's getting a high rate of return on investments, being a low-cost producer and maintaining a quality reserve base," Mr. Murdy said. "Those are the three key drivers." 
 The deal to create what is being called the "new Newmont," already approved by regulators and Franco-Nevada shareholders, and expected to be approved by Normandy shareholders by the end of the week, will make Newmont the world's largest gold producer, with an annual output of 8.2 million ounces, mines in 22 countries and 94,000 square miles of exploration properties, an area about the size of Britain.
Newmont has been a strong opponent of hedging against a drop in the price of gold, which has been largely stagnant. And Mr. Murdy defended the strategy. The company, he said, "while unhedged and therefore offering the upside potential to the investors, has a very strong balance sheet and very strong cash flow." 
"Given the land position that Newmont and Normandy have, this is a business that we think can grow," Mr. Murdy added. "That's the kind of natural hedge that we're building into this company."
He also said that he thought that gold could sustain its recent rally, adding that an expected drop in production levels by 3 to 4 percent a year over the next several years will build up strength in the price. The price yesterday hovered around $300 an ounce.
"I could easily see $350 or $400 prices coming back over the intermediate term," he said. "Gold mining is a long business cycle. From the time you start exploring until the time you get gold in production, it can easily be five to seven years. The price will rise faster than the production can increase to offset it."
Mr. Murdy said, "I think that consolidation is a trend that will continue -- it's all about scale and being extremely efficient in your use of capital and your cost structure." He expects the combined Newmont to save $70 million to $80 million a year from such efficiencies.
Newmont plans to pursue so-called property rationalization in Nevada, northern Ontario and Australia, with companies like Barrick Gold and Placer Dome of Canada, and AngloGold of South Africa -- its foe in the Normandy bidding war. That means the efficient use of processing operations owned by different companies in the same region. AngloGold is a unit of Anglo American.
"I also think that you'll see a much more rational approach to how properties are operated within various producing regions," Mr. Murdy said. "Newmont wants to be very aggressive in this development."
After Newmont's $2.3 billion takeover of Normandy, approximately 70 percent of its production will be in North America and Australia. Australia is currently the world's third-largest gold producer, after South Africa and the United States.
"Clearly the weakness of the Australian dollar has made Australian mining more attractive from an economic standpoint," said Mr. Murdy, who also noted that the development of larger mines there in the last decade has been a major factor in foreign interest. "We were not exposed to Australia and it's a good place to be. The potential for growth there is very strong."
Newmont has pledged to opportunistically unwind Normandy's hedging operations. It also plans to sell about 10 percent of Normandy's current holdings.
Mr. Murdy said he believed that Newmont, as the largest nonhedged gold producer, would be able to provide shareholders with stability at lower gold prices, while also gaining the greatest benefit when gold prices rise.
"This company at $350 or $400 gold prices can make a lot of money," he said.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Literary Davids Among Goliaths

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
One needs audacity and imagination and a passion for books quite remarkable to become a small, independent book publisher these days, because the communal territory is jammed with large houses capable of gobbling up every manuscript there is with their economic and editorial muscle. For the small publisher, no matter how eclectic, it's rather like being an elegant lightweight boxer doing speedy zigging and zagging in a ring with a heavyweight. 
 Happily for readers and writers, there are enough of these gritty people with their determination to do some serious literary publishing that the giants won't. The Small Publishers Association of North America has more than 1,300 members, and there are more than that in the field. Many are niche operations. Others do a variety of genres; they are miniature versions of large houses in their range. A handful of these small general-interest independent book publishers are in New York, putting them right smack in the competitive swirl of the world's center for churning out books. 
 No matter. Everyone knows book publishing is an easy thing to do, just as everyone knows he can run a baseball team or put out a newspaper. The business model for these small houses permits them to produce print runs of 3,000 or 4,000 or 5,000 copies and still have a chance for profit. Larger houses need minimums of 12,000 or 15,000 copies, virtually eliminating the likelihood that they will take a chance on the experimental. Would one of today's conglomerate publishing houses be the first to publish Joyce's "Ulysses"? Not likely.
Two of the several general-interest small houses flourishing in New York are Overlook Press and Persea Books, at the opposite ends of "small." Overlook does about 45 new hardcover titles a year and about 45 new trade paperbacks and has 18 employees. Persea, with only four employees, publishes 12 to 15. By comparison, Random House Inc.'s eight divisions publish a total of more than 3,500 books a year.
Independence, adventure and peril make small publishing invigorating. Peter Mayer, founder and publisher of Overlook, explains his satisfaction this way: "All our books feel very close to me." He explains his adventure this way: "We have our happy accidents." Definition of a happy accident: purchasing and publishing "The Royal Physician's Visit" by the Swedish novelist Per Olov Enquist for a modest advance and then selling the paperback rights to Simon & Schuster for $77,000. The book is "a literary masterpiece," Mr. Mayer said, "and how many novels can you say that about?" Well, masterpiece or not, it's at least the definition of a good literary sensibility.
Overlook's biggest coup since Mr. Mayer started it in 1971 could be called a sublimely happy accident. Bitten for a moment by the bug to be nearly big, he paid a reported advance of $50,000 to $100,000 to Robert Littell for his novel about the C.I.A., "The Company," which will be published in April. This was a high-risk leap for a small house, "like scaling Annapurna" in Mr. Mayer's words. But then he was able to sell the reprint rights in nine foreign countries and the paperback rights to Penguin for $225,000. The advance, modest by the standards of a large house, perhaps supports his faith that "Littell is the best espionage writer in the U.S.," and faith is often what small publishing is about.
Generally, a small independent house can maybe make a modest, marginal profit on 3,000 copies if the author's advance is in the $5,000 neighborhood. Most of their advances are from $3,000 to $7,500.
Persea Press publishes 12 to 15 new titles a year, mostly literary: poetry, first novels and occasionally second novels. It was founded 26 years ago by Karen Braziller, its editorial director, and her husband, Michael Braziller, the publisher, and its recent catalog includes the reprint of Oscar Hijuelos's first novel, "Our House in the Last World," and the "Poems of Nazim Hikmet," the Turkish poet. (Mr. Hijuelos won the Pulitzer Prize in 1989 for his Farrar, Straus & Giroux novel, "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love.") Most Persea printings are about 3,000 copies, but some are 8,000 or 10,000.
Publishing literary books hasn't been too profitable in recent years for large or small publishers, so Persea sort of invented a new type of educational book for the classroom. These are theme anthologies, Mr. Braziller said.
For instance, Persea is publishing "America Street," edited by Anne Mazer, a collection of short stories with each centering around a different ethnic background that can be used from the sixth grade through college, and "Fishing for Chickens," edited by Jim Heynen, for middle- and high-school students studying rural America. It has 16 stories, including one by Alice Walker.
Mrs. Braziller said: "We have a very small list spread over many areas and are competing with large companies that also have lists in each of those areas. We came up with these anthologies that are literary in nature but conceived for the purpose of teaching." 
Mr. Braziller said: "We were publishing what we loved, and we noticed some of our books were being used in colleges. That gave us the idea for the anthologies. We continue to publish the literary stuff that we like, but we've survived because of the educational books that pay the bills."
There are lots of Annapurnas in book land. So it's a nervy business being a small independent publisher. What makes it exhilarating is the taking of risks for a belief in a certain type of book, a particular author. Which is why, Mr. Mayer said, "alongside the giant houses, there's always room for the smaller companies."

HEADLINE: Talking More but Enjoying It Less 

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY SELINGO 

 BODY:
LISA KING bought a cellphone two and a half years ago to keep in constant contact with her husband, her job and her friends. But these days it seems like she is out of touch more often than ever.
 Her calls are often abruptly cut off or don't go through at all. Voice mail messages are sometimes delivered hours after they are left. She cannot even get a signal within a two-block radius of her home in Arlington, Va., just outside Washington. 
 "It just doesn't make sense because their advertisements make it sound like you can get clear service, anytime, anywhere," Ms. King, a technical recruiter, said of her Sprint PCS phone. "But it's completely unreliable." 
Many other cellphone owners agree. The ranks of wireless subscribers have ballooned in the last few years, and so have the number of complaints about service, analysts who study the industry say. 
Cellphone companies logged more customer-service calls per user than any other utility in the 12-month period ended last spring -- nearly three times as many calls as local telephone service providers, for instance -- according to a survey by the research and consulting firm J. D. Power & Associates. Last year the Federal Communications Commission counted more than 3,000 complaints about cellphone companies in the third quarter alone, compared with 48 about cable television companies. Nearly one-third of the cellphone complaints were about the quality of service or about false promises in advertising. 
People have been complaining virtually since the portable cellphone was introduced nearly three decades ago. But the industry's runaway growth in the mid-1990's brought an explosion in complaints as companies struggled to add enough capacity to keep up with the demand. The expansion -- and the struggle -- continue.
The number of wireless subscribers in the United States has more than doubled since 1998, to some 130 million today, as new customers are lured by offers of free long-distance service and inexpensive phones. Cellphone subscribers are also talking more than ever before, thanks to so-called bucket plans that include thousands of free minutes of use every month. Subscribers use their cellphones an average of 422 minutes a month, an increase of 75 percent from 242 two years ago. 
All that talking is taxing the capacity of the country's wireless system. Cellphone companies have been unable to build enough new cell towers or squeeze the capacity they need out of existing ones. As a result, subscribers complain of disconnected calls or busy signals caused by overloading of the networks. Others are frustrated when roaming charges appear on their bills because the signal proved weak in their local service areas or for calls within areas included on those colorful coverage maps. Some customers say they are tired of waiting so long for voice-mail messages from missed calls. 
No wireless provider in the country is free of complaints about service. For every satisfied customer, it seems, there is a horror story. About 15 percent of wireless customers have switched providers in the last 12 months, nearly double the level of four years ago, J. D. Power said. Many subscribers have given up trying to resolve problems with the cellphone companies and have taken their grievances to the F.C.C. or a state attorney general's office. A few have filed lawsuits seeking refunds. 
Wireless service providers say they are expanding their networks as fast as they can, tripling the number of cell sites since 1997 to more than 114,000. It is still not enough, however, and the addition of new sites, cellphone executives say, often meets with resistance from the same people who complain about service in the area. What is more, executives say, some customers expect too much from a service that essentially depends on radio waves traveling through the air. 
"At the end of the day," said Dan Wilinsky, a spokesman for Sprint PCS, the country's fourth-largest carrier, "we're talking about mobile phones, not land lines. Expectations are sky-high of digital coverage all the time, everywhere. But if you're in the heart of New York City, in between tall buildings or in a steel-door elevator, you may not get service. In rural areas, we're not going to have full coverage until cows talk." 
Customers say it is the cellphone carriers who have set the bar high with unrealistic promises in advertisements or on Web sites like that of VoiceStream, which boasts of service "whenever, wherever." 
"The wireless operators certainly present an image of ubiquitous coverage in their advertising campaigns," said Philip Marshall, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm. "But the days are gone when subscribers were more accepting of poor network performance. They have increased expectations because they're more reliant on the phones." 
Beth Case, a sign-language interpreter in Fresno, Calif., grew so frustrated with her Cingular phone service at one point last year that she stopped her car at a pay phone when she needed directions to a client's home. "It totally defeated the purpose of having a cellphone," she said. Of the 100 calls on her bill one month, she said, fewer than 20 of them lasted for more than two minutes because calls were continually dropped. 
Ms. Case switched to Sprint PCS in November and said she had had no problems so far. 
Cingular officials acknowledged that they had difficulty meeting consumer demand in California last year but said that service in the state had improved. The problems were compounded because California is "one of the more stringent jurisdictions" when it comes to building new cell sites, said Ed Reynolds, president for network operations at Cingular. 
"Frankly, customers just exceeded our expectations," Mr. Reynolds said. "We were victims of our own success." 
All wireless carriers have capacity problems. The range of a cellular site varies from a city block to about five miles in radius in a rural area, and the site can handle only a finite number of calls. If a site is full, new callers get a busy signal. When callers move into cells that are full, their calls may be dropped. 
Cellphone signals are purposely weak, so that a channel carrying a call in one cell can also be used in a nearby cell without creating interference. 
Weak signals sometimes fail to penetrate buildings, making a cellphone virtually useless indoors. That is what happened to Solie Swan when he decided to rely solely on wireless service for his Denver media business after seeing a commercial showing a woman talking on a cellphone and using her wired phone as a meat tenderizer. At times, Mr. Swan must step into his parking lot to carry on a conversation using his Verizon phone. 
"They sell it as if it's totally reliable," Mr. Swan said, "but then tell you when you complain that it's not guaranteed to work." 
Digital phones, in particular, are likely to fade as the distance from a cell site increases because they operate at higher frequencies. When a digital signal is too weak or the system is too busy, some cellphones switch to backup analog networks, which typically carry high roaming charges for some users and make features such as caller ID or text messaging unusable. 
A crowded network also slows down the delivery of the alerts sent to cellphones to notify users that they have received voice mail. Ms. King, the technical recruiter from Washington, said that some of her messages arrived up to six hours after they were left. She said she once missed a meeting because she received a message too late. 
"I now spend a lot of time calling in to the office to make sure nothing has changed," Ms. King said. 
Sprint PCS says that fewer than 1 percent of its messages are delayed more than a few minutes. 
Frustrated customers have few places to turn if their carriers fail to respond to their complaints. In New York, several cellphone users are suing AT&T Wireless over its Digital One Rate plan, accusing the company of false advertising because they were consistently unable to get service in their home calling areas. "AT&T came out with the plan prematurely, before the network was up to handle the demand," said Jacqueline Sailer, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 
Regulatory pressure on the cellphone carriers to improve service is building. Attorneys general in 22 states have asked several wireless companies to provide information on their advertising and billing practices. Representative Anthony Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat, is sponsoring legislation that would require the F.C.C. to collect more detailed complaint statistics, much as the Department of Transportation compiles complaints about lost luggage and the on-time performance of airlines. 
"If you go pick up a flyer, it looks like they cover all of metropolitan New York," Mr. Weiner said. "But if they were to portray that accurately, it would look more like Swiss cheese." 
Wireless service providers said that the coverage maps were not meant to depict actual service, but rather approximately where rates apply. "It's extremely difficult to have good maps," said Monica Mears, a Cingular spokeswoman. "You could have coverage above a bridge, but not below it, for instance." 
Cellphone companies find out about gaps in their coverage not only from customer complaints, but also by testing their networks and those of their competitors. Eleven days a month, for example, Verizon dispatches 50 vehicles outfitted with eight phones apiece from various carriers that dial a central computer every two and a half minutes. 
On a recent afternoon, Greg Booze, a Verizon tester, drove a specially equipped Ford Explorer down a busy thoroughfare into Washington during rush hour. Once the phones connected, they sent out a series of voice commands to test call quality. On this day, Verizon and several other carriers were lucky. None of their calls were disconnected. But at least one call on three systems -- AT&T, Cingular and VoiceStream -- was dropped during the seven-mile trip.
Customers should also test phones before signing a long-term deal, said Mr. Wilinsky of Sprint PCS. "Don't take our word for it," he said. "Take it for a test drive." Most providers offer a money-back guarantee if the customer returns the phone within a few days.
Otherwise the buyer may be stuck with the phone, sometimes for up to two years unless he pays a steep fee. Cingular waived the fee for Ms. Case after she posted several complaints on Internet message boards. (Nearly every cellphone company says it regularly monitors complaint sites.) 
Another reason people don't switch when problems crop up is the bother of changing phones and numbers. "I have a really easy phone number," said Chris Salko, who has stopped using his VoiceStream phone to make critical sales calls in his job near Philadelphia. "If there were some way to take the number with me, I'd probably move to a new service."

HEADLINE: Cuban Cash Reopens U.S. Food Trade 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
After 40 frozen years, direct exports of American food to Cuba have begun to flow again in the last few months. 
 So far it is just a trickle -- $35 million worth -- as companies take advantage of a new law that grudgingly lifts part of the embargo that forbade American companies to sell almost anything directly to Cuba because of its Communist government. For a while it looked as if even that much would not get through because the law still forbids sales on credit and because the Cubans sent mixed signals for months about their attitude toward the new law and its restrictions. 
 But in recent months, thousands of tons of rice, corn, wheat, frozen chicken legs and pork lard have been delivered to Cuba by major American suppliers. 
And -- a crucial point -- it has been paid for.
To seal deals, the American suppliers who lobbied for the right to sell to Cuba had to overcome obstacles that ranged from the simple to the sublime. "The phone lines were so bad, and I had so much trouble getting through on the telephone or by fax, that we handled all the arrangements from our office in France," said Arthur Otto, president of Schouten USA in Minneapolis, which represents the American unit of Groupe Soufflet, a major French grain trader that has been trading with Cuba for a decade.
Such problems slowed everything, as did new bureaucratic delays and a business culture gap between the Cubans and the Americans. 
But when it came time for the American companies to be paid, problems disappeared. Though Cuban-American members of Congress added a cash-only clause to the legislation, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, with the intention of making it almost impossible for Cuba to buy any food under the law, Cuba has paid in full in each of the 13 largest deals so far.
"We had no trouble collecting payment," said Larry Cunningham, senior vice president for corporate affairs for Archer Daniels Midland, which has shipped nearly 95,000 tons of grain to Cuba since November.
Other American suppliers have had similar experiences. "In some cases, payment was obtained when the products were loaded onto vessels in the United States," said John S. Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a business group that tracks developments in Cuba. "In others, payment was obtained when the shipment reached Cuba."
The payment record is unusual for Cuba, which owes billions of dollars to countries that have been selling it food during the embargo.
The country is rated a very high debt risk by Dun & Bradstreet; of 131 countries reviewed, only 5 -- Angola, Congo, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Iraq -- are considered worse deadbeats. Critics of Cuba, who oppose lifting any part of the embargo, say the Castro government succeeded in paying the American companies only by diverting cash from grain suppliers in other countries, suppliers that are already owed billions of dollars.
"They are robbing Peter to pay Paul," said Dennis Hays, a former American ambassador to Guyana and Suriname who is now executive vice president of the Cuban American National Foundation, which opposes trade with Fidel Castro's regime. "They are taking the money they had to pay down the debt to the Europeans and Japanese and using it to make these purchases."
Mr. Hays said it was no coincidence that Cuba was buying food from American subsidiaries of international food suppliers with which Cuba has been doing business -- and piling up debts -- for years, like Groupe Soufflet and Louis Dreyfuss of France.
The Cubans have also signed deals with companies like Perdue Farms, Pilgrim's Pride, Riceland Foods, Tyson Foods and Marsh Supermarkets. In all, their purchases exceed 220,000 tons. 
Executives of some of the American companies said that they did not care where the money came from, as long as they were paid. 
"We got no sense from them that the Cubans were paying for the purchases by transferring funds," said Jim Bohlander, vice president and general manager of the Cargill Americas Marketing Group, based in Miami. Cargill was among the first to close a deal with the Cubans, for 26,400 tons of yellow corn. "They said the funds were coming out of some type of emergency reserve that was set aside to alleviate the impact of Hurricane Michelle," he added
Shortly after Cuba was devastated by Michelle last fall, officials in Havana sent faxes to a long list of American food suppliers asking for bids to sell Cuba a range of goods. That step abruptly reversed Cuba's previous policy of turning up its nose at American suppliers because of the financing restrictions in the law. 
Hurricane damage gave Cuba a reason -- some critics call it an excuse -- for reversing that stand, at least temporarily. But after the first round of sales in November and December, Cuba went back to Tyson Foods and other suppliers and placed new orders, a step suggesting that the change was more than temporary.
Always short of cash, Cuba has strong reasons for wanting the embargo on food sales lifted. It imports more than $1 billion a year in food and grain, most of that from Europe and Asia. Switching to American suppliers would save 15 to 20 percent on shipping, a large part of the total cost of the commodities, because the United States is so much closer. A freighter full of rice, for example, may take 12 days to reach Cuba from France, while a ship from Texas can make it in 3 days.
Cuba has been handling the transportation of the food it has bought from Cargill, chartering Mexican ships to pick up the goods in New Orleans and carry them to Havana. 
Complications arose from the Cubans' lack of knowledge of American standards and regulations -- not surprising after Cuba's 40-year absence from that market -- and also from Cuban health and sanitary specifications. American executives said Cuba's regulations in that sphere were more demanding than those of other export markets, so they had to take extra steps to comply.
Whether the recent purchases prove to be an anomaly or the opening of a new market for American farmers depends largely on the Cubans. President Castro, who has recently toned down his attacks on the United States, said earlier this month that he might buy more American food this year but that any purchases next year would be contingent on the lifting of financing restrictions.

HEADLINE: In Shift, British Airways Looks to Coach 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
After years of pinning its fortunes to the deep pockets of business travelers, British Airways announced a strategic flip-flop today, saying that it would try to compete with Europe's booming budget airlines by offering cheaper travel over the Internet to passengers in coach.
 The move came eight months after British Airways sold its budget airline, Go, only to see rivals like Ryanair and EasyJet add routes, passengers and profits. 
 The change in strategy was coupled with an additional 5,800 job cuts as British Airways searched for a way to return to profitability after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The job cuts, along with other measures announced today will reduce the size of the British Airways fleet and the number of destinations. The measures are intended to save $930 million a year by March 2004. 
The attacks in New York and Washington damaged British Airways more than competitors because it depended on trans-Atlantic business travelers for most of its profit. Travel to and from North America has fallen by about a third since Sept. 11. Some British Airways advertisements recently have been aimed at trying to get business passengers to resume flying. 
Last week, British Airways said it had lost $:144 million, or $205 million, in the third quarter, and analysts said it might be headed for its biggest annual loss since it was privatized 15 years ago.
Rod Eddington, the chief executive, said that in addition to cutting jobs for the second time since Sept. 11, British Airways would also end flights on 10 routes, sell some airplanes and try to lure budget passengers onto its European networks.
The moves, he said, will create "a simpler, leaner, more focused airline." 
The airline said it would reduce its fleet by 49 planes, to around 300, cut back its presence at Gatwick Airport near London and fly to 15 fewer destinations. The cutbacks will cost about $285 million over two years, the airline said.
With the latest layoffs, mainly affecting administrative and support staff, British Airways will have reduced its work force by 13,000 -- almost a quarter -- from 56,700 last August. More than 150,000 workers in the airline industry lost their jobs worldwide after Sept. 11.
The latest layoffs at British Airways stunned union leaders. "We expected mild surgery but what we have got is butchery," said Bill Morris, the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union.
Analysts and investors said the layoffs and other cuts would probably not resolve the airline's problems. Howard Wheeldon, an analyst with the brokerage firm Prudential Bache, said the moves "go only half the distance" toward a radical remaking of the airline with less exposures to losses on European and domestic flights.
"They can't turn this unwieldy beast around without abandoning a history of being all things to all men," Mr. Wheeldon said. Reflecting those worries, British Airways shares fell by as much as 8 percent today before recovering. They closed in London at 199.75 pence, down 2 percent. The stock has fallen by more than half in the last 12 months.
In a conference call, Mr. Eddington said British Airways did not plan to create a budget airline but would model some of its unprofitable short-haul European operations on no-frills carriers. Airlines like EasyJet have been taking away both economy and business travelers from full-service carriers.
Paradoxically, one of Mr. Eddington's moves after taking over British Airways in May 2000, was to sell its low-frills Go subsidiary to private investors last June. Last month, Go reported a 74 percent increase in passenger numbers in January.
Mr. Eddington said British Airways planned to be "a more aggressive and competitive player in the short-haul game." The company plans to offer lower ticket prices for economy class travel by reducing its costs and cutting out travel agents' commissions by encouraging Internet bookings.
"We have a much bigger short-haul network than any of them," Mr. Eddington said, "and we must continue to play to our strengths. But we've got to take some key learners from them to run our short-haul business more intelligently."
The remarks contrasted sharply with the airline's former disdain for economy travelers and discount carriers in favor of business passengers paying top dollar. 
Because of deregulation in Britain, discount airlines have built a major presence and are only beginning to set up Continental European operating bases. That means British Airways faces far keener competition from budget airlines than European rivals like Lufthansa and Air France.
"They recognize for the first time that there's competition out there," Mr. Wheeldon, the analyst, said.

HEADLINE: ABB Seeks Return of Some Severance Benefits 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power and technology group plunged into red ink by huge charges for restructuring costs and asbestos liability exposure, said today that it wanted two former chief executives to give back some of their combined $138 million in severance and pension benefits.
 In a statement coinciding with the company's announcement of its first annual loss ever, ABB's board said it would seek the return of money "paid in excess of obligations" to Goran Lindahl and to Percy Barnevik, the architect of the 1987 merger that created the company. 
 ABB had been expected to post a loss for 2001 after its announcement two weeks ago that it would nearly double its provisions for settlement costs in asbestos-related litigation in the United States. The company put the year's net loss at $691 million today and said it would not pay a dividend for the year. 
Once regarded as one of Europe's best managed companies, ABB has struggled lately with surprise executive departures, slack sales in its core power and technology equipment markets, and a legacy of asbestos liability from a former American unit, Combustion Engineering.
Mr. Barnevik gave up the chief executive post in 1996 but remained chairman until last November, when he unexpectedly resigned, saying he bore some responsibility for the company's sagging fortunes in recent years. He received some $89 million in pension benefits from the company when he left.
Mr. Lindahl, who succeeded Mr. Barnevik as chief executive, left in early 2001 and received $49 million in pension and other benefits. 
Mr. Barnevik told reporters today that the company had approved his compensation. Mr. Lindahl told news agencies through a spokesman that as far as he was aware, proper procedures were followed in determining his benefits. 
Jorgen Centerman, the company's current chief executive, declined to elaborate on the board's plan to recover money from the men. But analysts said that whatever its intentions, the board's action had called the company's compensation structure into question and might provoke squabbling that would further undermine investor confidence.
Beyond asbestos, ABB took charges against last year's earnings for insurance underwriting losses, some connected to the Sept. 11 terror attacks ($138 million); accounting changes in ABB's reinsurance unit ($295 million); write-offs of good will ($288 million); and restructuring costs ($231 million).
In a telephone interview, Mr. Centerman was upbeat about reviving the company's sales. Revenues rose 3 percent, to $23.7 billion for the year. "What we started last year, we have delivered," he said. "We will have an increase of 4 to 5 percent" in 2002, he added, and earn a profit "even if economic growth remains flat."
Investors, unpersuaded that the company had turned the corner on its problems, bid ABB's American depository receipts down 6.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Farmers in Peru Are Turning Again to Coca Crop 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CACHICOTO, Peru, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
His farm filled with money-losing crops, Francisco Torres had begun to despair that he could ever make ends meet in this green river valley in northern Peru. Then tens of thousands of acres of coca were eradicated in neighboring Colombia in a vast American-backed campaign of aerial fumigation.
 The tightening supply has pushed the price of coca to new highs in recent months, drug market analysts say, making legitimate crops even less appealing while opening fresh opportunities for Mr. Torres and his neighbors. Now they are making more room for coca, a crop that Peru had made great strides in eradicating in the 1990's. 
 "We live off coca," said Mr. Torres, 58. "We pay for our harvest with coca money. Without coca, there is no life." 
In at least two river valleys in Peru, for the first time in years, coca, cocaine's main ingredient, is making a comeback, say Peruvian and United Nations antidrug officials. 
The trend does not mean that antinarcotics efforts in the Andes are failing, said analysts who track American antidrug programs. But it does underscore how fleeting victories can be in a drug war where national boundaries mean nothing to traffickers who can shift their crop across remote and poorly policed regions. 
While the reasons for the increase in Peru are complex, most experts attribute it largely to what they call the "balloon effect," in which eradication in one place simply pushes coca growing to another, given the continuing demand for cocaine, principally in the United States. 
Once-successful eradication efforts in Peru had already shifted much production to Colombia, where a $1.3 billion American-financed antidrug effort, called Plan Colombia, has now helped nudge coca growing back here again. 
"The drug mafia knows Plan Colombia would be hard, so they began to automatically move," said Ricardo Vega Llona, Peru's newly named drug czar. "And how do they give incentives to get people to plant? By paying higher prices." 
Even in Colombia, which had more than 400,000 acres dedicated to coca in 2000, new growth has offset eradication efforts, leaving the size of the coca crop steady last year, according to new United Nations estimates.
In Bolivia, where the government declared coca nearly wiped out a year ago, farmers in the Chapare region have continued planting the leaf, with drug traffickers increasingly shipping to Brazil. 
Ecuador has also become an important corridor for coca paste shipped from Colombia, as well as a port for cocaine bound for the United States via Pacific sea routes, said Klaus Nyholm, director for the United Nations Drug Control Program in Colombia and Ecuador.
"This is a footloose industry, and by footloose I mean it always goes to the path of least resistance," said Eduardo Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami. 
In Peru, satellite maps, aerial surveillance and ground assessment work by the United Nations Drug Control Program show that the coca crop has slightly expanded to cover about 125,000 acres in 2001, from 107,000 in 2000. Several Peruvian government officials, including Mr. Vega Llona, say those preliminary figures are accurate.
The shift to Peru comes after years in which the coca crop here was cut by 75 percent -- falling to 84,474 acres in 2000 from 318,000 in 1992, according to American figures -- with a decadelong American-supported program in which the Peruvian forces pulled up coca bushes and intercepted and even shot down drug flights and coca farmers were offered alternative crops. 
The strategy succeeded in collapsing coca prices, destroying coca labs, and disrupting transportation routes. 
But coca did not disappear. One high-ranking State Department official who works on drug issues said coca cultivation was now up 10 to 12 percent in two traditional growing regions of Peru, the Upper Huallaga and Apurimac valleys. 
Other American officials here and in Washington took issue with the United Nations findings on Peru, saying American data for 2001 now being analyzed shows that eradication efforts in Peru have simply slowed. 
The American figures also point to a smaller overall coca crop in Peru than the United Nations figures, putting the total crop at 84,000 acres in 2001, a reduction of 500 acres from the previous year.
Still, American officials are concerned about the new growth in Peru and the rising price for coca leaf, which has shot up to over $4 a kilogram in this region from less than $2 two years ago, increasing its appeal over alternative legal crops.
"That's really high," said James Williard, director of antinarcotics affairs at the American Embassy. "For it to be competitive with coffee or cacao, it needs to be around $1."
American and Peruvian officials blame a range of factors for the new growth, including the political turmoil in Peru after President Alberto K. Fujimori's government collapsed in November 2000. 
The suspension last April of a policy that allowed Peruvian Air Force planes to shoot down drug flights has also permitted trafficking to pick up, Peruvian officials say. The suspension came after a Peruvian fighter plane shot down a private plane carrying American missionaries, killing a woman and her baby. 
American officials, though, remain optimistic about eradication efforts here, noting that antidrug aid to Peru is tripling to about $150 million this year to pay for the renovation of antidrug aircraft and to finance alternative development programs for farmers. More money is likely in the coming years for a sustained, long-range program here and elsewhere in the Andes. 
"It's not a one-year effort," said the State Department official. "It won't work in one year, and I think Congress agrees."
Peru's government has increased the police presence in coca-growing regions, signed a new eradication plan with the American government and declared narcotics a national security issue. American officials in Washington also say that the suspension of the aerial interdiction program may be lifted later this year.
"I anticipate the possibility of making great headway here in the next few years," said John Hamilton, the American ambassador in Lima. 
Still, coca and opium poppies, which are also on the rise in Peru, will be particularly hard to uproot fully because the recent collapse of coffee prices and stubbornly low prices for other legal crops have given farmers few options, said Patricio Vandenberghe, director of the United Nations Drug Control Program in Peru. 
For now, here in the Monzon valley planting more coca simply makes economic sense, since prices have reached nearly $50 for 25-pound bales of leaves, the highest in Peru because of the quality of the plant. 
But the crop has also brought violence and other social ills. Beyond leading to renewed signs of drug trafficking, the increased coca plantings here and elsewhere have led to a reappearance of Shining Path guerrillas, who benefit from the coca trade. The group was nearly wiped out in recent years.
In fact, across Peru the police are discovering that traffickers are increasingly operating labs that process coca paste into cocaine, a change from years past when labs were solely for producing paste that was then shipped to refineries in Colombia, said Juan Zarate, director general of intelligence at the Interior Ministry. 
New trafficking routes, many of them headed into Brazil or to Peruvian ports, have also been found. Just last month, six tons of coca paste was discovered in a truck in southern Peru, an indication of how ambitious traffickers had become. 
"This was a signal that the cocaine industry is reactivating," Mr. Zarate said. "It put us on the alert."

HEADLINE: Regulation on Tire Safety Rejected by Budget Chief 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The head of the White House Office of Management and Budget took the unusual step today of rejecting a tire safety proposal made by the Bush administration's top auto safety regulators and said in a letter that their analysis was flawed.
 The Office of Management and Budget has not been known previously to return a significant regulatory proposal to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for reconsideration. The heads of both agencies are Bush administration appointees. 
 Dr. John D. Graham, the budget agency administrator, is the top regulatory watchdog for the White House and has the authority to review rules proposed by dozens of agencies. 
The traffic safety agency's rule proposed standards that would have required automakers to phase in systems to monitor tire pressure automatically. Congress, in the Tread Act passed in 2000, required the traffic safety agency to set new standards after the controversy surrounding defective Firestone tires, which have been linked to 271 deaths. 
The traffic safety agency suggested that automobiles be equipped with special pressure sensors in each tire by the model year 2007. But Dr. Graham said in a letter to the agency urged consideration of a less expensive system that estimates tire pressure by using sensors already in place in antilock brake systems, and that such a system would encourage greater use of antilock brakes. Both pressure systems are already in use in some vehicles.
"Additional safety may be available at a lower cost to the public," Dr. Graham said in his letter, and added that the "indirect" system, as it is called, could also encourage installation of antilock brakes.
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data indicated that the "direct" system it proposed saved more lives, but Dr. Graham also said his agency had concerns that the estimates of fatalities and injuries were "based on limited data and/or assumptions that have not been fully explained or analyzed."
Dr. Jeffrey Runge, the administrator of the traffic safety agency, said in a statement, "We have received Dr. Graham's letter and will be looking carefully at the analysis by O.M.B." 
Dr. Graham previously served as the head of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which was financed in part by a variety of corporations, including automakers. He said the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group, was the only outside group he met with before making his tire decision, but added that no other group asked to meet him. 
Joan Claybrook, president of a consumer advocacy group called Public Citizen, opposed Dr. Graham's nomination last year and said the budget agency was not qualified to tell the traffic safety agency how to act as a safety regulator. 
"Essentially, what this allows is for those vehicles that have antilock brakes to jury-rig a tire inflation system, but it doesn't work very well," she said.
"There's no technical competence at O.M.B. to do this," she added. "They're now directing N.H.T.S.A. how to do this?"
Dr. Graham said the Office of Management and Budget had its own staff of analysts and a staff member specializing in auto safety regulation.
The office says that the potential benefits of the "direct" system suggested by the traffic safety agency would be more than offset by the use of antilock brakes.
The contention hinges on the degree to which antilock brakes improve safety. Studies by the traffic safety agency have indicated that the brakes had mixed results decreasing deaths of pedestrians but increased deaths of vehicles in rollovers or when they hit fixed objects.
The budget agency report cited a recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that showed some more promising results, possibly as drivers adapt to the brakes -- though not enough to be statistically significant.

HEADLINE: Fish Wars 

 BODY:
The collapse of the once-great salmon runs of the Pacific Northwest ranks high among the ecological blunders committed in the name of progress. Lately there has been more bad news for these threatened fish. A National Academy of Sciences panel declared that efforts to protect fish species in Oregon's Klamath Basin by diverting irrigation water had been based on insufficient scientific evidence. And Western property rights groups have accelerated what has the makings of a river-by-river assault on endangered species protections for two dozen salmon populations in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. 
 All this has greatly cheered the self-styled libertarians who occupy senior positions in the Bush administration and who have long felt that many environmental laws, in particular the Endangered Species Act, unfairly favor wildlife at the expense of farmers, loggers, developers and other commercial interests. The administration has now promised to review its Klamath policy as well as past decisions to protect salmon. 
 The most troubling development is the looming offensive against legal protections for 24 coastal salmon runs. The basis for this assault is a ruling by a federal district judge in Oregon that essentially held that in assessing the health of the fish in a river, regulators must count hatchery fish as well as those raised in the wild. Since hatchery fish can be raised and added to a river at will, the whole problem of declining species magically disappears -- along with all the annoying steps that have to be taken to protect their habitat.
Buoyed by this decision, the right-wing Pacific Legal Foundation has now brought a second case. Environmentalists, however, are hopeful that a federal appeals court will reaffirm the government's obligation under the Endangered Species Act to manage ecosystems in ways that ensure the survival of wild fish, no matter how many hatchery fish are swimming along with them. 
The academy report also seems at first blush a setback for environmentalists and a victory for the Klamath Basin farmers who were forced to stop irrigating to provide more water for the salmon as well as the far less majestic suckerfish. However, as the panel's chairman noted, there is much more research to be done and the final report could well arrive at another conclusion. Moreover, as the panel makes abundantly clear, the underlying issue is neither the fish nor the farmers but the wretched condition of the basin as a whole. The Klamath water crisis has been in the making for more than 100 years, ever since the federal government decided to subsidize a farming economy in an arid area where none belonged. The result is an overstressed ecosystem in which there are too many claimants for too little water.
Nor is the problem the Endangered Species Act, which has to do with far more than the protection of flora and fauna. It speaks to the human condition as well: when an entire species is sufficiently threatened to require protection, it usually means that the same ecosystem will eventually fail the humans who depend on it as well. More water for agriculture will certainly cheer the farmers and may spare the administration a political problem. But it won't save the basin.
John Kitzhaber, Oregon's governor, and Ron Wyden, the United States senator from Oregon, have proposed various approaches to putting the region's economy on a more sustainable basis, including buyouts of some of the farmers. That sort of approach would mean far more to the long-term health of the region than continued grumbling over the Endangered Species Act.

HEADLINE: Donations in State Judicial Campaign Show Sharp Increase 

BYLINE:  By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
As Congress debates limiting political donations for federal office, a new study shows that donations to state judicial races, a little-regulated and little-noticed arena, have risen substantially in recent years. 
 The study of judicial races in the 38 states that elect judges found that donations to candidates for state supreme court seats increased 61 percent in the 2000 elections compared with the 1998 elections. 
 More than $45 million was raised and spent in the contests for state supreme court seats in 2000, according to the study being released on Thursday. The average supreme court candidate in 2000 raised $430,529 while 16 individuals raised more than $1 million each. 
The money is typically spent on television, the study said, and increasingly for the the kind of attack commercials familiar in races for legislative seats.
Most of the money comes from trial lawyers and business interests, precisely those groups that have the greatest economic stake in how judges rule.
The study, the New Politics of Judicial Elections, is the work of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University Law School, the National Institute on Money in State Politics and the Justice at Stake Campaign.
The greatest amount of money poured into Alabama contests in 2000, where candidates raised an average of $1.2 million, the study's authors said. Alabama has become a battleground in the fight between trial lawyers and business interests over whether damage claims should be limited in civil liability lawsuits.
The study said the top fund-raiser was Ralph Cook, who raised $1,761,990 in his losing effort to retain his seat on the Alabama Supreme Court in 2000. The report noted that the losing candidates in Alabama generally raised more money than the winners.
The Alabama contest appeared to revolve around different issues than money. The man elected chief justice was well-known for insisting that he be allowed to post the Ten Commandments in his courtroom when he was a trial judge.
Michigan had the second most expensive judicial races, with winners averaging $1,287,990 raised and spent. In New York most trial judges are elected, while top appellate judges are appointed by the governor. 
The study analyzed the donations in 11 of the states that held elections in 2000 and concluded that about 30 percent came from lawyers and 20 percent from business interests like state and local Chambers of Commerce.
The report said some of the most hotly contested races featured television commercials that distorted and simplified candidates' records. 
Last summer, a study commission of the American Bar Association recommended that states should provide public financing for judicial campaigns to limit the growing role of money in judicial politics.
That study concluded that sharply increased campaign fund-raising for judicial races in recent years had fed cynicism about the courts.

HEADLINE: With Larger Charities Faring Well, Neighborhood Nonprofits Struggle 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
When philanthropic giving rose sharply after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, many people feared that such giving would divert money from charities. But those fears have largely proven unfounded -- at least for big, name-brand nonprofit organizations.
 But small neighborhood nonprofits, which provide much of the social service and community development in the city, are struggling, even as the economy gets worse and demand for their services rises. 
 "Many of them were in dire straits already on Sept. 10, and fund-raising wasn't going to get them out of it, then or now," said Dennis Derryck, a professor at New School University who did a study of 125 neighborhood social and community service providers in the weeks after the World Trade Center attack. 
These organizations typically rely on government contracts and fees from the services they provide, supplemented by one or two grants from foundations and small contributions from other donors. They lack the diverse income sources and experienced fund-raising operations of larger, better-known organizations. "They're not sexy agencies that people like to give money to," Lawrence Mandell, executive vice president of the United Way New York City, said of the smaller nonprofits.
Take the Betances Health Center on Henry Street on the Lower East Side, which provides a wide range of services including medical care, occupational therapy, acupuncture and family planning, to a diverse ethnic community just about a mile from ground zero. About 75 percent of the center's $7 million budget comes from fees paid by Medicaid and other insurers, but patients could not reach it or were too afraid to try in the weeks after the attack, said Wanda Evans, the executive director.
The sudden decrease in patients punched a $700,000 hole in Betances's budget -- and within a month after the attack, demand for its services began rising, because of growing unemployment and the lingering effects of the disaster. In January, Betances had 40 percent more patient visits than the same month a year ago. Normally, more patient visits would mean more fees. "But now we're beginning to see more and more people come in without any insurance," Ms. Evans said. "We're going to have to take care of more people with less money, and we'll probably have to cut staff." The center did get a grant to cover the cost of hiring a social worker and two outreach workers, but only for six months. It has applied for foundation grants, and for a regulatory designation that would give it access to federal money, but hasn't heard anything yet. 
Of the roughly 27,000 nonprofits based in New York City, 10,000 are small neighborhood operations like Betances operating with some $23 billion in funds, more than half of which come from government contracts. Fees for services account for the next biggest portion of their budgets, and the remainder is made up of grants from foundations and donations from individuals. Government contracts, though, are always precarious, and more so at a time when the city and state both face budget deficits. 
"If you look at most not-for-profits, the larger share of their budget comes from the government, the smaller portion from philanthropy," said Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, senior vice president for agency services at the New York United Way. "The government cuts back and philanthropy doesn't make up for it, and that clearly hits them." 
Mary Dailey, executive director of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, a community development and advocacy organization, finds herself cutting the number of paid jobs at her agency by two, or roughly 10 percent. "One foundation told us it was taking too big a hit on Wall Street to sustain funding to us at current levels," she said. "It dropped its grant by several thousand dollars and went from a two-year to a one-year commitment."
Her experience and that of Betances stands in stark contrast to the experience of bigger, better-known nonprofits like City Harvest, which distributes food to pantries, shelters and other organizations.
City Harvest's annual auction and food tasting fund-raiser in November was a disappointment. The nonprofit had planned on grossing $250,000, but only $230,000 came in. "Every year we've managed to exceed our expectations by a substantial amount, but this year we missed the projection," said Julia Erickson, the executive director. But despite its disappointing fund-raiser, City Harvest is now $1.5 million ahead of its plans.
The Victoria's Secret model, Frederique Van Der Wal, played "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?" on the organization's behalf, raising $60,000. City Harvest's direct mail campaign brought in $350,000, almost double the amount anticipated. Two corporations that normally give $30,000 or $40,000 a year gave $250,000 apiece.
City Harvest is not alone. The Children's Aid Society, which provides social services to families, is ahead of its budget plan by more than 6 percent. The United Way New York City's annual campaign, now at the halfway mark, is up 10 percent over last year's, although United Way is concerned that several companies in the financial sector are delaying or canceling their annual fund drives.
Big foundations have tried to open their coffers. For example, $1 million of Ford Foundation money has recently been designated for loans, grants and other assistance to small businesses that suffered from the attack on the World Trade Center. 
One such affected business was the Urban Horizons Food Company, a catering business operated by the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation as a means of training low-income men and women for jobs in commercial kitchens. When the planes hit the twin towers, Urban Horizons was in the midst of preparing for two parties. Those parties were canceled, as were others for the following weeks. Rather than see food go to waste, Urban Horizons prepared it. 
"Gorgeous wraps, brioches, muffins, it was fabulous food," said Nancy Biberman, the executive director of the corporation, known as Whedco. "The precinct came in and took the food, the sandwiches, cookies, muffins and stuff, and brought it all downtown to help feed the relief workers." But that was the end of Urban Horizons' business. No more bookings came in, and on Oct. 1, the 4,000-square-foot kitchen and its walk-in refrigerators went dark. Fourteen jobs were lost.
Whedco tried to get a contract to provide food for relief organizations from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but was unsuccessful. "The city Office of Emergency Management decided to give food operations to the Salvation Army, and they contracted out to a Long Island company," Ms. Biberman said. While Urban Horizons sounds like just the sort of business the new Ford Foundation money was designed to help, that money is limited to businesses near the trade center. Urban Horizons is in the South Bronx, and will likely have trouble fitting the prescribed parameters.

HEADLINE: Man Sought in New York Hit-and-Runs Is Wanted in New Jersey Shooting 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The owner of a car that struck 19 people in Manhattan on Tuesday in a string of hit-and-run accidents was being sought today on charges from the shooting Sunday of a woman he had been dating, the authorities said. 
 A New Jersey judge issued an arrest warrant for the man, Ronald J. Popadich, 39, of Garfield, charging him with the attempted murder of Lisa B. Gotkin, 40, also of Garfield, and two counts of illegal possession of a weapon. 
 In addition, the New York police said tonight that witnesses to the accidents had identified Mr. Popadich as the driver. Deputy Inspector Joseph A. D'Amico of the Manhattan detectives said the authorities planned to charge him with several counts of reckless endangerment and leaving the scene of an accident. 
Ms. Gotkin was shot in the chest and the left arm and shoulder sometime Sunday evening and was found lying unconscious on a dead-end street in Elmwood Park, about a mile and a half from her home. She remained in critical condition today at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson.
James V. Santulli, an assistant Bergen County prosecutor, declined today to discuss the evidence supporting the attempted murder and weapons possession charges.
New Jersey and New York City authorities said the search for Mr. Popadich had expanded from the city and northern New Jersey to the rest of New Jersey and Philadelphia. Inspector D'Amico said that at 9:15 p.m. Tuesday, Mr. Popadich used a credit card to buy an Amtrak train ticket to Philadelphia at an automated ticketing machine in Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, but he added that the authorities did not know whether the ticket was used.
Ms. Gotkin's handbag and some of her identification documents were found in the trunk of Mr. Popadich's car in Manhattan on Tuesday after the 19 pedestrians and bicyclists were struck at intersections along Seventh Avenue from 34th Street to 14th Street. None were seriously hurt, but two remained hospitalized today. 
Inspector D'Amico said Mr. Popadich abandoned the car at 210 West 17th Street, near Seventh Avenue, and disappeared into a nearby subway station. Later, the inspector said, Mr. Popadich went to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center for treatment of a medical condition unrelated to the hit-and-run accidents. The police said the hospital would not identify the condition.
In addition to Ms. Gotkin's handbag and personal papers, bloodstains and a box of .32-caliber bullets were found in Mr. Popadich's car, detectives said. 
Mr. Santulli said the New Jersey authorities planned to compare the bloodstains with samples of Ms. Gotkin's blood. The caliber of the gun used to shoot her is unknown because surgeons at St. Joseph's Hospital were unable to remove any bullets from her body without further jeopardizing her condition, he said. One of the slugs passed through her heart, he said.
Mr. Popadich is unemployed and lives with his 77-year-old widowed mother, Violet, on a pleasant street of Cape Cod homes in Garfield. Ms. Gotkin lives with her husband, Richard, and their 12-year-old daughter several hundred yards away, on the other side of a municipal park. Both New York and Bergen County detectives described the marriage as strained and Ms. Gotkin as Mr. Popadich's girlfriend. 
Ms. Gotkin was last seen at home early Sunday evening, several hours before a worker in a trucking depot on the dead-end street in Elmwood Park discovered her body about 9:40 p.m., the authorities said. Whether she was shot there or elsewhere remains a mystery, they said.
Mr. Popadich's mother said in a brief telephone interview today that she last saw her son Tuesday afternoon and she insisted that he had not harmed anyone in New York or New Jersey. "He hasn't done nothing wrong, I know that," she said. "He may come home."

MOORE, ELISABETH LUCE

 BODY:
MOORE-Elisabeth Luce. On February 9, 2002, age 98, in New York City. She was the wife of the late Maurice T. Moore, the mother of Michael Moore and the late M. Thompson Moore, Jr. and the sister of the late Henry R. Luce. Born in Teng Chou, Shandong, China of missionary parents. She attended Abbott Academy and Wellesley College, of which she was a trustee. Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed her chairman of the State University of New York. She was a trustee of China Institute in America, the Asia Foundation and the National Board of the Y.W.C.A. She was president of the United Board for Christian Education in Asia and chairman of the Institute of International Education. For sixty-three years she was a director of the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. A memorial service will be held on a date to be announced. In lieu of flowers, contributions to the Brick Presbyterian Church, 8 East 91 St., New York, NY will be welcomed. 
MOORE-Elisabeth Luce. The Trustees and staff of the Institute of International Education mourn the loss of our good friend Elisabeth Luce Moore. Mrs. Moore brought great dedication to her work with IIE, serving as a Trustee, Chairman of the Board and later as a Life Trustee. Mrs. Moore had an enduring commitment to bettering the world through international education, and especially to building bridges between the United States and China. Her interest in China and in women's leadership in the nonprofit sector stimulated us to create the Elisabeth Luce Moore Leadership Program for Chinese Women, generously supported by the Henry Luce Foundation. Mrs. Moore was an inspiration to the many women trained through this program and enthusiastically shared her time and encouragement with those she met personally. All of us at IIE, as well as the many participants whose lives she changed will dearly miss her and extend our condolences to her son and the entire family. Henry Kaufman, Chairman, Board of Trustees Victor J. Goldberg, Vice Chairman Diane J. Paton, Vice Chairman Thomas S. Johnson, Chairman, Executive Committee Allan E. Goodman, President and CEO
MOORE-Elisabeth Luce. Members and staff of the National Board of the YWCA of the U.S.A., Board of Trustees, YWCA World Service Council, and World YWCA express their sorrow at the death of Elisabeth Luce Moore, our dear friend, volunteer extraordinaire, honorary board member, trustee, vice-chairman, and former chairman of the YWCA World Service Council. This profoundly gracious world leader, a woman of faith and courage, was truly "The Woman of the 20th Century," an intrepid explorer of ideas whose advocacy and commitment to racial justice and the economic, political, and spiritual empowerment of women has changed lives and given shape to our world and its history. We extend our deepest sympathy and gratitude to her son Michael Moore and her extended family for sharing her with us. Leticia Paez, YWCA of the U.S.A Margaret Tyndall Chief Executive Officer Kathryn A. Dessonville, President Board of Trustees Joyce Henderson Mims, Chairman World Service Council Jane Lee Wolfe, President, World YWCA
MOORE-Elisabeth Luce. The directors and staff of the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc. are saddened to learn of the death of their longtime colleague and founding director and convey their deepest sympathy to her son, Michael Moore and her nieces, nephews, great nieces and great nephews. During the sixty-three years of her directorship, the foundation approved grants of three hundred and fifty million dollars. She was an original. Henry Luce, III Chairman John Wesley Cook President
MOORE-Elisabeth Luce. The Directors of the YWCA of the City of New York and its Flushing Branch are saddened to learn of the death of "Beth" Moore, a longtime friend of the organization and many of its board members.

HEADLINE: STATE OF THE ART; 
Some Plans That Offer More Than Minutes

BYLINE:  By David Pogue; E-mail: Pogue@nytimes.com

 BODY:
CHOOSING a cellphone used to be easy. You simply had to calculate which was the better value: the $40 national plan with 500 anytime minutes, 3,000 weekend minutes and roaming at 65 cents per minute, or the $35 regional plan with 400 national anytime minutes, 5,000 weekend minutes and roaming at 60 cents per minute.
 But these days, you're not shopping for a phone -- you're shopping for a company. Wireless carriers are knocking themselves out to lure you with exclusive features. In phone stores these days, a bulleted list of trademarked features sits next to each phone. "Connect2Fone -- For the ultimate in on-the-go communication," you might read. Or "MobileMinutes -- Four-in-one message management for the mobile professional." 
 Suppose you were torn between two brands with identical rate plans. Which company's beyond-the-basics features might push you off the fence? I asked AT&T, Verizon, Cingular, Nextel, Sprint and VoiceStream to send me their coolest phones, loaded up with their coolest exclusive features. 
As it turns out, not everything on state-of-the-art cellphones is worth calling home about. Some carriers let you play cramped little video games on the phone against other customers on the network -- the last refuge of stranded airport travelers. Sprint offers phones like the sensational Sanyo 5150, with bright color screens and polyphonic ringers that sound more like an orchestra than a kazoo. Nextel phones can download and run dozens of Java programs, including a tip calculator and games like checkers and Nutty the Squirrel. 
Fortunately, not all recent advances represent such dubious steps forward. Depending on your commute, for example, this one might be a deal clincher: Verizon is the only company with phone service in the bus and train tunnels out of New York's Penn Station. 
And then there's Sprint PCS, a company that offers enough bells and whistles to outfit a marching band. If you've signed up for Sprint's Internet features ($5 per month), a synthetic voice can actually read your e-mail to you over the phone (if it was sent to the phone or to an EarthLink, Prodigy or Yahoo account). If you reply verbally, your correspondent receives your answer by e-mail as an attached sound file. Very slick.
Furthermore, Sprint has just announced that it has taken a whack at one of the most disagreeable aspects of cellphone ownership: programming the phone's address book. The new Contact Sync software lets you transfer numbers between Microsoft Outlook and the phone. The software costs $30 and the cable costs $60, making this a pricey though tempting option.
Sprint's Voice Command ($5 per month) is even more attractive. Whereas some phones let you dial up to 20 numbers by voice, Sprint's Web site lets you type in, or import from your computer's address-book program, the phone numbers of up to 500 people. 
Thereafter, you can dial your phone by saying, "Dial George Bush at home," or whatever. Better yet, your numbers are on the network, so if you lose or upgrade your phone, you don't have to retype those numbers (as long as you stick with Sprint, of course).
Voice Command also lets you dial by speaking any number ("Dial five five five, six two one nine"), an important but surprisingly rare feature. (Verizon also offers this feature in the form of its much more limited Talk Dial service, $3 per month.)
Finally, Sprint recently beefed up this feature with a new, free Windows program that synchronizes your Voice Command phone list with programs like Microsoft Outlook each morning, so that your phone always knows as much about your social circle as your PC does. Although all of this takes some time to set up, it's another Sprint attempt to eliminate the hideous ritual of plugging numbers directly into your cellphone.
AT&T offers a bit of voice control, too, thanks to a free service it calls #121. At your vocal command, a friendly, recorded voice reads you the latest information (when you say "Travel," "Traffic," "News," "Stocks" and so on) or location-specific information ("Movies," "Restaurants," "Driving directions"). 
This service is fantastically useful, fun, free and foolproof, but it's not much of an incentive to join AT&T. It's just TellMe, a free voice portal that anyone can call from any phone, cellular or not, by calling (800) 555-TELL.
Besides, if it's information you want, you may as well get it directly from the Internet. Almost every phone these days can show you snippets of Web information -- slowly and for an added fee.
But in some cities, AT&T, Verizon, VoiceStream and Cingular can deliver the Internet far faster (and for an even higher fee), thanks to the recently enhanced networks that represent the first step toward so-called third generation, or 3G, services. Some carriers even call their upcoming version 3G, but that's mostly marketing. Most companies use the term 2.5G to avoid inflated expectations. 
If you buy a 2.5G phone and pay 2.5G fees (from $3 to $40 monthly, depending on how much you're online), your phone can talk to the Internet at 40 to 60 kilobits per second, which is slightly faster than a computer's dial-up modem and far better than the maximum 14.4 kilobits per second of existing cellphones.
What can you do with faster Internet access on a cellphone? You can pull up Web sites quickly (if stripped-down, "formatted to fit your phone" Web sites can be called Web sites).
And if you, dear corporate customer, have subscribed to Xpress Mail (Cingular) or Wireless Inbox (VoiceStream), you can actually check your office copy of Outlook or Lotus Notes -- all your e-mail boxes, calendar, to-do list, address book and so on -- on the screen of your phone. Delete some mail on the phone, and it's instantly deleted back at the office PC, too. 
You feel as though you're looking at your PC through the wrong end of a telescope, but it's quick and it really works. (AT&T and Nextel offer the same service at the old-fashioned 14.4-kilobits speeds; Sprint will introduce the service in March.) 
Still, the real fun begins when you use the 2.5G service for your laptop or palmtop, either by connecting it to the phone with a $70 cable or by inserting a $300 wireless PC card. Verizon and AT&T already offer both the card and the cable. VoiceStream has only the cable, with a PC card on the way. By summer, Cingular plans to offer a PC card, a cable and a slip-on sleeve for the Compaq's iPaq palmtops.
In any case, this setup gets your laptop or palmtop online, wirelessly and from almost anywhere. That's a delight once reserved for owners of Ricochet modems, a company that burst along with the rest of the Internet bubble. Verizon's software even lets you make voice calls from the laptop using a headset.
Off in a corner by itself is Nextel, a maverick carrier whose phones come with a perk no other company can match: a built-in two-way radio. It's like a walkie-talkie with a 500-mile range. By pressing the "push to talk" button, you can chat directly with any other Nextel phone in your region -- without dialing or waiting, and without relying on congested cellular airwaves. Best of all, this feature (Direct Connect) doesn't eat up any of your cellphone minutes.
The radio really does a number on your battery; you soon get into the habit of recharging the phone every night. Even so, Direct Connect is economical, practical and addictive. At the moment, 90 percent of Nextel's customers are in the business world. But that may change later this year, which is when Nextel says that it will provide Direct Connect with coast-to-coast range and roll out new phones especially for teenagers.
Direct Connect and Sprint's Voice Command are so useful and ingenious, they could, and probably should, influence your thinking the next time you choose a cellphone company. Otherwise, however, almost every carrier says that it will eventually match every other carrier's list of added-cost options: Web and e-mail access, color screens, instant messaging, short-text messaging, faster Internet speeds, downloadable ringer sounds and so on.
Unfortunately, there's one feature you won't see on those bulleted phone-store feature lists any time soon: "Just-a-Phone -- Makes ordinary phone calls without dropping out." Maybe when 4G rolls around.

HEADLINE: Japan's Debt Under Study For New Cut In Rating 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Japan's credit rating could be lowered again soon because the country is not moving fast enough to deal with deflation and debt, the rating agency Moody's Investors Service said today.
 Moody's said it was reviewing Japan's yen-denominated debt for a possible downgrade in the next three months. Moody's lowered the rating on Dec. 4 to Aa3, tied with Italy for weakest among the Group of 7 major economies. 
 "The longer it takes for the government to fashion an effective policy response to deflation, the more complicated solving other economic problems becomes," the agency said, adding that further government inaction could lead to still more downgrades. 
The warning from Moody's -- a move the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, called "unfortunate" -- increases the pressure on the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to come up with substantial measures this week, before President Bush arrives on Sunday, to overhaul the stagnant economy and keep prices from falling.
Moody's noted in its announcement that if conditions in Japan grew any worse, "there could be credit risk contagion between domestic and foreign financial markets," and Japan's woes could begin taking a toll in the United States.
Japan's Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, a high-level government committee, met on Tuesday to draw up a strategy to combat deflation, which Moody's said was making "a serious government debt problem worse." The panel is expected to propose having the Bank of Japan buy more government bonds, and it may call for a new bailout of the banking system using tax money.
Hopes for such a bailout have recently buoyed the stock market, which has risen 5.8 percent in four trading sessions after sinking to an 18-year low.
But enthusiasm for the idea is already fading. At a policy meeting on Friday, the central bank left its monetary stance unchanged. An entity created to buy stocks from banks will begin operating on Friday, but it will be given only limited resources.
Mr. Koizumi and his top financial regulator, Hakuo Yanagisawa, have squashed talk that the government will simply force taxpayer money on all the banks. Mr. Yanagisawa told reporters that in any bailout plan banks would have to apply formally for funds. Because doing so would cede more control of their institutions to the government, bank managers may be unwilling to do so, analysts said.
The government already possesses the regulatory tools to take over banks in the event of an emergency, but politicians are reluctant to declare one for fear of further scaring already skittish savers and investors.
"Yanagisawa is too cautious about disturbing the financial order," said Tomohito Shinoda, a professor at the International University of Japan Research Institute.
Several analysts compared the dangers of the slow approach to a frog and a soup pot: drop the frog in hot water and it will jump right out, but put it in tepid water and then turn up the heat, and the frog will stay and die. By mainly trying to avoid a sharp shock, the analysts said, the Japanese leadership is keeping the country immobile in the soup.
And on the debt front, the temperature is rising. The government expects to owe 693 trillion yen ($5.2 trillion) in long-term debt by March 2003, equivalent to 140 percent of the country's gross domestic product or more than $45,000 for each citizen. Financial commitments to state-sponsored companies add further to the burden. 
Mr. Koizumi has promised budget austerity and a cap on new borrowing, but his swooning popularity -- his approval rating has fallen from 80 percent to 50 percent in recent polls -- make him more vulnerable to demands from lawmakers that he spend more freely. 
"If you think the government bond market is in trouble now," said Michael Taylor, head of research at Indosuez W. I. Carr Securities in Tokyo, "think what will happen if Koizumi leaves."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
Rule Makers Take On Loopholes That Enron Used in Hiding Debt

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS and JOSEPH KAHN

 BODY:
Responding to the collapse of the Enron Corporation, regulators, legislators and the chief accounting rule maker proposed changes yesterday in the way companies do business and report their finances, including closing the loophole that Enron used to hide hundreds of millions of dollars of debt and inflate its profits.
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules in the United States, took the first step toward interpreting rules in a way that would force companies to include in their financial statements the results of partnerships like those that led to the collapse of Enron. The company was able to hide information about such partnerships for years. 
 In a separate development yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would require companies to provide quicker and more comprehensive information about their finances, insider stock sales and critical accounting decisions. If enacted, the changes would overhaul some Wall Street practices that have not been altered since sweeping regulatory controls were imposed during the Depression. 
The proposals came as Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron executive who warned six months ago that the company's accounting practices could bring it down, prepared to testify before Congress today. She plans to say that Enron's questionable handling of partnership deals was widely known within the company, Congressional investigators said. Page C1. 
And a federal energy regulator announced plans yesterday to investigate whether Enron and other companies manipulated electricity prices in California last year. 
Both the S.E.C. and the accounting standards board indicated that they intended to move far more rapidly than in the past, with rules likely to be enacted within months.
Edward W. Trott, the accounting standards board member in charge of developing the new policy, said he hoped that a rule would be proposed by March 15 and, after considering public comment, adopted by the end of July.
In the generally slow-paced world of setting accounting standards, where rules can be adopted years after they are proposed, that is Olympic-like speed, and it is likely to arouse hostility from companies whose financial reports would be affected. If the rule is changed, those companies will probably push for a delay in carrying it out.
Under the current interpretation of the rules, adopted more than a decade ago, companies setting up so-called special purpose entities can keep them off their financial statements if an outside party puts up at least 3 percent of the equity.
Mr. Trott said that the proposed change would probably raise that limit to 10 percent and, more important, require that the outside investor be the first to suffer a loss if things did not go well. As it is, he said, a variety of guarantees now allow so-called equity investors to be sure that their money is not truly at risk.
The practical effect would be to force many companies to consolidate the finances of partnerships or other entities onto their balance sheets. In many cases, that would lead to companies' reporting significantly higher debts and might mean that they were violating limits set in agreements with their bondholders unless those agreements were amended.
In recent weeks, criticisms that the accounting standards board is too slow have been leveled by, among others, Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C. The board voted on the proposed change yesterday, a day before Edmund L. Jenkins, its chairman, was scheduled to appear at a Congressional hearing.
"We are trying to accelerate our work in this area," Mr. Trott said in an interview.
"We expect to move quickly down that path," he added, "but we won't be shortcutting due process just to get something done."
At a hearing yesterday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency announced plans for an investigation into whether Enron and other companies manipulated electricity prices in California last year. 
Patrick Wood III, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said the inquiry would take at least several months. Depending on the findings, he said, the investigation might lead to later proceedings in which long-term electricity supply contracts signed when prices soared could be abrogated if manipulation is found to have led to the high prices. The agency will also review Enron's effect on prices in other parts of the country, he said.
In another development, documents from Enron board meetings showed that for several years auditors from Arthur Andersen, then Enron's auditors, told the board that the company's accounting practices were aggressive, but that it was not until Enron was in its death spiral did Andersen tell directors that the company had gone too far. 
The S.E.C. proposals, which could take months to enact, would overhaul some Wall Street practices -- like the amount of time companies have to release quarterly and yearly financial results -- that have not been altered since Franklin Delano Roosevelt imposed controls in the 1930's.
If the changes are enacted, the time that companies have to report results would be reduced by a third, to 60 days from 90 days in the case of annual reports. The S.E.C. would also "dramatically shorten" the period for disclosure of executive stock trading. It would require formal reporting on other critical indicators of a company's financial health, like changes in its credit rating or its accountant.
Mr. Pitt, the S.E.C. chairman, called the proposals initial steps to "provide significant improvements quickly while other proposals are considered." 
The rules changes he put forward mirror some legislative fixes supported by House Republicans, including parts of a package introduced yesterday by the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Mike Oxley of Ohio.
The proposals also answer calls by Democrats to close loopholes and expedite financial reporting. But many Democrats say they want changes in the way companies and accountants are regulated that are more thorough than those suggested by Mr. Pitt, who was a lawyer representing accounting firms before President Bush named him to head the S.E.C. early last year. 
Representative John J. LaFalce of New York, the ranking Democrat on the financial services committee, said he was disappointed that the bill did not go far enough to separate auditing and consulting services, or "provide effective oversight of the auditing industry."
But he added that he hoped to work with committee Republicans to produce a bipartisan bill.
Lynn Turner, the chief accountant of the S.E.C. under its former chairman, Arthur Levitt, called the Pitt proposals "certainly a piece of the puzzle, and I view them very positively." 
Most of the rules put forward yesterday would address perceived shortcomings in financial reporting and accounting procedures that allowed Enron to promote artificially inflated profits, increasing its stock price while executives sold tens of millions of dollars in shares.
One S.E.C. rule change, for example, would require companies to let investors know of "critical accounting policies" that shed light on the judgments executives and accountants made in preparing financial statements.
If Enron had followed such a rule, it might have had to provide investors with more information about its prolific use of partnerships to remove debt from its balance sheet and raise reported earnings.
The S.E.C. also wants to force companies to make public immediately any decisions to waive corporate ethics rules. Enron's board granted permission to executives to take personal financial stakes in partnerships that did business with the company, but did not provide timely information about those waivers.
The proposal on insider stock trades would require companies to notify investors "on a current basis" when top executives buy or sell stock. Most such trades must now be disclosed by the 10th day of the month after the trade, but some transactions need not be disclosed until 45 days after the end of the company's fiscal year. Enron has said that Mr. Lay sold millions of dollars in stock back to the company last year but was not required to disclose the transactions.
The inquiry by the FERC is a response to senators from several Western states who asserted that Enron used its dominance in long-term energy contracts and derivatives to keep prices high. Enron has said such accusations are false.
Senators including Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, have sought the investigations, and yesterday the two lawmakers said they would introduce legislation to tighten regulation of energy-derivatives trading and to reverse provisions in legislation two years ago that gave Enron and other traders exemptions from certain oversight.
While past FERC reviews of California energy prices have focused on narrower issues about the structure of markets and whether refunds may be owed to this state, the "further question to be asked is, 'Why did prices go up in the first place?' " Mr. Wood said in an interview yesterday.
Significantly, the agency's investigation will examine the impact of trading of long-term energy contracts, energy derivatives and other financial products -- which include areas outside the FERC's primary jurisdiction of physical natural gas and electricity. Mr. Wood told members of the House committee yesterday that his agency was consulting with the Justice Department, the S.E.C., the Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Yesterday, members of the House committee were told that while Enron's collapse did not have a significant impact on energy markets, the situation could have been much different had it not been for warm weather and a slowing economy. Had energy supplies been tight, Enron's collapse might have pushed prices sharply higher, several witnesses before the committee said.
"The nation's energy markets skated by and escaped a disaster," said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, a large natural gas producer in Houston. "We avoided a supply crunch because the recession and one of the warmest winters in recent history combined to keep demand in check."
Mr. Plank said development of natural gas reserves has been endangered by rapid price swings caused by energy traders, as volatility has scared off drillers from making investments in the sector.
"Deregulation has been hijacked by traders, hedge funds and others who profit from volatility," he said.

HEADLINE: Annan Asks U.S. for More Money for AIDS Fund 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations met privately today with President Bush and members of the Senate to prod them gently to give more for a new global fund to combat the AIDS epidemic.
 "I think we can defeat it," Mr. Annan told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "It is not invincible. But we need sustained political will and resources." 
 Both meetings were closed to the press, except for Mr. Annan's opening remarks in the Senate. Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and the committee's chairman, said afterward that Mr. Annan did not ask for a specific amount. But he did urge the United States to set an example for other countries by increasing international AIDS spending by 50 percent each year for the next four years.
"The point he kept making was that it has a significant leveraging effect," Mr. Biden said. "The more we do, the more other countries will do."
With an estimated 8,000 people around the world dying each day of AIDS, Mr. Annan proposed the global fund last spring as a way to help poor nations cope not only with AIDS but also with tuberculosis and malaria. He said then that $7 billion to $10 billion would be needed a year for AIDS alone.
But financing has fallen far short of that goal. This year, United Nations officials said, international spending to fight AIDS will total $2 billion, about $800 million of it from the global fund.
Much of that money comes from the United States. In his budget proposal for 2003, President Bush has asked for roughly $900 million in international spending for AIDS prevention and treatment, including a promise of $200 million for the new fund. But the pledge is not an increase over this year. Advocates and lawmakers say it is not enough.
Administration officials, however, defended the amount. Testifying before the Foreign Relations Committee this morning, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said no country did more to combat AIDS. 
The $200 million pledge, "under the circumstances that we are facing right now, I think is a tremendously generous contribution," Mr. Thompson said, in an apparent reference to the war on terrorism.
But his remarks drew a sharp reply from Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, who said, "I'm afraid I don't see the $200 million as an adequate contribution." He added, "It does not reflect the leadership role our country ought to take."
The directors of the fund expect to distribute its first grants this spring. Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, told senators that more money might be forthcoming if the programs the fund pays for showed results.
"If this global trust fund works as well as we hope it will, then we should put more money into it," Mr. Natsios said. "But it hasn't proven itself yet."

Five months ago, the hierophants of fashion could scarcely have predicted what women would want to wear in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The frivolous, the highfalutin, were clearly out. On the other hand, did anyone in the industry really expect to drum up excitement for the chaste, the earnest and the cutely cozy?
 Two first-rate collections, by Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga and Michael Kors, both showing yesterday as the New York fall 2002 collections passed the halfway mark, were steeped in what fashion needs at any moment: optimism and a lucid point of view that anyone can grasp. 
 Instead of those high society themes that often bog him down, Mr. Kors concentrated on a handful of sporty American looks, from a hooded minidress in white leather lined with sheared fur to a fitted mechanic's jumpsuit in brown suede. He didn't abandon luxury, but he treated it in a nonchalant way, mixing splashy fur vests with washed tailored jeans, or showing flat boots, crunched down around the calves, with simple smock dresses in gray silk jerseys. Those dresses -- in sleeveless black jersey for evening with smocking on the yoke -- vaguely resemble nighties. But the loose shift has been working its way into fashion for a couple of seasons, if only as a respite from uptight clothes. 
Mr. Ghesquiere whittled down his Balenciaga collection, the main event of New York fashion week, to 28 looks, each of them packed with something fresh to say about modern dressing. That's his gift -- that he doesn't fill his vocabulary with an excess of language. So here is a belted black leather jacket, looking slightly slick, with a ribbed-knit collar drawn up against the face, with trim pants high and flat against the waist. There were loose gray jersey pullovers and a puffy herringbone vest, worn over denim work shirts, that called to mind homeboy sweatshirts. And yet there was nothing sloppy or retiring about the attitude.
Although Mr. Ghesquiere returned to his pencil-slim silhouette, he didn't give up entirely on the volume he injected into his spring clothes. It was mainly confined to vests with deep armholes and minishifts in childlike collages of patchwork. Where he excelled, though, were with white cotton coats and boleros sprouting with yarn curls, their effect like an eccentrically shorn lamb or an ambulatory assortment of Einstein Moomjy carpet samples. 
Going from Rick Owens's ultracool urban waifs in tattered, safety-pinned maxisweaters to Mr. de la Renta's ultrachic Gypsies in peasant tops and embroidered skirts presented a kind of mental challenge, making one wonder what Barbara Walters, say, would look like dressed not in one of Mr. de la Renta's ornate velour coats edged in fur, but in a pair of Mr. Owens's drab corduroy pants, with a fraying stretch T-shirt and a little hood. Just a thought.
But both designers could stand a little less gravitas this season. Mr. Owens's beaten-up jackets, his long apron skirts lashed around the waist and worn with distressed leather booties certainly speak to individuality, but it all seemed rather earnest and heavy going -- and slipping into Martin Margiela's moody territory.
Though Mr. de la Renta opened his show with a minitunic in sheared white fur, that simple gesture soon faded as he sent out a shimmering montage of patchwork and mirror-embellished evening skirts, interspersed with beautiful peasant tops and the odd lavender satin skirt gathered up like a Roman shade. All too often he seemed to be decorating a room rather than dressing a woman. 
As the sound system piped out "The Year of the Cat," and model after model glided down the runway, Mark Badgley and James Mischka's show on Tuesday began to resemble one of those continuous brain loops you're always worried about falling victim to, a "Groundhog Day" of couture.
Up until then, the designers had made their point, nicely, with black beads cresting the front of a tight pair of black suede evening trousers, a shirt of China-red lace bursting with tiny silk rosettes, and a clinging black camisole whose wide satin straps met a pair of noisy, big-shot rhinestones just above the flat bosom of the model. And there were some of those delectable little black dresses, in crepe georgette with demure pleats and tiny rhinestone-buckled belts, that occasionally make fashion editors, who now mostly wear pants and boots, have a pang or two. Oh, to dress like a lady.
But then the drone of a song, the blur of lace and passementerie, a black column with mink straps that looked, oddly, pressed on, as if with Velcro, and -- gong! -- you felt you were waking up every five seconds to the same dress. And there may be no way around that, given the expectation today that designers will spit out in 12 minutes what took them weeks to create, so everyone can hurry on to the next venue, the next experience. But it's a tough way to show expensive clothes.
And afterward everyone climbed into their Town Cars and Suburbans for the truck over to 10th Avenue to look at Marc by Marc Jacobs, or Little Marc, as it's sometimes called in the trade. Little Marc is in a way closer in spirit to Mr. Jacobs than Big Marc, his main collection, which often seems to embody someone else's personality, and sometimes even many personalities at once. Marc is consistently sincere, its cool evident to anyone, in such things as snug corduroy blazers over matching vests and girlish blouses, a black wool midiskirt ringed with crunched ruffles around the hem, a striped poor boy sweater or a denim prairie jacket inset with faded calico. Though each collection doesn't present much of a stretch from his original friendly vintage formula, Mr. Jacobs and his assistants keep topping it up with fresh pieces, and that's what you gratefully pluck out.
For the start of her DKNY collection on Tuesday in the tents at Bryant Park, Donna Karan had her models line up on a platform as if posing for a class portrait, and then, one by one, they peeled off down the runway, displaying their back-to-school pants in distressed leather, their washed cotton peacoats, their drab maxiskirts and pale vintage-looking frocks with crumpled coronation satin. Sound a bit old-clothesy? It was, and rather uninspired at that. Whereas Marc appeared to be intent on avoiding anything that looked too old-clothesy, DKNY seemed to scurry toward it. Such a dejected expression of fashion doesn't exactly stimulate a woman's imagination.
Instead of having her finger on the pulse, as she usually does, Nicole Miller seemed to be hitting the panic button on Tuesday, with a tepid collection of basic dresses and pinstripes, enlivened with the odd leopard-spotted twin set, that looked designed in reaction to the economy. But even commercially driven clothes need a jolt of energy.
Narciso Rodriguez knows how to cut a dress, and it's always a pleasure to see how he will finesse something as classic as a sheath. One of the best looks that came out at his show on Tuesday, in a Chelsea art gallery, combined beige and white cotton with a slightly draped V-neck that evoked a sailor collar. Wrap dresses that fell just below the knee brought to mind samurai tunics, while other two-piece styles were pencil-thin, accentuated by subtle corsetry. 
Yet Mr. Rodriguez seemed in a quandary, uncertain about the point he wanted to make this season. One moment he was emphasizing sharp tailoring, with a whitewashed cotton car coat over a skinny black skirt, and the next, he was sending out loose halter dresses that looked as if he hadn't completely worked them out in his head. Draped beautifully in the front, they looked hastily closed in the back.
Zac Posen, a young designer straight out of art school, has been compared to Isaac Mizrahi. That may be a good thing, a bad thing or just a deja vu thing, given that Mr. Mizrahi, fashion's Mr. Saturday night, is no longer in business. But where Mr. Mizrahi made it perfectly clear what inspired him when he first hit the scene in the late 1980's -- fresh color and American sportswear -- Mr. Posen could only express a kind of camp couture: trousers with one leg opened to the thigh, dramatic cowl necklines of the old Claude Montana genre, long Morticia dresses with witchy collars or sleeves. Here and there was clear evidence of talent -- a deep red flannel skirt coyly wrapped around the hips with an embroidered turned-down waistband that was shown with a crisp man's pinstripe shirt.
Energy he has to spare. Friends, too. In the front row Tuesday night, at an old synagogue, was President Bush's daughter Barbara. Down the row was the artist Julian Schnabel, whose daughters are friends of Mr. Posen's. Every generation needs its own stars, but in the middle of that kind of hoopla, with the models acting up for the photographers and Mr. Posen himself taking his bow in evening tails, it's easy to lose your perspective. 
And one thing this haywire show raised a doubt about was Mr. Posen's attention span. Just the fact that the clothes were all over the place, with no clear line of thought, suggested that Mr. Posen couldn't sustain a design idea long enough either to see it through completely or to scrap it altogether.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE MAYOR; 
At Ease in Sparing No Area of Government to Ensure the City's Recovery

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Speaking extemporaneously, dotting madly at his projection screen with a laser pointer and dashing off random one-liners, Michael R. Bloomberg gave clear definition to his mayoralty for the first time yesterday during a two-hour budget address. 
 Even as he delivered dismal news and defined tough spending priorities that are sure to incur the wrath of thousands, Mr. Bloomberg seemed more at ease than in any public moment since becoming mayor. He was clearly in his element -- making casual references to bond-rating agencies and zipping off policy acronyms -- a comfort level built on the foundation of his career as a chief executive. 
 At times using a forceful tone, Mr. Bloomberg made it clear that he would spare no area of government to ensure the city's recovery. Unlike some of his predecessors, Mr. Bloomberg is not beholden to many special interests since he was elected without the encumbrances of big-money donors or the endorsements of the large unions.
A man accustomed to highbrow culture and intrigued by public health, Mayor Bloomberg still took an unwavering slap at the city's cultural institutions, proposing 15 percent cuts to their aggregate budget. He recommended ending many key Health Department initiatives, like its program to stop smoking, aid to primary care clinics and contracts for cancer research and education.
Mr. Bloomberg also took his budget hatchet to areas that were sacrosanct under the Giuliani administration, like the Fire and Police Departments, where he is seeking cuts of 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively. At the Department for the Aging, he plans to shutter recreational centers that Rudolph W. Giuliani was often advised to close but consistently declined to do.
In many ways, Mr. Bloomberg's budget priorities were not so different from Mr. Giuliani's, who also rejected tax increases, although this year's budget woes are far more severe than those his predecessor confronted before the economic boom of the 1990's. In short, Mr. Bloomberg said -- even as advocates for children, libraries, cancer patients and others planned demonstrations on the steps of City Hall -- his budget reflects an unsentimental view of what needs to be done in light of the terrorist attacks last fall.
"In past times, there were games played," Mr. Bloomberg said. "People presented numbers trying to achieve a desired output rather than reflect reality. The game that was played was: I'll cut here, knowing that a legislative body, whether it's at the city, state or federal level, will come back and fill in over there. Mayors have had their projects they're trying to move moneys to and then the Legislature tries to move some of it back.
"That's not what's happening here. There are no new projects. We're trying to balance a budget. And I am -- do not have all the good ideas. I'm happy to have suggestions from the City Council, from the public, from the press, from the borough presidents and the comptroller and public advocate, from legislative bodies everyplace. The only thing I ask: If you come up with a cut that you don't like, just tell me where else you're willing to have us cut to satisfy your needs and explain to me why the person whose ox is getting gored is going to be willing to put up with that."
The mayor also reinforced his developing agenda to lean on the state and federal governments for billions of dollars in aid, gently passing the onus to get it done onto the state's delegation. Mr. Giuliani often echoed others' complaints that New York does not get its fair share from Washington, but did not enumerate his desires or lobby personally for assistance. Gov. George E. Pataki has told Washington what he needs, but was more or less dismissed for over-reaching. 
"I respect his proposals enormously," Senator Charles E. Schumer said of the mayor's plans. "They are all possible, they are all reasonable."
Mr. Bloomberg, who is to public speaking what Mayor Giuliani was to cooperating, barely relied on notes for his presentation, joked easily and took pains to compliment the good works of those he was about to hurt, much like a chief executive of a major company reporting poor earnings and layoffs. 
He showed a passion for minutia, becoming strikingly animated as he explained how paper was recycled, for instance, and making it known that anyone who found a stray cat in the middle of the night would be expected to house it overnight to accommodate reduced hours at the animal shelters.
And his folksy style, reliant on phrases like "these are incremental make dos," you-had-to-be-there jokes and C.E.O.-isms like "skill set" have now officially become Mr. Bloomberg's lexicon, when he is not forced to read a speech or break away from material that does not capture his interest or involve own skill set.
Studying up on animal shelter hours may do more than tame his own curiosity. It may demonstrate his newfound command of facts about a subject -- municipal government -- he has almost no prior experience with. "Knowing that level of detail gives an enormous amount of comfort to the rating agencies," said Joseph J. Lhota, a former deputy mayor who went though numerous budgets with Mr. Giuliani. "It makes them believe that this is a mayor who really gets it, that he can morph into the C.E.O. that he is." 
After his address, Mr. Bloomberg took time for what has become another City Hall ritual of his own, gathering a few aides and his security detail to quietly slip off to check on business at the local shoeshine shop.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes $44.9 Billion Farm Bill Limiting Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The Senate passed a farm bill today that increases basic subsidy programs, doubles spending for conservation programs and puts strict limits on how much money a single farmer can receive.
 By putting $22 billion into expanded conservation programs over a decade, the farm bill could become the most sweeping environmental legislation since the Clean Air Act of 1990. 
 The five-year, $44.9 billion bill also doubles the administration's request for food stamps, ensuring that the Agriculture Department's nutrition program is the second-largest federal program combating poverty.
The measure passed 58 to 40 with nine Republicans joining the Democrat majority, and it stands in stark contrast to the House farm bill approved last fall. That bill gives less money to conservation and nutrition programs, places no limits on individual subsidy payments and gives an additional $9 billion to commodity subsidies over a decade. 
Lawmakers will try to reconcile the two versions in conference, which is expected to last several weeks.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, had pushed to pass a bill before midterm elections, and today he praised the Senate's version of the farm policy. 
"This bill provides certainty for producers, an increased commitment to conservation, expanded nutrition, provisions making farmers and ranchers more competitive, and needed assistance for rural development," Mr. Daschle said.
For his part, Senator Trent Lott, the minority leader, portrayed the Senate farm bill as "the most partisan" in his memory. But many of the votes seemed determined as much by geography as by politics. 
Western senators of both parties worried about restrictions on water and packing houses. Southern senators complained about restrictions on subsidy payments. 
Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, voted against her party to protest payment limits that fell most heavily on rice and cotton farmers. 
The two Republican senators from Maine broke ranks with their party leaders to support the bill's conservation measures and a $2 billion dairy program that replaces the Northeast Dairy Compact.
Finally, the senators from Iowa seemed to be acting in tandem even though they sit on opposite sides of the aisle. Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican, wrote the amendment to limit subsidy payments and another to prohibit meat packing companies from owning their own livestock.
That provision is intended to protect small hog farmers, many of whom live in Iowa. Mr. Grassley's fellow Republicans said his measure would hurt the big meatpacking companies and cause an upheaval in the pork and beef industries.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, paid a rare tribute to his colleague today, thanking him for his "courage in representing Iowa farmers." Mr. Grassley voted with the Democrats.
Congress agreed last year to set aside $171 billion for a new 10-year farm bill to replace the Freedom to Farm law that expires in October. That policy was intended to wean farmers from subsidies but triggered emergency payments that now cost $20 billion each year, a greater amount than proposed in both new farm bills. 
The House bill uses all $171 billion and covers the entire decade. The Senate's version, however, is a five-year plan that spends $6 billion more than half of the available funds. 
Democratic senators said the problems in rural American were severe enough to warrant their strategy, but Senate Republicans objected. President Bush said in a statement tonight that he strongly disagreed with the Senate bill.
"This bill front loads spending into the first five years, leaving vital programs under-funded in the years that follow," the president said. "I am committed to sound farm policy that supports America's farmers and ranchers and am disappointed that the Senate-passed bill doesn't get the job done."
At the center of both bills is the Depression-era program that pays farmers to grow corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and rice. The Senate version would limit each farmer's annual subsidy to $275,000 -- cutting in half the amount of money the biggest farmers receive in the House version. 
The size of farm subsidies came to the national forefront last winter when a nonprofit group opened a Web site listing every federal subsidy payment received by every farmer in the last five years.
Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, refused to vote for the Senate farm bill, saying it did not go far enough in limiting subsidies.
"The egregious inequity of the farm program is that sixty percent of farmers receive no subsidies whatsoever," Mr. Lugar said.
The new conservation programs were written to remedy that inequity, and payments can be made to farmers who raise fruits and vegetables or ranchers who raise cattle or pigs. In current law and the House bill, the vast majority of conservation programs are available only to farmers of commodity crops like corn, rice and wheat.
The new farm bill also underwrites extensive conservation programs to clean up city drinking water, protect forests from urban sprawl and help protect wildlife and their habitat. 
Every major conservation group set its sights on the farm bill this year, from the Sierra Club to the Environmental Defense Organization.
"In its scope and in the significance of its programs, there hasn't been a environmental measure of this importance since the Clean Water Act," said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group.
But several conservative organizations criticized spending billions of dollars for what they called corporate welfare.
"Taxpayers continue to underwrite corporate agriculture," said Joe Theissen, executive director of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "With passage of this bill, incentives to overproduce still plague farm policy and will haunt family farmers for years to come. Huge farms aided by these subsidies will continue to produce more products than the economy can absorb."
The Senate bill also contains new provisions covering animals. It prohibits interstate shipments of dogs or roosters for fighting; requires puppies raised on puppy farms to be let out of their cages to play with dogs and people; and it bans the interstate trade in bear parts, a provision intended to prevent poachers from killing bears to sell their gall bladders for use in Asian medicine.

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Currency Plunges 19% as Controls Are Removed 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Venezuela's currency plunged against the dollar today as President Hugo Chavez abandoned exchange controls to try to stem capital flight and restore investor confidence. The bolivar fell by 19 percent, closing at 980.50 to the dollar, compared with 792.50 Friday, the previous trading day. Economists have said the bolivar was overvalued as much as 30 percent. 
 Reopening after a holiday weekend, several Caracas exchange houses and banks postponed dollar sales today to wait for the price to stabilize. 
 Late Tuesday Mr. Chavez announced the surprise decision to abandon a controlled devaluation scheme and let the currency float. He also announced a 7 percent cut in government spending to help close a projected $8 billion budget deficit.
The measures reflect a new economic reality of low oil prices, capital flight and investor nervousness about Latin America after Argentina's financial crisis and the slump of the global economy since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, Mr. Chavez said.
Thomas Dawson, spokesman for the International Monetary Fund, praised Venezuela's decision to abandon exchange controls as a step "in the right direction."
Venezuela had spent more than $3 billion to prop up the bolivar since November. Business groups had wanted the currency devalued to make exports more competitive.
Mr. Chavez, a former paratrooper who once led a failed coup, was elected in 1998 with a mandate to throw out the discredited political elite and help the poor. Critics accuse him of alienating investors by fighting with business leaders, the Roman Catholic Church and the news media.
Domingo Maza Zavala, director of the central bank, said today that the bank would not sacrifice its reserves to defend the bolivar but would intervene if needed to stop the free fall. Currency turmoil is likely to ease in a few days, he said.
Some experts said the moves would stop the drain on foreign reserves but would generate inflation that Venezuelans, 80 percent of whom live in poverty, can ill afford. One of Mr. Chavez's chief aims was to tame the rate of inflation, which was 10 percent in 2001.
"This is actually a devaluation, and Venezuelans now should get used to higher prices," said Janet Kelly, professor of public policy at the Caracas Graduate Institute of Advanced Management.
Some called the measures too little, too late.
"I think the adjustment should be much more ambitious," said Francisco Rodriguez, head of the National Assembly's economic advisory office. "This is a first step, but it's not enough." He said he foresaw a "substantial" devaluation.
Capital flight has been fueled in part by a volatile political situation.
Venezuelans lined up at banks Friday to buy dollars after two military officers demanded that Mr. Chavez resign, accusing him of threatening civic freedoms. Their demands prompted thousands to protest in Caracas for and against the president. The military assured the nation that there was no unrest in its ranks, and protests calmed over the weekend.
Mr. Chavez said the announced budget cuts would focus on administrative costs at the federal, state and local levels, and would not touch social programs.
The new $25 billion budget, down from the original $33 billion, is based on an average oil price of $16 a barrel, instead of a forecast $18.50. Venezuela loses $1 billion in income for each $1-a-barrel drop in the price of oil.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: DEBT; 
New Bond Issue Is a Step That Pleases No One

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
It is an idea that no one, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, likes. And it is something the city has not tried, at least to this degree, since the days of the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. But a plan is now on the table to sell $1.5 billion in long-term debt to balance the city's new budget.
 In the simplest terms, it is like an unemployed worker taking out a loan to pay his rent, a practice that would avoid an eviction but cost the worker much more in the long run as he pays back the loan. 
 Even in introducing the proposal yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg acknowledged that it was just the kind of budgeting trick that disturbs the bond-rating agencies that monitor the city's fiscal health. Nevertheless, the city was so hurt financially by the Sept. 11 attack, he said, that the one-time action is justified. In fact, recognizing the extraordinary circumstances, the state Legislature specifically gave the city the power late last year to issue an additional $2.5 billion in debt. 
"This is clearly a unique situation -- 9/11 is not the sort of thing that you normally should be planning for," Mr. Bloomberg said. "When something like that happens, it's an extraordinary event, and you have to take extraordinary measures."
In any other year, such a proposal would be immediately opposed by a wide range of fiscal monitors, but yesterday the response was decidedly muted, and several said that while the plan was undesirable, it might be reasonable in a year when the city must close a $4.76 billion deficit.
"Of course, it is a concern from a credit perspective," said Robert Kurtter, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, a bond rating agency, "but this appears to be a necessary action that the city must take to get the budget balanced."
City Council Speaker Gifford Miller also expressed reserved support for the plan. 
"When revenues are low for an unusual reason, as they are now, it's important to take steps, even extraordinary ones, that preserve our ability to deliver core services," he said, noting that even with the plan, Mr. Bloomberg proposed $1.8 billion in budget cuts.
There is one obvious way Mr. Bloomberg could eliminate the need to borrow the $1.5 billion, which is 3.6 percent of the city's proposed $41.4 billion budget: he could propose an increase in city taxes.
Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a public watchdog group, said she would almost prefer that before the city resorts to borrowing money, it increase the real estate tax slightly, reimpose a sales tax on clothing that was cut recently, and push the state to reimpose the commuter tax. 
"You should be reluctant to pass on the cost of today's services to future taxpayers," she said, although she added that her position was not firmly against the debt financing. "Today's taxpayers should be first in line."
The $1.5 billion in borrowing -- bonds would be sold to investors and then repaid over 20 years or less -- would in no way threaten the city's overall financial stability, budget analysts said. New York City is in no danger of failing to meet its obligations to its current bond holders and it is not having trouble selling new debt, as it did during the fiscal crisis.
The problem the city encountered in the 1970's resulted from repeatedly borrowing money, for a short term, to pay basic city bills. When a recession hit and city revenue faltered, the city almost went bankrupt.
In this case, Mayor Bloomberg has made clear that he would only use debt to cover basic city bills for one year. The mayor is also cutting planned spending on major capital projects, such as new schools and museums, so the new debt would not be much more than was previously planned. 
Still, the technique comes at a real cost. The Independent Budget Office estimated that the city would have to pay $100 million a year for 20 years to pay off the bonds, meaning roughly $600 million in interest costs.
Mr. Kurtter said that Moody's was considering lowering the city's bond rating before the mayor announced his budget, a move that would cost the city millions of dollars a year because it raise the interest rate the city would pay. 
That rating is not necessarily going to be lowered, though. The rating services may take into consideration that while the $1.5 billion is very large, the city has turned to debt financing in recent years. 
In 1997, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority gave the city $250 million in surplus revenue to help balance the city budget, in exchange for $500 million in debt the city issued on its behalf. Similarly, last year, the M.T.A. gave the city $345 million it earned from selling the New York Coliseum, which the city used to balance the budget, and in return the city gave the M.T.A. back $345 million that it borrowed.
The difference is that the Giuliani administration did not call attention to them.

HEADLINE: Bush Plan Expected To Slow, Not Halt, Gas Emission Rise 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
President Bush is set to announce a plan today calling for voluntary measures to slow but not halt the growth in emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming, White House officials said last night.
 The climate proposal is Mr. Bush's response to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 treaty accepted but not yet ratified by all other large industrialized countries, which would require cuts in such emissions by 2010 to well below their 1990 levels. Mr. Bush rejected the treaty last March, calling its targets arbitrary, its schedule too costly to meet and its terms, which are not easily applied in large developing countries, unfair. 
 The program he is to announce this afternoon would slow the rate of growth in emissions in relation to the growth of the overall economy. It would use $4.6 billion in tax credits over the next five years to encourage companies and individuals to limit those emissions.
Utilities, for example, would get incentives to build power-generating windmills; homeowners would get new tax credits for buying solar panels or more efficient cars. 
The one thing the climate policy would not do is require anything of anybody, sticking with the position Mr. Bush has held for more than a year on the climate issue: that firm limits on the so-called greenhouse gases would drag down the economy. 
The administration's approach, he plans to say, is based "on the common-sense idea that sustainable economic growth is the key to environmental progress -- because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies," according to an advance text.
On another emissions issue unrelated to climate, aides said Mr. Bush would call today for mandatory restrictions on three other kinds of pollutants from power plants: mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. In contrast to proposals by environmentalists and many Democrats, however, the plan would delay such cuts until 2010 or later. 
Last night, administration officials called the voluntary approach on climate the most reasonable path for the time being. A senior administration official did say, however, that if insufficient progress was being made by 2012, there could be a move toward some kind of limits. "If we're not making progress toward our goal," he said, "we will be considering a full range of programs." 
Some environmental groups criticized this kind of checkup, saying it puts off any measuring of progress until well after Mr. Bush is out of office.
Under the administration's proposed target, the growth rate of emissions of carbon dioxide would drop nearly 18 percent by 2012 -- to 151 metric tons for each $1 million in gross domestic product, from the current level of 183 metric tons.
But environmental groups sharply criticized this kind of yardstick, saying that it merely reflects an existing trend toward using energy more efficiently and adding that as long as the economy grows, this would not result in emissions reductions.
Alluding to the date of the speech, Jennifer Morgan, the climate policy director for the World Wildlife Fund, called it "a valentine to the coal and oil industry that will allow emissions to increase without any time frame, eternally." 
One provision of the new climate plan would be to greatly expand a program encouraging businesses to monitor and report their emissions of greenhouse gases. Those that participate, voluntarily, would gain credits that might eventually be used in a trading scheme similar to that used for other pollution. 
White House officials said this could prompt industries to change behavior, the same way similar reporting requirements instituted in the late 1980's resulted in big cuts in releases of toxic chemicals. 
Philip E. Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust, a private lobbying group, criticized this approach, saying: "The president's global warming proposal appears to be another faith-based initiative: we should have faith that major corporations will line up to volunteer cuts in their carbon pollution. That approach has failed for a decade now, since the president's father set up the first voluntary program."
And Myron Ebell, a climate policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a private group whose free-market views are frequently embraced by industry, criticized the idea from the opposite ideological direction.
"What looks like voluntary will actually be coercive," Mr. Ebell said. 
The president is leaving for Asia on Saturday and has been under pressure to present a climate plan before visiting Japan. Japan, which has avoided criticizing the administration over its rejection of the treaty, has been eager for a sign that Mr. Bush is concerned about the issue. Several experts on the treaty said that his decision to make the announcement now was very likely influenced by this situation.
The proposed plan on nongreenhouse emissions from power plants -- mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides -- would impose mandatory limits but would allow companies to exceed them by buying credits from others that reduce pollution below required levels. 
There would be no similar limits on power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. In the face of lobbying from coal companies and utilities, Mr. Bush abandoned a campaign pledge last March to control the four plant emissions together and has shown no signs of reconsidering that idea.
As hints of the emerging plan circulated in e-mail messages by environmental groups and conservative groups, it appeared that no one was particularly pleased. 
An official at an energy company that had been pressing the White House to revise power plant rules said the best news was that there was something finally on the table to discuss. 
"At least they're coming out with something," the official said. "It may not be what everyone wants, but it recognizes that the Senate is going to deal with climate on its power plant bill."

HEADLINE: Telmex's Dominance Draws Complaint From U.S. 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
The United States asked the World Trade Organization today to force Mexico to open its telecommunications industry to foreign competition or face trade sanctions, raising the stakes in a two-year dispute over the $12 billion market. 
 "Mexico's market remains dominated by a single company with a government mandate to set high wholesale prices," the United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, said in a statement. 
 Market domination by Telefonos de Mexico, called Telmex, results in telephone charges that "penalize American and Mexican families seeking to maintain cross-border ties, raise the price of doing business across the border and burden U.S. telecom firms with unnecessary costs," Mr. Zoellick said. 
Mexico's government, which began opening its telecom market after an earlier challenge raised by the United States before the W.T.O., said it had no objections to settling the matter again at the trade body.
"If they want to go to a panel, we would like to," Jorge Arredondo, head of Cofetel, the telecommunications regulatory panel, said in Mexico City. "We could clear up the concerns that the U.S.T.R. has."
The threat of trade sanctions underlines the United States' dissatisfaction with market-opening moves that Telmex and Cofetel have made since the first trade organization case, which was filed in November 2000, during the final months of the Clinton administration. Access rates to Telmex's phone lines were reduced, interconnection fees for long-distance calls from one country to the other were lowered, and new regulations were drafted. 
Mr. Zoellick's office said today that Mexico still had not dismantled its "anticompetitive cross-border telecommunications regime," even though it had pledged to do so.

HEADLINE: South Koreans Criticize Bush's Methods, if Not His Message 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Ask a South Korean on the streets of this city what he or she thinks about President Bush's recent statements including North Korea in a so-called axis of evil and many will say they are shocked and even insulted. 
 Probe a little further and despite the widespread feeling of offense, many people here also say they agree with Mr. Bush, up to a point. 
 With the approach of Mr. Bush's first official visit to this country on Tuesday, few South Koreans took direct issue with his characterization of North Korea. Instead, in numerous interviews, people from all walks of life expressed chagrin that Mr. Bush had shown so little delicacy in addressing a government that their own government has struggled to engage, and they said they were worried that Mr. Bush had made things worse. 
This is the world of South Korean public opinion, in which few countries arouse such conflicted feelings as the United States and North Korea. Put the two together, and add some provocative language from an American president, and feelings that seem mutually contradictory begin to surface.
"The sunshine policy is generally accepted as the greatest achievement of the Kim Dae Jung government," said Song Kyung Sang, referring to Mr. Kim's diplomacy of engagement with the North. "But with that single remark, Bush seems like he is trying to destroy it." Mr. Song, a 58-year-old novelist, added, "The fact that he would say such things without consulting Koreans first is frankly an embarrassment to us." 
Another man of the same generation who was out enjoying the last day of the Lunar New Year holiday with his family expressed the same kind of shock, but with a nuance. "Basically I agree with what Bush said," said the man, a corporate executive named Lee Bong Hwan. "The way he said it, though, just wasn't professional. Maybe this is the way people talk in America, but in Korea, and in this part of the world, it sounds a bit strange."
Washington has a history here of building up resentments with what South Koreans see as scant consultation, followed by rash actions and statements. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter announced during a visit that the United States should withdraw its 37,000 troops from this country. Similarly, Koreans say, they were surprised to learn, after the fact, that President Bill Clinton had come close to war with North Korea in 1994 over the issue of nuclear weapons production.
"We have talked about this quite a bit among ourselves, and most of my friends think that Bush's comments were way too strong," said June Lee, a 28-year-old employee of an Internet company. "Personally, I kind of agree with President Bush. We are giving aid to North Korea all the time, and getting nothing in return. The comments were too strong, and the timing was bad, but in a way, he is right."
Ms. Lee's comments touch upon a major fault line in opinion between Washington and Seoul. If Mr. Bush thinks the government of Kim Jong Il is evil because of its international missile sales, many South Koreans think the North evil mostly for its human rights abuses, and for something more insidious: the drag of a desperately poor North Korea on this country's astounding recent economic progress.
Remarkably, although Seoul is just 30 miles from the world's most heavily armed border, and though North and South Korea remain technically at war, few South Koreans perceive their neighbor as quite such a threat as Washington says it is. Instead many South Koreans dread the effects that helping North Korea might have on their prosperity.
Yet although a growing sense of being had by North Korea has steadily eroded the president's popularity, most Koreans say the sunshine policy should continue after the presidential election in December.
"We don't really know the inner workings of the sunshine policy," said Kim Sang Bum, 34, a computer company employee interviewed in a downtown park. "But over all, even though we complain about it, everyone knows that it is a good thing."

HEADLINE: Thorny Rights Disputes Await Bush in China 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
Just this week, a Chinese-born businessman from Connecticut who has been detained without explanation for almost a year in Inner Mongolia managed to let his wife know that he had been beaten unconscious after his arrest, resulting in a severe brain injury.
 The case of the businessman, Liu Yaping, is among a number of increasingly difficult legal disputes that have received prominent attention from United States officials, politicians and human rights groups. The issue could cloud President Bush's talks with China's Communist leaders on his first official visit next week. 
 Mr. Liu, who was detained last March 8, faxed a letter to his American wife this week about the beating that he said occurred after he stood for 22 hours of interrogation without food or water last April. 
Other cases that have caused friction between China and the United States include two Internet entrepreneurs who posted progressive political essays on the Web, an academic jailed because his research touched on sensitive topics, and another businessman based in the United States who, like Mr. Liu, apparently got caught up in local political feuds.
These cases illustrate a shift in human rights disputes between China and the United States in recent years, which have become more diverse and in some ways harder to solve.
While human rights concerns used to focus primarily on known dissidents imprisoned for challenging China's government, many of the new disputes involve formerly unknown people incarcerated for far murkier offenses.
In some instances even the Chinese police have struggled to define the crimes, resulting in long detentions without clear charges or a trial. 
"These kinds of cases present a new wrinkle in the rights agenda," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Asia director for Human Rights Watch in Washington. "But our core concern remains the same: the lack of rule of law and the abuse of state power whether it's directed at dissidents, internet entrepreneurs, scholars, or businessman."
With so many Chinese now studying or living in the United States, a growing number of the prisoners are American citizens or permanent residents or have close ties to the West, pushing otherwise obscure cases into the international limelight.
With China and the United States now focusing on their mutual interests, particularly the war on terror, some human rights advocates worry that such cases will be ignored during Mr. Bush's visit.
"How they will balance the counterterrorism offensive, nonproliferation issues, trade concerns and human rights is still an unanswered question," Mr. Jendrzejczyk said.
Last summer the Bush administration presented the Chinese government with 68 cases that it was concerned about, and in October it held a first dialogue on human rights issues with the Chinese, in Washington.
Chinese officials were hoping for a second meeting in Beijing this spring. But the administration is holding off until there are more tangible results, said someone familiar with the negotiations.
In apparent good-will gestures, China recently released an exiled Tibetan scholar based in the United States who was arrested seven years ago on espionage charges, and, last week, a Hong Kong man convicted of smuggling an unapproved version of the Bible into China. He was freed after religious groups and Mr. Bush himself lobbied for his release.
But on Sunday, China's government press agency published remarks by Li Peng, head of China's legislature, that seemed intended to emphasize that even personal intervention by the president might have limited success. 
"We are firmly opposed to interfering in other countries' internal affairs by using the human rights issue," Mr. Li said.
Mr. Liu, who has a green card and was in China setting up a Web design company, has been held without a trial by police in Hohhut, Inner Mongolia, officially charged only with minor economic crimes that usually bring at most a fine, a Chinese lawyer said.
Aggressive protests by the American ambassador here, as well as by United States senators and congressmen, have failed to bring about his full release or even an explanation for his detention.
Last month, apparently in response to American pressure, the police in Inner Mongolia agreed to let Mr. Liu move from his guarded hospital bed to his parents' home. There he is under a lesser form of police custody, which allowed him to send his fax, said his wife, Pei Zhang, an American citizen. 
But he is not allowed to travel outside Hohhut, not even to Beijing for medical treatment, and he has been told that once President Bush leaves on Feb. 22 his situation will worsen again, his wife said.
In this week's fax Mr. Liu said local military and police officials had used torture during interrogations and encouraged him to denounce high-level local officials who are his friends. The April beating left him unconscious for half an hour, and prison officials initially declined to take him to a hospital, leaving a cellmate to care for him, the fax said.
His family suspects that Mr. Liu is caught up in feuds among provincial leaders; his confinement has been supervised by a deputy Communist Party secretary of the province, Wan Jisheng, his fax said.
The police and other authorities in Inner Mongolia failed to respond to dozens of phone calls and faxed questions concerning the case, saying only that they were "unclear" why he was being held.
Another thorny legal case that the United States Embassy in Beijing has pursued repeatedly is that of Fong Fuming, a power company consultant and former Chinese power industry official, now an American citizen. Mr. Fong has been held by Chinese state security since early 2000, although he has never been found guilty of any crime.
In September last year, after 18 months of unexplained detention, he was charged with "obtaining state secrets" for overseas organizations and giving bribes -- charges his family and lawyers dispute. He was tried in October, but no verdict has been yet returned, even though legal time limits have passed.
The judge has said he is helpless to move more quickly, since the case "has to wait for the leadership to decide," said Jerome Cohen, a New York lawyer with extensive experience in China, who has advised Mr. Liu's and Mr. Fong's families.
"The authorities have violated numerous aspect of China's own criminal procedure law," Mr. Cohen said. "There are thousands of such cases where people are just stuck, and unless someone puts on the pressure they stay there. If they can't convict, they just hold them indefinitely."
Other cases taken up by rights groups or the American government involve Chinese citizens with strong connections to the West or whose detentions could by proxy affect American citizens or companies.
In a case that has alarmed Western academics, Xu Zerong, a mainland-born Hong Kong resident who spent most of the 1990's at Oxford University, was recently sentenced to 13 years in prison, primarily for "leaking state secrets" in connection with his academic work on the Korean War.
Last year a number of Chinese-born Western academics were detained for periods from four days to several months by the Chinese state security apparatus. Those with American citizenship or residency rights were ultimately freed.
Some said the police had considered publicly available materials that the scholars had gathered or used in their academic work to be "harmful to national security" -- a worrisome precedent in the academic world.
Two young Chinese Internet entrepreneurs, Huang Qi and Yang Zili, have likewise received Western support; both of their cases have been raised recently in hearings before Congress.
Both men have been in prison for a long time on serious charges of trying to "undermine state security," in part for their involvement in progressive Internet ventures. Both were officially tried last year, but no verdict has been delivered, despite the passage of legal deadlines.
Mr. Huang, who owned a Web site in Sichuan Province that posted articles on topics from rural poverty to political reform, was detained on June 3, 2000. His family has not seen him since, friends said.
Mr. Yang, who was detained in March 2001, was a computer wiz and prolific essayist on social topics who published his writings on his own home page. With seven friends, he also convened an occasional discussion group by the lake at Beijing University.
He and three friends were tried on Sept. 28 for "organizing to overthrow the government," and there has been no decision as yet.
"When we ask what is happening, the court says, 'Sorry but we don't have any power to resolve this,' " said Lu Kun, his wife, who has not spoken with her husband for almost a year.
Of course, the United States government has also lobbied on behalf of more classic political prisoners and dissidents. Its list of 68 includes some members of the underground Christian Church in China, for example, as well as Rebiya Kadeer, a high-profile Muslim businesswoman who was detained on her way to meet with a congressional delegation in 2000.
She was later sentenced to eight years in prison for leaking state secrets -- apparently based on the fact that she sent local newspaper articles to her husband, an activist for Chinese Muslims in the United States.
Also included is a veteran dissident, Xu Wenli, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison in late 1999 for his involvement with the China Democratic Party, a fledgling pro-democracy party that was ultimately declared illegal by the Communist state.
Dozens of former members of the China Democratic Party are in prison. But Mr. Xu has a daughter in New York and has drawn more international attention.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: RECYCLING; 
Glass, Metal and Plastic May Become Plain Trash

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The task of getting rid of New York City's waste has always generated headaches. And since 1993, when a mandatory citywide residential recycling law took effect, it has also essentially required two separate systems -- one for the ordinary domestic detritus of coffee grounds and spoiled take-out, and one for recyclables.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal yesterday to eliminate the metal, glass and plastic portion of the recycling program would achieve most of its projected savings of $57 million a year by merging parts of that overlapping system back into one. Metal, glass and plastic, which account for about 40 percent of the city's daily recycling total of 2,400 tons, would lose their separate status and become once again ordinary trash, picked up by ordinary garbage trucks. 
 Environmentalists say the equation is not that simple. Although most tempered their criticism of the mayor's plan with a nod of understanding about the city's economic plight, they said that suspending the program could cost New York even more in the long run by adding to the garbage export costs and hurting the environment by requiring more out-of-town trips by garbage-hauling trucks. It also sounds a retreat, they said, from a program that the city has supported with hundreds of millions of dollars in promotion and advertising. 
"The truth is that for every ton of material that's not recycled, we have to pay someone to bury it," said Mark Izeman, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York City-based conservation group.
City officials say that while paper recycling has proven its value, with a well-developed pulp market that the city can sell to, recycling glass, metal and plastic is ultimately a big money loser. New York now pays an average of $64 a ton have its 11,000 tons a day of garbage hauled away, mostly to landfills in other states. The 1,000 tons of metals, glass and plastic a day, by contrast, will cost about $100 a ton to recycle under proposed contracts with recycling vendors that would begin in July, said Steven W. Lawitts, the deputy commissioner for administration at the Department of Sanitation.
The mayor's proposal would also eliminate, through attrition, about 450 sanitation jobs involved in recycling collection, of a workforce of 6,700 people. And it would take 1,000 trucks a a week that pick up metal, glass and plastic off the streets, Mr. Lawitts said. 
New York has long struggled with its recycling program. The law's goal to recycle 25 percent of the city's waste has often seemed like a mountain shimmering in the distance that might never be climbed. Last year, about 20 percent of the waste was recycled. But, like recycling programs elsewhere, there has also been a civic and environmental ethos that said, through television advertisements and posters in the subway, that recycling was about more than money.
People should separate their trash, the ads said, not because the law required it, but because it was a good thing to do.
Mr. Izeman at the Natural Resources Defense Council said that the losses in that realm of public education might be hard to recoup when and if the program was restarted -- a cost that would go beyond money as well.
"This is a program that needs to be nurtured," he said.
Other environmentalists warned that every additional ton of trash that is shipped out of state makes the city more vulnerable. The states that are receiving the trash, they said, might restrict their laws or raise fees to discourage trash export in the future.
But Department of Sanitation officials say it is the pincer of rising costs -- recycling expenses going up even faster than trash-disposal expenses -- that is at the heart of the mayor's plan.
Under the set of contracts that were recently put out for opening bidding for metal, glass and plastic recycling, prices would go up to $100 a ton from the current $58 a ton beginning in July, said Mr. Lawitts, the deputy commissioner.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: FINANCIAL REPORTING; 
Pressure for Overhaul Builds on Stock Options

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
John McCain and three of his Senate colleagues want to take a multibillion-dollar whack out of corporate America's profit column.
 Microsoft would lose more than $2 billion in earnings. About $1 billion would vanish from AOL Time Warner's income statement. The Walt Disney Company would lose almost $300 million, and Starbucks $40 million. 
 In the wake of Enron's collapse and widespread worries about the quality of financial statements, the senators introduced a bill yesterday to force companies to deduct from profits the estimated cost of stock options they give employees.
Companies, in reporting profits, now consider stock options to have no cost, but many receive large tax deductions when employees exercise them, much as corporations do for the salaries they pay. 
Because the debate is essentially a replay of one that seemed to have ended in the 1990's, the fight will be one of the first tests of just how much Enron's collapse has altered the political atmosphere for corporate America. 
Changing accounting rules may seem cosmetic, but the measure could have broad effects on corporations and the stock market, analysts say. Options might become less popular if companies that award an unusually large number of them can no longer report higher profits than their rivals. By lowering reported earnings, a change could also cause investors to question whether stock prices -- already historically high, relative to earnings -- are inflated.
Had a similar law been in place in 2000, profits reported by companies would have been 8 percent lower, according to a study by Bear Stearns.
Corporate executives are expected to oppose the measure strenuously, much as they did when regulators considered a similar move in the early 1990's, when 100 chief executives flew to Washington one day to help defeat it. There is no simple way to estimate the value of an option, the executives say, and any attempt to do so would only muddle income statements.
In 1994, the Senate voted 88 to 9 to effectively prevent the Financial Accounting Standards Board from forcing companies to account for options, but political analysts said the situation now was too close to call.
When Mr. McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat, offered a similar bill in 1997, they knew it did not have enough support to pass, said Mark Buse, a former McCain aide who is now a lobbyist at ML Strategies in Washington. But today, with corporate America appearing less triumphant, "the whole dynamic has shifted," he said. 
In addition, a recently formed international accounting standards board will consider the issue this year. And top officials at the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents many large pension funds and which opposed a change in the 1990's, have switched their position because they consider option grants to be out of control at many companies, said Sarah Teslik, the group's executive director.
The advocates of new accounting rules argue that the current system allows companies to give an overly cheery picture of their financial condition. The problem has become worse as stock options have grown in popularity over the last 15 years, the critics say.
When executives award options to themselves or other employees, they reduce the portion of the company that existing shareholders own, lowering the value of the stock. But income statements do not try to calculate that cost.
"Accounting rules should attempt to get the clearest picture of a company's financial condition," said Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, who is sponsoring the bill with Mr. Levin, Mr. McCain and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois.
"Right now, they're just ignoring options altogether," Mr. Fitzgerald said.
Janet Pegg, an analyst at Bear Stearns, said the issue is best understood by considering two companies, one that pays workers in cash, another that pays lower salaries but makes up the difference with options. If the two are otherwise identical, the company that gives options will appear more profitable, Ms. Pegg said.
The Senate bill would require companies either to forgo the tax deduction that corporations take when employees exercise options or to include the cost of options, as estimated by a complex formula, in their income statement. Nearly all companies would continue to claim the deduction, accountants predicted.
The technology, telecommunications and financial service sectors tend to hand out more options than most companies. In 2000, the list of companies whose option grants would have reduced their operating profits by at least 10 percent included AOL, Cisco, Disney, Gap, Halliburton, Hasbro, Louisiana-Pacific, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, J. C. Penney, Pfizer, Staples, Starbucks and Tyco International, according to Bear Stearns.
From 1996 to 2000, Enron received $381 million more in tax rebates than it paid in corporate income taxes, partly because of deductions it claimed from option exercises, Mr. Levin said yesterday.
Companies are now required to estimate the cost of options, and their effect on earnings, in a footnote to their annual report.
Opponents of a rule change say that the footnote provides the best solution, by giving investors enough information but not corrupting profit statements with fuzzy estimates. "You don't want to put a number in the financials that we don't have any faith in," said Mark G. Heesen, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, a Washington trade group. 
The bill's sponsors and their allies said that income statements already include many economic estimates and that relatively few investors read the footnotes.
"While it's certainly possible to figure things out, it's difficult," said John Y. Campbell, an economist at Harvard. As a result, he added, the headline numbers that companies report do have a significant effect on stock prices.
"The quality of accounting disclosure matters," Mr. Campbell said.

HEADLINE: Who's Hu in Beijing 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush's trip to the Far East next week will culminate in a summit in China with a lame Peking duck. 
 The Communist Party leader and president, Jiang Zemin, the "Third Generation" of leadership, will be replaced in both jobs within the next year. He does not have the power to name his favorite as successor. 
 George W. will come to the meeting fresh from quick stops in Japan (where Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi wants to cooperate with us in a defense against China's growing missile threat) and in South Korea (where President Kim Dae Jung has been frustrated by the yearlong refusal of North Korea's strange dictator to respond to the South's "sunshine" offers). 
Bush's visit to Jiang is a courtesy call to a departing leader who is getting lavish praise for giving the most modest support to a global war on terror. As a humble hegemonist, Bush will not complain about China's heavy investment in electronic systems aimed at crippling America's computer networks, which Chinese intelligence is convinced is the superpower's Achilles' heel. Nor will Bush impolitely ask Jiang to stop buying supersonic "Sunburn" missiles from Russia, which are designed primarily to threaten U.S. aircraft carriers. 
In all likelihood, the Americans will be looking beyond Jiang at the meeting to get some kind of fix on the man most likely to succeed: Hu Jintao. At 59, Hu is in the "Fourth Generation" of Chinese leaders, following Mao Zedong in the 50's and 60's, Deng Xiaoping in the 80's and Jiang in recent years.
The man thought to be certain to soon lead one billion, three hundred million Chinese is a politician who has never been interviewed by a real reporter. Until he quietly visited Europe last year and met a delegation of Old China Hands in Beijing last month, Hu was a total mystery to Westerners.
We know the bare bones of his career: A student of hydraulic engineering, Hu became an ardent Communist and the protege of Hu Yaobang, an early reformer. Put in charge of Tibet, the young politician turned against his mentor and led a brutal crackdown on dissidents. He further gained favor with the hard-liner Li Peng by being the first regional leader to applaud the massacre in Tiananmen Square. 
Such trimming earned him the reputation of being a sunzi, literally grandson, but with a sense of "manipulator of elders." He was propelled onto the standing committee of the Politburo a decade ago as its youngest member, and runs a think tank in Beijing that keeps Hu in touch with the power-hungry Fourth Generation. He is a Chinese Putin: sharp memory, agile loyalties, openly secretive. Chosen by Jiang to brief propagandists after NATO accidentally bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Hu said "the hostile forces in the U.S. will never give up their attempt to subjugate China." 
Let's hope this skilled opportunist is in the room with Jiang when Bush puts forward what the China expert Winston Lord has called a "sweet and sour" policy.
The sweet: (1) Isn't it great how we share an interest in stopping terrorists in South Asia, and maybe your agents in North Korea can pinpoint nuclear sites that our eyes in the sky cannot see. (2) China's interests and ours coincide in averting a war between India and your nuclear client, Pakistan. (3) Tell North Korea, a danger to Asian stability, that you won't come to its rescue as your grandfathers did if our bombers must de-proliferate its nukes. (4) U.S. investment and markets can alleviate your coming world trade unemployment pains, once you stop using slave labor and make contracts enforceable with honest judges. 
The sour: (1) I meant what I said about doing whatever's necessary about helping Taiwan defend itself, and you see how I do what I say. (2) Why don't you see the Dalai Lama and make life bearable for Buddhists in Tibet? It's in China's self-interest to stop persecuting Catholics and Protestants in the South, and torturing the Falun Gong everywhere. (3) You'll never root out debilitating corruption while you refuse to free the media, and you'll fail to educate your Fifth Generation by shutting down free Internet access. 
Bush should make this pitch while looking only at Jiang. But we all know Hu's on first.

HEADLINE: The 'Evil' Missiles 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
President Bush's tough stance toward North Korea has yet to stem its sales of ballistic missiles to nations like Iran, Syria or Libya. But his description of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" has already distressed a long-time ally: South Korea.
 In recent days, State Department officials say, they have worked hard to ensure that Mr. Bush's visit to Asia next week will be perceived as a success, drafting a diplomatic script to ease South Korea's concerns. 
 Mr. Bush will reaffirm his willingness -- first voiced last summer -- to negotiate with North Korea anytime and anywhere. In return, South Korea will endorse the president's fight against terrorism, American and Korean officials say. 
But those declarations will merely paper over a fundamental debate about the best way to deal with North Korea, one of the most isolated and militarized nations, and stanch the flow of its missile technology to other countries.
Former American officials who have negotiated with North Korea have said that the administration's strategy is a virtual prescription for deadlock and that the North Koreans, while difficult negotiating partners, have kept to previous commitments.
"I think the Bush administration has a visceral as well as an intellectual problem with negotiating with countries that are reprehensible in their domestic and international behavior," said Robert L. Gallucci, who negotiated the accord to freeze North Korea's nuclear program in 1994. "The administration says it is willing to meet anytime and anywhere with the North Koreans. But what they mean is that they are prepared to meet to accept North Korea's surrender on the points at issue."
That sort of criticism draws a tart response from the administration, which insists that only its firm set of demands offers the hope of a genuine relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.
"There is great utility in entering into a broad-based dialogue with North Korea aimed at transforming the relationship and reducing the North Korean threat across the board," a senior official said. "If we begin these discussions, there is flexibility built in. The problem is that North Korea is unwilling to talk to us."
The rhetoric from Washington seems unlikely to change the North Koreans' mind. Last week, the government in Pyongyang abruptly canceled a visit by American experts and academics that had been planned for after Mr. Bush's trip to Asia and was seen as a way for North Korea to maintain dialogue with the Americans, if not with the administration.
In branding North Korea an evil and dangerous regime, the administration has repeatedly complained that North Korea is the world's principal missile exporter. Missile sales are an important source of hard currency for North Korea. 
Iran is developing a medium-range missile, the Shahab-3, which is derived from the North Korean Nodong missile. The Iranian system will have the range to strike Israel, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and American officials worry that Iran will eventually develop a longer-range system, capable of striking American territory, by using technology for North Korea's Taepodong missiles. 
Syria, Libya and Egypt have been upgrading their missile force with North Korean assistance, according to American intelligence. Pakistan has also acquired Nodong missiles, although Pakistan is now in such good graces in Washington after its assistance in the war on Afghanistan that Mr. Bush did not raise the missile sales with President Pervez Musharraf, who was in Washington today.
Despite food shortages and a desperately bad economy, North Korea devotes as estimated 25 percent of its gross domestic product to its one-million-strong military and has concentrated much of its firepower near the border with South Korea. 
But it also true that North Korea has kept its pledge not to test its missiles in flight, a step it would need to take to deploy a missile that could hit American territory with a nuclear-size payload. 
The Central Intelligence Agency recently reported that North Korea has also continued to abide by a freeze in its nuclear reactor program, as required under the accord negotiated by the Clinton administration. American officials also say North Korea no longer appears to be actively supporting terrorism.
While the Bush administration is considering military action against Iraq, a pre-emptive American military campaign against North Korea is almost unthinkable.
North Korean artillery is deployed so close to the border with the south that a war on the peninsula would virtually invite the destruction of the South Korea capital. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell stressed that no American offensive was being planned against the north. 
Before the Bush team took power, the Clinton administration conducted serious talks with North Korea on banning the export of all its missiles and missile technology. Clinton officials also sought to negotiate an end to the production, testing and deployment of North Korea's missiles that were capable of carrying a 1,000-pound payload more than 180 miles.
Clinton officials believed they were within striking distance of an accord. They were trying to seal the deal with hundreds of millions of dollars a year in relief aid, free satellite launching services and a visit to Pyongyang by President Bill Clinton. 
But the Bush administration was never happy with this approach. After a review, it developed an approach that melded the State Department's interest in talks with the position of hard-liners in the government who believe Washington should wait for North Korea's collapse.
The Bush administration stiffened the terms of the Clinton missile proposals by demanding stringent verification. It also broadened Washington's negotiating position by asking North Korea to accelerate inspections under the earlier accord that froze Pyongyang's nuclear program, and by insisting that North Korea reduce the threat posed by its conventional forces. At the same time, the administration has been vague about what financial rewards, if any, it might give.
"The issue of conventional forces is extremely important," a senior Bush administration official said. "North Korea's conventional forces are very destabilizing and potentially as dangerous as its missile exports." 
North Korea reacted sharply to the tougher position and the two sides have yet to engage in serious dialogue.
Some former officials say there is merit in the administration's effort to seek broad concessions. But they said Washington should be prepared to seek a separate deal banning missile exports if progress on a broader front cannot be made. 
"I think there is a good possibility of concluding a deal that bans the export of missiles and missile-related technology," said Robert J. Einhorn, who led talks with North Korea during the Clinton administration. 
So the immediate concern for the Bush administration is to assuage the concerns of South Korea.
According to a recent poll by Hankyoreh, a South Korean newspaper, 54 percent of those surveyed believed Washington and Pyongyang were each to blame for the downturn in relations. Another 28 percent felt Washington was primarily to blame, while only 17 percent believed North Korea was more at fault. The poll, of 700 adults, had an error margin of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. 
"The Bush administration's strategy in Seoul will be to embrace South Korea and hold North Korea at arm's distance," said Kurt Campbell, a senior Pentagon official during the Clinton administration. "The political climate in Seoul will make that most challenging."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
Bush Hails Musharraf, and Warns Iraq

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 

 BODY:
President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, whom the United States treated as an outcast after he seized power in a coup two years ago, was welcomed to the White House by President Bush today as a "leader of great courage and vision" who would continue to receive economic and military aid for his help in the war against terrorism.
 At a news conference with General Musharraf, Mr. Bush also implicitly acknowledged that he was reviewing options to topple Saddam Hussein of Iraq. A variety of actions are under consideration, he said. "I will reserve whatever options I have. I'll keep them close to my vest." 
 He added, "One of the worst things that can happen in the world is terrorist organizations mating up with nations which have a bad history, and nations which develop weapons of mass destruction."
"Saddam Hussein needs to understand I am serious about defending our country," he said.
The warmth of the welcome General Musharraf received at the White House indicated that he has been rehabilitated in Washington's eyes since the Sept. 11 attacks. Soon afterward, the Pakistani leader swung his support behind the United States and away from the Taliban rulers that Pakistan had supported in Afghanistan. Since then, the Pakistani leader has also pledged to crack down on terrorism practiced against India by groups with ties to Pakistan or with bases there, and has arrested hundreds of Islamic militants.
One sign of the administration's new solicitousness toward Pakistan is that Mr. Bush did not, according to his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, raise the subject of North Korea's missile exports to Pakistan, even though the United States has identified Islamabad as one of North Korea's biggest customers.
Asked if American aid would be contingent on Pakistan severing its ties to North Korea and its missile program, Mr. Fleischer said, "Not that I've heard."
Some Clinton-era sanctions on Pakistan for its dealings with North Korea remain in effect.
While General Musharraf, who was dressed in a civilian suit rather than the military uniform he often prefers at home, clearly reveled in his warm greeting here, he will not return home with many economic benefits for his impoverished country. Mr. Bush promised very little new money, aside from a $200 million credit to write off nearly $1 billion in Pakistani debt.
The general would most like to receive American arms shipments, or trade concessions to make it easier for Pakistan to export textiles here. Members of Congress from textile states have bitterly fought administration efforts to lift the barriers on such imports.
At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who met separately with General Musharraf, said only that the two had discussed ways of reviving cooperation that existed before the Clinton administration imposed sanctions after Pakistan and India tested nuclear weapons in 1998.
At the White House, General Musharraf also said he was "reasonably sure" that the kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter, Daniel Pearl, was still alive. But he offered no evidence. A leading suspect in the case, apprehended a day ago by Pakistani authorities, has reportedly admitted his involvement in the kidnapping, but professed not to know where the reporter was being held. 
General Musharraf suggested that the kidnapping was part of a predictable backlash to his crackdown on extremist Islamic groups in Pakistan. "We are not deterred," he said, "These kinds of things were expected."
The mere presence of the Pakistani leader in Washington was sufficient to ruffle India, which continues to see the general as duplicitous, and failing to make a genuine effort to contain terrorism.
India today huffily dismissed a vague accusation Mr. Musharraf made Tuesday night in a speech here, when he contended his country's adversary had conducted -- or was about to conduct -- fresh nuclear tests.
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee rejected the allegations as routine propaganda, the "old tactics of Pakistan to mislead the world community."
General Musharraf made the initial remark at an event arranged by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He broached the alarming issue by mentioning India's Jan. 25 test-firing of the Agni, an intermediate-range missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
"The missile test carried out by India and some information, some news even, of maybe a possibility of a nuclear test is most untimely and may I also say provocative," the general said elliptically.
After the speech, he was asked to clarify the statement.
"There are certain indications and I did share this information with the United States leadership," the general said, shedding little more light. "I can't give conclusive evidence of it. But I thought if at all there was a possibility, it should be checked."
Nirupama Rao, a spokeswoman for India's Foreign Ministry, said today that "false allegations" coming from General Musharraf's lips were "timed-released capsules of diversionary propaganda."
Last week, in an interview with The Washington Post, the general said "it was very much a possibility" that India orchestrated the kidnapping of Mr. Pearl.
To even the recriminatory score, Mr. Vajpayee said today that Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the chief suspect detained in the kidnapping and someone considered a terrorist by India, could not have lived clandestinely in Pakistan "without the government's connivance."
General Musharraf's accusation about an Indian nuclear test underscored the lingering worries about a confrontation between the two powers of the subcontinent, who have fought three wars since the territory of the old British Raj split into two countries, India and Pakistan, in 1947.
Kashmir is the major bone of contention. Pakistan believes all of the mostly Muslim territory in the Himalayas should have become part of Pakistan in 1947.
Most recently, both India and Pakistan have massed troops on their mutual border. The buildup followed a Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament, which the Indians quickly attributed to two militant groups operating in Pakistan and pushing to get Kashmir back from India.
Many analysts have said the greatest danger of a nuclear exchange stems from the inability of the two suspicious foes to monitor accurately what the other is doing. Bush administration officials have begun to talk -- although not necessarily with the two countries -- about some kind of an arms control agreement or understanding of each other's nuclear doctrine.
"The chances of either side making a mistake are greater than ever," one senior administration official said recently.

Sh! They're Making Mini-Masterpieces

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
TO feel at home. It's an emotional connection, an intangible tug of the heart. To some, it happens in a cabin in the wilderness; to others, a quiet corner beside the kitchen window. The home is the most intimate of landmarks, the place where newborns explore the boundless frontiers of carpeting, and memories are like doors opening into every room.
 Like roughly 43 million other Americans, I spent last year looking for a home. In real estate, as in love, it's not easy starting over. Home for 13 years had been an apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y. It was the winding staircase with the funny window, the walls that shimmied from subway vibrations at rush hour, the reassuring din of children's hockey pucks ricocheting off street curbs. 
 We arrived in the East Bay of San Francisco in the midst of the dot-com boom. Like many newcomers, we rented, taking a two-year lease that seemed like an eternity when we signed it. The Hunt, minus the bloodhounds, began more than a year before we had to move. Weekends were subsumed with Sunday open houses, the fine art of gawking in neighbors' homes having moved right up there with baseball as a favorite American pastime. 
The houses were propped to the nines by "stagers," a mostly West Coast phenomenon in which decorators are hired to de-personalize houses for sale by replacing the warts of real-life decor with picture-perfect interiors. Like a soap opera, whose sets they resembled, these interiors were deliberately designed to evoke an emotional response. The storybook beds were always piled high with chenille throws and fluffy duvets, a la Snow White, and foil mints beckoned atop cumulus pillows. The kitchen was always perfect -- until hours later, when you realized there was no refrigerator and absolutely no room for one.
In desperation, we decided to write love letters to houses. Walking around the neighborhood with our son on his bicycle, we dropped love letters surreptitiously at the foot of driveways of houses we admired. "Dear Person With the Charming Dutch Colonial," they read, or, "Dear Neighbor With the Flawlessly Restored Victorian."
Much to our amazement, the ploy, supplemented by a blitzkrieg of letters from our realtor, Mavis Delacroix, eventually worked. Miraculously, a Deep Throat -- now our neighbor, Peggy -- anonymously phoned Mavis to say that her neighbors were moving and that theirs sounded like the perfect house. It's a brown shingle in a bastardized Prairie Style, situated between two redwood trees. Feathery light filters through the branches and into the living room. On an urban street, it feels as if we're living in a forest. 
We spent the summer getting the house ready. It was a season of firsts -- our first house, first yard, first experience with an architect (actually our former neighbor Lisa Joyce, whose gift for design is matched by her steadiness and good sense as a person). We grew attached to the men -- they were all men -- who spent over a month painting, stripping and sawing. (Do-it-yourselfers we're not.) Mostly, we helped paint, infusing color into a house that was dingy white. Lisa gave us courage and deftly handled our nervousness. The colors are pretty restrained except for my cantaloupe and lipstick-pink office, which I had wanted to feel like Mexico to ward off rainy-season blues. Our 7-year-old, Gabe, chose a Yellow Submarine motif, and Jacob, 10, decorated his room with baseball placards that he spotted -- and correctly dated to be from 1969 -- at the flea market. 
We feel as if we have always been here, which may be the most profound definition of home. When looking out the windows of our apartment in New York, we always knew where we were.We could only be in Brooklyn, with its backyard fire escapes and crooked sidewalks and glorious brick buildings in infinite red and rose hues. When you look out the windows of our new house, you can only be in the East Bay, its green hills shrouded in mist.
Our favorite view looks onto an Oakland cemetery that was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted -- specifically, onto a triumphal neo-Classical-style crematorium. If you squint hard, it looks like Bethlehem. I have realized that for me, home is knowing where you are. How do you tell that to a realtor? 
THE definition of home is deeply personal for everyone. Our homes are mini-masterpieces upon which our humanity is written, whether it's planting daffodil bulbs, fashioning a home office or learning how to decode real estate listings in the newspaper. Some people fantasize about Dacor cooktops, others about high-performance routers. But the impulse to shape space, our space, no matter how humble, is universal. 
Since 9/11, we have been hearing a lot about "cocooning." Americans, we're told, are burrowing in, stockpiling DVD's, candles, knitting needles and p.j.'s, becoming Norman Rockwell images beside the Nintendo. But it will take a while to see how it all plays out. 
Over the last decade, our homes have reflected America's affluence, with the average size of a new house now a whopping 2,330 square feet (the excess born not of function but of imitation, because somebody they know has one, said Gopal Ahluwalia, the director of research at the National Association of Home Builders. Even in recessions, house sizes show no signs of shrinking. Over the next five years, Mr. Ahluwalia said, we'll spend 2 percent of our budgets wiring these rambling abodes with increasingly sophisticated security systems. 
Terence Riley, the chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, thinks that a shift in values has occurred that will lead to authenticity replacing image. (What's in: any material with an integral finish; that is, stainless steel, wood or concrete -- in other words, nothing with a phony veneer. What's out: fake moldings by the foot.) The ever-increasing distance between home and the workplace, has resulted in unsatisfactory life experiences, in Mr. Riley's words.
Michael Bell, a Houston architect, has calculated that Houstonians collectively commute 53 million miles a day to work. In a time of limited resources, this may be the primary issue planners will face.
Historically, however, the image of home has remained surprisingly constant. The freestanding single-family house remains a powerful force in the American psyche, despite profound social changes. "We still want the three- or four-bedroom home with the backyard," said Dolores Hayden, a professor of architecture at Yale University. "We still love the house of long ago." 
OF course, loving a home is one thing; maintaining it is quite another. My family and I are true Americans now, possessed of an endless to-do list. This spring will find us in mortal combat with wood-boring beetles, who have found nirvana in our deck, and shoring up a garage of nonreinforced masonry that Lisa, our architect, is certain will collapse in the next earthquake. We seem to have won Round 1 with the raccoons, who have spent the rainy season tearing up our new lawn. To fend them off, we spritzed the backyard with predators' essence -- coyote urine -- another example of Lisa's practical brilliance. (Who knew?) 
I suppose we're cocooning. We're trying hard not to think about ravenous insects, killer garages and our shot budget. We're trying to remind ourselves that from cocoons butterflies emerge.

HEADLINE: BUYING; 
Seeking Comfort in a Market That's Still Warm

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD 

 BODY:
EVERY economic cycle produces a proverb on how best to achieve the American dream. During the inflation-frenzied 1970's and early 80's, it was "Buy as much house as you can afford and finance it for as long as the lender will allow." With interest rates, house prices and incomes racing upward, leverage was considered a good thing. A hefty mortgage payment would soon turn to chump change while the house's value doubled or tripled. A house was an investment.
 In the early 90's, home prices stagnated in some areas and tumbled in others. Appreciation looked rather shabby compared with gains in the stock market, so a new maxim appeared: "Think of your house as a home, not an investment." A house was shelter. 
 In today's atypical economic cycle, where the recession has not been led by a decline in housing prices, the wisdom falls between the extremes. Poor stock-market performance has made housing seem like a stable and relatively low-risk investment. But annual appreciation cannot be counted on, so the mantra for buyers now is: "Choose a house and financing that fits your individual comfort level."
It could be a while before the housing market sees another year like 2001. New and existing home sales both broke records, according to David A. Lereah, the chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. Appreciation rose 5 to 8 percent, beating the year's 2.7 percent inflation rate and major stock-market indexes. Mortgages that originated last year reached a historic high of $2 trillion, up 33 percent from the previous record of $1.5 trillion in 1998, Mr. Duncan said. Inventories have dipped to historically low levels.
"It's unheard of in a year when there's a recession," said Frank E. Nothaft, the chief economist at Freddie Mac, a secondary mortgage market lender in McLean, Va.
Economists say the 11 cuts made last year by the Federal Reserve Board for the Federal funds rate helped fuel the strong activity in house buying and refinancing. In addition, there was a growing demand for homes from baby boomers, recent immigrants and minority households.
Consumers should see the market retreat to more normal levels in 2002, with increases of 2 to 4 percent in appreciation. Sales and mortgage originations are expected to fall off. Mortgage rates are already creeping up from a low during early November , when a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.45 percent, the lowest since Freddie Mac began its rate survey in 1968. Mortgage interest rates, on average, will be higher in 2002 than in 2001, Mr. Duncan said.
Yet, this may still be a good time to jump into the market. Consider Cleofer and Marie Smith of Bear, Del. They plan to move into a new $200,000 house in Smyrna, Del., in March. They think the low interest rates have allowed them to buy a bigger house with more land. At the same time, there was a bidding war on their $163,900 current house. 
"I follow the market pretty closely and I've never seen anything like this before," said Mr. Smith, a 39-year-old engineer. (Mrs. Smith, 37, is a banker.) "It's a good time to both buy and sell." 
That's how Clare Pelino of Philadelphia sees it, too. Although median prices in the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood climbed 61 percent from 1995 to 2000, she would like to buy a house there this year. In 2001, the median value of houses in this section were about $272,000. 
"I feel it's still a good time to buy a house, even though we're not used to paying such high prices here," said Ms. Pelino, who is 39 and owns a public relations firm. "I feel it's a safe bet -- the prices are only going to increase."
That may not be true everywhere. Ingo Winzer, president of Local Market Monitor in Wellesley, Mass., a company that tracks local real estate values and measures them against local economics, said that some communities were overvalued as much as 30 percent. Generally, prices for houses rise very quickly in good times but drop slowly when times change.
According to Mr. Winzer, overpriced markets include Miami (25 percent); New York City (23 percent); Portland, Ore. (30 percent); Des Moines (25 percent); and San Jose, Calif. (20 percent). "Many are at the peak-peak of prices," he said. "Buyers should be careful."
Cities he considered underpriced include: Rochester, N.Y; Hartford and New Haven; Philadelphia; Wilmington, Del.; Norfolk, Va.; and Little Rock, Ark.
But in the long run, homeowners nationwide should come out ahead, economists say.
Lasting concerns about sprawl and the environment will continue to dampen new construction, keeping supplies lower than demand, according to David W. Berson, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, the country's largest secondary mortgage market lender. At the same time, the strong demand is not about to disappear. Baby boomers, 38 to 56 years old, have not reached the peak age for homeownership, which is 65. Two large immigrant waves in the 80's and 90's will also increase demand, because homeownership among immigrants tends to skyrocket after they have lived in the country for 10 years, Mr. Berson said."The sheer numbers tell you demand for housing is going to grow," Mr. Duncan, the economist, said.

HEADLINE: GETTING SMART; 
Facing Down the Adjustable, Fixed and 3-Point Mortgage

 BODY:
Borrowers can find it difficult to wade through the roughly 10,000 mortgage lenders and more than 100 permutations of the mortgage loan. But information on how to navigate the industry, which is laden with jargon and fine print, is a mouse click away. There are more than 100,000 Web sites related to real estate. 
 Secondary mortgage market lenders, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, have home-buying primers on their Web sites as well (www .freddiemac.com/homebuyers and www.homepath.com). Consumers can also obtain free home-buying guides from the Fannie Mae Foundation by calling (800) 688-4663. 
 As a result of the wealth of information available to the public, more than half the people who bought a house in the last five years said they felt confident they were in control during the mortgage loan process, according to Fannie Mae.
Jason and Jennifer Kirsch of Harrisburg, Pa., recently began their house-hunting search by visiting Web sites and contacting lenders.
"I think we feel confident enough that if we found the right house we could make it happen," said Mr. Kirsch, who is 28 and a deputy press secretary to Gov. Mark S. Schweiker. Mrs. Kirsch, 28, is a social worker; they plan to look for a house in the $160,000 to $185,000 range.
Affordability guidelines that have been used for decades still generally apply: 28 percent of gross monthly income equals the maximum housing expense, or the mortgage principal and interest, homeowners insurance, taxes and, in some cases, private mortgage insurance. The housing expense, combined with monthly debt like credit card payments, should equal 36 percent of gross monthly income. But guidelines are not hard and fast.
"A better predictor of whether someone is a good credit risk is his credit history," said David W. Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. 
Banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and real estate agents will work with buyers to determine their mortgage ability. In addition, many Web sites have mortgage payment calculators.
Fluctuations in mortgage interest rates can change a loan picture drastically. So will the length of time to repay the loan. The down payment amount will also influence how much a buyer can afford. 
Experts recommend that buyers contact as many lenders as they can, though three is considered reasonable. Buyers can also use mortgage brokers, who match buyers with lenders, shopping a purchaser's mortgage for the best deal. Nearly a third of all buyers last year went to a mortgage broker for home loans, according to Fannie Mae.
The most popular mortgage is the 30-year fixed-rate, which is the easiest to qualify for. With a fixed-rate mortgage, a buyer borrows money at an interest rate that remains unchanged for the life of the loan. 
For people who plan to move in a few years and for those who expect their income to rise, an adjustable rate mortgage can be a sound alternative, because the initial interest rate is less than for a fixed-rate loan. But unlike a fixed mortgage, the interest rate on an adjustable mortgage is not constant, but can go up at a designated time if other interest rates do.
Costs for a mortgage can include discount points, with one point equaling 1 percent of the loan amount. Points are paid up front and can start at 0 and go up to 3 or more. Lenders typically offer a menu of interest rates and points. Loans with a lower interest rate tend to carry higher points and vice versa. Points are deductible on buyers' income taxes the year in which the mortgage originated. 
Over time, people have chosen to pay fewer points, Mr. Berson said. Because borrowers actively manage their mortgages today and refinance when rates drop, they do not want to pay points for a mortgage they might unload in a short time, he said.
Fees, like charges for the application and credit report, have been dropping as the use of electronic technology is incorporated into the mortgage process, Mr. Berson said. But buyers should beware of "junk fees," which a lender can legally add to a settlement statement. They go by a variety of names -- document preparation fee, underwriting analysis fee, tax escrow fee and escrow fund analysis fee. 
Compare such lenders' fees and negotiate. Settlement costs include the payment of points, transfer tax and lawyer fees. Lenders are required to provide the borrower with a good-faith estimate of closing costs.
Buyers who borrow more than 80 percent of the value of the house are usually required to buy private mortgage insurance. It's good to shop around for the best rates on this insurance, which protects the lender in case the buyer defaults. 
Some employers offer mortgage assistance. For example, Scott Delp, a 40-year-old bioengineering professor at Stanford University, obtained a mortgage for 3.5 percent from the university for the $850,000 house he and his wife, Lori, bought last year.
Some states, local governments and nonprofit organizations also offer programs. The Federal Housing Administration, which insures loans originated by lenders, allows buyers to put down as little as 3 to 5 percent. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also offer low-down-payment mortgages through conventional lenders.
And there is no down payment with a Veterans Administration guaranteed mortgage, which is available to qualified veterans.

HEADLINE: THE BIG PICTURE; 
Their Roles Are Sometimes Wooden but Always Solid

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES 

 BODY:
Movie characters are like everybody else. They just want a home of their own -- to enjoy the good life, to show off, to retreat to or to find peace of mind in. Characters buy, build, renovate -- whether they can afford it or not -- and inherit. In the movies, as in life, sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't. ANITA GATES

LIFE AS A HOUSE (2001)
 George Munroe (Kevin Kline), a terminally ill nonconformist and newly unemployed architect, has been saying for years that he was going to tear down his cliffside, ocean-view shack and build a house there instead. This time he does it. Everyone pitches in, including his son (Hayden Christiansen) and his ex-wife (Kristin Scott Thomas). They deal with the neighbor who insists the place is six inches taller than the building codes allow. The house gets unforgettable sunsets and looks great with its Christmas lights on. "It didn't need to be big," says George. "It didn't need to be beautiful. It just needed to be mine." 

THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (1979)
George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) can't believe their luck. A fixer-upper colonial, with a fireplace, sun porch and boathouse, is on the market for $80,000, when it should be much more. The Lutzes know that a family of six was murdered there, but who knew that would mean black slime oozing through the walls and plumbing, doors bursting off their hinges and mysterious voices saying, "Get out"? The house's curse also seems to force the cast, even Rod Steiger as a nauseated priest, to overact.

GONE WITH THE WIND (1939)
Never mind Tara. Scarlett O'Hara's (Vivien Leigh) dream house is the one that Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) built for her in Atlanta after the Civil War. Rhett, who finances the house with his blockade-running gains, assures his bride, "It can be as ornate as you want -- marble terraces, stained-glass windows and all." Not to mention lots of wrought iron, a garden with fountains and that grand carpeted staircase.

HOUSE SITTER (1992)
Newt Davis (Steve Martin), a talented architect, designs and builds a gorgeous two-story contemporary house -- glass walls, gleaming hardwood floors, open kitchen, wraparound porch -- for his fiancee (Dana Delany) and wraps it all up in a big red ribbon, but she turns him down. Meanwhile, a waitress-drifter (Goldie Hawn), who had a one-night stand with Newt, takes a bus to his hometown, moves into the house and tells everyone in town that she is Newt's new wife. When Newt visits the house, he is a little surprised to find it furnished.

GIANT (1956)
Texas is a new world for Leslie Benedict (Elizabeth Taylor), who has just married Bick (Rock Hudson) and his 595,000-acre cattle ranch. The family house is a Gothic monstrosity (above) set in the middle of nowhere, with leather furniture and dark paneled walls. After the death of Bick's bossy sister, Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), Leslie paints everything white and, at Christmas, takes advantage of the high ceilings with a Rockefeller Center-worthy tree. When the oil money starts flowing in, the Benedicts add a pool -- in the front yard.

MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (1948)
Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), a Manhattan adman, decides to move to the country. He and his wife, Muriel (Myrna Loy), buy "the old Hackett place" in Connecticut, but it's in such bad shape they tear it down. Vowing not to spend more than $10,000 for a new colonial with lots of bathrooms, they forge ahead, running into trouble with well digging and lintels, lock themselves in a closet and are forced to move in before the windows are installed. They end up with an $18,000 mortgage, yet are as happy as clams. As Mr. Blanding says of home ownership, "You buy it with your heart, not your head."

HOWARDS END (1992)
Sometimes a house and an owner are meant for each other. Ruth Wilcox (Vanessa Redgrave), on her deathbed, leaves her flower-and-vine-covered cottage outside London to a new friend, Margaret Schlegel (Emma Thompson), who is losing her city lease. Margaret has only heard about Ruth's cherished Howards End ("It sounds like a glorious place, so redolent"), but has not seen it. The Wilcoxes tear up the handwritten bequest, but when Henry Wilcox (Anthony Hopkins) and Margaret marry, they "store" Margaret's furniture there. There's some unpleasantness with a bookcase -- and a sword above the mantel -- but eventually justice is done.

PSYCHO (1960)
Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), skipping town with an embezzled $40,000 in cash, never gets to visit the Second Empire mansard on the hill beside the Bates Motel. It's a gloomy thing with winding stone steps leading up to it, inhabited by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), but it has its charms. Just up the stairs is a cavernous master bedroom with an ornate fireplace and original Victorian lighting fixtures. "The kitchen's awful homey," too, says Norman. Oh, and there's a fruit cellar, handy for hiding corpses.

THE MONEY PIT (1986)
A con artist sells what looks like a $1 million house to Max Fielding (Tom Hanks) and Anna Crowley (Shelley Long) for $200,000. But the place turns out to be less than a bargain as the front door falls in, the doorbell explodes, the staircase collapses and a raccoon is found in the dumbwaiter. "It's a lemon, honey, let's face it," says Max understatedly. The renovation, a two-week job, takes half a lifetime and almost destroys the couple's relationship.

HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK (1998)
Stella Payne (Angela Bassett) has it good. She's a successful San Francisco stockbroker with an adorable son (Michael J. Pagan) and a house to die for. It's like a freestanding glass loft with lush plants inside and out, a greenhouse (naturally) and a pool. She has to travel to Jamaica to find her true love (Taye Diggs), but she isn't sure she loves him until she brings him home and he fixes up her workshop. Seems her real dream is to make furniture for a living.

HEADLINE: BUYING; 
A Nimble Agent Wants to Know, What Recession?

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
THE middle-aged teacher is all business as she walks into the sales office of the Clifton, an upscale condominium complex being built near Emory University, in the leafy northeast section of the city.
 J. Dunn, the project's on-site sales agent, hopes to begin his pitch by guiding her to a scale model and describing the building's amenities. She is having none of it, and waves him off as dismissively as if hanging up on a telemarketer. Her body language makes it clear that she intends to be the alpha dog in this encounter. 
 "Here's what I want," she asserts. "I want quiet." 
"Well, we're all concrete and steel," Mr. Dunn responds.
"I've heard about parents buying them for their kids at Emory," she says, raising one eyebrow.
"There will be some," he counters, "but it's not going to be like a college dorm."
As she glides back toward the model, Mr. Dunn spots his opportunity. "The one I bought is right here," he says, pointing to a one-bedroom on the first floor.
This intravenous injection of credibility has the intended effect, and you can feel the dynamic shifting. Now Mr. Dunn is setting the agenda, and his client is listening intently as he boasts of the 10-foot ceilings, the spacious storage units, the second fireplace in the master, the shoulder-high wainscoting in the foyer. When she arrived, all brusqueness and attitude, it seemed she might leave before removing her coat. Instead, she has stayed an hour and a half.
Mr. Dunn and the teacher have just exchanged the lead in a dance routine familiar to almost everyone who has chased the American dream of homeownership. It's really a three-way tango, involving the buyer, the seller and the real estate agent, who makes his living bringing the other two in step. A good agent can make it look easy, but with the mixture of money, taste and emotion involved, it rarely is.
"You have to be adaptable," Mr. Dunn explained later, discussing the craft of real estate sales. Describing his exchange with the teacher, he said: "In a situation like that, you have to let them feel they're in control, but then bring them around to where you want them to be. When she left, I was in control."
Don't tell John Baxter Dunn 3rd about the recession. He is doing just fine. While real estate sales have cooled a tad in Atlanta, business remains heated in the in-town market where Mr. Dunn, 44, has made a mark after only three years. Two years ago, he gained notice by selling $12 million worth of property in his rookie year, garnering a variety of awards. This year, with contracts expected to close on dozens of homes at the Clifton, he expects to tally more than $20 million in sales.
"I'm having a very good year," he said, driving his spotless black Saab to meet a client. "People are buying. It's still a great city and lots of people are moving in. There is a lot of demand for product." 
Mr. Dunn's superiors consider him a natural salesman. He is knowledgeable about his market, well trained, hard-working and, above all, highly empathetic. "He's just beautiful to watch," said Victor R. Miller, the managing broker of the Condo Store, a local realty company owned by Coldwell Banker.
A North Carolina native, Mr. Dunn majored in psychology at Chapel Hill, dropped out of seminary at Wake Forest University, moved to Atlanta 19 years ago and sold office trailers to construction companies. His next gig was with Tiffany & Company in corporate sales. A friend persuaded him to give real estate a try, and the prospect of helping people fulfill their dreams appealed to him.
"You work all your life to buy a home," he said, "and I thought working with someone to find their perfect house would be the best thing you could do."
Mr. Dunn works five to six days a week at the Clifton, where units cost $275,000 to $850,000. Though he is affiliated with the Condo Store, he is an independent contractor who works purely for commission, sometimes splitting a 6 or 7 percent cut with another agent.
During his off hours, he takes clients, many of them personal friends, on daylong odysseys to look at available resale property, mostly condominiums in Midtown and Buckhead. Appearances matter on such days, like a recent Sunday when he dragged John Ballard to 10 condominiums. Selling million-dollar condominiums demands a million-dollar image. He is outfitted with a cellphone and pager that both chimes and vibrates, seemingly all the time. The fancy car attests to his success, and his stylish black turtleneck highlights salt-and-pepper hair and gleaming white teeth. Not for nothing was he voted best-dressed in high school.
"A lot is about perception," he said. "You have to be confident and you can't be fearful. If you're nervous, or if you have doubt and uncertainty about your product or what the economy is going to be like, then your client is going to pick up on it.
"They've already got all these emotions at their fingertips -- fear, excitement, apprehension -- and if you've got an agent who can be the objective voice they need and who can talk them through the pluses and minuses, it can be very important."
It was Mr. Dunn's first search for a house for Mr. Ballard, and he had spent three hours combing computerized listings for options. Mr. Ballard had said he wanted to spend no more than $240,000 on a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium, but Mr. Dunn was eager to get a feel for Mr. Ballard's tastes and the true depth of his pockets.
He thinks it is counterproductive to show clients property that is more expensive than they say they want to consider. But he also knows that many will move to a higher level after he educates them about the realities of the market and the possibilities of financing.
He has learned to ask questions with finesse, and to peer deep within his client's comments about a given home. "Being a real estate agent sometimes is a lot like being a detective," he said, "and what's on the surface is not always what's really happening. Someone may say, 'This isn't the right location,' or that they don't like the view, and it may really be the price, which is a pride issue. So you have to gently find out if it's really that they don't like that east view, or is it just too expensive." 
Part of Mr. Dunn's challenge in the current economy is persuading his customers that real estate remains a wise investment. Sept. 11, he said, only made buyers more cautious. He stuffs information packets for his clients with articles about the underlying health of the Atlanta economy and low interest rates.
The return to in-town living has been a remarkable development here in the last five years. In the 80's, when the region's growth accelerated, all the action was far from downtown. Both newcomers and longtime residents fled the crime, taxes and schools in the city and moved to beckoning suburban counties like Cobb and Gwinnett.
Developers clear-cut the land to put up cookie-cutter subdivisions. Roads were widened, then widened again, and strip malls became ubiquitous. The results were predictable. Traffic became, and remains, unbearable, and the metropolitan area earned a reputation as a poster child for charmless sprawl.
"People are getting up at 4 in the morning to get to work at 6 to beat the traffic," Mr. Dunn said. "If you're spending an hour and a half a day on Georgia 400, eventually that will wear you out."
Now the flow has reversed. Beginning with the 1996 summer Olympic Games, when several daring developers built in-town complexes and converted downtown buildings into lofts, the urban market has been sizzling. Virtually any available property within the Interstate 285 beltway has become a target for development.
Condominiums are rising in parts of downtown and Midtown that few Atlantans would have visited a decade ago. Old buildings are being converted into lofts, a new concept here, and new buildings are being designed to look like old loft conversions. Prices are astronomical for the market. At Cotting Court, a new building in Midtown, a one-bedroom, one-bathroom condominium with 900 square feet goes for $225,000, a price that would have bought a four-bedroom suburban ranch on a half-acre lot five years ago.
David J. Tufts, the founder of the Condo Store, said that there were now close to 50,000 condominium units within Interstate 285, up from 30,000 in 1993. The buyers include young singles, empty nesters, gays, transplanted Yankees and occasionally families. And while average listing times have lengthened during the recession from one month to two or three, Mr. Dunn and others who know the in-town market think that the long-term supply is still well below demand. "I don't think we've even begun," Mr. Dunn said. 
Much of Mr. Dunn's work is done out of sight. He sends Christmas cards and market updates to the 4,000 names he has compiled in a database. He holds parties to promote the Clifton. He follows up with phone calls and letters.
And he never stops looking for new customers. One day, for example, he meets Amy Berk at a condominium he has listed for sale. She is not interested, but in the course of the tour Mr. Dunn quizzes her about what she is looking for and tells her he knows of a number of condominiums she should see. They make a date to get started, and Mr. Dunn now has a new client.
"There's a lot within your price range," he assures her. "There's a home out there for you."

HEADLINE: ENTERTAINING; 
New Mantra for Revelers: Eat, Drink and Be Comfy

BYLINE:  By KIMBERLY STEVENS 

 BODY:
VICTORIAN velvet couches and cozy armchairs were arranged in clusters around coffee tables. Colorful floor pillows were strewn about. Bunches of red tulips bowed gracefully from simple vases, adding a rosy glow, and the carpet had just been meticulously vacuumed, one last time.
 Sounds like a nice get-together in your neighbor's living room, right? Not so. 
 On one particular night, about 500 guests lazed around on the floor pillows, chatted on love seats and perched on the arms of various couches and chairs until the wee hours. The party, to celebrate the first issue of Harper's Bazaar's new editor in chief, Glenda Bailey, was held at the Eyebeam Atelier, a 10,000-square-foot cement-and-brick party space on West 21st Street in Manhattan. 
Eyebeam is the kind of place that would have had a bare and spare decor last year and be booked by people or companies aching to make their event the latest word in hip. But lately, caterers, party planners and photographers say, hitting the town has become more like heading home for the evening.
Maybe the new "home" look is an effort to be socially appropriate after 9/11, or maybe it is an attempt to make guests feel more secure at a time when the economy is uncertain. But the days of over-the-top, statement-making parties are waning, trend-watchers say. The "statement" seems to have been literally domesticated -- visions of glamour have come back to earth and landed in the living room.
That is exactly what the Harper's magazine party designers had in mind. "We set out to create a giant living room where people would feel comfortable and at ease," said David Stark, a co-owner of Avi Adler Design, an event planner in Brooklyn. 
To transform the Eyebeam into a couch potato's dream, the planners rented more than 40 sofas and chairs and laid down carpeting, which ran throughout the space and even up some walls. 
The out-but-at-home approach is actually the second trend to emerge from the lavishness of the Nasdaq bubble era. As stock prices fell last year, many party planners tried to reflect a chastened mood with a minimalist style. Large bare spaces, often sparsely decorated, were the thing.
But spare is not cozy, and that earlier trend, according to Mr. Stark, is over. "People want spaces that they feel comfortable and secure in," he said. Rocking chairs and electric fireplaces are hot decorative features. So is the color red, which adds an element of warmth.
Party behavior has changed as well. "The formal dress-up thing isn't really happening right now," said Patrick McMullen, a photographer who chronicles parties for New York and Vanity Fair magazines. "There is a sense that people are just running out for a few moments, so parties have become an extension of home, and they are behaving in a more casual way."
And suddenly, children have burst onto the social scene. "You would never see children and babies at evening cocktail parties and launches," said Joan Steinberg, the president of Match Catering, which catered the Baker TriBeCa store opening last month. "They were actually checking strollers," she said.
Weddings, too, are becoming cozier. Couples are changing the site of their wedding -- and the focus -- to incorporate homier mannerisms. Nicky Reinhard and Ann David, who own David Reinhard Events in Manhattan, say that couples are having smaller celebrations so they can have their weddings at home. 
Traditionally, the backyard wedding occurred only in the backyard. "We've always done home weddings, but people used to rent portalets and lock the front door and back door," Ms. David said. Now couples want to open their doors, as well as use family china and linens, she said. Even people who are getting married in rented spaces are bringing furniture and items from their homes to decorate the rooms, Ms. David added. 
"People are searching for meaning in their lives, and home is often the first thing they think of," Ms. Reinhard said.
Food is getting more homey, too. "There's a real emphasis on comfort food, or comfort food with a twist," said Peter Callahan, the owner of Callahan Catering in Manhattan. Forget caviar and foie gras. Menus now tend toward macaroni and cheese canapes, spaghetti and meatball canapes and demitasse cups filled with tomato soup. "People are requesting that I incorporate family recipes into my menus," Mr. Callahan said. "They want a sense of home and nostalgia." 
Cost does not appear to be a factor in the home look. David Beahm, an event designer in Manhattan, said that people were spending as much money on their parties as in the past, yet the effect was a less flashy decor. As with the Florida wedding, family antiques and heirlooms -- which can act like anchors in a storm, Mr. Beahm said -- are being incorporated into events. "Many of my clients are finding new meaning in elements from their past," he said. "For the first time, people are asking how the decor at a party or an event will make their guests feel. Novel idea, right?"

HEADLINE: HOME-FRONT NOTES; 
More Homeowners, More Luxury, More Moving

BYLINE:  By SARA IVRY 

 BODY:
AS the economy struggled, there was speculation about the health of the housing market. Would it follow the technology sector in a downward spiral? The answer, said David Lereah, the chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, is no.
 Home sales have not plummeted, even as the jobless rate rose to 5.8 percent at the beginning of January. According to the association, sales of existing single-family homes fell nationwide from August to September, but the downturn was temporary. By October, nationwide sales were back up and continued to rise (or stayed the same) in November, except in the Northeast. In December, sales dipped nationwide again, though they were 5.1 percent higher than they were for December 2000. 
 Overall sales for 2001 exceeded sales in 2000 by 2.7 percent, the realtors association said. Sales of new homes in 2001 were up 2.6 percent from the year before. 
Housing starts, which track new construction, have demonstrated a similar pattern.
Though there were 67,000 fewer starts of privately owned units in October than in September, by November the number of starts exceeded those in October by 107,000. By December, the number slipped again by 55,000, though the decrease might be attributable more to seasonal factors than to the recession or the war in Afghanistan.

BUYING THE DREAM: Homeownership has recently been made easier by a fall in mortgage rates, to 40-year lows in October and November. Mortgage rates, however, began crawling back up in December and January.
Significant savings are possible with even slight changes in rates. According to Victor Angel of Universal Mortgage in Manhattan, in early November Jane Doe could have locked in a 6.375 percent mortgage rate. If Ms. Doe bought a $250,000 apartment with the typical 20 percent down payment on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage, her monthly payment would have been $1,247.74. By mid-January, the rate rose to approximately 7 percent, raising Ms. Doe's payment to $1,330.60. 
Though the $82.86 monthly difference might seem negligible, the 30-year savings of $29,829 hardly does. Ms. Doe's ultimate monthly expenditure could be mitigated if she buys points at closing; these reduce mortgage rates by a quarter of a percent per point.
In addition to points, other expenses accrue. In the New York metropolitan region, closing costs on a co-op (which rarely exceed $1,800) include fees for an appraisal, mortgage application, bank lawyers and underwriting, among other things.
People buying houses or condominiums can also expect to pay for title insurance and a mortgage tax, which in New York City is just under 1.75 percent of the loan amount.

CLOSING THE GAP: While American homeownership is at its height, breaking it down by race shows a persistent disparity. About 73 percent of whites own homes; for African-Americans, the figure is 47 percent; for Hispanics, 46 percent; and for Asian-Americans, 53 percent. Lenders, interest groups and government agencies are trying to close this gap between white and minority groups.
"It's the right thing to do," said Naomi Bayer, the director of the New York regional office of Fannie Mae. "Also from a business point of view, that's where the potential growth in the market is."
Two years ago, the Bank of America and the N.A.A.C.P. introduced a $6 million program for minority-homeownership education and counseling. More recently, Fannie Mae, which is working with the Urban League and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, committed $2 trillion in mortgage financing for low- and moderate-income families, with the focus on minority buyers.
There are several online initiatives to assist such buying, like homeowners.com, which, with the Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, offers loan information in Spanish, Korean and Chinese. In addition, there is increasing flexibility in negotiating buying terms. Ten years ago, a 20 percent down payment for a house was standard; now, 3 percent is acceptable. In some cases, Ms. Bayer said, if an applicant has good credit, he can purchase with no money down.

PAYING THE RENT: Renters account for about a third of American households, with the bulk living in and around urban areas. According to the National Multi Housing Council, more than half the people who rent are under 45, and more than 40 percent live alone. New York City has the largest percentage of renters, followed by Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston.
Not surprisingly, New York City has the largest stock of rental apartment buildings that have at least five units. California, which had the country's largest population surge in the 1990's, claims the greatest number of actual rental residents.

WHERE THE DEALS ARE: You may never have considered moving to Rockford, Ill., but before you rule it out, consider this: housing there is the most affordable in the United States, according to the Housing Opportunity Index, tallied by the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. The index ranks communities by calculating the number of homes on the market that a median-income family could afford to buy in a given region. The following data is for the third quarter of 2001.
Top 10 metropolitan areas with the most affordable housing, starting with the least expensive:
* Rockford, Ill.
* Davenport (Iowa)-Moline-Rock Island, Ill.
* Kokomo, Ind.
* Springfield, Ill.
* Syracuse, N.Y.
* Binghamton, N.Y.
* Elkhart-Goshen, Ind.
* Wilmington, Del.-Newark, Md.
* Dayton-Springfield, Ohio
* Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton, N.J.

ON THE ROAD: Atlanta has long been known as a high-growth city for a number of reasons, including its year-round warm weather, its physical potential for growth (no coastline hems it in) and the presence of corporate headquarters like Coca-Cola, United Parcel Service and other major companies. In 2000, it was the top destination city for people who were relocating, according to data from U-Haul, the self-moving company. U-Haul rents 1.7 million trucks and vans annually and estimates that the average American moves 11 times in a lifetime.
Other most popular cities in U-Haul's ranking were Dallas, New York and Las Vegas. Such calculations are not scientific, however, and data provided by the American Moving and Storage Association differs slightly; by the association's tally, the top cities, by preference, were Washington, Atlanta and Phoenix.

INFORMALITY INSIDE: The "DR/LR" of real estate advertising may soon disappear as construction and remodeling trends move away from formal dining and living rooms. Gopal Ahluwalia, the director of research at the National Association of Home Builders, predicts that within the next 10 years, 70 percent of new homes will lack a formal living room. Instead, he said, people will want large open spaces that allow kitchens with central work islands to run into family rooms.
Brokers see a similar pattern. People want to spend more time at home, said Van Davis, the president of the Cendant Corporation, whose subsidiaries include Century 21, ERA and Coldwell Banker realty companies. "We've become a much more relaxed society, particularly in our entertaining," he said.
As formality ebbs, luxury flows. Though the average family size is shrinking, square footage is growing. Average ceiling heights in new homes are rising from 8 to 9 feet, the latter once considered standard only in affluent homes. Homeowners are installing "his" and "her" sinks, even in relatively modest residences.
Despite recessionary times, Mr. Ahluwalia said, many buyers still have money and want to show it off.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
The Last Dynasty, Trying to Fit In Through a Burst of Creativity

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
The Qing dynasty was China's last dynasty. It came at the end of a very long history and had a longish history of its own. This began with a bang in 1644, when the Ming dynasty collapsed and its emperor hanged himself, and ended with an inglorious whimper in 1911, when China became a republic.
 Originally, the Qing were a non-Chinese Manchu population living beyond the Great Wall. For years they kept a hungry eye on China, maintaining contact through trading and border wars. Gradually they adopted Chinese ways, and even set themselves up from afar as a rival dynasty, which they named Qing -- pronounced ching -- meaning "pure." 
 Their waiting was not in vain. By the early 17th century, China was a mess. Political factionalism was rampant, economics were shaky, popular rebellions were frequent. When a rebel army entered Beijing in 1644, the city's defending forces asked the Manchus for help. They promptly showed up and claimed China for themselves, and spent two and a half centuries trying to prove how Chinese they were. 
One time-honored way of accomplishing that was by promoting classical art, and that's what they did, in a big way. They lured prestigious artists to the court, made the position of imperial art adviser a high bureaucratic post and wrote lavish commissions into the state budget. Some of the fruits of their efforts can be seen in "When the Manchus Ruled China: Painting Under the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)," an ethralling sleeper of a show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Technically, the exhibition of 60 or so works is a reinstallation of the Met's Chinese galleries, drawn mostly from its permanent collection. But it is also the most comprehensive sampling of Qing painting yet assembled in the West, which goes to show not only how deep the Met's holdings are, but also how much we have to learn about Chinese art.
For the Manchus, who had no painting tradition of their own when they took control in China, getting to know the medium was a matter of learning on the job. At first they went for the boldest, most exotically "Chinese" things they saw, religious paintings with splashy colors and dramatic figures. Such a piece comes right at the beginning of the Met show: a hanging scroll depicting the third-century emperor Guan, whose martial valor had earned him immortality as a Daoist saint.
He is shown dressed head to toe in armor; the Manchus must have liked that. And as to the work's aesthetic stature? Well, in style it is a little old-fashioned, but with its superb workmanship, pristine surfaces and ornamental gilding, it is technically the best of its type that money can buy. And in fact, the Met bought it just last year.
Qing taste matured fast. Like every dynasty before, the Qing understood art's political power. Whoever controlled Chinese high culture had a claim on imperial legitimacy. It was through art that the past survived, and the past was China's soul. Other cultures treasure the past; for China it had the all-consuming pull of a narcotic.
Under the Qing, three types of painting flourished more or less side by side, and the Met show, organized by Maxwell K. Hearn, a curator in the department of Asian art, devotes a section to each. The first type, called the traditionalist or orthodox, was actually a late-Ming hybrid of amateur literati painting and the academic, revivalist school masterminded by Dong Qichang.
Orthodox work can be starchy and fastidious. But when it's good it's very good, and in work produced by the quartet of artists who shared the surname Wang, the Met has some of the best to be found.
Two of them painted with exceptional flair. The youngest, Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715), is represented here by his finest piece, the handscroll titled "Wangchuan Villa." Its ostensible subject is the legendary country home of the Tang artist and poet Wang Wei, but what it's really about is the surrounding landscape, which ropes across the length of scroll like a living thing, all sinew and muscle, flexing and relaxing. Beside this unnervingly vitalistic vision of nature, most Western landscape painting just sits there looking pretty.
For sheer dazzle, though, no one quite matches the slightly older Wang Hui. An artist of prodigious versatility, his work leaps from an album of pitch perfect riffs on canonical styles to a pair of enormous handscrolls recording, in photo-documentary detail, a state visit to southern China by the Qing emperor. By the time this work was painted, the once-independent orthodox artists had become court employees, bringing wealth to themselves and luster to the dynasty they served.
Not all painters were for hire. Some assiduously avoided contact with their Manchu overlords. Artists were left in an ethical quandary when a dynasty fell. Their duty was to remain true to the fallen regime, come what may. Some forged new alliances; others exiled themselves to the countryside or monasteries. Such was the case with several of the 17th-century "individualist" artists in the second part of the show.
They are a wild bunch: the minute you see them you know you are in a different world. Where orthodox painting is an art of controlled space and micro-managed gesture, the work of the individualists tends to be spare and airy, like that of their formal model, Ni Zan (1306-74), an earlier political refusenik who used barely-there images of nature and astringent brushwork to express a profound retrospective longing.
Work by these artists fills two galleries, and the variety alone is breathtaking, from the dense, ashen album paintings of Gong Xian, as moodily agitated as anything by Rodolphe Bresdin, to Fan Qi's softly tinted, European-influenced landscapes with water-reflected sunsets. The outstanding contributions, though, come from the artists known as Bada Shanren (1626-1705) and Shitao (1642-1707), who are among the greatest figures in Chinese art.
They were cousins and descendants of the Ming imperial family. Both ended up in Buddhist monasteries after the dynasty's fall. Bada seems to have suffered from psychological disorders. He was prone to fits of sobbing and laughter. He went through periods of being unable or unwilling to speak. How much of his distress was caused by anguish under Manchu rule is impossible to say, but there's no question that an abiding sense of grievance and sorrow propels his art.
Stylistically, the painting couldn't be lighter, subtler, more buoyant, even whimsical. Yet each image in the album titled "Flowers, Birds, Bamboo, and Rock" -- a chick perched on a stone, a rotting pomegranate, a single broken branch stretching across a page -- is a terse, gestural emblem of vulnerability, waste and decay.
Shitao was more together as a personality, and that comes through in his art. A handscroll painting of the 16 lohans, or Buddhist holy men, thought to be his earliest work, is a high-spirited Tolkienesque invention, with dragons emerging from bottles and mountains opening onto spiritual worlds. Album paintings of idyllic landscapes and birdwatching scholars from the end of his career are equally spirited, and probably no less fanciful in content.
By the time Shitao died, the kind of energy that sings through his work had begun to fade from art. In the 18th century, painting went commercial. Bourgeois merchants were clamoring for it and willing to pay top dollar. Artists sold scrolls like cloth, by the yard. Even the best court work, despite its technical polish, seems to have the juice squeezed out of it.
In this context, it's a relief to encounter a large-scale drawing by Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), the Jesuit missionary who was a fixture of the Qing court and painted in a fair imitation of a Chinese style. The Met's drawing is the only known preparatory study by him, and its occasional awkwardness has a fallible personal touch that is missing from the immaculate, spirit-starved late-Qing work around it.
Chinese painting by no means ends there. The necessary spirit would return many times and in mold-breaking forms in the future, as a glance at 20th-century art reveals. The seeds for this rechanneled vitality are already present in the Qing; so is evidence of a culture drugged on visions of the past and unable to shake the habit. If art can be seen as an epic volume of moral tales, Qing painting is a chapter we have only beginning to read.

"When the Manchus Ruled China: Painting Under the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)" is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Aug. 18.

HEADLINE: Argentines Are Missed At Resorts 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay, Feb. 10 

 BODY:
At the height of the Southern Hemisphere summer, the Carnival holidays just before Lent are peak periods for the coastal resorts of Uruguay and southern Brazil. Any other year at this time, the Moby Dick, a bar across from the yacht club in this seaside town, would be packed with middle-class Argentines spending their American dollars. 
 Not this year. Half a dozen idle waitresses chat quietly behind the bar; one couple quietly enjoy a warm Sunday evening at a table on the wide terrace. Otherwise the place is deserted. 
 The financial crisis in Argentina has devastated tourism in this region. Argentine visitors to Uruguay are down by two-thirds so far this year, industry experts say, and are down by 90 percent in Brazil. 
Argentines had been cutting back a bit on travel anyway after more than three years of recession, but this season's charter packages to Brazil and Uruguay still sold out last November, according to Juan Carlos Chervatin, owner of the Consult House travel agency in Buenos Aires and the president of the Argentine Association of Tour and Travel Agents.
Then came December, when the Argentine government, fighting a desperate and ultimately losing battle to avoid defaulting on its debts and devaluing the peso, imposed draconian limits on banking transactions. The cancellations began pouring in.
"The banks' withdrawal restrictions hurt us, since our mostly middle-class clientele could only withdraw enough money to pay their basic expenses," Mr. Chervatin said. "But it was the devaluation in January that really did us in."
Airline tickets, priced in dollars, doubled in peso terms in a matter of days, making the impact especially severe for Brazilian resorts, since most Argentines who go there fly; Uruguay's beaches are close enough to Buenos Aires to readily make the trip by car and ferry.
In the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, where many popular resorts are, only 112 Argentine charter flights out of the expected 810 had touched down so far this year, according to Flavio Jose de Almeida, president of Santur, the state tourism board. Last year, 86 percent of the state's 569,000 foreign tourists came from Argentina, according to Santur figures; most traveled to Florianopolis, the capital. 
"In Florianopolis, there are many hotels that have catered specifically to Argentine tourists for years," Mr. Almeida said. "When those reservations were canceled, many establishments were left without any guests at all. It's a total disaster."
And the few Argentines who do turn up have a different mind-set now. "Before, when the Argentines came, they wouldn't even look at the price before buying, it was so cheap for them," said Marcelo Franzoni Bousfield, whose family owns a grocery store in Ingleses, a beachfront district of Florianopolis. "Now they complain about the price of everything." 
Tourism boards in both Uruguay and Brazil have tried to replace the missing Argentines by persuading locals, whose own currencies have been weak lately, to vacation at home instead.
Tourist traffic in Uruguay and southern Brazil is unlikely to snap back next summer even if the Argentine economy begins to recover before then, travel agents say. 
"Our most optimistic projection is that we could sell 50 percent of what we sold in 2001, before the crisis," Mr. Chervatin said.

HEADLINE: Uncertain Times Send Hotel Business Reeling 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
There were definitely rooms at the inn last month.
 The once booming industry suffered through its worst January in seven years. Four out of every 10 hotel rooms in Manhattan sat empty, and operators offered discounts to fill the others. 
 The average occupancy rate slipped to 60.5 percent, down from 65 percent in January 2001, according to a survey of 75 hotels in Manhattan by PKF Consulting. In a double whammy for the industry, room rates fell 12 percent from a year earlier to an average of $168.85. 
"It's partly an issue of perception, coming off an unbelievable year in 2000," said John Fox, senior vice president of PKF. "That said, a lot of hotels are struggling this first quarter."
Hotel owners and analysts said that some of the hardest hit hotels were not the high-priced places like the St. Regis or the Four Seasons, but the larger, low-cost operations that cater to tourists and airline crews: the Pennsylvania, the Edison and the Milford Plaza.
And in the city that gave birth to boutique hotels in the 1980's, the Paramount and other highly stylized hotels are hustling for customers. The newly opened Bryant Park Hotel on West 41st Street is getting rave reviews for its Ilo restaurant, but the rooms are selling for closer to $250 a night than the $650 the owner had projected.
There were some brights spots.
In the vast Art Deco lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria on a recent Friday night, executives and tourists trying to make their way to their rooms had to elbow their way past thick knots of tuxedo-clad patrons on their way to the banquet hall.
A couple of blocks away at the New York Palace, guests were paying more than $400 for a rare room in the black glass tower on Madison Avenue, banishing, at least for the moment, some of the hotel industry talk of bad times. 
"It was manna from heaven," said Michael Silberstein, managing director of the Palace. "To have a full house at top rates is unprecedented in New York. For an 896-room hotel, that is very nice."
But the manna is not falling onto every hotel operator's table. The Palace, the Waldorf-Astoria and other East Side hotels benefited from the World Economic Forum, which met at the Waldorf at the end of January, and the International Toy Fair. Most other hotels were still offering discounts to lure patrons. 
Hotel owners are clinging to the memory of a record-setting 2000, when the occupancy rate hit 84.1 percent and the average room rate soared to $233.39. But the market had already begun to soften last September, when the attack on the World Trade Center sent the industry into a tailspin. By October, more than two-thirds of the city's hotel rooms were vacant, as tourists avoided travel by air and a recession cut corporate and vacation budgets.
Although January was weak, it was better than what most analysts had predicted, and there is some cautious optimism about the future.
"I expect that occupancy will be on a steady upward climb," Mr. Fox said. "The fourth quarter of this year will look very good compared with the fourth quarter last year."
Hotel owners complained that they still could not charge the hefty prices that made New York hotels the most expensive in the nation. "It's going to take a few years to get back the rates we had before 9/11," said Ian Schrager, who owns the Hudson, Morgan, Paramount and Royalton Hotels.
Mr. Silberstein of the Palace said that the economic conference, which attracted visitors from all over the world, brought some welcome relief. Demand was so strong at the end of January, he said, that he was getting an average of $450 a night for a room. The Waldorf-Astoria, which employs 1,000 union workers, put on extra staff to handle the booming business.
"It gave us and the city tremendous exposure with all the top executives and politicians," Mr. Silberstein said. "It sent a message that New York is safe."
Still, the boom is over. As of last week, 3,480 hotel workers had not been called back to work, according to Hotel Trades Council. That accounts for 20 percent of the union membership, although the situation is better than it was in October, when 6,000 were out of work. 
For the most part, international travelers, who spend six times as much as domestic travelers on hotels, restaurants and cultural attractions, have yet to return to New York City, said Jonathan M. Tisch, chief executive of Loews Hotels. Many people even in the United States, he said, are still under the mistaken impression that the trade center attack damaged much of the city.
As a result, room rates are down 10 percent to 15 percent, pretty much across the board, Mr. Tisch said.

HEADLINE: Ersatz Climate Policy 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Alert shoppers know that an extra word in a product's description can make a big difference, and rarely for the better. Apologies to connoisseurs of Velveeta, but most of us don't regard "cheese food" as a good substitute for plain ordinary cheese.
 To the unwary, yesterday's pledge by the Bush administration to reduce "greenhouse gas intensity" by 18 percent may have sounded like a pledge to reduce greenhouse gases, the emissions (mainly carbon dioxide, released by burning fossil fuels) that cause global warming. In fact, that's the way it was reported in some news articles. But the extra word makes all the difference. In fact, the administration proposed to achieve almost nothing; consistent with that goal, it also announced specific policies that are trivial in scope and will have virtually no effect. 
 What is this thing called greenhouse gas intensity? It is the volume of greenhouse gas emissions divided by gross domestic product. The administration says that it will reduce this ratio by 18 percent over the next decade. But since most forecasts call for G.D.P. to expand 30 percent or more over the same period, this is actually a proposal to allow a substantial increase in emissions. 
Still, doesn't holding the growth of emissions to less than the growth of the economy show at least some effort to face up to climate change? No, because that would happen anyway. In fact, the administration's target for reduction in greenhouse gas intensity might well be achieved without any policy actions -- which is good news, because the administration hasn't really proposed any.
The reasons greenhouse gas intensity tends to fall over time are complex, but the basic logic is simple: We are gradually becoming a post-industrial society, in which knowledge and service industries grow faster than the old smokestack sector. Because pushing bits around doesn't take as much energy as pushing around large pieces of sheet metal, a dollar of new-economy G.D.P. generally doesn't require burning as much carbon as a dollar of old-economy G.D.P. 
But the old economy is still there, and the new economy still uses significant amounts of energy -- especially if office workers drive S.U.V.'s long distances on their way from house to mouse and back. So as the economy grows, greenhouse gas intensity may fall, but greenhouse gas emissions -- which are what damages the planet -- continue to rise.
So what does the Bush administration propose to do? Nothing much. 
The main actual policy described yesterday was an array of tax credits for planet-friendly activities, such as installing solar power or capturing methane from landfill. It's not worth trying to analyze the specifics of this proposal, such as why tax credits should be the tool of choice. (Oh, I forgot -- tax cuts are the answer to all problems.) The key point is that it's just too small to do the job. It offers $4.6 billion over the next five years. That's less than a penny a day per American. Do you really think that's enough to produce a major change in the way we use energy, or that it is an appropriate level of response to a major threat to the planet?
And that's the substantive part of the proposal. The other part is creation of a "registry": companies can, if they choose, report their emissions of greenhouse gases. If they show reductions in emissions, they will receive -- well, nothing. But future administrations might be pleased. 
The real question is why an administration that clearly doesn't want to do anything about climate change feels obliged to put on this show. 
The answer, of course, is that on environmental issues the administration is clearly out of step with the public. Its indifference to the fate of the planet would be quite unpopular if it were generally appreciated. 
To deal with this potential political threat, the Bush administration exaggerates the economic costs of environmental regulations. Last spring Dick Cheney implied, disingenuously, that environmental rules had caused a shortage of refining capacity; now George W. Bush tells us, implausibly, that the Kyoto Protocol will destroy millions of jobs.
Meanwhile the administration offers the illusion of environmentalism, by announcing policies that sound impressive but are nearly content-free. 
So buyers beware. What the administration offered yesterday was processed climate-change policy food, bearing very little resemblance to the real thing.

HEADLINE: Initial Unemployment Claims Continued to Slide Last Week 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing initial applications for jobless benefits fell for the fifth week in the last six, the Labor Department said today, a sign that layoffs are slowing.
 First-time claims dropped 8,000 in the week ended Saturday, to 373,000 from a revised 381,000 the previous seven days, the Labor Department said. The six-week stretch of claims below 400,000 is the longest since before mid-April 2001, when the first recession in a decade was beginning. 
 "The news is very encouraging," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn. "If we can sustain these claims levels, we could even see a resumption of modest increases in payrolls in the next few months," she said.
Weekly jobless claims surged in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, averaging 456,000 in the last quarter of 2001. The four-week moving average of claims last week dropped to 376,000, the lowest since August. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department today showed that businesses might have reached the end of reducing their supplies of unsold goods, a process that contributed to the recession. 
Business inventories fell in December to the lowest level in two years, reflecting declines at department stores and other retailers, factories and wholesalers, the Commerce Department reported. The 0.4 percent decrease in December, to $1.14 trillion, was the 11th consecutive drop and came after a 1.2 percent drop in November. Stockpiles were down 6 percent in December from a year earlier.
"Inventories were pared very quickly in the fourth quarter, and that sets the economy up for some improvement in coming months as production picks up," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
The decline in business inventories was the smallest in four months, a sign businesses see little room for further reductions. That means future demand will be supplied by placing new orders with factories, helping them pull out of a slump that began in August 2000.

PERSON: Larry A. Silverstein 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Undaunted and Planning the Next Great Skyline

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY's familiar skyline -- the old one -- lives on in his incandescent gold cuff links. The Trump-size theme baubles come into their own as Larry A. Silverstein, the chatty septuagenarian who runs Silverstein Properties Inc., shrugs off his suit jacket and sinks, with a discreet groan, into a bottomless blue sofa in his Fifth Avenue office. 
 New York City's next skyline -- the one he means to have a heavy hand in shaping -- is alive on his agenda. Where others see a scar and a burial ground, he sees intimations of immortality: skyscrapers are forever. He hopes. Which is why he not only, at age 70, had the temerity to sign a 99-year lease on the World Trade Center, but is also now, just shy of 71, hyperventilating at the prospect of rebuilding his trophy from scratch, albeit in revised form. Using his blueprints as his footprint. 
 Give him 10 years, he says, and he'll give the world a greater New York.
Mr. Silverstein, an implacable developer who closed a fraught $3.2 billion deal for the twin towers last July only to see them obliterated six weeks later, can't help the hubris, or the hurry. 
"Those who remain are obligated to rebuild downtown, because only in that way will we ever properly recognize those who gave or lost their lives and only in that way will we deprive the terrorists of what they were trying to take away," he asserts. His plans endorse a "dignified" memorial, a cultural center, a museum, a retail mall, a quartet of shorter towers to replace the twins. Not that he can rebuild without approval from the city, the governor, and the Port Authority, or without the $7 billion he's suing his insurers for. But he is raring to go at 7 World Trade Center, which he built 14 years ago adjacent to the towers and which he intends to see operational again by 2005, with more buildings in 2006, 2007 and 2008. 
He set his cap for the twin towers the day he completed No. 7. "Here I was with this beautiful 47-story, two-million-square-foot building, but when I walked outside I realized it was totally eclipsed by the towers and thought, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to own that, too?' It was a compulsion with me."
When it came time to complete his consortium's bid for the trade center in January 2001, he was in the hospital with a crushed pelvis after having been hit by a drunken driver. "I said, 'Doc, cut my morphine, I've got to be able to think.' "
Now it is a "Field of Dreams" mission: if he rebuilds, he is convinced, the tenants will come. And if he doesn't? "The tenants will go to New Jersey, and who wants that?" he asks, with some hand-wringing for dramatic effect.
"Under the terms of our lease, for which we pay the Port Authority $120 million a year in ground rent, we are obligated to rebuild. And with six or seven billion in insurance company proceeds, we have the opportunity to do something spectacular there. Spectacular," he reiterates, his smile multiplying the wrinkles etched into his sun-damaged face. (A morning appointment with his dermatologist on Sept. 11 probably saved his life; otherwise he would have been hobnobbing with trade center tenants.) 
Serendipity spared him in several ways: "If those planes had hit an hour later, I would have lost half my company." Including his son, Roger, who had just arrived downtown when the first plane struck. 
Mr. Silverstein's discarded jacket disappears, tactfully removed by the same assistant who serves his iced tea and daily bakes 100 chocolate chip cookies, two for his noontime dessert, the rest as deal sweeteners for visiting real estate magnates.
"We sweeten 'em up," he says. Point taken. With a seemingly inexhaustible supply of billionaire partners (like the investor Lloyd Goldman), nimble lawyers (Jack Quinn was former President Bill Clinton's counselor), fresh-baked cookies and chutzpah, Mr. Silverstein usually gets what he wants, hence his 20 million square feet of Manhattan office space. And yacht. And six grandchildren. He refuses to believe he won't get to build a newer, better trade center.
As for the antirebuilding sentiments of survivors of Sept. 11 victims, he gets weepy about the four staffers he lost. "Candidly, I don't think there will ever be a way to satisfy everyone," he says. 
ABOUT those rivals who warn that his $7 billion reclamation project portends a glut of vacant office space, Mr. Silverstein raises his eyebrows and unleashes a scolding. "I think they're being disingenuous, thinking of themselves and not the city," he says. Rebuilding is "a no-brainer. The World Trade Center was responsible for $47 billion in gross wages in 2000, and unless we get it back, it's going to decimate the region financially." 
Mr. Silverstein, raised in Washington Heights, got into real estate because his father was in real estate: it was the logical thing to do, particularly for a young man whose asthma made physical exertion an impossibility. He was sickly; cortisone and Adrenalin shots were his lifeline. His father leased lofts to the garment trade, and so, until he came up with a syndication brainstorm at 25, did he. 
"I suggested to my father that the guys making all the money were the owners, not the brokers. And he said, 'But we have nothing.' I told him about syndicators like Lawrence Wein and Harry Helmsley. I said, 'Dad, if they can buy the Empire State Building like that, why can't we?' " With 22 investors in at $10,000 each, they bought a loft on East 23rd Street. Then they bought another.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: CHARITIES; 
9/11 Charities Set Cutoff Date For Applicants

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Having already doled out hundreds of millions of dollars to residents and businesses in Lower Manhattan, three of the charitable funds that have given the most to victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack will soon stop taking applications for emergency cash grants for anyone who has lost a job, a business or income because of the attack.
 Officials with the funds -- the American Red Cross's Liberty Fund, the Sept. 11 Fund and the Salvation Army -- said they thought it was time to move from providing disaster relief to financing longer-term services like job training and counseling. And they said they had already reached a sizable number of those affected, disbursing an estimated $250 million to more than 50,000 displaced workers and business owners to date. 
 The three funds will continue to grant money to the families of those killed in the attack. 
But the decision to limit the programs of cash grants to those who lost jobs or businesses has provoked both confusion and resentment. Thousands of workers and scores of businesses have yet to apply, and many remain unaware that they are even eligible for such aid, according to several officials who are involved in helping the downtown area recover economically. Moreover, they said word of the sudden imposition of a deadline had not reached many of those it would affect.
Charity officials, who at first said they were confident they had made a reasonable effort to inform people of the deadline, late yesterday announced they would extend the deadline for people to make appointments to discuss aid to March 8 from Feb. 22. Officials in charge of administering the cash grants said the number of people applying for new assistance had remained steady in recent weeks, with at least dozens of new applicants arriving daily. People who lost jobs as recently as Jan. 11 are eligible.
One Red Cross official said he considered it unlikely that exceptions would be made for people who applied after March 8.
"It seems arbitrary," said Kevin Curnin, co-founder of From the Ground Up, a coalition of downtown businesses, who had not heard of the deadline until informed by a reporter.
"They don't know how many people are going to apply for this. They don't know how soon the money is going to run out. So how do they fix a deadline? Clearly, it's not based on a close understanding of the people they're trying to help, not only because the people they're trying to help didn't know anything about it, but because closing the program at this point in the rebuilding process seems too early."
The grants awarded were used to pay bills, cover rent or jump-start a new business enterprise.
The decision to establish a deadline for the cash program for workers and businesses and the turmoil it has produced represent another example of how delicate it is to begin the process of drawing limits around Sept. 11 charity. In recent weeks and months, each of the three major funds, which together had raised roughly $1.3 billion in donations for aid of all kinds, announced they had halted taking new donations. In making the announcements, officials took care to make clear that they believed sufficient money had been raised to care for all victims of the disaster.
This time, the decision to draw limits does not appear to have been as deftly handled, given the chorus of complaints and last-minute maneuvering. Still, the charities said that the main theme remained unchanged: that they were doing their best in the most unusual circumstances to figure out how best to help the greatest number of people and still make prudent decisions about how the aid should be spent.
"You have to have a deadline for a number of reasons," said Robert J. Hurst, chief executive of the 9/11 United Services Group, which is coordinating the relief efforts among the three big charities, plus about 10 others. "These agencies are shifting to another stage, and are providing long-term assistance, counseling and a whole range of social services to those affected."
Mr. Hurst, though, conceded that officials with the funds, in first setting the Feb. 22 date, might have failed to fully appreciate the challenge of making sure potential recipients knew of the decision.
"I think it was just a feeling on the part of the agencies and ourselves that given some concern on the part of various victims that there wasn't enough time to make the appointments, that it wasn't a smart thing to do," he said in explaining yesterday's decision to push back the deadline.
By any tally, there is a lot of money available to help rebuild Lower Manhattan and assist its displaced workers. Two weeks ago, for instance, the Bush administration approved a $700 million grant for New York State to create jobs and revive businesses in Manhattan crippled by the terrorist attacks.
Still, some of the financing has major strings attached, usually in the form of time and commitment. There are many loans available through the federal Small Business Administration and other agencies, but some businesses are reluctant to put themselves into more debt.
These emergency cash grants, by contrast, have generally been acts of rapid and direct infusion, with checks being written out almost immediately to economic victims, or on behalf of victims to cover cable, telephone, rent and other bills. Such cash payments have been of particular value as unemployment checks have dried up.
The Sept. 11 Fund, chiefly through the nonprofit organization Safe Horizon, was the first to distribute these grants, about two weeks after the attacks. And while each charity has since established its own eligibility criteria, the basic requirements have included anyone who worked below Canal Street, lost a significant portion of income and has been unemployed any time between Sept. 11 and either Dec. 31 or Jan. 11.
To date, the Red Cross has distributed about $200 million to more than 30,000 displaced workers, Safe Horizon $30 million to 30,000 workers, and the Salvation Army roughly $20 million to 12,000 workers, according to officials. Many of those workers have received payments from more than one fund.
Last Friday, officials from the three funds, as well as the 9/11 United Services Group, announced the original Feb. 22 deadline for people to make appointments, both to encourage people to act quickly and to begin to set a limit on this type of aid. Those seeking information can call a hot line the charities have established at (866) 689-4357.
Still, few people -- from those waiting to make appointments yesterday morning in Lower Manhattan to Nancy Ploeger, executive director of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce -- were aware of any deadline. And some said there should be no deadline whatsoever, because need and awareness were still uncertain.
"I think a lot of people are confused, and they're getting cynical," said William Maier, a founder of the League of TriBeCa Businesses, which sprang up after Sept. 11. "On the other hand, it is like this constantly from one minute to the next: constant change."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Return of a Lure: A Month's Free Rent

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
With the sagging economy and the aftereffects of Sept. 11, developers of apartment buildings are incorporating a factor into their rents that all but disappeared from the real estate vocabulary in the mid-1990's: the concession.
 "One month's free rent" and "two months' free rent" are prominent inducements in advertising copy along with such magnets as chef's kitchens and fitness centers. 
 "It has become a rite of passage for most developers to offer from one to two months off on one- and two-year leases," said Brian G. Edwards, executive director of leasing for Halstead Feathered Nest, a large residential brokerage firm. "Concessions were nonexistent from 1995 to 1999. By the end of '99 we began to see a little weakness and a fair number of new buildings. In 2000 the marketplace began suffering the shakeouts of the dot-com collapse and a drop-off in new hires, and then we had 9/11." 
Though offers of free rent are especially obvious in advertisements for new buildings, where landlords have a clean slate of apartments to fill, they are also available in occupied buildings.
"As of today, it appears that we have 6,300 active rental listings in Manhattan in our database," Mr. Edwards said. "New York landlords who are accustomed to a 1 to 2 percent vacancy rate have now had to resign themselves to a 5 to 6 percent rate." Speaking of the 6,300 rentals, Mr. Edwards added, "Of those, about 2,000 to 2,300 are in new high-rises that entered the rental market in the last 12 months." 
According to Douglas Wagner, president of Benjamin James Associates, perception can be as meaningful as actual savings. 
"I have customers who ask how much free rent they can get even before they ask what the rent is," he said.
The concessions are more than acts of generosity. Landlords and developers stand to reap benefits, too.
"The majority of banks and lenders won't give permanent financing, called end loans, on new construction projects until the apartments are 100 percent leased," said Andrew S. Heiberger, president and chairman of Citi Habitats. "If they don't get it, then the construction loan or the intermediary loan known as a mezzanine loan continues in place with higher interest rates and possible penalties."
Some landlords deliberately set the prices high in order to raise the threshold on which future increases are computed. Then they offer concessions.
"There is a value to free rent," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest. "If I say I will give you two months' free rent, you will be willing to pay slightly higher rent. If the market turns up again, you will be qualified to pay higher rent when the renewal comes around again." 
To determine where the fine line between maximizing rent potential and pricing out of the market falls, developers and their advisers scrutinize the competition. 
"The first thing we do is to see what everything else in the marketplace is priced at, by doing a survey by phone and by foot," said Adrienne Albert, president of the Marketing Directors, a marketing and brokerage firm specializing in new construction. "Then we look at our own product and compare it feature by feature: the quality of finishes, views, amenities, closet space, size, location. We weight those factors giving them a value. It's elegant math."
It is not clear how long concessions will continue. 
"We deal with this every 8 to 10 years," Mr. Edwards said. "There is a little building boom and an economic downturn, so you end up with a shifting marketplace and concessions. Once the buildings are absorbed, the market builds back, and the same thing happens again."

HEADLINE: Driver Who Mowed Down 19 Returned to Hit 7, Police Say 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
A man suspected of shooting a woman last weekend and of deliberately running down 19 people in a hit-and-run spree in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday was seized at his New Jersey home yesterday after he hijacked a car at gunpoint in Secaucus, returned to Manhattan and, the police said, did it again -- plowing into more Midtown pedestrians.
 Seven people were struck down and injured, four seriously, at 11:20 a.m. at 34th Street and Seventh Avenue, the police said, by a driver who sped east, weaving wildly against oncoming traffic before abandoning his car at the curb outside Macy's and disappearing into a crowded subway station. 
 The assailant -- witnesses described a man clad in black, with wraparound sunglasses, a silver handgun and a nosebleed from crashing into victims -- eluded a dragnet of police officers and bloodhounds who swarmed into the station at 34th Street and Broadway and into other stations along the ganglia of subway and suburban train lines leading from Herald Square and Pennsylvania Station.
But less than two hours later, Bergen County authorities seeking a suspect in the woman's shooting and in Tuesday's vehicular assaults arrested Ronald J. Popadich, 39, at his home in Garfield, N.J. The car abandoned after Tuesday's crashes was found to be registered to Mr. Popadich, and a check with the New York police yesterday showed that the captive matched the description of the driver in yesterday's assaults. 
Confronted with the dovetailing evidence, Mr. Popadich, according to law-enforcement officials, admitted hitting the pedestrians and the shooting of the woman, Lisa B. Gotkin, 40, of Garfield, who is married and the mother of a 12-year-old daughter but was described by detectives as the suspect's girlfriend.
"He confessed to both hit-and-runs, the one on Tuesday and the one today," a law-enforcement official said. "He said he intentionally did the carjacking this morning in Secaucus, and he intentionally went back to the same area to hurt more people. The underlying motive is he just hates people."
Mr. Popadich also told the authorities he escaped yesterday by darting in and out of the subway station and taking a taxicab home to New Jersey. As for the silver handgun used in the hijacking in Secaucus, he said he left it in the car he abandoned on 34th Street. In the car, still wrapped with yellow police tape, was a silver .32-caliber Smith & Wesson. 
That was the caliber of the gun used to shoot Ms. Gotkin last Sunday, the police said, but investigators were still awaiting ballistics tests. A box of .32-caliber bullets and Ms. Gotkin's handbag were found in the trunk of Mr. Popadich's car in Manhattan on Tuesday after 19 pedestrians and bicyclists were hit along Seventh and Eighth Avenues between 34th and 14th Streets. None were seriously hurt.
Mr. Popadich was being held last night on a warrant issued on Wednesday charging him with attempted murder and possession of a weapon in connection with the shooting of Ms. Gotkin, who was hit in the chest, left arm and shoulder and remained in critical condition at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, N.J. Mr. Popadich was to be arraigned today in Superior Court in Hackensack.
Neighbors in Garfield said that Mr. Popadich has lived for many years with his 77-year-old widowed mother, Violet, on a pleasant street of tidy, modest homes. They described him as unemployed and an unfriendly loner who shopped for his mother and puttered in the yard.
"He's quiet," said a neighbor, Steve Baskinger. "He doesn't talk to anyone in the neighborhood, and no one talks to him." Cido Patire said: "In the 15 years I've lived here, the guy never said hello to me. I used to say hello, but I never got a response so I stopped. He'd just give you that look, like he was in another world."
Violet Popadich, in a brief telephone interview, said she did not believe her son had struck pedestrians or shot Ms. Gotkin, but she declined to amplify. The Record of Hackensack quoted her as saying her son met Ms. Gotkin last summer when she fell off her bicycle while riding past the Popadich home.
The bizarre case, unfolding in episodes like a paperback thriller, began last Sunday night when a worker at a trucking depot found Ms. Gotkin, shot and lying on a dead-end street, in Elmwood Park, N.J. Investigators interviewed her husband, Richard, and sometime later began searching for Mr. Popadich.
On Tuesday afternoon, investigators charged, Mr. Popadich drove to Manhattan in his battered greenish-blue Buick Regal and struck 19 people in a 20-block series of vehicular assaults that began at 34th Street and ended at 17th Street and Eighth Avenue, where the car was abandoned. Witnesses saw the driver flee on foot and run into a subway station.
Bloodstains were found on the car's seat. After learning that the car was registered to Mr. Popadich, investigators expanded their search across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania after they discovered that his credit card had been used at Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to buy an Amtrak ticket to Philadelphia. He apparently took the train to Trenton, where he stayed Wednesday night, and then took another train to northern New Jersey early yesterday.
Next, investigators said, Mr. Popadich turned up at a Dunkin' Donuts in a strip mall in Secaucus, three miles west of the Lincoln Tunnel, at 6:45 a.m. Havinder Singh, 26, the manager, remembered a middle-aged man in a black ski hat, black pants and a black leather jacket with the collar turned up.
About 6:50, Susan Dayan, of Verona, N.J., who bought coffee and doughnuts, walked out. The man followed. Moments later, Mr. Singh said, the woman ran back in screaming: "She was crying and screaming, 'Call the police! Somebody took my car! He put a gun to my head!' "
Capt. John Buckley of the Secaucus police said the carjacker had driven off in Ms. Dayan's silver-gray Volkswagen Jetta, a four-door sedan.
The car was seen at 11:20 a.m., going east on 34th Street in Manhattan. At Seventh Avenue, the police said, it turned south, invading a crosswalk and knocking down three pedestrians. It then veered across the avenue, striking four more people. One was hurled upward and shattered the windshield.
The car then shot back into 34th Street, still going east, witnesses said, and careered wildly into the westbound lanes, forcing oncoming traffic to veer away. Just west of Broadway, it halted and the driver fled into the subway.
At a news conference last night, William H. Allee, the chief of detectives in New York, and James V. Santulli, an assistant prosecutor in Bergen County, said that bloodhound tracking showed that Mr. Popadich had dashed through the station and emerged at 32nd Street. The officials said he then took a cab to Garfield, arriving at his home at 12:10 p.m.
Ten minutes later, the police arrived at the home and were told by Violet Popadich that her son was hiding in the basement. A short time later, they said, he came out, disheveled after days on the run, and surrendered peacefully.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: RECONSTRUCTION; 
Restarting Afghan Cycle Of Agriculture

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
While American troops search Afghanistan for terrorists, relief agencies feed its refugees and a nascent government seeks to restore order, something experts call essential for reviving the shattered country is quietly taking place in a few fields.
 Seed is being planted. 
 The immediate goal is not to grow food for millions of hungry Afghans. The first harvests will simply produce more seed, as will the next, and the next. 
With these small steps, scientists are beginning an extended effort to restore the foundation of the country's agricultural economy, which once employed three-fourths of the population and produced bounties of wheat, lentils, fruits and nuts. 
Yesterday, scientists organized by Future Harvest, an international agricultural development group, announced a project aimed at replenishing Afghanistan's empty seed stores, restocking its livestock herds and assessing damage to irrigation systems and trees. The first year of the effort is being financed mainly with an $11.5 million grant by the United States Agency for International Development. 
But experts say billions of dollars will be needed over a decade or more to rebuild Afghanistan's agrarian economy. They say the project is essential if Afghanistan is to resume domestic food production and discourage farmers from cultivating poppies for the heroin trade, a common practice in recent decades. 
"To really bring peace to the country you need sustainable, viable agriculture," said Dr. Adel el-Beltagy, director general of the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, based in Aleppo, Syria. "Restoring the nation's seed supply is crucial because it forms the foundation for all farming activities."
The center, which is supervising the project, is supplying some of the seed from its archive, which includes more than 2,000 genetic varieties of Afghan plants.
Under the program, scientists from several relief agencies, the Aleppo center, universities and seed banks as far away as Mexico will head to Afghanistan next month with an initial batch of 3,850 tons of seed for dozens of crop varieties that thrive in the region's varied climate. Another 11,000 tons, mainly wheat, corn, barley and other grains, will be sent in the fall for a spring seed harvest, project scientists said.
While a small amount of seed has been produced in Afghanistan in recent years by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the new project is expected to sharply increase supplies. 
The goal over the next five years is to expand seed production to about 125,000 tons a year, the level needed for Afghanistan to return to self-sufficiency, said Dr. John H. Dodds, a Washington representative for the dry-areas agriculture center.
Much of the seed brought in for the project will come from collections made in Afghanistan in the early 1970's, as part of an international effort to safeguard samples of crop varieties. Many important plants originated in Afghanistan, including carrots and chickpeas. 
Dr. Beltagy says the crisis in Afghanistan illustrates the value of maintaining these dispersed genetic repositories. Afghanistan's own plant gene bank, stored in its agricultural headquarters in Kabul, was destroyed in 1992 as rival factions ransacked the city; more recently, a severe drought depleted Afghan farmers' remaining stocks of seed.
"We believe the majority of the country's seed was lost when farmers planted the 2001 crop," Dr. Beltagy said. "When the rains failed for a third year in a row, it put an end to their ability to stay on the land."
If the drought persists, it could threaten the seed-production plan itself, scientists said. "If you have the rain and not the seeds, you have a problem," Dr. Dodds said, "but if you have the seeds and don't have the rain, you still have a problem."
As farming areas are brought under government control, scientists will fan out to assess damage to rural networks of irrigation channels, native pistachio forests and orchards that once produced bumper crops of almonds, walnuts, apples and plums. 
Since the Soviet invasion in 1979, the pistachio forests, mainly in northern provinces, have been chopped down for firewood. In other places, orchards were destroyed during fighting between rival warlords and scorched-earth campaigns by the Taliban. 
But scientists say the most important mission is rebuilding stockpiles of seed. A leader of the team, Dr. Nasrat Wassimi, a plant geneticist who is a native of Jalalabad, left Afghanistan in 2000 after training local teams to collect samples of native nuts, grains, fruits and vegetables. "Whatever we could get our hands on, we collected," he said.
Before fleeing the Taliban, the team hid the samples last year in basements and other caches in Ghazni province, in the south, chosen because its dry, cold climate might help preserve them. 
Dr. Wassimi said one of his first goals would be to find out whether they survived.

HEADLINE: House Adopts New Tax Cuts; Senate Votes For Benefits 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
The House today passed a Republican-sponsored package of tax cuts and other measures intended to help the economy, rebuffing an effort by the Democratic-controlled Senate to put further tax reductions aside for now and move quickly just to extend unemployment benefits.
The vote was 225 to 199. Ten Democrats voted in favor of the bill and one Republican voted against it.
 It was the third time since last fall that the House had passed an economic package built around new and accelerated tax cuts for individuals and businesses. 
 Republicans said the plan, which they said would cut taxes and increase spending by $150 billion over the next decade, would help the economy bounce back strongly and would create jobs instead of just giving more money to jobless people. It included the provision adopted unanimously by the Senate last week to extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks beyond the 26-week limit set by most states.
"I want to be able to go to my out-of-work constituents and say that I tried my best to help you get a job," said Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the House speaker.
Democrats said the vote was a political ploy, because the Senate has repeatedly blocked the Republican plan. Democrats said Republicans were willing to let 11,000 people a day run out of unemployment insurance just to score points with big companies, the wealthy and other supporters of more tax cuts. 
The January unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, up 1.7 percentage points in 16 months, and economists expect it to rise this year even if the recession ends. About 7.9 million people are unemployed, and about 2 million could exhaust their benefits in the first half of this year if there is no extension, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group.
"I have seen some pretty political things happen on this floor on both sides of the aisle," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, who was elected to Congress in 1970. "But this has to be one of the most mean things I have seen since I have been here. We are holding hostage millions of Americans that we promised early on that we were going to help."
The plan passed by the House today is basically the same package it passed in December. It would provide many low-income workers with a one-time payment of up to $300; reduce the current 27 percent individual income tax rate to 25 percent effective this year, four years earlier than the rate would fall to that level under current law; allow companies to write off an additional 30 percent of the cost of new investments for the next three years; reduce the corporate alternative minimum tax; create tax credits to help unemployed people buy health insurance; and establish tax breaks to encourage rebuilding in lower Manhattan.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said that the Republican plan "isn't going anywhere" and that Congress should enact the extension of benefits this week, before lawmakers take a one-week break.
Mr. Daschle took the benefit extension bill to the Senate floor again this afternoon, where it was again passed without a roll call vote or any dissent from Republicans. Mr. Daschle said the action sent the House a "clear bipartisan message" to stop playing games with help for jobless people.
John Feehery, a spokesman for Mr. Hastert, said the House Republican leadership had no plans to bring up a stand-alone bill extending unemployment benefits but had not ruled out doing so if the Senate did not act on the House bill.
The maneuvering was the latest chapter in the long-running ideological debate between the parties about how best to help the economy. The Bush administration has completed a study of the economic effect of last year's $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut, and concluded that it has helped make the recession more shallow than it would otherwise have been.
The study, by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, is to be released formally on Friday. It found that without the tax cut, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's pre-Sept. 11 agenda, the economy would have contracted at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter instead of the reported 1.3 percent annual rate. In the fourth quarter, the study said, the economy would have contracted at a 1 percent annual rate rather than growing 0.2 percent.
Democrats have assailed last year's tax cut as fiscally irresponsible and ultimately bad for the economy. They picked up that theme today when Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill reiterated the administration's request that Congress increase the limit on the national debt by the end of next month to allow for more government borrowing. 
Last year Republicans joined Democrats in promising to pay off the part of the debt held by the public within a decade.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans To Lay Off 3,000 People 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
General Motors said today that it planned to lay off nearly 3,000 workers at two plants, including 1,100 at a truck plant in Linden, N.J.
 The cuts are the second tremor New Jersey has felt from Detroit's belt tightening, which comes after a year of big sales but shrinking profits. 
 Last month, the Ford Motor Company, which lost $5.4 billion last year, said that a truck plant in Edison, N.J., would be among five plants it would close by the middle of the decade. Ford is in the middle of a corporate turnaround plan that includes 35,000 layoffs worldwide. 
G.M., the world's largest automaker, said today that it would dismiss 1,750 workers at a plant in Orion Township, Mich., near Detroit. Both the Linden and Orion plants were making vehicles that had recorded falling sales in recent years.
G.M. did record a profit of $601 million last year and has been the most resilient of the Big Three during the recession, but its earnings fell 58 percent from a year earlier, partly as a result of the high cost of no-interest financing deals the Big Three offered. 
"Management made a decision this afternoon to transition both Linden and Orion to one shift of production, from two," said Dan Flores, a G.M. spokesman. He added that the move would "align the production output with market demand for the products they build."
The plant in Linden makes an older version of the Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle, as well as the G.M.C. Jimmy. Sales of the old Blazer have faltered since a new version of the vehicle, the 2001 Chevrolet Trailblazer, was introduced. The Jimmy is no longer sold in the United States but is exported to Canada.
A G.M. plant in Moraine, Ohio, near Dayton, makes the Trailblazer and the G.M.C. Envoy, a midsize sport utility that replaced the Jimmy. 
Linden also produces the Chevy S-10 and G.M.C. Sonoma pickups. Both are compact pickups, but it is G.M.'s newer full-size pickups, like the Chevrolet Silverado and Avalanche, that have been the hotter sellers of late. 
Down to a single shift, the future of the Linden plant is in some doubt. 
"Right now, Linden is assigned production through the third quarter of the 2004 calendar year," Mr. Flores said. "The future of the plant beyond 2004 has not been determined."
The plant in Orion Township makes the Oldsmobile Aurora -- Oldsmobile is going to be phased out -- as well as the Pontiac Bonneville and Buick Park Avenue. In January, the Bonneville's sales fell 33 percent from a year earlier, and the Park Avenue's fell nearly 40 percent.
Under the terms of G.M.'s contract with the United Automobile Workers union, workers can be laid off for 42 weeks, receiving partial pay, and then are placed in a jobs bank, making them eligible for transfer to other G.M. sites.
The announcements today were not part of previously announced job cuts. G.M. said last month that it would cut its white-collar work force 10 percent, or more than 5,000 workers, through buyouts.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A SUBSIDIARY; 
For Executives Of Enron Unit, The Skill Was in Leaving

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE with SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Thomas E. White served 23 years in the Army, rising to the rank of brigadier general. But it was his second career -- a decade spent as a top executive of the Enron Corporation -- that won him inclusion in the circle of businessmen whom President Bush appointed last year to run the armed services. 
 "Tom White is one of the most outstanding managers in corporate America," Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said in introducing him to the Armed Services Committee at a hearing on his confirmation as secretary of the Army. "He is a person that knows how to manage people and resources. And when our job is taking the money we have and building the finest army we can build with those resources, I don't have any doubt in my mind that Tom White can do an outstanding job." 
 Now, though, the collapse of Enron has put Mr. White's resume in a new light. The unit he helped run in his last years at the company, Enron Energy Services -- though it was presented by the company as a big money maker -- turns out to have bled cash, former employees said. They describe it as a seemingly smart idea -- selling electricity and natural gas supplies to big corporations in competition with the local utility -- undone by poor financial assumptions, suspect accounting and lax management oversight. 
Both Mr. White, who was vice chairman of the unit, and his boss, a longtime Enron executive named Lou L. Pai, rose quickly, and by the time they left Enron last summer, they seemed set for life. 
Mr. White, 58, left with a $1 million severance payment after earning $5.5 million in his final year at the company. Over that time, he sold about $12 million in Enron stock.
Mr. Pai (pronounced pie), the chairman of Enron Energy Services, cashed out all his shares and options, valued at more than $270 million, before leaving the company. That was more than any other executive took away in stock before Enron collapsed. At various times, both men served on the top management committee that set Enron Corporation policy.
Yet despite earlier successes at Enron that won them big rewards and promotions, neither Mr. White nor Mr. Pai appears to have fully understood the energy services business, according to former employees and analysts. Co-workers said the two men contributed to the unit's problems through neglect of the multimillion-dollar deals the business forged, many of which were irreparable money losers.
They portray Mr. White as the charming public face of Enron Energy Services, valuable for his ability to motivate workers but indifferent to the dollars-and-cents details that would determine the unit's success.
"You would talk finances, and Tom's eyes would glaze over," said John E. Olson, director of research at the Houston brokerage firm of Sanders Harris Morris. Mr. Olson, a longtime critic of Enron, nonetheless said he regarded Mr. White as an honest executive, and co-workers described him as a strong leader. 
The employees paint a picture of the reserved Mr. Pai as a canny financial theorist and devout free marketer. They say he firmly believed that selling power to big customers could be profitable, but he lacked skill in carrying out his ideas. 
"Lou Pai was good at starting things," said Rudy Sutherland, a former Energy Services manager who was part of a team created to sort out a large group of contracts where claims of profitability were suspect. "He was a visionary, but he had no expertise in structuring a fiscally responsible company."
Mr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. His lawyers issued a statement on his behalf saying: "Mr. Pai has seen the recent E.E.S.-bashing by certain former employees. He believes the criticism to be completely unfounded. E.E.S. conducted its business with integrity and reported its financial results properly and candidly."
Mr. White did not respond to questions relayed to him through an Army spokesman. In an interview on Jan. 31, he dismissed a suggestion that Enron Energy Services was unsound. "As far as I am concerned, Enron Energy Services was a great business," he said. "We built it from nothing. There were no accounting irregularities that I was aware of."
Both Mr. White and Mr. Pai were fortunate in the timing of their departures from Enron. Government ethics rules required Mr. White to begin selling his stake in the company once he became Army secretary, responsible for the service's $81 billion budget. 
As for Mr. Pai, whatever he may have known about Enron's finances, the impetus for selling his stock was a divorce in early 2000. By selling most of his equity, close acquaintances said, it was easier to split marital assets in the divorce. His former wife, Lanna Pai, received half the proceeds.
Now remarried, to a woman with whom he had maintained a decade-long relationship and had a child, Mr. Pai owns a 77,500-acre ranch in southwestern Colorado, making him among the state's largest private landowners.
He is named in a shareholder lawsuit contending that 29 top Enron executives engaged in improper insider stock sales.
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Government Reform, has said that Mr. White should testify about his activities as an executive at Enron, but no committee has called him to do so. 
When states began deregulating the power industry in the mid-90's, Enron was certain it could make money selling electricity and gas to companies more cheaply than the old-guard utilities. In 1997, it created Enron Energy Services, a pet project of Mr. Pai and of Jeffrey K. Skilling, then Enron's president.
Former Enron executives said that the men became close professionally when Mr. Pai helped Mr. Skilling develop the contracts that enabled Enron to trade natural gas and later, electricity. In 1995, with Mr. Skilling's backing, Mr. Pai became president of Enron's sprawling gas and power trading division.
With Mr. Pai and Mr. White at the helm, Enron Energy Services reported $165 million in operating profit on $4.6 billion in sales in 2000, in contrast to a loss of $68 million on sales of $1.8 billion in 1999, according to Enron's 2000 annual report. 
But the profits turned out to be illusory, according to many former employees. The business, they said, lacked the controls and the scrutiny that would have offered a realistic picture. 
In many cases, the division entered into contracts that ended up losing money. Long-term contracts were based on economic forecasts about the price of power that reflected the unit's earnings targets, rather than objective data, according to an economist at Enron Energy Services.
And in the chase for big-name corporate clients -- the unit's customers included Lucent Technologies, Ocean Spray and J. C. Penney -- Enron traded away the right to renegotiate contracts that turned unprofitable, Mr. Sutherland said. 
Others also warned of problems at Enron Energy Services. In her August 2001 letter to Kenneth L. Lay, then Enron's chairman and chief executive, Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate development, said she was concerned about the unit's accounting practices. Enron Energy Services, she said, used "mark to market" accounting, booking the projected profits of its multimillion-dollar contracts in the year they were signed, long before the actual results could be known. Ms. Watkins described company practices today in extended testimony to a House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee. 
In a letter to Energy Services executives dated Dec. 1, 1999, Debra A. Cash, an auditor with Arthur Andersen, said that the unit had failed to establish policies for such essential functions as "risk management, model development and use, financial accounting and reporting."
Enron has dismissed the problems at the Energy Services unit as normal for a start-up business. The division, which once employed more than 1,000 people, has laid off most of them and is now facing liquidation as part of Enron's bankruptcy filing.
Mr. White joined the Enron Corporation in mid-1990 after serving as executive assistant to Gen. Colin L. Powell, now the secretary of state, when General Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He ran the company's power plant business, proving himself by overseeing the construction of Enron's huge Tees-side power plant in England, which one former executive said was built on time and under budget. 
Later, Mr. White managed the company's vast network of natural gas pipelines before teaming up with Mr. Pai in March 1998 as vice chairman of Enron Energy Services. 
"Tom was viewed internally as being a very strong leader in an organization that had few leaders, though it had a lot of smart people who could get deals done," a former Enron executive said. "When he went to E.E.S, it was thought he could bring a complement really needed to Lou."
On his appointment as Army secretary last year, Mr. White joked that he and the business executives who were named secretaries of the Navy and the Air Force would serve Donald Rumsfeld, the defense secretary, as "C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense." 
Experts on Pentagon management said it was too early in Mr. White's tenure to assess his performance as Army secretary, a post they said required more political skill than business acumen.
"As complex as Enron is -- as far as who did what, who does what -- the Army is tougher," said Dan Goure, vice president of the Lexington Institute, a policy research group in Washington. "It's older, has lots of traditions, has more complex and incomplete paperwork. It's very difficult to manage."
Senator Gramm, whose wife, Wendy, is a member of Enron's board, maintains a high regard for Mr. White, a spokesman, Larry Neal, said. "Senator Gramm believed then that after a lifetime of military and corporate experience, General White would make an excellent secretary of the Army, and now he has," Mr. Neal said. "In the absence of substantial and honest evidence to the contrary, the senator's views are unchanged."
Mr. Pai maintained a distance from the unit's everyday workings, colleagues said. The youngest in a Chinese immigrant family sparkling with professional accomplishment, Mr. Pai received a master's degree in economics from the University of Maryland and worked as an economist for several federal agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the 1970's. He moved to Houston in the 80's to work for Conoco and was hired at Enron by a friend from graduate school.
People who knew Mr. Pai at Enron say he was reserved to the point of seeming aloof. A sales manager recalled that other executives, including Mr. Skilling, scrutinized his contracts more closely than did Mr. Pai -- who, he said, would sign off with a perfunctory "good deal."
During most of his time at Enron Energy Services, Mr. Pai was tangled in marital problems. In the early 1990's, he became involved with a married woman named Melanie Fewell. When Ms. Fewell divorced her husband in 1996, he described Mr. Pai in court documents as her "paramour" and employer.
Mistakes did not seem to daunt Mr. Pai. In a 1999 interview with The New York Times, he said, "You can't sit there and punish people for trying."
But he conceded that if Energy Services miscalculated its prospects, the market would discipline it severely. "If we don't execute," he said, "we're toast."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Closes Above 10,000 for First Time in a Month

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices were narrowly mixed in directionless trading yesterday, but the Dow Jones industrial average closed above the 10,000 level for the first time in more than a month. 
 Helped by gains in Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, Eastman Kodak and Honeywell, the Dow gained 12.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,001.19. It is the first time the blue-chip index has closed above 10,000 since Jan. 10. 
 But broader market averages fell, hurt by weakness in telecommunications stocks. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 15.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,843.37. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell for the second session in the last three, closing at 1,116.48, down 2.03 points, or 0.2 percent. 
"We have been conditioned to daily moves of 2 to 3 percent," said Bill Schneider, head of equity block trading at UBS Warburg. 
Now, however, "people don't know what they want to do," Mr. Schneider said. "There is no rush to put money to work because there is no feeling the market is going to get away from you."
More than 1.2 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, nearly 5 percent below the three-month daily average. Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the Nasdaq, while advancing and declining issues were about even on the Big Board. 
"The market is up about 4 percent over the last four days," said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock market research firm in Connecticut. 
"The previous four days it was down 4 percent," he said. "The problem is that the stocks that went down are not the stocks that subsequently went up." 
Indeed, even as worries about credit quality and possible accounting irregularities continue to hound some stocks, there is a growing sense that conditions have returned to those that existed before the terrorist attacks. 
"The stock market is now about where it was prior to the crisis," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer for Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. 
"So are bond yields and initial unemployment claims numbers," Mr. Paulsen said. "And retail sales are not much different."
Stocks rose at the opening yesterday after the Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell last week, remaining below the 400,000 level for the sixth consecutive week. The report was the latest indication that the economy is rebounding. 
The positive tone remained largely intact until early in the afternoon, when the Standard & Poor's Corporation said that it had cut its ratings on the long-term debt of Qwest Communications. Earlier, Qwest had activated backstop loans from a number of banks when it could not roll over its short-term commercial paper. 
Qwest, a component of the S.& P. 500, fell $1.10, to $7.49. 
Tyco International, another company that has been plagued by worries about debt levels and the transparency of its books, was a further drag on the S.& P. yesterday. The company's stock fell $2.15, to $26.75. The shares have lost more than 54 percent of their value so far this year. 
Drug stocks were weak. 
Johnson & Johnson fell 61 cents, to $57.30. Merck declined 89 cents, to $59.69. And Pfizer dropped 29 cents, to $40.80. 
Among Dow stocks, 3M gained $1.09, to $116.90; Eastman Kodak rose $1.08, to $29.15; and Honeywell closed at $34, up 70 cents. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Reuters)
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, carried by gains in long-term bonds as reports showing a stabilizing labor market and declining business inventories increased prospects of an economic recovery.
The upbeat economic data, coming after another bright piece of economic news on Wednesday that core retail sales posted their biggest one-month gain in January in nearly two years, prompted investors to switch out of short-term notes into long-term bonds.
Traders also say the data roused some market fears that the Federal Reserve, after one of its most aggressive rate cutting campaigns in history, would lift benchmark rates as early as May.
"It seems as if we are getting a little bit of dominance at the long end that is helping to drag up prices across the rest of the curve," said Michael Wallace, senior market strategist at Standard & Poor's MMS International.
The 10-year note rose 9/32, to a price of 99 15/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 4.94 percent from 4.98 on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond rose 20/32, to a price of 99 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.41 percent from 5.45 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: POLITICS; 
A Pragmatic Approach To a Bad-News Budget

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made the rounds this week trying to sell his austere budget plan, one thing has been notably absent: sweeping, ideological pronouncements about how his budget will shape city policy or transform its delivery of services to reflect his political beliefs.
 Instead, Mr. Bloomberg has cast himself as a pragmatist trying to solve a particularly thorny problem: finding a way to close the $4.76 billion budget deficit that the city is facing. "There are no new projects," he candidly declared when he presented his plan. "We're trying to balance a budget. And I do not have all the good ideas." 
 It has not always been so at City Hall. 
Rudolph W. Giuliani's budgets were often presented as needed correctives to what he saw as the failed liberal policies of the past. His budget speeches were full of calls to end remedial classes at the city's community colleges, or to overhaul welfare policies by declaring the end to a culture of dependency, or to reinvent government. When he spoke about shrinking the size of government, it was clear that he thought smaller government was a goal unto itself.
And before him, David N. Dinkins, who had more than his share of bad-news budgets in tough economic times, spoke of his vision of an expansive role for government even as he made difficult cuts and raised taxes, speaking of the city's "covenant with the most vulnerable of our people."
Mr. Bloomberg, by contrast, simply painted the size of the city government as a luxury that can no longer be afforded. When he pointed out that by some measures the city's work force could be considered to be as high as 363,000 -- 100,000 bigger than previously believed -- he avoided words like "bloated." 
In fact, he largely avoided judgments. After noting that the ratio of city employees to New Yorkers was higher than the ratio of federal employees to Americans, he concluded: "So it just shows you that the city is more compassionate. We do more things for our citizens than any other place. But there is a cost."
Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said that his rolled-up-sleeves, problem-solving approach goes back to his career in business and even to his days as an engineering student. Some said they hoped the approach would make it easier for him to forge a consensus with the other necessary players in creating a budget: the City Council, Albany, the federal government, the unions, the bond rating agencies. And City Council officials said they hoped it would make negotiations easier by eliminating distractions.
"I'd say the mayor is a much less ideological man, and I think his budget is reflective of that," said Gifford Miller, the City Council speaker, who added that he was pleased that the mayor had made it clear that he was open to suggestions. "In the past, we wasted a lot of time on vouchers and other ideas that were nonstarters from the beginning that obscured the real issues." 
Douglas Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College, said that the less politically charged tone of his budget presentation was a striking departure from those of at least the last two mayors. "He is a businessman," Dr. Muzzio said. "And while he has his own set of social ideas, he does not have a political doctrine he is pushing. I think it will make it easier to sell his plan." 
Of course, Mr. Bloomberg allowed himself a few ideological moments, especially on tax policy. His stated belief that higher taxes would hurt the city in the long run by scaring away businesses is already being questioned by people trying to avoid some of his planned cuts to social services that serve the poor.
And the main exception to his no-new-taxes rule -- his call to raise the city's cigarette tax by $1.42 a pack -- is motivated as much by a policy goal as by a need for the $250 million the tax would generate: Mr. Bloomberg believes the higher tax would keep children from taking up smoking. 
But for the most part, Mayor Bloomberg tried to cast his plan as a nuts-and-bolts approach to closing the budget gap, motivated solely by the bottom line.
His call to stop the recycling of glass and bottles was made for one reason, he said: the program was not helping the environment, and it was not cost-effective. A $3 million grant program administered by the Health Department would go, he said, because sponsoring research is not the department's job.
And while it may not be politically savvy to cut weekend meals for the elderly or to close centers for them, given the fact that the elderly are a reliable voting bloc, or to begin construction of new schools only in a single borough, Queens, Mr. Bloomberg said that the proposals were made on the merits. There was no mention in his speech of overriding policy objectives, no calls for merging or renaming agencies, no new social contracts laid out or calls for union productivity or living wages or privatization or any of the other government buzzwords of recent years. 
It was mainly expenses and revenues. 
"In 1994, Giuliani wanted to slay a whole number of dragons," said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, who argued that some of Mr. Giuliani's successes made such an approach unnecessary now. "Bloomberg's strength, his style, works well with the post 9/11 mood of the city, the cooperative mood of the city. It is appropriate to the moment."
Mr. Bloomberg did not make any dramatic pleas for large amounts of state and federal aid. "We can't depend on a Hail Mary pass, whether it is an enormous upturn in the economy or moneys from Washington or Albany that we are unlikely to get," he said. "Doesn't mean we wouldn't like to get them."
He is counting on $800 million in new revenues and savings that the city can get only if the state and federal governments take action. Some of those actions are unlikely. But Mr. Bloomberg said he had identified a series of actions that could save the city $2.1 billion, so that he could reasonably expect that enough of them would come through for the city to hit the $800 million target.
His wish list from the federal government includes legislation to allow the city to refinance its debt and getting more flexibility in how it spends federal aid, among other things. He is calling on Albany to allow the city to raise the cigarette tax, to pass tort reform legislation that would reduce claims against the city, and to allow the city to phase in the cost of living adjustments it must pay to its pension funds.
He was careful not to criticize the governor, as he was careful not to criticize the unions.
Of course, since the days of Machiavelli, politicians have been asking themselves whether it is better to be loved than feared.
"Giuliani came off as being more than a bit scary," said Edmund J. McMahon Jr., a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "Bloomberg comes off as someone who is determined to bend over backward to be nice. If history shows anything, it is that getting tough and being maybe a little scary is more likely to get results than being nice and expecting people to voluntarily dig deep to help out."

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: TRANSPORTATION; 
Mayor Looks At Tolls For Bridges On East River

BYLINE:  By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration said yesterday that it was exploring placing tolls on city-controlled bridges on the East River and perhaps others. An idea that has been proposed by mayors several times before, it seems to be gaining momentum as a way to help cure the city's ailing finances. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not mention the idea when he presented his budget plan, but deep within it -- in a section explaining sources of money that the city hoped to tap in the next few years -- the administration included $800 million expected by 2006 from "congestion pricing" and "E-ZPass initiatives." 
 While administration officials stressed that they were still in the early stages of discussion, they said that money could come from a range of new charges to drivers. 
Clearly the most prominent plan for generating the money -- and the one that the Bloomberg administration was most reluctant to talk about yesterday -- would place tolls on the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro and Williamsburg Bridges, and possibly other bridges under the city's control (like those on the Harlem River). 
The measure, city officials said, would probably require approval from both the City Council and the State Legislature. 
"Everything is under consideration," said Jordan Barowitz, a mayoral spokesman, when asked about the budget projections.
Tolls on the East River crossings have long been supported by many traffic experts, who say that they would reduce excessive traffic into Manhattan, prompt more people to take public transportation and generate badly needed income for the maintenance of the city's streets and bridges. Other pieces of the plan, officials said, could entail higher parking rates at meters across the city during high-traffic times, a practice known as congestion pricing, which is intended to encourage drivers to use roads earlier in the day, or later. 
Another idea to accomplish that, and to raise money for the city, would be higher tolls on bridges and tunnels controlled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority during peak travel periods. Under one concept being discussed, some of the toll money would then go to the city, in part because the cars using those crossings during high-traffic times are costing the city money for road repair, traffic and environmental controls and other services.
Privately, administration officials said that some details about the plans would probably be released in April, when more information about the mayor's budget proposal will be made available. A senior official described the new toll proposal as being "on the table as something we want to start to discuss."
Charging cars for using the city's free bridges was first proposed in 1973, as a way for the city to comply with federal requirements that it reduce its car pollution.
But the idea, which has always been approached by elected officials with a great deal of trepidation, was dropped by Gov. Hugh L. Carey, after the federal government allowed the state to comply by showing that it would use all available financial sources to meet basic public transportation needs. The idea was revived under Mayor Edward I. Koch, who hoped that bridge tolls and a $10-a-day fee on all vehicles entering Manhattan south of 59th Street would discourage unnecessary driving as well as gridlock, which damaged both the city's economy and environment. 
During the administration of David N. Dinkins, a mayoral commission proposed East River tolls to help the mayor deal with the city's long-term budget problems. But Mr. Dinkins never supported the idea.
In his campaign position papers, Mr. Bloomberg said that he supported the concept of congestion pricing, which uses tolls and parking charges to change people's travel habits and to try to speed out the flow of traffic more evenly over the day. 
Mr. Bloomberg has continued, in the emergency orders he issues every five days as part of the World Trade Center cleanup, to impose a ban on driver-only vehicles crossing into parts of Manhattan in the morning, a restriction started after enormous congestion in the days following the attack. But it is clear this time that city officials are moving cautiously on tolls, especially given that it is a gubernatorial election year when Mr. Bloomberg's fellow Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki, could face angry voters if he supported new tolls. 
While administration officials say that all the ideas are being considered -- including deriving some income from parking fees and from the M.T.A. -- several transportation experts said that the kind of money projected in the mayor's budget plan -- $100 million starting in 2004, rising to $800 million by 2006 -- could only be gained from placing tolls on the busy bridges. 
"If transportation policy were based on doing the right thing, these tolls would have been started 40 or 50 years ago," said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a transportation watchdog group. "But politically, this has always been a very heavy lift."

Dell Reports Strong Earnings for Quarter

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Dell Computer said yesterday that it had reaped the benefits of unexpectedly good holiday sales to record strong earnings for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, but it predicted no immediate end to the weak demand for computers.
 Dell, whose aggressive pricing and direct-sales strategy helped extend its lead in personal computers during the quarter, reported a profit of $456 million, or 17 cents a share, for the period ended Feb. 1. Sales were $8.06 billion, down 7 percent from the period a year earlier, when it earned $434 million, or 16 cents a share. 
 The report offered few surprises, matching the recently increased estimates of Wall Street analysts. Citing better-than-expected purchasing by consumers, Dell last month raised its earnings forecast to 17 cents, from 16 cents, and its sales projection to $8 billion, from $7.6 billion.
For the current quarter, Dell, which is based in Austin, Tex., said it expected to again outpace its competitors, though overall sales would probably fall without the help from holiday shoppers. Michael S. Dell, the chairman and chief executive, predicted a sales decline of 3 percent to 5 percent from the quarter just ended, a narrower decline than the 10 percent he predicted for the industry.
Dell said it expected to earn 16 cents a share for the current quarter, which matched analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
Many computer makers expected a dreary holiday season, but instead they enjoyed a surprising resurgence in PC buying by consumers. Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard, which are trying to merge to compete better with Dell and I.B.M., also exceeded their early revenue and earnings predictions for the fourth quarter.
But while Dell's competitors relied on certain products like printers and consulting services for profits, Dell was the only computer company to increase sales in all parts of its business compared with the fourth quarter of the previous year.
The financial results of Dell's competitors recently beat analysts' expectations by several pennies a share. But Joel Wagonfeld, an analyst with Banc of America Securities, said Dell's earnings were no less impressive for their consistency.
"They speak to the company's ability to manage its business extremely well in a very difficult environment," he said, adding that its competitors have difficulty breaking even in selling computers.
Mr. Dell said the company's corporate business had stabilized or even strengthened slightly, but he backed off earlier predictions that corporate buyers would begin widely upgrading their computers again around the middle of the year.
Nearly 150 million computers are more than three years old, and about one-third of those sit in large American companies, Mr. Dell said. Many corporations have delayed replacing those machines for several quarters.
"We expect the upgrades to come, but it's going to be very dependent on the economy," he said.
As demand flagged in 2001, Dell used price cuts to gobble up market share for PC's and data-serving computers. The company held 14 percent of the worldwide PC market and 27.5 percent of the American market, more than Compaq and Hewlett-Packard combined.
While the PC market declined, sales of accessories like digital cameras and home networking equipment helped retail sales of computer products remain steady last year, according to a report issued yesterday by NPDTechworld, a market research firm. PC sales fell 20 percent in 2001, but accessories like hard drives, hand-held computers and mice increased by 13 percent.
Stephen Baker, a research director with the NPDTechworld, said many consumers bought gadgets that improve their PC's, instead of buying new computers.

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: EDUCATION; 
Middle-Class Parents Say Schools Have Been Cut to the Bone

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Since the first days of school last September, parents at Public School 87, the quintessential middle-class school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, have brought reams of paper so teachers can photocopy homework assignments. 
 They have taken up a collection to pay the salaries of classroom assistants in kindergarten and to help pay for the school librarian. That is not even counting the animal crackers, pencils and tissues that they pay for day in and day out. 
 But they have not been able to make up for the loss of relief teachers who made it possible for children to take elective courses in foreign languages, or for the loss of the music teacher, the two reading teachers, the speech therapist or the guidance counselor. 
Even before a new round of cuts proposed this week by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ripples through the school system, parents at P.S. 87 and other middle-class schools across the city say that cuts imposed last year -- most before Sept. 11 -- have been so deep that they have reduced their schools to all but the most rudimentary form of education: one teacher standing in front of a large class of students.
Now they are worried that a new 7 percent, $354 million proposed cut in city financing will drive families out of the public school system and into private schools or homes in suburban school districts. 
The daily pressure to get by has led to intense envy among schools as they jockey over who has more and who deserves more resources. 
"I think it's really sad that once again the middle class is being turned against the working class in the system," said Leslie Berger, whose two sons are in kindergarten and third grade at P.S. 87.
Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, a group that monitors the education budget, calls the rivalry "horizontal hostility."
"It's a fight for every crumb between one school and the other, and it's pathetic," Ms. Connell said.
The last round of cuts, imposed in stages beginning last August, has totaled $400 million so far. The cutbacks have hit classrooms hard and have already sharply reduced the city's contribution.
They caused particularly deep pain in middle-class schools, which do not have the cushion of city, state and federal antipoverty and remedial aid money to fall back on. These schools already had the highest class sizes in the city and have stopped growing bigger only because of the minimum staffing requirements written into the teachers' contract.
But even in schools with a poorer population, the cuts wiped out many small innovative programs intended to give failing black and Hispanic children an academic edge and a chance at success, like Saturday mathematics classes and after-school reading programs.
At Middle School 51 in Park Slope, almost every penny in classroom expenses is going to teacher salaries, said Jeanette Lee, so the seventh-grade class of her son Patrick Flaherty, has no science textbooks and the art teachers have to raise money for materials. At the Neighborhood School in the East Village, the math teacher of Lily Sacharow, a sixth grader, has only one textbook, which she copied for students, said Lily's mother, Barbara.
District 27, which includes Woodhaven and Howard Beach in Queens, has cut its science coordinator, testing coordinator and math coordinator, said Donna Caltabiano, a community school board member.
At P.S. 193 in Midwood, the school librarian now covers classes when other teachers are getting contractually mandated preparation time, instead of doing research projects with individual children, said Ellen Bilofsky, co-president of the Parents Association.
Clinton School in Chelsea cut back its after-school literacy program and parents have been asked to pay for Internet wiring, said Sylvia Wertheimer, a parent there.
At P.S. 153 in west Harlem, the gates are shuttered at 9 a.m. Saturday, when children used to scamper in for extra classes.
Elizabeth Lorris Ritter was skeptical the first time her son came home from Muscota New School in Washington Heights saying he did not have homework because there was no copying paper. "It was right up there with the dog ate it," she said. But when it kept happening, she found out it was true.
Unlike the Police Department, which, supported by a special income tax surcharge, grew enormously under the Giuliani administration, the school system received little extra city tax money in the years of plenty. 
This school year, "city spending per pupil went down in absolute terms, and in real terms adjusted for inflation, it probably went down even more," said Anthony Shorris, deputy chancellor for management and policy. 
While the state added $82 per pupil to city schools for this school year, the city cut $167, said Ms. Connell of the Educational Priorities Panel. 
Parents at P.S. 87, one of the most successful schools on the Upper West Side, have had enough. Researching district documents, they found that spending per pupil in their school had plummeted 12 percent in one year, and that they were receiving less money per pupil for the classroom -- $3,700 -- than any other elementary school in their district.
In contrast, P.S. 191 on West 61st Street, a high-poverty school performing far below standards in reading and math, was cut 16 percent but still receives $7,100 per pupil.
The gap in spending between P.S. 87 and the second-lowest school in the district, P.S. 75 on West End Avenue and West 96th Street, has grown tenfold this year, to $700 from $70 per pupil.
Parents say they are being punished for their ability to raise money privately, at a time when their principal has retired and is no longer there to defend them.
"I have to say, until I had kids in the public schools I didn't pay enough attention," said Mary Hammann, whose son, Eli Kaplan, is a kindergartner at P.S. 87. 
Yesterday, about 50 parents at P.S. 87 marched from the school at West 77th Street up Amsterdam Avenue to the District 3 headquarters on West 93rd Street to protest the cuts. After meeting with a small group, Patricia Romandetto, the district superintendent, agreed to restore about $53,000 of the $600,000 cut to P.S. 87.
"At this juncture they have children who are not in economic nor educational need, so that they stand to lose the most," Ms. Romandetto said.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers Plan for Voluntary Measures to Limit Gas Emissions 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: SILVER SPRING, Md., Feb. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush announced his long-awaited plans today for slowing the buildup of gases linked to climate change and for cutting power plant pollution. 
 His speech, made this afternoon at a government climate and oceans research center here, elicited clashing choruses of criticism and praise from advocates and politicians arguing over the best way to cut emissions of so-called greenhouse gases while minimizing the burden on the economy. 
 Mr. Bush made it clear that, for him, the economy came first, not just for its own sake but because, he said, a thriving economy was necessary to build wealth that could be used to improve conditions on the planet. 
"My approach recognizes that economic growth is the solution, not the problem," he said. 
With his address, Mr. Bush essentially provided his answer to an international treaty intended to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases that his administration rejected in March.
At that time, he also abandoned a campaign pledge to cut power-plant emissions of carbon dioxide and three other pollutants. Not until now has his cabinet been able to agree on substitute proposals.
The treaty Mr. Bush rejected, the Kyoto Protocol, has been agreed to but not yet ratified by almost every other industrial power and developing country. It would require prompt and mandatory reductions by 2012 in gas emissions to levels well below those in 1990.
Mr. Bush rejected the treaty saying it would burden the American economy and unfairly exempt major developing countries. The plan Mr. Bush announced today would rely on voluntary measures only and allow gas emissions to continue to rise, with the goal of slowing the rate of growth. 
Utilities and energy companies expressed support for Mr. Bush's plans through their trade groups. 
Environmental campaigners expressed dismay, including some Greenpeace demonstrators who stood outside the Commerce Department building waving wads of fake dollar bills and a mock climateaction plan stamped in red with the words "Exxon-Mobil Approved." 
On the climate, the administration wants to stick with inducements instead of requirements, using tax breaks and the prospect of a future trade in emissions credits to encourage industry and individuals to trim releases of the warming gases.
But in trying to minimize the costs, his critics said, Mr. Bush had settled on a strategy that would provide few results, saying that some limits on emissions would inevitably be necessary. 
By 2012, Mr. Bush said, his goal would be to nudge the curve of emissions down enough to save 500 million metric tons of carbon dioxide -- the equivalent "of taking 70 million cars off the road." 
Mr. Bush said he planned to promote this measured, voluntary means of dealing with climate change in visits to China, South Korea and Japan next week, saying that it was important to find a way to encourage developing countries to join rich ones in reducing the growth of the so-called greenhouse gases. 
Japan has strongly supported the Kyoto treaty, which was negotiated there in 1997. But Japanese officials have been eager for some sign of action in the United States before pursuing its ratification.
Mr. Bush said China, India and other large countries with fast-growing economies were already the dominant source of warming gases. "It would be irresponsible to absolve them from shouldering some of the shared obligations," he said. 
The United States remains the single largest producer of greenhouse emissions, generating about 20 percent of the global total. 
Another central element of his climate plan would be to expand a system created under his father's administration in which businesses would voluntarily report their emissions and be granted credits that could later prove valuable if an emissions trading system were adopted.
He only hinted at that prospect, though, saying that only after 2012 would there be an assessment of how the country was doing without concrete caps. 
On cleaning up power plants, though, Mr. Bush said a voluntary system would not do. In Bush's view power plant pollution poses a clear health risk, while the threat of global warming remains less certain. 
Echoing recent bipartisan proposals in Congress, he called for deep mandatory reductions in three kinds of pollutants from power plants -- sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury -- all of which contribute to health problems and harm the environment, but play no significant role in global warming. 
Proposing legislation that he has called "a new Clean Air Act for the 21st Century," Mr. Bush said that sulfur dioxide would drop 73 percent by 2018, nitrogen oxides, which spawn smog, would drop by 67 percent over the same span, and mercury by 69 percent.
He proposed a fundamental redesign of existing plant regulations, ending a jumble of individual restrictions on various compounds. As with other proposals evolving in Congress, his plan would allow industries to achieve reductions by trading emissions credits. 
Environmental groups and Democrats, including Al Gore, pounced on Mr. Bush's plans, saying they followed industry's dictates and would result in little or no improvement beyond existing laws and trends.
David Hawkins, the climate policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group, said the plans for climate and power plants mirrored the views of the Energy Department and companies that sell or use large amounts of coal, oil, and other fossil fuels -- the main source of carbon dioxide.
"Every number, every date, are the numbers and dates that they advocated," he said.
But others involved in the debate were more content. Kevin J. Fay, the executive director of the International Climate Change Partnership, which represents multinational manufacturers who support some climate controls, said Mr. Bush's proposal was a starting point for moving ahead with legislation and new environmental rules. "The most significant thing is that they now have entered the dialogue with a fairly well-rounded proposal," he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: JOURNALISTS; 
Suspect, Changing Story, Says American Reporter Is Dead

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
The chief suspect in the kidnapping of the American journalist Daniel Pearl said today that the reporter was dead, and that he had carried out the abduction three weeks ago "under my own free will."
 But the Pakistani authorities and Mr. Pearl's employer said afterward that they believed that he was still alive, and his wife issued a new plea for his release. 
 "As far as I understand, he's dead," the suspect, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, said of Mr. Pearl during a court hearing in Karachi, where he was ordered held until Feb. 25. 
His declaration was chilling for its bluntness, and transformed what had been a hopeful outlook in the case to one of some bleakness.
Only a day earlier, the police interrogators in Karachi said Mr. Sheikh, a Muslim militant who was born in Britain, had reported that Mr. Pearl, 38, was still alive. That optimism had been echoed in Washington by Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who is there for meetings with President Bush.
Because of the conflicting statements, a spokesman for Pakistan's government insisted today that he attached no particular credence to Mr. Sheikh's statement. "This gentlemen has been making several statements and changing those statements," said the spokesman, Aziz Ahmed Khan, an assistant foreign minister. "We cannot give any credence to any of these statements that he gives."
It has been more than two weeks since the authorities last received what they regarded as credible evidence that Mr. Pearl, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, was still alive. Not since Jan. 30, seven days after Mr. Pearl's disappearance, have the authorities received a photograph of him in captivity or any direct message from his kidnappers.
Pakistani officials said Mr. Sheikh was being interrogated by the Pakistani authorities and representatives of the F.B.I. 
A senior Pakistani intelligence officer with knowledge of the investigation quoted Mr. Sheikh tonight as saying: "The group had decided to move him around, and not everyone in the group knows what the other is doing. You'll understand that is the best way for us to act. I mean, if one guy getting caught means everyone getting caught, then we're not much of a liberation struggle, are we?"
The Pakistani intelligence officer said Mr. Sheikh was "running rings around the investigators."
In New York, a spokesman for The Wall Street Journal said today that the newspaper was confident that Mr. Pearl was still alive. Referring to the courtroom statement, Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Dow Jones, The Journal's parent company, said, "This is just part of the ebb and flow of this, but we continue to believe that Danny is alive and remain very hopeful."
Separately, Mr. Pearl's wife, Mariane, who is nearly seven months pregnant and is staying in Karachi, released a statement that said, in part: "My husband and I are looking forward to creating a family that will help make this world a better place through better dialogue and understanding between civilizations. From the bottom of my heart, I appeal to you to please release Danny and enable us to continue carrying out the path we have chosen to pursue."
At the court hearing in Karachi this morning, Mr. Sheikh acknowledged responsibility for the kidnapping of Mr. Pearl, who disappeared in Karachi on Jan. 23, after telling his wife that he was going to meet a Muslim militant.
Mr. Sheikh's statements in court seemed to surprise Pakistani officials. They noted that he had not been speaking under oath, but said they could think of no explanation for why he might lie about Mr. Pearl's death. Still, they cautioned, Mr. Sheikh is a hardened militant who has years of experience in deceiving investigators.
Mr. Sheikh, taken to court in an armored personnel carrier and surrounded by policemen carrying machine guns, told the court that the kidnapping had been his decision.
"Right or wrong, I had my reasons," he told the judge. "I think that our country shouldn't be catering to America's needs."
Demands for Mr. Pearl's release were made in two apparently legitimate, e-mail messages to news organizations. The messages centered on the repatriation of Pakistanis captured in Afghanistan, the legal rights of any Pakistanis detained in the United States and the return to Pakistani custody of Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan. 
A Pakistani businessman who heads a citizens' police liaison committee in Karachi said he could not discern whether Mr. Sheikh might be telling the truth now, in his public claims that Mr. Pearl was dead, or earlier, in his reported private statements that the reporter was alive. 
"He is such a shrewd person, it's difficult to understand him," said the businessman, Jamil Yusaf.
Mr. Sheikh, whose parents were born in Pakistan, was educated at the London School of Economics and is one of the leaders of Jaish-e-Muhammad, an extremist Islamic group. The organization was formed in 2000 by his onetime mentor, Massood Azhar, who along with him had been freed from an Indian jail into Afghanistan in a 1999 hostage-prisoner swap. Mr. Sheikh, who had been arrested in India in 1994 on a kidnapping charge, spent five years in jail on the charge, but was never tried.
In the current situation, some Pakistani officials said today that Mr. Sheikh's confession might have been intended as a signal to confederates, and while he had been identified as the prime suspect in the case, some are now speculating that he might have been working as a subordinate. 
Still, some of those Pakistani officials suggested that his apparent confession was intended in part as a warning to others that they should move swiftly to avoid capture.
As has been common throughout the case, the Pakistani authorities sent conflicting signals today about their investigation. Mr. Sheikh said in court today that he had been in custody since Feb. 5; in public statements, Pakistani officials have said he was not arrested until two days ago. Mr. Sheikh said he had surrendered himself because friends and relatives had been taken into custody; Pakistani officials would not address this claim.
In Washington today, General Musharraf said it was possible that the extremists who captured Mr. Pearl "thought they should try to destabilize me and my government." But in a speech to the National Press Club, he speculated that Mr. Pearl might have been "overintrusive in whatever he was doing" and "got really into the thick of these extremists." It was the first time he had raised the possibility that Mr. Pearl shared some responsibility for his kidnapping.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MILITANTS; 
Yemen Fears Being Singed by a Home-Grown Firebrand

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen, Feb. 8 

 BODY:
Not many people see Abdel Meguid al-Zindani these days. Since the rout of the Taliban in Afghanistan, when many Yemenis worried that they might be the next target for Western forces, the fiery Muslim cleric, a prominent and long-tolerated political force in Yemen, has stayed uncharacteristically out of the limelight.
 But Mr. Zindani's anti-Western and anti-Jewish diatribes can still be heard on cassette tapes of his speeches, sold all over the city. 
"Who is the terrorist and what is terrorism?" he demanded in a sermon recorded this month. "I think it applies to anyone who is against Western or American policy."
In his world view, a vast Jewish conspiracy is behind every event, including the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Like his old friend and student Osama bin Laden, he has divided the world into good Muslims and everybody else, saying that supporters of the American war in Afghanistan are infidels.
Mr. Zindani exemplifies the relationships forged in the last decade -- to mutual benefit -- between religious radicals and Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. 
While those ties have been strained since Sept. 11, as President Saleh and Islamic leaders have been forced to review their political calculations, there is little indication that they will be broken.
Although he has dropped from sight, Mr. Zindani, a striking man with a long beard dyed red with henna, a symbol of piety, remains influential. He is the director of a government-supported religious university and head of the central committee of the second-biggest political party, Islah.
Mr. Saleh has long tolerated the presence of militantly anti-Western groups in Yemen, as long as they did not threaten his own outwardly secular government.
Now the Bush administration is pressing Mr. Saleh to disable religious extremist groups that could threaten Western interests -- or risk being seen as a leader who is incapable of fighting terrorism without American intervention.
"I think President Saleh is slowly beginning to realize that some of his ideas need to change, that he doesn't need to stick out as the one who always takes a different stand in regional affairs," said Walid Abdul aziz al-Saqqaf, editor of The Yemen Times in Sana. "He doesn't want Yemen to be another Afghanistan."
In the 1990's Yemen became a magnet for an assortment of self-styled Muslim holy warriors, veterans of the Afghan war against the Soviets, who ultimately took up arms on behalf of Mr. Saleh at critical times during his presidency.
While other Arab leaders banned or curtailed Muslim fundamentalist movements, Mr. Saleh helped Islamist politicians like Mr. Zindani build a power base in Yemeni schools and mosques.
So far, Mr. Saleh has avoided a direct confrontation with home-grown fundamentalists like Mr. Zindani, focusing instead on foreigners with no local patrons to protect them.
More than 100 foreign teachers and students without the proper visas have been rounded up and deported from private religious institutions like the Dar al-Hadith schools, founded by a firebrand cleric named Sheik Muqbel bin Hadi al-Wadi.
The sheik, who died last summer, attracted a devoted underground following in Europe and the Indian Subcontinent with his tirades against Christians and Jews. Among his more notorious students was John Walker Lindh, the American captured with Taliban fighters in Afghanistan.
Western intelligence officials say Mr. Lindh was one of many graduates who went from Sheik Wadi's classrooms to Mr. bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan.
Foreign students at Mr. Zindani's school, Al Iman University in Sana, have also been targeted. The university, long considered by Western officials to be a factory for producing Islamic extremists, has attracted hundreds of non-Yemeni students to its courses in Islamic law, economics and science.
The university was built with help from Mr. Saleh's government, private donors in the Persian Gulf region and Turkey's now-banned Welfare Party. Living stipends for the students were cut after Sept. 11, according to one student. Mr. Zindani has abruptly changed his flamboyant ways and now rarely meets with students.
Whether Mr. Saleh will move beyond highly publicized arrests of foreigners to a frontal assault on such schools is unclear.
"This is not the first time the political security police have picked up foreigners at these places," said a Western diplomat in Sana. "They knew these places were recruiting grounds and they let them operate for years. The only difference now is the crackdown is a little harder."
The president's handling of Mr. Zindani, who is popular and enjoys protection from a powerful tribal chieftain, Sheik Abdullah al-Ahmar, head of the Islah Party, may offer clues to Yemen's future ties with the United States.
In the past Mr. Zindani has declared that Yemen should never cooperate with the United States in investigating attacks or rounding up terrorists, and also opposed the extradition of Egyptian terrorism suspects. In recent speeches he denied that Mr. bin Laden, whom he has known since the 1970's, was responsible for "so-called terrorism."
But Mr. Zindani has also been careful not to oppose Mr. Saleh's government directly.
"At his school they don't openly advocate violence, but they create a culture of hatred of others," said Abdul Karim Iryani, a former Yemeni prime minister who has had many run-ins with Mr. Zindani. "There is no reason to go into direct confrontation with him. He is not in revolt against the government."
Indeed, Mr. Zindani gained a spot on President Saleh's advisory council after lending him the backing of armed foreign militants when South Yemen forces tried to secede in 1994.
The president tolerated and even steered government funds to Islah's parallel religious school system, although he now apparently sees the schools as a political threat.
Yemenis who attended or sent their children to the Islah schools said the students were instructed that the only real Muslims were those who followed Mr. Zindani's teachings.
Last year the president accused Islah of using the schools to campaign for its own candidates in bitterly contested municipal elections. The government then pushed through a bill in Parliament to merge the 1,300 Islah schools, with their 400,000 students, into the public school system, a process that will start with the next school year.

HEADLINE: HOUSE BACKS BROAD CHANGE IN FINANCING OF CAMPAIGNS; FAST SENATE ACTION SOUGHT 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
The House early today approved a broad overhaul of the way campaigns are financed, and Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, swiftly promised to do all he could to speed the bill to the president, putting the nation's political system at the brink of sweeping change.
 The 240-to-189 vote, at 2:43 a.m., capped a seven-year effort to ban the large unlimited donations to political parties known as soft money. Such donations grew to nearly $500 million in the 2000 election. The bill's sponsors, Representatives Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, fought back a near-17-hour barrage of rival bills and amendments that Republican leaders had hoped would derail the legislation. 
 Forty-one Republicans broke with their party and joined all but 12 Democrats to back the Shays-Meehan bill in a week in which hearings on the Enron collapse kept the issue of special-interest access to politicians center stage. 
The attention quickly shifted today to the Senate, which passed almost identical legislation last April. Mr. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said he planned to bring the House version of the bill directly to the Senate floor for final passage rather than go to a conference committee to resolve minor differences.
"Today, because of what the House has done," he said, "we have the first real chance in a generation to limit the access of special interests in the political process." 
He added, "This is the year we're finally going to pass campaign finance reform."
The White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, again hedged on whether Mr. Bush would sign the bill, noting that the Senate had not yet taken final action. "I think it's a little early to get declarative," Mr. Fleischer said, "but the president has sent a very clear signal to the Congress that he wants to sign something that improves the system." Other advisers to Mr. Bush said they expected him to sign the bill.
But Mr. Daschle's first effort today to get the Senate to agree to scheduling a four-hour debate on the House bill failed. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who has opposed the campaign finance legislation, said he wanted time to read the House bill. 
Mr. McConnell has threatened in the past to tie up the Senate floor to force the legislation into a negotiating conference. Today he said he would decide what to do over the one-week Congressional recess. "There are parts I like, parts I don't like, parts that I think will be knocked out in court," he said at a news conference.
But for one moment on the Senate floor, he paid surprisingly affectionate tribute to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, the bill's chief Senate sponsor, with whom Mr. McConnell has been tangling for seven years over the issue. 
"I don't know whether we're going to end up having these annual dances that we've had over the last decade or not," he said. "If it ends up we don't have these anymore in the future, I'll sort of miss them in a perverse sort of way."
Mr. McCain, laughing, said, "I may not miss it at all."
The Senate supporters of campaign finance overhaul are trying to bring the House bill directly to the floor because they fear the measure will die if it goes into a House-Senate conference committee to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate measures.
Other controversial bills have often languished in such committees. But an opponent of the House bill could try to stop the Senate from considering it through a filibuster. 
It takes 60 votes in the Senate to bring legislation to a vote, should someone filibuster, and the campaign bill passed last April with only 59 votes. Still, Mr. Daschle insisted that a filibuster would not succeed.
"We know there are still some in the Senate who think they may still have a chance to keep this bill from becoming law," he said today. "And we say to them, 'Look what happened in the House.' Opponents in the House used every conceivable argument and excuse, every imaginable ploy. They failed, and so will you."
He said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who had opposed the bill, had agreed he would vote against a filibuster, providing the 60th vote. But for the first time, Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican, said he no longer supported the bill -- leaving the outcome of a filibuster again uncertain.
In banning soft money, the legislation sponsored by Mr. Shays and Mr. Meehan would force the parties to rely on smaller, more closely regulated donations. It would also impose new rules on advertising by outside groups, 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election.
In exchange for the soft money ban, the measure would allow some new fund-raising. It would give donors the right to make contributions of up to $10,000 to state political parties for get-out-the-vote drives. It would increase to $2,000 from $1,000 per election the longstanding limit on how much an individual donor can give to federal candidates.
The supporters of overhauling the campaign law say the bill will reduce the power of special interests and combat public cynicism. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said today that the measure would stop politics from being about "consummate fund-raisers for large TV advertising campaigns."
The bill's many Republican opponents say the measure violates free speech rights and will put their party at a disadvantage. Mr. McConnell criticized the bill today for trying to stop outside groups "from saying bad things about us in proximity to an election." He said he would challenge the constitutionality of the advertising restrictions in court if the measure makes it into law. 
It will take some time to judge just how profoundly the measure could change politics. It would not go into effect until after the hotly contested 2002 elections. The parties also raise large amounts of the more regulated donations that go to candidates, known as hard money, and many students of the campaign finance law say that new ways will be found for money to seep into politics. 
For years, the campaign overhaul bill died in Republican-run filibusters in the Senate. But Mr. McCain then put the measure at the center of his surprisingly potent maverick bid for the presidency in 2000, and a year later the Senate passed the bill.
An attempt to follow up swiftly in the House collapsed last summer, when the bill's proponents voted against the rules for debate set by the House Republican leadership, charging they were rigged to cause defeat. Republicans countered that the proponents lacked the votes to win and used the rules as an excuse. Mr. Hastert refused to set a new vote, and it took a six-month petition drive by supporters to force the bill back onto the House floor.
Yet for all the uncertainty about who would win, in the end, across two days of debate, Mr. Shays and Mr. Meehan withstood a Republican counterattack. They defeated two rival bills, as well as 10 attempts by Republicans to change their bill enough that it would have to be sent to a conference committee. Republican leaders acknowledged that they could not crack the voting bloc assembled by the sponsors.
The advocates for change attributed their success to several factors. They said Mr. McCain's maverick presidential run gave their issue new prominence that pushed it in the Senate. The Enron scandal helped resuscitate the measure in the House. Both sides said the fact that the bill passed the House twice before, in 1998 and 1999, affected the House outcome. Republicans, with second thoughts and pressured by their leaders, had to remember that they had a record on the bill and that they would have to explain any change. 
In the end, 31 of the 43 Republicans who had voted for the measure in the past years did so again -- despite the House leadership. 
House Democratic leaders also worked hard for passage, assuaging many black Democrats who had feared that the end of soft money would mean the Democratic Party would no longer run minority registration and get-out-the-vote drives. Some of their objections were answered when the bill was altered to allow state parties to take donations of up to $10,000 from individuals, strictly for get-out-the-vote drives. 
The only amendment to pass, unexpectedly, on Wednesday was one striking from the bill special transition provisions for the Democratic National Committee, which has been planning to build a new Washington headquarters with soft money.
Terry McAuliffe, the party chairman, said lawyers were looking at how to proceed. The bill would take effect on Nov. 6 -- a day after the 2002 elections. "I think we're just going to have to write one $25 million check," he said, "and count on the developers to bring it in on budget and on time."
This morning after just a few hours sleep, Republicans and Democrats who had transcended the Capitol's usual partisanship to push the overhaul of the campaign laws forward were almost giddy.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Rethinking The Rites Of Recycling

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
ENVIRONMENTALISTS may not like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to suspend the recycling of cans and bottles. But it could be their best chance to save their reputations and do some good for the environment.
 The recycling program was sold to New Yorkers nearly a decade ago with the promise that it would save money. It did not. If New York had instead shipped all those recyclables to out-of-state landfills, the city would have saved more than half a billion dollars, and that figure doesn't even include the biggest costs, which are the labor and storage space that citizens are forced to donate to the cause. 
 Recycling newspapers makes a certain amount of sense, because used newsprint often has economic value and people often have special bins for their newspapers anyway. But why clutter the city with bins for stuff that's less than worthless? The city pays extra to collect and dispose of the bottles and cans, and then 40 percent of the stuff ends up in landfills anyway.
Could this sort of recycling ever pay for itself, as environmentalists are still promising? Maybe, but only if its devotees abandon their passion for hand-sorted trash and their belief that we're running out of natural resources. They've expected recycling to become profitable as raw materials become more expensive, but they're on the wrong side of two historical trends. For thousands of years, the costs of natural resources have been falling in relation to the cost of labor. 
Recycling might someday pay if the sorting were done not by hand but by machines. Miners and oil drillers have used computerized technology to extract small concentrations of materials that would once have been unprofitable. Maybe robots will one day profitably sift garbage for minerals and plastics.
But many environmentalists don't like this vision. In some cities, they've fought plans to use automated sorting equipment because they wanted people to have the hands-on experience. Here in New York, one of the most expensive labor forces on the planet is being forced to sort materials that third world peasants wouldn't waste their time saving. 
Recycling has become a sacrament of atonement for buying too much stuff -- for secretly loving stuff too much, as James B. Twitchell explains in "Lead Us Into Temptation," a study of consumer passions. "While we claim to be wedded to responsible consumption," he writes, "we spend a lot of our time philandering. Trash is lipstick on the collar, the telltale blond hair." Recycling is our way of saying, "I'm sorry, honey."
Sinners have every right to repent, but in this country religious sacraments are not supposed to be legally mandated or publicly subsidized. Recycling bottles and cans next year would cost taxpayers more than $50 million. Why don't its devotees find another ritual of atonement that might help the environment and save the city money? 
SUPPOSE that all the time and money spent exhorting children and adults to recycle were spent instead urging each New Yorker to pick up one piece of litter each day. Millions of pieces of trash would disappear; street-cleaning bills would plummet. 
Perhaps guilty consumers could get used to paying for their sins with cash. Environmentalists could urge the end of free trash collection. If people had to pay for each can of trash they produced, they'd find ways to reduce waste, and the city budget would benefit.
Or suppose environmentalists channeled their zeal for recycling into another political cause: putting tolls on the East River bridges. These tolls would have economic virtues (more on that in another column), while also reducing air pollution and fuel consumption by easing traffic congestion. The recycling program, by contrast, increases local air pollution and fuel consumption by putting extra trucks on the roads to collect bottles and cans.
Could the act of paying a toll be turned into a sacrament? Could children and adults be trained to regard the toll as penance for the extravagance of owning a gas-guzzling, polluting machine? 
Some recycling devotees might not be satisfied. Paying a toll on the East River bridges might seem too simple, too antiseptic, too easy by comparison with the mortification of sorting garbage. For these ascetics, maybe the best ritual would be for them to get out of their cars altogether and walk across the bridges, possibly on their knees. For extra penance, these pilgrims could carry sacks filled with old bottles and cans.

HEADLINE: Realism in Cutting Emissions 

BYLINE:  By R. Glenn Hubbard; R. Glenn Hubbard is chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The climate policy President Bush announced yesterday sets out a better and far more workable approach for measuring progress against global warming than the one in the Kyoto framework he rejected last spring. The president set the goal of an 18 percent reduction over the next 10 years in greenhouse gas intensity -- the ratio of emissions to economic activity -- rather than an arbitrary goal for curbs on total emissions. And he announced steps to get there.
 This emphasis not only removes a large part of the economic risk associated with goals based on a fixed emission limit, but gives American industries a target, similar to a goal for productivity or efficiency, that they can shoot for in practical ways. Because it is realistic and workable, it is likely to move us, at last, beyond arguments at the extremes and toward real action against climate change. 
 For most of the past century, economic growth, energy use and emissions of carbon dioxide -- the dominant greenhouse gas -- have been linked. In this setting, a fixed emission limit harms the economy. Until we invent and commercialize new technologies to generate electricity and provide transportation -- as the president's science and technology initiatives encourage -- a fixed emission limit eventually means lowering economic growth. In fact, as Russia demonstrated in the past decade, the surest way to experience emissions declines is to go through an economic collapse.
By tying goals to economic activity, the president's policy encourages a flexible response but does not take economic risks.
The goal of his plan is both serious and meaningful: an 18 percent decline in greenhouse gas intensity over 10 years implies a 4.5 percent reduction by 2012 in annual greenhouse gas emissions, relative to what they would be if we moved ahead according to current forecasts. Meeting this goal will require real reductions: faster adoption of energy-saving technologies; improved recovery of methane that currently escapes from coal mines, gas pipelines and landfills; and programs to improve forestry and agriculture so they absorb more carbon dioxide. These are reasonable steps that require a level of effort the administration believes is warranted, given the current state of climate science.
Yet many of these reductions are not easily encouraged in traditional ways. An economist's first choice for lowering industrial pollution is usually a cap-and-trade program. Companies are required to measure their emissions in tons and obtain an equal number of emission allowances, which can then be traded with other companies. This encourages the least expensive reductions. President Bush has proposed such a system to control sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions from power plants. But applying this concept to greenhouse gases would be premature and would risk unnecessarily high costs. The methane and carbon storage options that are among the most practical means now to reduce greenhouse gases cannot easily be measured for trading.
Instead, the president has challenged businesses to figure out innovative ways to measure and record their reductions. And he has promised them that not only would their investments in emissions reductions today be protected from future policy decisions, but the credits generated by these investments could be traded.
For too long, the loudest voices in the climate change debate have either called for large emission reductions in the next 10 years or ignored the fact that climate change is a real risk. President Bush's plan makes sense: focus on a reasonable approach to slow, stop and then reverse growth in greenhouse gas emissions; don't wreck the economy in the process; and adjust future policy in response to scientific and technical progress. He has added a fresh, reasoned voice to the debate.

HEADLINE: Disney's Chief Seems Cool on a Hot Seat 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON with BILL CARTER 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
When Michael D. Eisner, the longtime chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, takes the stage at the company's annual shareholder meeting in Hartford, Conn., on Tuesday, he is going to have a lot of explaining to do.
 Ratings have plummeted 21 percent this season among total viewers at the ABC television network, putting ABC in third place. ABC Entertainment has replaced a handful of senior executives in recent years. And Disney's stock price has underperformed not only the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the last five years but also the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq. 
 That has left many people to wonder how quickly Mr. Eisner can turn around the ailing Disney. Since Jan. 1, 2001, its stock price has also lagged that of peers like Viacom. On a brighter note, it has outperformed AOL Time Warner, although that company went through a recent merger.
Already there is talk that Disney is a takeover candidate, a notion that Mr. Eisner dismisses. And Robert A. Iger, Disney's president, who is responsible for the company's day-to-day operations, is personally overseeing the fall season lineup at the ABC network. "Disney is in a transition mode," said Jill Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
In a telephone interview today from his offices in Burbank, Calif., Mr. Eisner listed a number of accomplishments, despite the lagging share price, that he will point out to investors on Tuesday: the successful merger with Capital Cities/ABC, the success of Radio Disney, two new theme parks and the acquisition of a host of cable channels.
"Are we better off? Yes," Mr. Eisner said. "Are we richer? No."
Still, friends and colleagues who have talked to him recently, say that for the first time in a long time, Mr. Eisner is on the defensive. "He is under so much pressure right now," said one industry executive who insisted on not being identified. A former Disney executive who knows Mr. Eisner said, "This is the first time that some people are saying perhaps Michael is the wrong guy."
Some of Disney's problems are beyond Mr. Eisner's control. All media companies are suffering from a widespread advertising slump because of the recession. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 continue to wreak havoc on park attendance, particularly among foreigners.
Analysts were encouraged by recent quarterly earnings that were higher than expected. And on Tuesday Disney film studios received 24 Oscar nominations. Disney needs to ride out its problems "without getting beaten up in the process," said Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein.
Mr. Eisner, for his part, said he felt no urgency. "I don't feel any pressure at all," he said.
The company's after-tax cash flow from operations -- a measure of how much money the company has to spend -- has risen since 1998, although analysts say that in the current fiscal year it will be less than in 2001. 
"Maybe Bob and I are living in some ivory tower where we don't hear the body language of the community," he said.
What Mr. Eisner has heard all too much of lately is how badly ABC is doing. In the six years since Disney acquired Capital Cities/ABC, concerns about ratings have arisen frequently. The culprit behind ABC's recent decline in prime time was the same show that almost single-handedly led the network to ratings pre-eminence two years ago: "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." The show's ratings collapsed only one season after ABC showed so much faith in the game show that it broadcast it four times weekly. The show initially helped increase Disney's profits, generating, by some estimates, $1 billion for the company.
But its falloff only worsened a longstanding problem at ABC: too many seasons with too few hits. Cutting back on the budget for developing new shows -- a decision that was made because management thought that "Millionaire" would be filling many hours a week for a long time -- proved flawed.
"That was silly," said Susan Lyne, the new president of the entertainment division. "We should have put more money into developing shows. The issue for us is why we didn't take better advantage of that period to launch more scripted programs."
Analysts agree that the network could turn itself around quickly if it had a couple of hit shows. Mr. Iger is overseeing that process. "Michael and I have decided that ABC is our No. 1 priority, and we decided that my time would best be spent focusing on ABC," Mr. Iger said in a telephone interview today. Of rumors that he has a limited time to succeed or lose his job, Mr. Iger said, "That's completely absurd."
Yet executives and television producers who are working on the fall lineup said the focus by top management was causing some angst in the entertainment division.
One Disney executive who insisted on anonymity referred to a recent article in Fortune magazine in which Mr. Eisner was quoted as saying that if he could spend a couple of hours a day at ABC, he could make it the No. 1 network in two years. "When the people working there hear that," the executive said, "it takes their heart and breath away."
When asked about the reaction to the quotation, Mr. Eisner seemed appalled. Recalling younger years, he said, "My view is when my boss got involved it was the greatest thing in the world." Such involvement showed, he said, that the boss cared.
Still, Disney executives are tentative about committing themselves to their own projects.
"This is the mystery of it all," one television producer said. "No one at Disney has any interest in being the champion of a project right now. They don't want to be on the plank."
Two of ABC's top executives disagree.
"I have nothing but positive things to say about Bob's role," said Lloyd Braun, the chairman of ABC Entertainment. "He's been really supportive and a great resource for us." Ms. Lyne said Mr. Iger sent e-mail messages to her but did not participate in the division's day-to-day decisions.
"We really talk over the process," she said. "We have a big uphill battle here, so the more smart opinions we can get from people we respect the better off we are."
Several Wall Street analysts say that if the stock price does not rebound in the next two years, Disney will be ripe for a hostile takeover. But people close to the Disney directors say Mr. Eisner has their support. Analysts and investors have criticized the board as unwilling to challenge Mr. Eisner.
Some industry executives have suggested that if federal regulatory strictures loosen, Microsoft might be interested in Disney. Others say that Brian L. Roberts, the president of Comcast, could turn toward Disney after his company has finished its takeover of AT&T Broadband. 
"We are not concerned about that," Mr. Eisner said. "It is not on our agenda."

HEADLINE: Personal Touches to Highlight Bush's Asian Visit Next Week 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
President Bush will speak to American troops in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea next week during a three-nation, six-day trip to Asia and will appear live on television in China during a question-and-answer session with students at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
 The trip, which begins Saturday and includes two days in Japan, will be the president's first chance to hear directly from nations in Asia that have been alarmed by Mr. Bush's reference to Iraq, Iran and North Korea as an "axis of evil." 
 It will also be a test of whether Mr. Bush's tough talk has helped or hurt his policy goals in Asia, and of how much he can reassure the South Koreans, who worry that his words will lead to further tensions with the North. 
Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security adviser, said in a briefing for reporters today, "The president sees absolutely no contradiction between calling the North Korean regime precisely what it is, a secretive and repressive regime that is trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction," and "really very intensive efforts by the South Korean president to try to open up an avenue for North Korea to come across, to get out of its bad behavior and to seek reconciliation with the South."
Officials and foreign policy experts say China may be as difficult for the president as Seoul. 
In Beijing, Mr. Bush will seek to stabilize a fragile, wary relationship and assure the Chinese that his planned missile defense system is not aimed at neutralizing them, even though many in his administration say it should be.
"Missile defense is a problem for China in the sense that it symbolizes a hostile attitude toward China, whether it works or not," said Bates Gill, a China analyst at the Brookings Institution.
Ms. Rice, in a preview of the administration's position, said: "The president has always said that our missile defense program is defensive in nature, it is not aimed at anybody, it is not intended to give the United States unilateral advantage. 
"That's the message he will take to the Chinese, and we're happy to have that discussion."
Although China's state-controlled media have sharply criticized Mr. Bush for his "axis of evil" remark in his State of the Union address, its leaders have been less vocal. 
Ms. Rice said Mr. Bush did not have plans to meet separately with Hu Jintao, the man expected to take over from Jiang Zemin as China's leader next year. 
But she said Mr. Bush might see Mr. Hu at a large group meeting, as he did last fall in Shanghai during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
In Japan Mr. Bush faces a different set of problems, although few are likely to be aired publicly. The president will publicly embrace Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi for what Mr. Bush will cite as his economic reforms, even though members of the administration are increasingly concerned about a possible collapse of Japan's banking system and Mr. Koiziumi's political survival.
"The United States is facing a Koizumi who has become the Arafat of economic policy," said Adam Posen, a Japan analyst at the Institute for International Economics, in a comparison to the embattled Palestinian leader. Mr. Posen said Mr. Koizumi had not shown signs of being able to halt the downward spiral of Japan's economy.
Ms. Rice's preview of the visit to Japan was more diplomatic. "The president is going to talk with the Japanese prime minister about the importance of getting the Japanese economy going again," she said. "He will also talk about U.S. responsibility to get the American economy going again."
Much of the trip will have personal resonance for Mr. Bush, who rarely traveled overseas before becoming president.
His visit to Beijing will be his first since 1975, when he spent six weeks as a recent Harvard M.B.A. visiting his mother and father, who was then ambassador to China. Mr. Bush wrote in his 1999 campaign biography that he was bored and depressed by a nation where all the bicycles looked the same, and that he was eager to return to the United States.
The president will be accompanied on the trip by his wife, Laura.
In Tokyo, the couple are to visit the Meiji Jingu, the national Shinto shrine. They will also have dinner with Mr. Koiziumi and his wife at a Tokyo restaurant and have lunch with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace.


CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 15 about President Bush's trip to Asia later in the month referred incorrectly to the scheduled dinner companions for Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, at a Tokyo restaurant. The host, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, was not with his wife. He is divorced.

HEADLINE: Europeans Give Bush Plan on Climate Change a Tepid Reception 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 14 

 BODY:
Saying that any action taken to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases was at least a step in the right direction, the European Union gave a tepid welcome today to President Bush's new proposals to tackle climate change.
 The Bush proposals, which are strictly voluntary, would rely on tax credits to coax big business to pollute less. As word of the proposals began to filter out, many environmentalists and political commentators in Europe said that Mr. Bush's plan was far too little, too late, and would not improve his image abroad as a servant of the oil industry. 
 The most outspoken reaction came from France, where the head of an intergovernmental task force on global warming calling the proposals "window dressing."
The expert, Philippe Meunier, said that although it was hard to judge the new plan before knowing its details, "the total volunteerism approach makes us worry."
"It lacks credibility," Mr. Meunier added. "We worry that without sanctions it just won't work." 
He asserted that while the plan was a step in the right direction, it showed that the United States sought change "at no cost and in a way that would not in any way challenge the American lifestyle and especially its consumption." 
Echoing the concerns of most other specialists reacting today, Mr. Meunier evoked the Kyoto Protocol, the widely accepted treaty that would require emissions cuts by 2010 to well below their 1990 levels.
The Bush plan might "destabilize" support for the Kyoto pact, which is awaiting ratification. 
As Mr. Meunier put it, "You may have countries that say, why should we who are poorer do anything?"
The Bush administration's rejection of the protocol last March caused an outcry in Europe and came to be seen here as another example of America's refusal to limit its options in almost any sphere. 
When he rejected the treaty, Mr. Bush called its targets arbitrary, its schedule too costly to meet and its terms unfair.
Nonetheless, no other country has chosen to abandon it. 
The voluntary measures in the plan Mr. Bush unveiled today would, if followed, slow but not halt the growth in emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. It would use $4.6 billion in tax credits over the next five years to encourage companies and individuals to limit those emissions. 
In Brussels, a European Commission spokeswoman, Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen, said, "We feel that the multilateral approach is the best way to face up to this tremendous challenge." She said that the European Union still hoped the United States would return to the Kyoto pact.
In Britain, Chris Hewett of the Institute for Public Policy Research, added his voice to criticism of the plan as not enough. He said Britain had proved "that you can cut emissions and still have a healthy economy," adding that there was no "inextricable link" between carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth.
Some green groups said they were suspicious of the timing of the White House announcement, just days before Mr. Bush is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in Japan.
Japan has so far remained committed to the Kyoto pact, but it has made no secret of the fact that it will have difficulty meeting its targets.
Hiroshi Oki, the new Japanese environment minister, said it would be best for the United States to return to the the protocol. 
But, he said that "our joint efforts" must not be halted by disagreement on that point. 
The only real praise for the Bush administration had nothing to do with the environmental proposal. 
In Germany, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and a member of the government's advisory council, made a point of citing a second American plan announced today, one that affects emissions but not global warming. He hailed Mr. Bush's call for mandatory restrictions on three power plant pollutants -- mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides -- as "a great air pollution policy."
"A wonderful policy," Mr. Schellnhuber added. "But the wrong target."

HEADLINE: In a Big Switch, Barrick to Sell Some Gold on Spot Market 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
The Barrick Gold Corporation said today that it planned to sell half of its 2002 gold production on the spot market -- the first time in 14 years that it has not hedged, or locked in prices in advance, on all its output. 
 A spirited debate has raged in the industry for a decade over the wisdom of hedging, and Barrick's new policy is an important change of direction for a major producer. 
 "It sends a significant message to the market," said Hester le Roux, director of Gold Fields Mineral Services, a consultancy based in London. 
Barrick, which has the highest market value of any gold mining company, has been the leading voice on the more cautious pro-hedging side, arguing that forward sales contracts, options and other techniques protect the company's future profits in the face of an uncertain gold price. 
Barrick, which is based in Toronto, earned an average of $317 an ounce for its gold last year, well above the average spot price of $271 an ounce.
On the other side, producers like the Newmont Mining Corporation say that hedging amounts to a bet against their product, limiting the possible profits as well as the possible losses, and making gold stocks less attractive to investors.
Newmont has used its no-hedging policy to present itself as a clear alternative for investors who want maximum exposure to the gold price. Newmont is in the process of completing the acquisition of Normandy Mining Ltd. of Australia, which will make it the world's largest gold producer, with an annual output of 8.2 million ounces.
Reporting Barrick's fourth-quarter earnings today, Randall Oliphant, the chief executive, said, "We recognize that our shareholders like to see our earnings go up or down as the gold price goes up or down."
The gold price has risen sharply in recent weeks, closing at $298.90 an ounce today, up from $273 in mid-December. Ms. Le Roux said that the price of gold had risen because of the nervousness of investors about American stocks in the wake of the Enron scandal and because of Japanese savers' nervousness about the soundness of that country's banks. 
John Bridges, a metals analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York, said the prospect of a falling supply of gold had also buoyed prices. After a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry, "a lot of mining companies no longer feel the pressure to produce marginal gold," Mr. Bridges said.
Mr. Oliphant said Barrick's decision to do less hedging had also been prompted by the company's healthy cash position and a fall in its capital spending. On top of that, he said, low interest rates have made hedging less attractive.
AngloGold Ltd. of South Africa, another supporter of hedging, indicated earlier this month that it, too, would make more use of the spot market. Gold Fields Mineral Services has estimated that in all, producers hedged 100 fewer metric tons of gold last year than they did in 2000. 
Barrick reported net earnings of $96 million, or 18 cents a share, for 2001; it lost $94 million in the fourth quarter because of $149 million in one-time charges.

HEADLINE: Trying to Divide New York Arts Aid More Evenly 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
In her first public remarks since being named the city's commissioner of cultural affairs, Kate D. Levin said yesterday that she hoped to restructure her agency's budget to allow more flexibility in its giving, including the ability to shift more money to some of the city's less-well-known cultural organizations.
 In particular, Ms. Levin said, she had noted that under the current budget, 85 percent of the city's arts financing is given to the Cultural Institutions Group, a group of 35 prominent cultural institutions, while the rest of the city's arts groups are left to apply for remaining 15 percent. 
 "It is increasingly clear to me that there are some basic structural issues that need to be addressed more comprehensively," Ms. Levin said, adding that it was awkward to have "so little flexibility to deal with emergent needs, aesthetic or otherwise."
While Ms. Levin voiced support for the institutions group, which includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, she said she believed that her agency could do more for so-called program groups, those outside the institutions group. "It troubles me that there is a kind of second-class citizenship status," she said, adding that the current budget policy had made the city an inconsistent partner for some nonprofit companies outside the Cultural Institutions Group.
Ms. Levin's remarks came at the start of a daylong conference at Columbia University, "Who Pays for the Arts?," which focused on the future of city financing for the arts.
Some of those issues were outlined in a study released at the conference that looked at support of the arts in the late 1990's, and showed that government support had slowed significantly even before the attack on the World Trade Center.
For example, the report, based on data from 575 of the city's nonprofit cultural institutions, showed that small organizations' income decreased 12 percent from 1995 to 1999.
Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, which released the study, said those declines for small institutions, coupled with the continued effects of Sept. 11 and the recession, "could diminish New York's pre-eminence as a cultural center," unless action is taken.
That response will fall in part to Ms. Levin, an assistant professor of English and theater at City College of the City University of New York, who was named commissioner of cultural affairs last month by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
Ms. Levin succeeded Schuyler G. Chapin just as the mayor announced a shoestring city budget, including a 15 percent cut in the budget of the Department of Cultural Affairs.
Ms. Levin also outlined several other goals, including more affordable space for artists, better marketing for the arts and an effort to compile hard statistics on the positive economic impact of the city's cultural institutions.
"I think the dialogue has been hamstrung in the past by a tendency to be anecdotal, to talk about your conversion experience and how arts changed your life," Ms. Levin said. "But that doesn't really cut it when you have to numerically line up budget items."
Those that attended the conference, which was sponsored by the Alliance for the Arts and National Arts Journalism Program, seemed to embrace Ms. Levin's approach to her job, though the concept of city budget cuts was daunting.
"For some of us, a retrenchment of 10 percent is going to zero," said Patricia Diaz, the executive director of Aaron Davis Hall. "We're talking about tightening the belt around a skeleton."

HEADLINE: Two Economic Reports Indicate Recovery Could Be a Slow One 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell this month, and industrial production declined in January, evidence that the economy may be slow in gaining strength.
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for February fell to 90.9 from 93 last month, and analysts attributed the drop to worries that the Enron Corporation is not the only company to have issued misleading financial reports. 
 The Federal Reserve's index of industrial production by factories, mines and utilities declined 0.1 percent in January, the 15th drop in 16 months. 
Neither decline will doom the rebound, propelled by the fastest pace of inventory reduction on record and an unflagging willingness by consumers to keep spending.
"We're inching closer and closer to the end of the recession, but it's going to be a slow recovery back," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York.
The Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent in January, the Labor Department reported. It was the first increase in four months and was led by the biggest rise in food costs in almost a year. Excluding food and energy, the index fell 0.1 percent after no change in December. Producer prices were 2.6 percent lower than in January 2001, the biggest 12-month drop since February 1950.
Also, the capacity-utilization rate fell to 74.2 percent last month from 74.4 in December. January's reading is the lowest since April 1983.
While consumer confidence slipped, it was the first decline in five months, and the January reading of 93 was the highest in a year. The current conditions index, which reflects the financial perceptions of Americans and their willingness to spend on furniture and home appliances, rose to 97.2 from 95.7. The expectations index, based on optimism about the next one to five years, fell to 86.8 from 91.3.
"We're seeing a pause among consumers, but it's not near the pullback we thought," said James Glassman, chief United States economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York. "What we're seeing is a little worry about the stock market and Enron and all this talk about accounting problems. It's natural that people are going to say they're anxious."

HEADLINE: Some Affected by 9/11 Are Hard to Reach 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
A day after three major charities announced a last-minute extension for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack to apply for emergency cash grants, charitable organizations and social service agencies scrambled yesterday to get the word out to a group that has probably received the least, and most contradictory, information to date: non-English-speaking immigrants.
 But even with a two-week postponement of the deadline to March 8, some groups believe that logistically it is still too difficult to contact the tens of thousands of people in Lower Manhattan who have not applied. As a result, some groups said yesterday that they still thought the deadline was arbitrary and hasty, and therefore should be waived altogether. 
 Together, the three charities -- the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and Safe Horizon -- have disbursed more than $250 million in emergency assistance to 50,000 displaced workers and other individuals who lost income because of the attack. And on Feb. 8, the charities established a Feb. 22 cutoff date for applicants to make appointments, saying that it was time to shift attention from emergency assistance to long-term help.
On Thursday, though, the charities decided to postpone the deadline, in part because of concerns that some people were still unaware of the deadlines, or even of the programs. And yesterday, the Sept. 11 Fund -- which has been the primary source of money for Safe Horizon and has provided another $70 million in assistance to displaced workers -- held a press conference to reach out to the ethnic press and emphasize that noncitizens, too, are eligible for assistance, regardless of their status.
Immigrant advocacy groups said that while they were pleased by the extension, they were still concerned that immigrants would be reluctant to apply by March 8 because of linguistic and cultural barriers.
"What we're hearing from community groups is that they are still reaching people every day who are unaware of the benefit programs and the eligibility requirements," said Margie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. "So it's a slow process both to get the correct information, identify people who are eligible and arrange times for them to go to the centers."
While each charity has established its own eligibility criteria, the basic requirements have included anyone who worked below Canal Street, lost a significant portion of income or has been unemployed any time between Sept. 11 and either Dec. 31 or Jan. 11.
Business entities, by contrast, have no deadline, and in fact are eligible for assistance from additional sources, including the federal government, said Nicole Elkon, a spokeswoman for the 9/11 United Services Group, which is coordinating relief efforts among several charities.
Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the Sept. 11 Fund, said: "It's very challenging to establish the boundaries under which you can help people. We have a responsibility not only to help people, but also to keep faith with our donors and our donors' intentions."

HEADLINE: State Pageants at War With Miss America Organization 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
To pull the struggling Miss America pageant into the 21st century, Robert M. Renneisen Jr., its chief executive, has proposed some unconventional ideas, like moving the pageant from Atlantic City -- perhaps to an Indian casino in Connecticut -- and licensing a Miss America slot machine. 
 Mr. Renneisen's proposals have prompted the kind of fiery outcry one might expect after suggesting a face lift to a faded but vain beauty queen. 
 Over the last two weeks, the proposals -- along with complaints from the reigning Miss America's mentors and family that became public -- provoked a coup attempt by directors of state pageants, who were alarmed that the national contest, in a search for profits and younger television viewers, might forfeit its wholesome, sorority-sister image. 
A group of state pageant administrators seeking to wrest control from Mr. Renneisen, circulated an eight-page letter from the parents of Katie Harman, Miss America herself, that accused him of depriving her of press opportunities and leaving her with a $2,200 bill for her post-coronation victory party and a $750 bill for clothing alterations. 
Insisting that the complaints were unfounded, Mr. Renneisen, a former casino executive and Army captain, promised to quash what he referred to as "the rebellion of the beauty queens." Yesterday, he did: Miss Harman was called back from her national speaking tour to participate in a news conference with Mr. Renneisen and five members of the pageant's board, at which she professed her devotion to the job and the Miss America Organization. 
The dispute is evidence of a culture clash within the pageant, setting state pageant directors, who long shunned two-piece bathing suits for contestants, against Mr. Renneisen and his team, who are fighting a loss of television revenues and a growing sense of cultural irrelevance.
"Younger people need to see the pageant move to modern times," Mr. Renneisen said in an interview. "And there is going to be a tug of war. What we are going through right now is one big growing pain." 
Angered by Mr. Renneisen's proposals to move the pageant, cut their budgets and court different sponsors, as well as what they characterized as his lack of promotion for Miss Harman, managers of four prominent regional pageants -- California, Illinois, Oregon and South Carolina -- met with Mr. Renneisen in Atlantic City on Feb. 4, asking for his resignation, two of the directors said. 
"We simply want a kinder, gentler, Miss America," said Robert Arnhym, the chief executive of the Miss California Organization.
The state directors also demanded that the National Association of Miss America State Pageants, a group of volunteer committees, take over the pageant from the Miss America Organization, based in New Jersey. 
At the time of the meeting, Mr. Renneisen also had the letter, dated Feb. 3, from Glen and Darla Harman, of Gresham, Ore., accusing him of mistreating their daughter. 
"Katie is your Miss America, and I can't tell you how many times she is in trouble for things that aren't her fault," the letter read in part. 
Yesterday, Miss Harman distanced herself from those complaints. "I was never mistreated," she said at the occasionally emotional news conference. "I'll tell you that honestly, up front." 
In a letter to Mr. Renneisen that was made public this week, Dana Philips, executive director of the Miss Oregon Scholarship pageant, from which Miss Harman went on to win the national title, criticized Mr. Renneisen's proposal for the slot machine, adding that Miss Harman thought it was "demeaning." 
Mr. Renneisen said in an interview earlier in the week that the complaints were unfounded. "Katie received $42,000 in clothes," he said. "She received an alteration budget of $1,500 and went over that by $258. And we paid it." He added that Miss Harman had fewer public assignments than previous winners because booking Miss America was not the country's priority after Sept. 11. 
The trouble comes at a particularly difficult time for Mr. Renneisen, the third director of the pageant in four years, who recently provoked government and civic leaders in Atlantic City by threatening to move. 
In late December, Mr. Renneisen said he might move the pageant in 2003 if Atlantic City did not come up with $1 million beyond the money -- around $500,000, Mr. Renneisen said -- it already gets from the Atlantic City Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
Alarmed, the convention bureau formed a task force that plans to meet on Feb. 22 to discuss whether the city can meet the demands. 
Mr. Renneisen said that the location was a license he can sell, and that Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn., had offered $1.5 million. 
What really gets the state pageant directors going are fundamental questions of the Miss America mission. When Mr. Renneisen proposed the licensing of a Miss America slot machine, some state directors were incensed -- in part because contestants were until recently not even allowed to enter a casino, for fear it could besmirch the pageant's image. 
"We want this pageant to be about role models, and we want to attract the leadership of tomorrow," said Jean Magness, who has worked for the Miss Texas pageant for 30 years and is the president of the National Association of Miss America State Pageants. "Whether or not you think Miss America should be on a slot machine, I don't think the leadership of tomorrow is going to be hanging around in casinos." 
Mr. Renneisen said the four regional managers and the president of the National Association of Miss America State Pageants were not representative of the 51-member Miss America infrastructure. 
"This organization is staffed throughout the country by people who are predominantly volunteers, many of whom are deeply passionate about the pageant, and some of whom, frankly, have no other life than this," he said. "They have collected 12 years of petty gripes and groans and are trying to put it all in Katie's mouth."
The directors argue that Mr. Renneisen is the one putting falsehoods in Miss America's mouth and using her to deflect attention from what they say is his mismanagement. 
"I just think it's sick that he would use her like this to detract from his inadequacies," Ms. Philips said yesterday after the news conference. 
Tensions first came to a head in January at a Las Vegas workshop sponsored by the national organization. There, said Timothy Crammer, a New Jersey lawyer who represents the National Association of Miss America State Pageants, several state officials complained that they felt the national organization was delinquent in returning calls of potential sponsors drummed up by the state pageants. The local directors were also concerned about the rumors that the pageant might be moved. 
Mr. Crammer said his clients were unhappy with Mr. Renneisen's response. "He actually told several of the state directors that if they didn't like the way he was doing things, they could quit," Mr. Crammer said. 
The unhappy state directors took their complaints to the Miss America Organization board, Mr. Renneisen's bosses. At the meeting on Feb. 4, they gave the board what Joseph Sanders, the executive director of the Miss South Carolina pageant, called "a book of grievances."
Mr. Renneisen said that the volunteers who run state pageants do not grasp the breadth of the economic measures the pageant must take to stay afloat and relevant. 
The 2000 pageant brought in the lowest ratings in its 43 years on television, with 8.8 million homes tuned in, compared with its peak of 22 million homes in 1970. Last year, 13.5 million viewers watched.
Traditional revenue sources have begun to wither. Last year, ABC paid $5.8 million for the broadcast rights, a sum Mr. Renneisen said has been shrinking. "When the company hired me two years ago, given this economic paradigm, we knew we must begin to increase and expand our sources of revenue from other areas," he said. "Clothing, jewelry, T-shirts, dolls, whatever." 
Despite Miss Harman's affirmations of good will yesterday, the state pageant directors were not mollified. 
"I don't think this means anything is over, or anything is resolved," said Ms. Philips, the Oregon executive director, after the conference. 
As for the slot machine, casino-goers can count on it. Mr. Renneisen said he has reached an agreement with a slot-maker. If Miss Harman had ever been opposed to it, that was too bad.
"By the time it comes out she won't be Miss America anymore," Mr. Renneisen said, "and her vote won't count anyway."

HEADLINE: Global Economy Taking Toll on Small Towns 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: BRADY, Tex. 

 BODY:
All along the nation's back roads, hundreds of towns like this one are teetering in the recession, and some worry that they may never recover. Uranium mining has stopped in Falls City, Tex. In Loving County, Tex., oil exploration has stalled. 
 For farmers in Pima, Ariz., and Bartow, Ga., cotton prices have sunk to 30-year lows. Here in Brady, the ranchers who raise goats for angora wool are victims of low prices and competition from New Zealand and Argentina. 
 Stretched across the southern tier, from Arizona and New Mexico through Texas and Georgia and into Virginia, these small rural communities form the base of the national supply chain. They produce most of the oil and much of the ore, fiber and food. In past recessions, even if they did not bounce back entirely, at least they survived. 
But this time around, as the overall economy begins to show some signs of healing, things are ominously different in many of these towns.
Since the last recession, in the early 1990's, China, Russia and the former Soviet republics have charged into the world's commodity markets. At the same time, new trade agreements have erased quotas and tariffs that long insulated United States industries from foreign competition. 
While freer trade benefits American consumers and industries that can now buy cheaper imported commodities, it has been rough on the places whose livelihoods depend on raw goods. For these already-struggling communities, the first post-globalization recession may break the old sequence of boom-bust-boom, and erase any hopes of long-term survival.
Foreign potash and uranium are now cheaper than New Mexico's, and Australian wool is cheaper than that produced here in Brady, a ranching town of about 6,000 people in the Texas Hill Country. In part because of competition from Latin America, the copper mining that has stalled in Arizona and New Mexico might never return. 
"All the rural parts of New Mexico are dependent on mining," said Terry Fletcher, chairman of the state's mining commission, "and almost all hard-rock mining is going offshore."
Certainly, there are communities along these back roads that have found ways to rebound. Some are part of the expanding orbit of sprawling cities. 
Heirs of the beleaguered peanut farmers of Floresville, Tex., are selling out to subdivision developers from San Antonio. Brady's game-stocked woods bring in money from hunters. With museums and antique shops, other towns, like Silver City, N.M., hope to get along by selling their past.
But for many rural communities, industries that have been declining for years may be dying out. 
"We're just constantly losing without anybody filling in the blanks," said Joyce Patrick, a real estate office assistant in Halifax, Va., where the economic pillar was once tobacco and then became textiles, which are now in decline. 
One place that is losing is Silver City, population 10,545, in southwest New Mexico. Contrary to what its name implies, Silver City depends on copper, as the silver ran out a century ago, and it has been the plunge in demand for copper that is hurting the town and surrounding Grant County. 
The Phelps Dodge Corporation operates New Mexico's two biggest copper mines here and it is the county's largest private employer. It employed 2,400 workers in Grant County and neighboring Hidalgo County three years ago. 
All but about 700 have been laid off. Businesses that served the mines are letting another 400 workers go, said Jose Maestas, director of the local office of the New Mexico Department of Labor.
Mr. Maestas said that unemployment in Grant County had gone to about 14 percent from 9 percent last fall. Stores are closing fast. 
"A couple of years ago, every building downtown was full," he said. 
Behind Silver City's latest travails is a plunge in world demand for copper. Prices have dropped by half, according to the United States Geological Survey, to just under 70 cents a pound in the spot market from $1.40 a pound in early 1995. 
"We've got huge inventories of unsold copper, which are not selling," said Richard Peterson, Phelps Dodge's spokesman in Silver City. 
Once customers need copper again, Phelps Dodge mines in Chile and Peru as well as foreign-owned mines in South America will benefit more than those in Silver City, Mr. Peterson said, because the ore mined abroad is richer in copper. 
About 330 miles east of Silver City is Loving, N.M., population 1,326. It has ranches, oil wells and, nearby, the nation's largest deposits of potash, a basic ingredient of fertilizer.
A few years ago, seven 850-foot-deep potash mines operated in Eddy County, which includes Loving. Now there are three. Mining jobs in the county have fallen to 850 from 1,800 in 1993. Mining companies say most of those jobs may be gone for good. 
Part of the reason is the depressed agricultural economy. But even if that economy revives, and farmers start using more fertilizer, the Loving area will be hard put to respond. Canadian potash is increasingly competitive, and the potash reserves here are old and run down. What remains is harder and more expensive to get. 
"You just run out of mineable ore," said Melinda Hood, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Chemical Corporation, a potash mine operator in Eddy County. 
In Loving's little downtown, just two cars were parked at the branch of Western Commercial Bank on a summery day in the middle of winter. The only person in sight was a woman in curlers smoking outside the town's other remaining business, a hair salon. 
The storefront marked City Hall was shuttered. After a fire in June, the town government moved to two rooms in what was once the elementary school.
"We used to have two pool halls, two bars and two cafes, a barber shop," said Manuel Garza, the city clerk. "People just moved out." 
From Loving, N.M., Highway 285 winds east to a county in West Texas also called Loving, which is the nation's least populous county, with 67 people. Mentone, the county seat, has two businesses, a cafe and a gas station. Children are bused 36 miles to school in the town of Wink. 
In the 1980's oil boom, with so much oil and so few people, Loving was a very rich county. But with the oil bust of the late 80's, the West Texas economy plunged. It has not helped that the county's oil, which was easy to retrieve, is harder and more costly to get. 
"The oil field just went poof," said Barbara Creager, whose husband, Royce, services oil wells. There is more oil out there, but further exploration is costly and the industry faces competition not just from Saudi Arabia but from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
This has been rough on Loving County, which gets 98 percent of its tax revenues from oil, said Mr. Creager, who is also a county commissioner. 
About 250 miles from Mentone as the crow flies is Brady. Here, the recession and globalization have hit mohair and wool.
Tommy A. Quick, 68, and his wife, Wanda, 54, pulled into a McDonald's one Sunday morning, a black and white Nubian nanny goat nibbling straw in the back of their pickup. 
The Hill Country was the "angora wool capital of the world," said Mr. Quick, who owns 125 goats, but now raises them for their meat instead of their hair. "The whole wool business is shot," he said. "Every Japanese man wanted a mohair suit. It comes from angora goats." 
With the global recession, he said, no one wants the suits anymore.
"I worked at this wool plant, Roddie Wool Scouring, for 27 years," Mr. Quick said. "We washed two million pounds a week. It was the steadiest job ever in this town. Now it's shut down to three days a week."
Four years ago, Sherri Tally, the office manager at the Roddie plant, wrote weekly paychecks for 105 workers. "I do 23 now," she said. 
In Bartow, Ga., the culprit is cotton. High production in countries like China has led to an oversupply and plunging prices. Raw cotton today sells for about 55 cents a pound, about 30 percent below the price five years ago. 
As the American farms have gotten bigger and automated, the small-farm families that sustained Bartow have given up and moved. 
Even the federal government's subsidies for cotton have not been enough to allow any but the biggest farmers to eke out profits. Though Georgia is one of the fastest-growing states, Bartow's population dropped to 223 in 2000 from 292 in 1990. 
"I just gave it up," said T. Murray Dukes, 72, who raised 300 acres of cotton near Bartow for 40 years. "Cotton used to be your money crop. But you don't know what you're going to get for it now."

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Leader Urges New Push on Social Security 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, urged his fellow Republicans today not to shrink from a fight with Democrats this year over how to shore up Social Security.
 In a memorandum to all House Republicans as they went home for a one-week recess, Mr. Armey said he would soon bring legislation to the floor that would give the party the political cover it needed to protect itself from Democratic attacks. 
 With that protection, Mr. Armey said, the party can more vigorously push its proposal to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security money in the stock market, a change that Democrats say would mean deep cuts in guaranteed benefits and create big financial risks for retirees. 
Mr. Armey said one bill he planned to bring up would, for the first time, guarantee all current Social Security recipients that their benefits would not be cut. He said another bill would call for increases in benefits for women.
Depending on the details, which Congressional aides said had not been worked out, the bills could be difficult for Democrats to oppose. More to the point, Republican strategists said, they would help neutralize Democrats' arguments that the Bush administration and Republicans in Congress had put Social Security in deeper financial trouble by squandering the budget surplus and missing an opportunity to pay down the national debt.
"Both of these initiatives are important to current and future Social Security recipients," Mr. Armey said in the memorandum. "But just as important, these measures will provide House Republicans with an opportunity to begin a candid national discussion about the future of this important program."
Mr. Armey said the party should "begin making the case -- forcefully and without fear or apology -- for wide-ranging reform of the system."
Mr. Armey has announced he will not run for re-election. But many Republicans who are up for re-election are wary of making Social Security a focus of their campaigns this year, fearful that Democrats will turn the issue to their advantage as they reliably have for decades.
One Republican strategist said there was no appetite for a vote this year in the House on a full-fledged plan to add personal investment accounts to Social Security. But he said Republican candidates would welcome the chance to vote on measures that would allow them to fend off what they regard as demagoguery by Democrats.
"Republican candidates are going to have to deal with this issue," the strategist said. "They can't run and hide in a corner under attacks from the Democrats."
Democrats welcomed any move to put Social Security on the front burner, saying they think they can prevail both on politics and on substance. They said the Republican push for private investment accounts looked particularly risky after the collapse of the Enron Corporation and the losses suffered by workers and investors as its stock became almost worthless.
Democrats also said a focus on Social Security made it easier for them to hammer home their message that Republicans have been fiscally irresponsible, leaving no money to deal with the retirement system's long-term problems.
"The president's budget has broken the Social Security lockbox," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the senior Democrat on the House subcommittee on Social Security, "and now workers' payroll taxes, which they believe are being saved for retirement, are being used to finance tax cuts for wealthy individuals and big corporations." 
The White House made clear today that it planned a vigorous defense of last year's tax cut and of its call for new and accelerated tax reductions. Vice President Dick Cheney said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations that last year's tax cut had helped keep the recession relatively shallow and would help create 800,000 jobs this year.
Democrats said Mr. Cheney's figures, from a new report by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, were self-serving and ignored the fact that the provisions in the tax cut that helped the economy last year were there at the insistence of Democrats, primarily the checks of up to $300 per person sent to most taxpayers.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said that having the White House credit the tax cut with helping the economy was "a little like a figure skating judge awarding his own team a gold medal."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Concerns About Accounting Cause Losses Once Again

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by the International Business Machines Corporation, after a published report said the company did not fully disclose a gain from the sale of a unit.
 The Nvidia Corporation's disclosure that federal regulators are investigating its accounting added to concern that companies are misstating profits. A report showing that consumer confidence unexpectedly fell this month also hurt stocks by suggesting an economic rebound may be less robust than anticipated. 
 "Investors are focused like a laser beam on accounting issues," said Robert Bloom, president of LF Capital, which manages $1 billion. They are "a blow to investor confidence." 
I.B.M., which said the unit's sale was "properly and fully" reported, accounted for one-third of the loss of the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow dropped 98.95 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 9,903.04.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.30 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,104.18. The Nasdaq composite index declined 38.17 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,805.20.
The exchanges will be closed Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for February fell to 90.9 from 93 last month, and analysts attributed the decline to concern that more companies have issued misleading financial reports.
"Retail sales is a driver of the economy, and if consumer confidence falters, then consumer spending will falter and that's not good for the economy," said Todd Clark, head of listed trading at Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco.
The drop in confidence curbed optimism from reports this week that showed rising retail sales and falling jobless claims.
"We're looking for a correction," said Frederick Sears, who helps manage $150 million at the Investors Capital Corporation in Lynnfield, Mass. "Too many people are convinced that the economy is O.K. and that we're out of the recession, but we don't agree."
Shares of I.B.M. dropped $5, or 4.6 percent, to $102.89. The change followed a report in The New York Times yesterday that when I.B.M. reported fourth-quarter earnings last month, it did not treat the $300 million sale of its optical transceiver unit as a one-time gain. The paper said the sale had been used to lower operating costs, thus improving the appearance of I.B.M.'s earnings per share.
Nvidia fell $4.81, to $57.35. The company, the maker of computer graphics chips, said the Securities and Exchange Commission was reviewing the recording of reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 and the first quarter of fiscal 2001 and product costs recorded in the second and third quarters of last year. 
Corporate accounting practices have come under increased scrutiny after the collapse of the Enron Corporation. Shares of companies, including Tyco International and Cisco Systems, have declined as investors question the accuracy of their financial statements.
WorldCom Inc. slid 30 cents, to $6.73. The company, the second-largest telecommunications provider, said an internal audit found that about 12 sales representatives improperly bolstered commissions, costing the company as much as $4 million. The disclosure comes one week after the chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, said Worldcom finances were sound.
Shares of other telecommunication providers slumped on concern the companies would follow Qwest Communications International and borrow from banks as short-term lending dries up.
Sprint PCS, the mobile phone operator, fell 93 cents, to $9.27, and Qualcomm, which licenses patents for mobile phones used by 103 million people, dropped $2.92, to $37.40.
In the bond market, prices rallied as the dip in consumer confidence and subdued wholesale prices pointed to contained inflation. The 10-year Treasury note rose 22/32, to 100 5/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 4.86 percent from 4.94 percent on Thursday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 20/32, to 100 4/32. Its yield fell to 5.37 percent from 5.41 percent.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Made Big Cut In 2001 Pay Of Its Chief 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
In the midst of a prolonged drought in Wall Street's most lucrative businesses, the financial pain is shooting all the way to the boardroom.
 Investment banks have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs and drastically cut the pay of the remaining bankers, traders and analysts. Now, even chief executives are feeling the pinch as their huge bonuses shrink. 
 Morgan Stanley paid its chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, $12.8 million in cash and stock for 2001, down from $21.9 million in 2000, according to the firm's proxy statement, which was released yesterday. That was a drop of more than 40 percent and probably was in line with the cuts given to top executives of other major firms on Wall Street, analysts said. 
"They had to go down this much because the group that was hit the hardest, the senior investment bankers, had their pay cut in half," said Alan M. Johnson, a compensation consultant. Executive pay on Wall Street "is going to drop a lot," he said. "But there are still going to be big numbers for most of these people."
Morgan Stanley's proxy offered a first peek. Other big firms, including the Goldman, Sachs Group and Lehman Brothers Holdings, are expected to release their proxies and annual reports over the next few weeks. 
At Citigroup's offices in lower Manhattan yesterday, investment bankers and analysts heard the bad news about their bonus checks, which are due in two weeks. Many of them learned that their checks, which account for the bulk of their annual pay, would be at least 25 percent smaller than they were a year ago.
Wall Street has been struggling through a slide that has lasted almost two years, since the market for technology stocks collapsed in early 2000. Last year was the most disappointing full year since 1994, and it ended a run of six years of extraordinary growth, rising profits and soaring pay.
The slump had a direct effect on the economy of the New York area, where most Wall Street employees work, live and shop. Prices of apartments in Manhattan have begun to decline as young investment bankers have stopped bidding against one another for Park Avenue prewar units and TriBeCa lofts.
Business has dropped off so sharply that Wall Street firms have stopped worrying about keeping employees. Just two years ago, they caved in to a variety of demands, from providing concierge services at the office to relaxing their dress codes. Already, Lehman Brothers has announced plans to bring back suits and ties.
"The mantra in the industry that you hear everywhere is: Where are they going to go?" Mr. Johnson said. 
Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Citigroup, said Morgan Stanley's executive pay suited the times.
"It was a very bad year for the industry and, therefore, a bad year for Morgan Stanley as well," he said. Morgan Stanley's profit declined 34 percent last year, to $3.6 billion, and the company's total compensation dropped by about 15 percent, he said. 
"It seems appropriate that the chief executive should have his earnings down at the 40-percent-or-better level," Mr. Moszkowski said. "The big guys take more of a hit, obviously."
Along with his salary, bonus and $4.4 million in restricted stock, Mr. Purcell received stock options last year that the company valued at $3.3 million. In 2000, Mr. Purcell received options valued at $15.1 million.
Robert G. Scott, who succeeded John J. Mack as the firm's president early last year, received a raise to go with his promotion. Mr. Scott received $11.9 million in cash and stock, up from $11 million in 2000. Mr. Mack is now the chief executive of Credit Suisse First Boston.
The two top executives in Morgan Stanley's institutional securities group, Vikram S. Pandit and Stephan F. Newhouse, each received about $11.5 million in cash and restricted stock. Mr. Pandit's bonus shrank to $7 million, from $10.4 million in 2000.
The proxy also disclosed that Morgan Stanley plans to hold its annual meeting of shareholders in London on March 19, its first outside the United States.

HEADLINE: Linden G.M. Workers Take Wait-and-See Approach as They Face Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: LINDEN, N.J., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
The last time there were layoffs at the General Motors Corporation plant here, Guy Messina, shop chairman of the union local, had to go onto the plant floor to answer questions about them. He was roundly booed by the members.
 On Thursday, when Mr. Messina joined other union and company officials to announce that 1,100 of the plant's 2,300 workers would be laid off by April 15, people were polite, and some even applauded. 
 The difference in reactions to the layoffs 12 years ago and this week, officials said, can be traced to what happened last month, when Ford announced that it would close its Edison plant and lop off 3,000 jobs.
"This time our membership has matured," said Mr. Messina, the shop chairman of United Auto Workers Local 595, which represents most of the G.M. plant employees. "But most of all, the guys here knew they weren't as bad off as the Ford workers down the road."
In announcing this latest bite out of the state's industrial midsection, General Motors said demand had declined in recent months for the two- and four-door Chevrolet Blazers that are the plant's main product. 
The company was hoping to shift resources and investment to more popular and larger sport utility vehicles, like the TrailBlazer and Tahoe. It has assured workers and town officials that it plans to retool the plant for another line of vehicles just as it did after the layoffs 12 years ago, paving the way for rehirings. 
Still, workers were divided today as to whether the layoffs portended more drastic action by the company.
"The key will be whether we get a new product to produce here by 2004," said Jerry Walker of Roselle,who has worked for the company for 32 years. "We have been promised a new product, so we will just have to see."
But Bob Van Der Meiren, 58, said the handwriting was on the wall -- the plant was likely to close in a few years and he, for one, was ready.
"I have a wife who works, a few dollars in the bank and a boat in the driveway," said Mr. Van Der Meiren, suggesting that he would retire after 37 years. "And flounder season is coming up."
The cutbacks at the plant will only slightly diminish the gritty mix of manufacturing in this town, which includes motor vehicle and pharmaceutical production and some of the East Coast's largest oil refineries. Linden is the flat stretch of petroleum tank farms and fire-belching smokestacks along the New Jersey Turnpike that has become somewhat emblematic of the state to those who are just passing through.
But Mayor John T. Gregorio says the bleak industrial face has provided this town of 37,000 with a vibrant and prosperous commercial sector, allowing the lowest property tax rate in Union County. He says he is confident that when all is said and done, the plant will still be here.
"I've been mayor here for 30 years and I have dealt with the General Motors people over that time, and when they tell me that this is not about eventually closing the plant I believe them," he said. "This is just about a slump in the business and they are just selling fewer Blazers."
Either way, he said, the economic impact of the cutbacks on the town would be slight. Under the contract between General Motors and the auto workers' union, those workers who are laid off will continue to get 95 percent of their base salary until the current contract expires in 2003, he noted. And the automaker will continue to pay $3 million a year in local property taxes.
Mr. Gregorio said the town was undergoing a renaissance of sorts, with many employers eager to locate in the area. "I would be killed in the rush to buy up the G.M. property if they did close down," he said.
Back at the plant, at the change of shifts today, workers blamed the cutbacks on everything from politics to globalism. "Every time a Republican gets into office in Washington, the layoffs start," said David Gates, a retiree from the plant who stopped by the sprawling complex along busy Routes 1 and 9 to commiserate with friends and former colleagues.
John Porcellana, 64, of Fords had another view.
"When Enron went down it was the fault of the lawyers, the accountants and the executives," he said. "But our fate has to do with the public at large, which isn't buying American cars and has this mind-set that foreign-made cars are better."

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
An Internet start-up goes public. It is not profitable -- in fact, it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars to date -- and faces competition from old-economy stalwarts. Yet on the first day of trading, investors go wild, pushing the company's stock up 60 percent.
 Sounds like 1999? It happened today. 
 PayPal, a Silicon Valley company that lets people pay for goods and services online, became one of the first consumer-oriented Internet start-ups to go public since the dot-com bust, and it did so with notable success. The company, whose stock opened at $13, hit as high as $22.44, before closing at $20.09, raising $70.2 million by day's end.
The response came, on top of everything else, after PayPal delayed its offering for a week after being hit with yet another challenge, a patent lawsuit from a competitor, and having its service suspended by banking regulators in Louisiana.
Given the obstacles confronted by PayPal, the offering's success provoked questions about whether investors were responding to the promise of a single company, or demonstrating a renewed appetite for matters Internet.
Unlike with many past dot-coms, "there is some clarity about how this company is going to make money," said Randall Roth, a research analyst with Renaissance Capital, echoing a view among analysts who cover the industry that PayPal has much to recommend it to investors.
But, Mr. Roth added, the optimism did not seem sufficient to justify the big first-day run-up.
"It's an anachronism -- straight out of 1999," he said. "It's like we've kind of forgotten what got us into this situation in the first place."
What fueled the boom, and soaring stock prices, back then was the promise that the Internet would transform business and consumer habits, and make transactions, shopping and access to information more convenient and less expensive.
While some of the hopes have been borne out, and may yet be so, what led to the bust was a realization that the initial promise would not happen overnight, or be as profound as optimists hoped. And, pointedly, there was the recognition that start-ups must be commercially viable, not just good ideas, to be worthy investments.
With the same vigor with which investors embraced Internet start-ups, they shunned them, starting about April 2000. In the last 18 months, there have been only a handful of public offerings from Internet-related ventures.
PayPal, which declined to comment today citing a quiet period mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, lets people make payments to each other, and to businesses, over the Internet. To do so, an individual seeking to make a payment visits www.paypal.com and opens a account, depositing money into it -- with, for example, a check or credit card -- and then using the account to pay for transactions. The recipient, who also must have a PayPal account, receives an e-mail notification that the payment has been transferred.
PayPal has 12.8 million account holders, with about half its accounts having been active during the first half of 2001, according to company documents. Overwhelmingly, customers use PayPal to pay for online auctions, which account for 68 percent of PayPal's transactions.
In particular, PayPal has ridden the coattails of the success of eBay, one of the few Internet businesses that has lived up to its promise. Individual sellers often heavily favor PayPal's payment mechanism because they are leery of accepting personal checks or cannot accept credit cards. 
PayPal also has capitalized on two other successful areas of Internet trade, gambling and pornography, which account for 10 to 15 percent of the company's transactions, according to analysts who cover it. Many sites offering online wagering or pornography also accept credit cards.
PayPal makes its money by taking a cut of a transaction, roughly 3 percent, from the seller. One of the aspects of the business that make it attractive is that it provides a less expensive alternative to other payment methods, like credit cards, which can charge upward of 8 percent for Internet transactions, according to Gwenn Bezard, a research analyst with Celent Communications. He said PayPal had 90 percent of the e-mail payment market.
But such success has invited competition from Citigroup's Citibank, and eBay itself, both of which offer competing transaction methods, and from Mastercard, which has indicated its interest in getting into the business.
And whether PayPal can make a profit remains unknown, given that the company lost $265 million in its first two and a half years in business. However, its loss rate has slowed markedly in recent months.
Adding to the questions, the company had initially planned to go public earlier this month, but postponed the offering after a company called CertCo Inc. filed a lawsuit claiming it had a patent on the online payment system. In the last week, PayPal disclosed that it may be subject to banking regulations in several states, including Louisiana, which informed PayPal last week it must suspend operation in the state until regulators can assess which state licenses the company is required to obtain.
Aaron McPherson, a research manager with IDC, a market research concern, said that despite the obstacles, the company was attractive to investors because it was in a "commanding" position in an emerging market, and was "trending toward profitability." But, the analyst said, another factor in the first day run-up of the stock may be simply that it has been a long time since investors had anything to get excited about.
"There isn't much competition for investor dollars," he said.

HEADLINE: The Two-Enron System 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH; E-mail: frankrich@nytimes.com

 BODY:
If you're having trouble keeping up with the Olympian scandals in Washington, just think of the Republicans and the Democrats as the French and the Russians and all the rest of us as Canadians. But at least those Canadians got their gold back.
 The head of the Republican Party, hand-picked by the president, is Marc Racicot, who served as an Enron lobbyist as recently as last fall. His Democratic counterpart, Terry McAuliffe, is a former consultant to Gary Winnick, the founder of Enron's twin in bankruptcy, Global Crossing, which is now under investigation by the F.B.I. and the S.E.C. and will soon have its own inquisition in Congress. For anyone left holding these companies' stock after their executives and insiders cashed out, there is no gold, not even silver -- just handsome stock certificates that will brighten someone's day on eBay. 
 Democrats want to believe that Enron is the Republicans' Armageddon. Republicans hope Global Crossing will prove the Democrats' comeuppance. Dream on. Political cross-dressing is a distinguishing feature of this systemic scandal, much of it entirely legal, in which the only currency that counts comes in green, not the red and blue of the electoral map. As countless Democrats have turned up on the lists of Enron and Arthur Andersen campaign beneficiaries, so the former President Bush is among those who joined Mr. McAuliffe in test-riding the Global Crossing gravy train. 
Surveying the landscape this week, John McCain told Larry King that while he'd like to believe Enron was merely a tale of corporate malfeasance, he thought it would prove "a lot more than that" and "lead a lot of places that we never thought it would." We'll soon need an Olympics-grade scorecard to keep track.
For starters, keep your eye on two private lists of names that are being held onto for dear life by their keepers. The first, of course, is the list of those who met with the Cheney energy task force last year. Why is the vice president risking a Congressional lawsuit to hide the identities of the Enron executives and their cronies, even though a CNN/USA Today poll says that Americans overwhelmingly support full disclosure? Every time this question gains speed there seems to be another terror alert -- a kind of "Wag the Dog" scenario in which the dog never barks. 
The second list is of the "individual investors" who joined Andrew Fastow and other Enron executives at the trough of the 3,000 off-the-books partnerships that turned nominal investments into fortunes overnight while regular stockholders got stuck with the debt. Enron has told Congressional investigators it can't provide the names, even though it usually owned 97 percent of each of these entities. 
To get to the bottom of such mysteries, Congress has leaned heavily on the Powers report -- the in-house Enron investigation hyped by Democrats and Republicans alike as (in the words of the North Dakota senator Byron Dorgan) a "devastating indictment" of the company's misbehavior. But this "devastating" document examined a grand total of 3 of those 3,000 partnerships and provided no names of the individual investors in those either. Nor did it look into Enron Energy Services, a nearly defunct division that may have overstated its profits while hemorrhaging cash under the leadership of Thomas White, who is now the secretary of the Army, entrusted with $81 billion of taxpayers' money during the biggest expansion of the military budget since the Vietnam War. Mr. White, in fairness, was only vice chairman of Enron Energy; the chairman was Lou Pai, who took more out of the pre-bankrupt Enron than anyone ($270 million) and was last seen trying to duck an ABC News reporter while denying that he had brought dancers from "a top Houston strip club" into Enron headquarters. 
What is most revealing about the Powers report is its provenance. One author is Herbert Winokur Jr., an Enron outside director who was in the fortunate position of having a big say in a report passing judgment on his own questionable corporate citizenship. Appearing before the House Commerce Committee with condescension in his voice and a flag pin in his lapel, he contradicted himself so much under questioning that one member, Bart Stupak of Michigan, told me he had "impeached his own testimony." 
The Powers of the report, William Powers Jr., is the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, an academic institution subsidized in part by Enron. In his testimony before Congress, Mr. Powers conceded that the interview with Ken Lay conducted for his investigation had not been transcribed and that any notes from it had been discarded. This is "standard, accepted" practice, he said -- and presumably is taught as such in his school as Enron 101. Asked to explain other holes in his report, this law school dean repeatedly asserted that he was "not an expert" on the relevant laws, or apparently much else. 
As for Global Crossing, keep your eye on Mr. McAuliffe. The story that he's sticking to is that after making a brave early $100,000 investment he got out in 1999 with a profit approaching $18 million (the exact figure remains elusive) through sheer capitalistic ingenuity. "The company went from zero to 50 billion in market cap," he said on CNN late last month. "It's a great success story." That great success story, which hit its peak of $64 a share in the same year that Mr. McAuliffe cashed out, never turned a dime of profit, ultimately lost $7 billion and has since traded for pennies. 
As it happens, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Global Crossing executives and insiders also started unloading shares in 1999 -- hauling home $1.3 billion, even more than Ken Lay and company netted when they dumped Enron stock while telling their employees to buy. Did these brilliant capitalists -- among them Mr. Winnick, who made off with $735 million -- know something that other Global Crossing shareholders didn't? Did any of them tell Mr. McAuliffe? On Tuesday I asked the Democratic National Committee merely for the dates of the party chief's Global Crossing sales within 1999. The answer has been silence. 
Then again, maybe Mr. McAuliffe doesn't remember. These days even Democrats can go Skilling on you. Listen to the curious answer given by Joseph Lieberman when asked by Don Imus about the $2,000 he received from Enron in 1994: "I hadn't even remembered it because I hadn't had much contact with people from Enron." True, no doubt, but more than a shade Cheneyesque coming from one of the Senate's high Enron moralizers. It's been widely reported that Mr. Lieberman's friend and former chief of staff, Michael Lewan, arranged three meetings between Enron officials and Lieberman aides while working as an Enron consultant last year.
Because Democrats, and not just Mr. Lieberman, are terrified both by President Bush's poll numbers and the number of dollars they have themselves received from Enron, Andersen and Global Crossing, they don't have the guts to join the California congressman Henry Waxman in pursuing former Enron executives like Thomas White into the current administration. Granted, that's a full-time job -- without Enron alumni, the Bush team would be as depopulated as an apres-ski party thrown by the Lays this winter in the Aspen hacienda they have just unloaded at an $8 million profit to the producer of the CBS soap "The Bold and the Beautiful." 
But surely someone should consider the case of Lawrence Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser and a $50,000-a-year Enron consultant while advising the Bush campaign in 2000. Let's take the administration's word that there's no reason for Mr. Lindsey to stay away from Enron matters, despite having taken at least as much Enron money as John Ashcroft, who has recused himself from the Justice Department investigation. Even so, is this the best financial seer American taxpayers' money can buy? In mid-January the White House proudly declared that Mr. Lindsey had helped lead an October review to see "the potential impact" of Enron's woes and had delivered a thumbs-up prognosis, seeing no situation that could "harm the national economy." Try explaining that to anyone who's taken a beating in the stock and bond market declines since Enron declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
The good news is that 70 percent of Americans, up from 55 last month, are telling pollsters they care about this scandal. Already this has driven the House to take its momentous step to slow the spigots of corporate cash. Should Congress subpoena any of those Houston strippers to testify about any or all kinds of Enron partnerships, accounting reform may not be far behind.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VICE PRESIDENT; 
Cheney Rejects Criticism By Allies Over Stand on Iraq

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney offered a strong rebuttal today to allied officials who have criticized the Bush administration's aggressive stance toward Iraq, saying the United States was prepared to use all available means to stop Saddam Hussein from continuing his development of weapons of mass destruction and that he expected allied support if "aggressive action is required."
 Addressing the Council on Foreign Relations here, Mr. Cheney stressed that Iraq and Iran were dangerous adversaries and underscored that Washington had a responsibility to broaden its campaign against terrorism. He said that Washington would not be dissuaded by international criticism that the Bush administration was too eager to use force and too unilateral in its actions. 
 "America has friends and allies in this cause, but only we can lead it," Mr. Cheney said, referring to the war on terrorism. "Only we can rally the world in a task of this complexity against an enemy so elusive and so resourceful. The United States and only the United States can see this effort through to victory."
Speaking of the new phase of Washington's efforts, Mr. Cheney said President Bush was determined to press on and stop Iraq, Iran and North Korea from continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction.
"The president's made it clear that this will be a priority," Mr. Cheney said. "We will use all the means at our disposal -- meaning military, diplomatic, intelligence, etc. -- to address these concerns."
This week allies have become increasingly critical of the administration's tough tone. fearing that it signals a dangerous expansion in Washington's war on terror. In Europe, for example, Chris Patten, the European Union's external affairs chief, argued today in The Financial Times that the success of the United States military campaign in Afghanistan might embolden the administration to act recklessly.
"The Afghan war," Mr. Patten wrote, has "perhaps reinforced some dangerous instincts: that the projection of military power is the only basis of true security; that the U.S. can rely on no one but itself; and that allies may be useful as optional extras." 
President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada have also urged Washington not to act unilaterally against Iraq or Iran. South Korean officials have quietly fretted that Mr. Bush's comments have undercut their efforts to engage North Korea.
"If we try to do it unilaterally it will go nowhere," Mr. Chretien said. Mr. Cheney's appearance before the council represented his most comprehensive presentation in a public forum since the Sept. 11 attacks. For several months, he has rarely been seen in public and has often worked in an undisclosed location outside Washington, a precaution against terrorist attacks.
Asked whether his elusive working habits had given him a James Bond-like aura, he seemed to savor the question for a moment and then answered in his characteristically droll manner. "There are certain features of his lifestyle I've not been able to avail myself," Mr. Cheney said. "But I'm certainly hopeful." 
Mr. Cheney's message on foreign policy, however, was tough and certainly not the one that many allied officials wanted to hear. On Iran, he acknowledged that his views had hardened since his oil business days a year and a half ago, when he was urging efforts to rebuild a relationship with Tehran. In the sharpest criticism of Iran by a Bush administration official, he asserted that the Iranian government was trying to derail the Arab-Israeli peace process by shipping arms to the Palestinians.
"There is a great yearning on the part of the Iranian people to restore and re-establish relationships with the U.S. and the West," Mr. Cheney said. "By the same token, the government appears to be committed, for example, to trying to destroy the peace process as it relates to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And we've seen all too many examples of their active support of terrorism and their, as the president said the other night in the State of the Union speech, unstinting efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction."
As for Iraq, Mr. Cheney's comments come at an important juncture. Next month, he is scheduled to visit 12 allied and Middle East nations in a trip widely seen an effort to elicit their cooperation in overthrowing Saddam Hussein through the use of tougher economic sanctions, covert operations and, potentially, military force.
When Mr. Cheney addressed Iraq right after the Sept. 11 attacks the United States was preoccupied with hunting down the Qaeda leaders responsible. Mr. Cheney said at that time that there was no evidence linking Baghdad to the terrorist attacks in America. 
"Saddam Hussein is bottled up at this point," Mr. Cheney told NBC News on Sept. 16. 
Now, however, the Afghan campaign is winding down and Washington is focusing on new threats. So Mr. Cheney's tone about Iraq today was very different. 
"If you were to put together a list of states," Mr. Cheney said of Iraq, "clearly that's got to be one we focus on." 
"Not only do they have a robust set of programs to develop their own weapons of mass destruction; this is a place that's used it," he continued. "And we know he drove the inspectors out three years ago, and we know he has been actively and aggressively doing everything he can to enhance his capabilities. He has in the past had some dealings with terrorists, clearly. Abu Nidal for a long time operated out of Baghdad."
Some American officials have said that they expect the Administration to go to the United Nations in May to try to toughen sanctions against the Hussein regime. A demand for unfettered United Nations access, they say, might also be issued at that point, in the form of an ultimatum.
At the same time, they said, Washington will be preparing a campaign of covert action and military strikes to dislodge Mr. Hussein if he frustrates inspections, which American officials believe is virtually certain. 
"I think if aggressive action is required, I would anticipate there would be the appropriate support for that, both from the American people and the international community," Mr. Cheney said.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CORRESPONDENCE; 
Letters Show Bush and Lay Shared Much

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
In more than two dozen letters written from Kenneth L. Lay to then-Gov. George W. Bush, the former Enron chairman lobbied repeatedly for his company's pet issue, electric deregulation, sought the governor's presence at Enron-related functions and sent magazine articles and personal notes.
 The letters are included in 350 pages of correspondence between Enron executives and Mr. Bush when he was Texas governor, all of which suggests that Mr. Lay was involved in a variety of pressing state issues, including education, civil justice reform and electric deregulation. Mr. Lay also asked for the governor to lobby the state's Congressional delegation on federal issues important to Enron, including tax relief. 
 The letters, released today after open records requests, are a reminder that the relationship between Mr. Lay and Mr. Bush, which has chilled as scandal has enveloped Enron, was once close. Mr. Bush wrote Mr. Lay a teasing note about his 55th birthday. Mr. Lay twice thanked the governor for Christmas presents, including in December 1997 after Mr. Bush sent him a state Capitol ornament.
"It was a thoughtful gift and one our family will enjoy hanging on the tree every year," Mr. Lay wrote. "We want to wish you and your family a healthy, happy and prosperous 1998. Ken."
A year later, after thanking Mr. Bush for a "Tejano Santa" print for Christmas, Mr. Lay scribbled a handwritten note in the margin: "George and Laura -- Linda and I are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the White House. Hope you have a great Christmas with your family, Warmest Regards, Ken."
Mr. Lay's pre-eminent concern in his letters was the deregulation of the retail electricity market, a law signed by Mr. Bush in 1999. He wrote Mr. Bush several letters about the issue, including one after the 1997 legislative session, when the measure fell short of passage. 
"We would have liked to have accomplished more," Mr. Lay wrote, "but realistically, the issue would not have moved nearly as far as it did without your involvement, and for that Enron is deeply grateful."
On other occasions, Mr. Lay solicited Mr. Bush to appear at a variety of functions, including twice for an annual conference promoting trade between Japan and the United States, for a gala in Houston for a Civil War musical sponsored partly by Enron as well as for the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Bush attended the Japan conference at least once, though he apparently declined the gala for the musical. It could not be confirmed whether he attended the Davos conference.
In April 1997, Mr. Lay wrote the governor about an upcoming meeting scheduled between Mr. Bush and an influential official from Uzbekistan. He noted that Enron had opened an office in Tashkent and was negotiating a $2 billion joint venture.
"I know you and Ambassador Safaev will have a productive meeting which will result in a friendship between Texas and Uzbekistan," Mr. Lay wrote.
Two years later, Mr. Lay wrote asking that Mr. Bush meet with the prime minister of Romania during his visit to Houston. He noted that Enron had recently finalized a joint venture gas marketing deal in the country. But a handwritten note by a staff member suggests that Mr. Bush declined to meet the official.
Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, called the letters and other documents "old news" and said the relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Lay was never improper.
"The president has always acknowledged that he was a supporter," Mr. McClellan said of Mr. Lay, the man Mr. Bush once nicknamed Kenny Boy and who contributed about $600,000 to Mr. Bush's campaigns.
Mr. McClellan added, "But as governor he made decisions based on the best interests of all Texans."
The correspondence released today were taken from 1,800 boxes of documents collected during Mr. Bush's service as governor from January 1995 until December 2000. Before he became president, Mr. Bush used a new state law to designate his father's presidential library at Texas A&M University as repository for his papers as governor. This arrangement has left the status of the papers murky.
The presidential library is federally operated and does not consider itself subject to the tough open records law in Texas, which requires a response to all requests for public documents within 10 days. Officials at the Texas state archives, the usual repository for governors' papers, have expressed concerns. An opinion on the legality of the arrangement is expected in May from Attorney General John Cornyn of Texas.
Until then, the papers are being handled under an interim memorandum of understanding, which gives President Bush's lawyer, Terri Lacy, the right to know in advance which documents are being released. Before today's release, Ms. Lacy acknowledged that she had questioned whether archivists needed to release first drafts of certain documents before ultimately relenting.
"I never tried to block the release of the first drafts," she said today from Houston. "I just questioned whether it was helpful to anyone."
Also included among the documents released today were records from the Governor's Business Council, the advisory group appointed by the Texas governor. Mr. Lay, the group's chairman, was first appointed by Gov. Ann Richards, then reappointed by Mr. Bush.
In documents from 1995, Mr. Lay and other council officials raised money and worked to build public support for a reading initiative championed by Mr. Bush that later became state law.
"I know that the governor spoke to Ken Lay about the importance of providing some 'outside' momentum to his initiative," one council administrator wrote in a memo.
Tom Smith, director of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer and government watchdog group, said he believed that Mr. Lay and other business officials supported the reading initiative because of the governor's help on other issues.
"Essentially what you see here is kind of a quid pro quo," said Mr. Smith, whose group had filed an open records request for the documents, along with several news organizations, including The New York Times, "where the governor helps on electric utility deregulation and tort reform, and these guys are helpful for the governor on his education reform."
Mr. McClellan said electric deregulation, tort reform and education reform all had strong bipartisan support in Texas and disputed any characterization of a deal.

HEADLINE: Bush Has Much to Finesse In Trip to Japan and Korea 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Barely a month ago, the first two stops on President Bush's Far East tour -- Tokyo and Seoul -- had all the markings of a makeup class, routine stopovers in a trip that was hastily cut in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.
 Since then, Mr. Bush's regional tour, which begins in Tokyo on Sunday, has taken on new urgency, and Asian political analysts say the American president now faces delicate maneuvering in both places. 
 In Japan, Mr. Bush must somehow find a way to encourage meaningful reform in Tokyo without going back on a longtime pledge not to lecture this country over its economic management. 
In Korea, he must soothe the hurt feelings of a president whose prestige was built in large part on tireless efforts to reconcile with North Korea, a country Mr. Bush recently called part of an "axis of evil."
Neither task will be easy. 
Only a few weeks ago, support for Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, seemed unassailably strong in public opinion polls. While the Japanese economy may have seemed stubbornly adrift, there was scant feeling of crisis.
Then Mr. Koizumi's perceived mishandling of the dismissal of a popular foreign minister cut sharply into his popularity, and, at the same time, the gravity of the country's deflationary crisis has come into sharper focus.
Since World War II, the government of Japan has always incorporated pressure from Washington, known as "giatsu"; far from systematically resenting the interference, successful prime ministers have used it in support of their programs. 
So after nearly 10 months of inaction, Mr. Koizumi's government has announced a flurry of efforts to fight deflation and to revive a moribund banking sector. If past practice is any indication, he will try to use the Bush visit to cow his opponents, many within his own party. 
But with 60 percent of Japanese now saying they doubt Mr. Koizumi's ability to carry out reforms, some predict that once Mr. Bush leaves, the same inertia that has plagued Mr. Koizumi will quickly return. 
"Koizumi will use Bush's visit to speed up passage of his deflation package, but this country is paralyzed because people don't understand what is going on yet," said Masaru Tamamoto, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. "People still don't know what's hit them. They don't have any ideas on how to resolve these economic problems."
Japan's importance for Washington goes far beyond the country's status as the world's second-largest economy. With Japan seemingly stuck in neutral, worries are growing that its ability to carry its weight internationally -- particularly as a counterbalance to China -- may be declining.
"Unfortunately, Japan has been suffering economic woes for many years and there is danger that its important leadership role may be undermined if its economy deteriorates further," James Kelly, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told Congress recently.
In Seoul, meanwhile, where Mr. Bush will travel on Tuesday, the problems are mostly of Mr. Bush's own making. The President's "axis of evil" phrase has further weakened South Korea's lame-duck president, Kim Dae Jung, politically and personally, and has generated strong, if mostly veiled, tensions between the traditionally close allies.
Senior officials in Seoul worry openly about what they describe as Mr. Bush's penchant for blunt talk, and after a visit by Mr. Kim to Washington in March, in which Mr. Bush spoke harshly about the North Koreans at a joint news conference, they now describe the South Korean president as gun-shy. 
Aides said that Mr. Kim has been spending much of the last few days in near seclusion, in preparation for Mr. Bush's visit.
"The mood around the president has been very serious lately, because no one can be certain about what Bush is doing," said a senior South Korean official. "We are not altogether optimistic about this visit. President Bush obviously has his own ideas, and now we are aware that he might say something that we would rather he didn't say."
Senior South Korean officials say they will strongly reaffirm their country's alliance with the United States, but say that they will also press for more vigorous efforts by Washington to engage the North Korean government.
"They've been saying they are open for discussion for a long time," said a senior official who was referring to the Bush Administration. "We want something that goes beyond general declarations."

HEADLINE: Backward on Global Warming 

 BODY:
The obvious conclusion to be drawn from President Bush's latest global warming strategy, unveiled this week, is that he does not regard warming as a problem. There seems no other way to interpret a policy that would actually increase the gases responsible for heating the earth's atmosphere. That the policy demands little from the American people, while insulting allies who have agreed to take tough steps to deal with the problem, only adds to one's sense of dismay. 
 The White House described Mr. Bush's strategy as aggressive and bold. The only thing bold about it are accounting tactics worthy of Enron that are designed to make an increase in emissions look like a decrease. 
 The plan is voluntary and consists mainly of tax credits and other incentives to encourage Americans to limit emissions. There is nothing wrong with voluntary measures or with the credits. Several American companies have already reduced emissions on their own, partly for environmental reasons and partly because the efficiencies required to achieve reductions make economic sense. 
But these piecemeal efforts have been undertaken largely in the expectation that at some point the United States would join in a collective attack on the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which mainstream scientists now agree could trigger unwelcome changes in the earth's climate. Mr. Bush has refused to join that effort, abandoning his campaign pledge to limit carbon emissions and renouncing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committing industrialized nations to mandatory reductions of carbon and other greenhouse gases. 
Mr. Bush's long-awaited substitute for Kyoto is a disappointment. The essence of his strategy is a concept that seems to have been minted for the occasion, called "emissions intensity," under which carbon dioxide pollution would be allowed to grow, but at a slower rate than economic output. That sounds attractive, but it misses the point. The buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, already alarmingly high, is a cumulative process. Thus the name of the game is to stop adding new emissions to the vast amounts already up there, not simply to slow their growth.
Yet that is all Mr. Bush is proposing to do, meanwhile dressing up his meager agenda with some squirrely math. He first posits an increase in emissions that is higher and more rapid than the forecasts of his own Energy Department. Then, from this "business-as-usual" baseline, he promises reductions of 18 percent in the next 10 years. By his own figures, however, actual emissions -- the ones that count -- could rise by 14 percent, which is exactly the rate at which they have been rising for the last 10 years.
Mr. Bush's speech also included proposals aimed at reducing three other pollutants largely unrelated to global warming: mercury, sulfur dioxide -- the main cause of acid rain -- and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to urban smog. The president called for stronger, mandatory caps on all three pollutants and for market-based mechanisms like emissions trading to help companies meet those targets. Mr. Bush would substitute this "cap and trade" approach for the complex system of regulations that now govern clean air enforcement.
In principle, these are fine ideas. But before disposing of the existing regulatory structure, Congress must be fully satisfied that the president's proposals will in fact achieve the sizable reductions he and his senior associates say they will. We cannot abandon existing law for a promise. Meanwhile, Congress is obliged to do something, and soon, to develop a credible national strategy on global warming. On this score Mr. Bush has fallen well short of the mark.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED; 
In Cheney's Words: 'Our Role Is Clear'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Vice President Dick Cheney's speech yesterday to the Council on Foreign Relations, as transcribed by Federal News Service Inc. The full text is available on the Web at nytimes.com/world.
 Throughout the time that I've been a member of the council, most of our debates were defined by the cold war. When America's great enemy suddenly disappeared, many wondered what new direction our foreign policy would take. 
 We spoke, as always, of long-term problems and regional crises throughout the world, but there was no single immediate, global threat that any roomful of experts could agree upon. 
All of that changed five months ago. The threat is known and our role is clear now. 
We face an enemy that is determined to kill Americans by any means, on any scale and on our soil. We're dealing with a terror network that has cells in 60 countries. Such a group cannot be held back by deterrence nor reasoned with through diplomacy. 
For this reason, the war against terror will not end in a treaty. There will be no summit meeting, no negotiations with terrorists. This conflict can only end in their complete and utter destruction.
The attacks of Sept. 11 confront us with a whole new set of considerations, from our ongoing vulnerability to international terrorism to the possibility that terrorists may someday gain access to weapons of mass destruction. 
In the rubble of Afghanistan we found confirmation, if any were needed, that bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network were seriously interested in nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. It's one thing to have that sort of issue discussed in policy seminars; it's quite another to have in your hand documents clearly describing their aspirations and plans for acquiring these capabilities so that they can use them against the United States or our friends and allies around the world. 
We have a responsibility to answer that growing threat. 
With all of the urgency that is required, we will work to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons, or allowing them to provide those weapons to terrorists. 
Many nations throughout the West, in Asia and in the Islamic world are joined with us in a broad coalition against terror. The response we've seen is a model for diplomatic and military cooperation in the face of common danger and a tribute to the leadership of the president of the United States. 
I've seen President Bush bring this coalition together with great steadiness and skill, working with old allies, seeking new ones, consulting every day with other leaders, laying the groundwork for a sustained, unified and successful campaign. 
America has friends and allies in this cause, but only we can lead it. Only we can rally the world in a task of this complexity against an enemy so elusive and so resourceful. The United States and only the United States can see this effort through to victory. 
This responsibility did not come to us by chance.
We are in a unique position because of our unique assets, because of the character of our people, the strength of our ideals, the might of our military and the enormous economy that supports it. 
We cannot take these for granted, and President Bush does not. He has proposed, as you know, the largest increase in spending for national security in a generation. The skill and bravery of our troops and the power of their equipment to protect America and our friends and allies is at stake. The precision of our weapons can spare the lives of innocent civilians. 
Yet modern warfare is expensive. In Afghanistan, the effort has cost more than $30 million a day. We must also remember that the time frames involved run very long in the military. The forces we'll have to defend us 10 or 20 years hence must be planned and built today.

 THE CHASTENING
Inside the Crisis That Rocked the Global
Financial System and Humbled the IMF.
By Paul Blustein.
431 pp. New York:
PublicAffairs. $30.
 It is hard to resist a bit of instant nostalgia for the 1990's, an era when Americans felt so safe that they could fixate on Monica Lewinsky. The stock market rose ever upward. Crime rates fell ever downward. And wars conveniently confined themselves to faraway places. If history is a record of the crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind, as Gibbon said, then, as far as Americans were concerned, the 1990's were a holiday from history. 
But you don't have to look far below the glittering surface of that decade to discover that history was, in fact, still in motion. It is not just that Osama bin Laden and his ilk were busy hatching their plots in the caves of Afghanistan. The global economy was always much shakier than most people imagined. One of the most severe economic crises since World War II occurred in 1998, a crisis of confidence that swept through the developing world and even threatened to spread to the United States. 
It started as a little local difficulty in Thailand in July 1997. But by the time it had played itself out, much of the developing world had been devastated, as currencies were undermined and credit dried up. The victims included not only such notorious basket cases as Russia but also such paragons of economic progress as Indonesia, which had a quarter-century of solid economic growth behind it. 
The most optimistic interpretation that can be placed on the crisis was that it proved that "crony capitalism" is incompatible with open capital markets: that politicians who try to rig the market in favor of relatives or friends will eventually have to pay an economic price. But even if the turmoil taught valuable lessons, it nevertheless imposed "bone-carving pain" across Asia, most of it borne by people who had never profited from their connections with the powerful. In Indonesia, economic output shrank by more than 14 percent in 1998 and millions of people lost their jobs. In South Korea, wages of the average worker fell by 10 percent and unemployment rose to nearly 9 percent. 
And the crisis did not stop in the developing world. In the fall of 1998, Long-Term Capital Management, a gigantic hedge fund, collapsed, threatening to paralyze the financial system of the United States. Many senior policy makers concluded that Armageddon was around the corner. At one dinner party during that year's International Monetary Fund-World Bank meeting, the assembled pooh-bahs delivered such gloomy speeches that one Georgetown socialite left in terror. "My God," she said, "we're all going to be buying canned goods!" 
Paul Blustein, a business reporter for The Washington Post, had a ringside seat during all this. And in "The Chastening" he tells the story with admirable aplomb. He is at his best when bringing the I.M.F. to book -- and in particular when contrasting the fund's elevated image of itself with its somewhat humdrum performance. 
The I.M.F. likes to think of itself as the guardian of economic orthodoxy: a priesthood that is open only to people who command a complicated science and who are willing to pursue the long-term good of the economy, however much it hurts in the short run. Most important I.M.F. officials have spent their entire careers at the fund. Their outlook is summed up in an internal memorandum that described the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia as "a misallocation of resources." 
But this worldview has always been a bit of an illusion. The I.M.F. is inevitably involved in making political decisions -- something that its members are singularly ill trained to do. And the enormous explosion of private markets over the last couple of decades has hugely reduced their ability to pursue even their narrower economic objectives. 
Blustein demonstrates with an overwhelming wealth of anecdotal detail that the guardians of the world's financial stability were often making it up as they went along. They failed to see the storm coming. And they frequently engaged in petty-minded bureaucratic squabbles with rival organizations. The situation was made all the more desperate by the fact that the Asian division of the I.M.F. was something of a backwater -- reflecting the prevailing view that Asia was doing fine and needed little attention. The brightest economists within the fund gravitated to Latin America and Europe. 
The I.M.F. has always attracted criticism from the left and the right. But its handling of the Asian crisis proved so clumsy that even mainstream economists who shared its basic philosophy -- belief in free markets tempered by a safety net -- joined in the criticism. Objections came not only from distinguished academics like Martin Feldstein and Jeffrey Sachs but even from the chief economist of the I.M.F.'s sister institution, the World Bank. The I.M.F. itself, which spent much of 1998 arrogantly insisting that it was doing the right thing, has now conceded that it made basic mistakes. 
"The Chastening" is a little hard going at times. The problem is that the characters that Blustein draws with such verve are -- how can one put it politely? -- a bit on the dull side. Even Dickens would have struggled with Michael Mussa -- balding, bespectacled and a lifelong bachelor," who "tended to stand nervously sipping a drink at social gatherings, unless he was stimulated with a remark or question about economics." But it is worth persevering for two reasons. 
The first is that the book is thoroughly sensible. Blustein points out that the most popular solutions to the I.M.F.'s problems are as impractical as they are mutually contradictory. Getting rid of the fund completely risks allowing economic crises to run out of control. Giving the I.M.F. the power to print its own money is a nonstarter with Congress. Blustein has a few modest suggestions of his own. Most sensible is his idea of forcing private creditors to join in the I.M.F.'s rescue efforts -- a device that worked triumphantly in South Korea in December 1997 and again in Brazil in 1999. 
The second reason is that we could well see a repeat of the crisis of 1998. That year the Federal Reserve had plenty of room to slash interest rates. But this time the outlook appears much darker. President Bush's economic team is far less impressive than was President Clinton's. And the Federal Reserve has few weapons left in its armory. Islamist terrorism is not the only horror that America has to worry about.

HEADLINE: Into Thin Air 

BYLINE:  By Roger Lowenstein; Roger Lowenstein is the author of "When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management."

 BODY:
On the evening of Sept. 10, negotiators for the C.E.O. of United Airlines, James Goodwin, huddled in Washington with union officials representing United's 30,000 baggage handlers, customer-service representatives and reservation agents. They were putting the finishing touches on an agreement for a hefty double-digit wage increase, and Goodwin, a tall, likable West Virginian who had been with the company 34 years, was waiting for a call to give his O.K. It didn't matter that United, which had lost $605 million in the first half of 2001, was in a financial tailspin: when airline unions are due for a raise, they get one. If you don't understand why, then you don't understand the airline business. 
 As it happened, the talks dragged on, and at 5:30 on the morning of the 11th, the negotiators trudged off to get a few winks. Randy Canale, a union negotiator, returned to his hotel, the Capital Hilton, not far from the Pentagon, figuring they would sign later that day. He awoke earlier than expected, to the sound of sirens. "Boy, it sounds awful close," Canale murmured. Someone was banging on his door, and puffs of smoke were visible from the hotel window. Two of United's jets were down, the wage hike was history and so was the 57-year-old Goodwin's career. Seven weeks later, he was dismissed by United's board. It hardly mattered that United's directors would have approved the agreement and were as much to blame as Goodwin. They were letting him go for a way of doing business that has tormented United and the entire industry for decades. 
 Since 1978, when commercial aviation was deregulated, no fewer than 137 carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection. And from the end of World War II, when aviation started to become big business, through 1994, the sum of the industry's profits and losses was less than zero. Warren E. Buffett once remarked that it would have been a blessing for shareholders if someone had thought to shoot down Orville Wright at Kitty Hawk.
This is the industry that Congress has rushed to save, and this is the record that -- failing basic changes -- it will have helped to perpetuate. Indeed, even as it reels from last year's record $3.8 billion operating loss, United is facing the possibility of a strike by its mechanics, pending a vote on a proposed 37 percent wage hike this past week. If this rings faintly of "Alice in Wonderland," well, that is because airlines are not like other businesses, where competition breeds variety and choice for consumers and profits for business. They are more like flying utilities. As passengers, we demand quality service -- on-time takeoffs, edible food, plenty of leg room -- and don't much care who provides it, as long as they make it cheap. That leaves the airlines with the dubious honor of competing to be the Ma Bell, the Con Ed, of the sky. 
One reason the major airlines find themselves in this predicament is that they use huge amounts of fixed capital -- wide-body jets go for $100 million each and can't be readily liquidated. They also depend on a skilled labor force. The two problems exacerbate each other. Since airlines cannot afford to let planes sit idle, they can ill suffer strikes. That makes their unions unusually powerful. Consider some other businesses for a moment: Microsoft has highly skilled programmers but little invested capital. Merrill Lynch has both, but its assets -- stocks and bonds mostly -- could be liquidated overnight. Steel has high fixed capital, but it can replace its workers more easily. 
Airline pilots (and mechanics too) are not so replaceable. Stringent safety codes strengthen the unions further by introducing a stickiness into the rules that govern hiring and firing. Any other industry would compensate by raising fares, but air travel is a commodity, so the temptation is always to cut fares to fill seats.
None of this was caused by the attack on the World Trade Center. But until then, it was possible to believe that airlines were turning a corner. Even though they were losing money in 2001, they had recently enjoyed some good years, thanks to genuine improvements in their operations. They had learned to manage their fleets more efficiently, they had structured their routes better and they had cut overhead. 
United was emblematic of the airlines' ephemeral prosperity. In the late 1990's, it reported $4 billion in profits, and its route map, stretching over four continents, was the envy of the industry. Most strikingly, it had ventured a daring solution to the industry's thorniest problem -- labor -- by selling a majority of its stock to its employees. 
But despite this groundbreaking arrangement, United was never able to fully align the interests of its employees, particularly the pilots, with its own. Rick Dubinsky, longtime head of the AirLine Pilots Association at United, made this clear when he and Goodwin began a recent wage negotiation. "We don't want to kill the golden goose," Dubinsky told Goodwin. "We just want to choke it by the neck until it gives us every last egg." 
On Sept. 11, the goose ran out of eggs.
In five months, United's traffic has shrunk by, on average, a quarter, fares are down and two of its fleets lie mothballed in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Meanwhile, it has been begging senior pilots, who can earn close to $300,000 a year, to sit home and collect a full 80 percent of their pay for doing nothing; otherwise, they can remain on the premises, though inactive, at full pay. This is why by the end of 2002 United stands to lose every penny it made in the previous five years -- and why bankruptcy for one of the nation's largest and most venerable airlines looms as a real possibility.
United's modern history started in 1985, when Richard Ferris, the C.E.O. at the time, boldly challenged his pilots. The underlying issue -- then, and in every subsequent dispute -- was management's desire to break the contractual stranglehold inherited from regulation. Before 1978, fares were set by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which generally let carriers pass along their costs. Such a cozy set-up naturally bred inefficiency (banks were similarly slothful in the days of managed interest rates), and airlines got used to rubber-stamping union demands. Eventually, they approved a byzantine system of work rules sought by pilots and other employees. Come deregulation, competition intensified, air fares dropped and more people started flying. But the stifling work rules remained and so, of course, did safety constraints and also antitrust concerns preventing mergers. In effect, aviation became deregulated only on one side: free competition for revenue; costs largely immovable.
Ferris tried to win points by befriending the pilots. He started flying, got a license and took some union members under his wing. For a while, it worked. Attacking a brazen case of featherbedding, he got the union to agree to cut the number of pilots in the cockpits of Boeing 737's from three to two. But when he tried to impose a lower wage scale for newly hired pilots -- as Robert Crandall had done at American -- the pilots went on strike.
The head of the union's strike committee, Dubinsky, was nicknamed Mad Dog. The son of a butcher, he was hired by United in 1965 at a measly $500 a month. He flew the tobacco route: Winston-Salem, Raleigh-Durham, Chattanooga. In the pilot culture of the day, captains were virtual gods and young flight engineers like Dubinsky received barely more respect than the stewardesses. Dubinsky, though, found a vent for his aggressiveness. He started doing small chores for the AirLine Pilots Association and then handling grievances, and the union discovered that he was a badger. By 1985, he was brimming with class-conscious fervor. The pilots, despite their political conservatism and sense of themselves as professional people, heeded him. Pilots make good money but lack the free agency of other professionals. If a United pilot moves to Delta or American, he loses his seniority and most of his pay. That makes him utterly dependent on the union -- and makes the union a potent force. 
Ferris hired replacements to keep United flying, and the pilots returned after 29 days, taking the offer Ferris had on the table. The strike was over, but permanent damage had been done. A certain culture, an implacable Arab-Israeli-like hatred, took hold at the airline, and nobody has been able to dislodge it since. More significant, United's experience helped spread fear through the industry. Airlines began to leapfrog one another, granting successively better terms at each negotiation -- anything to avoid a strike.
Today, thanks to generous vacations, sick-leave provisions and clauses that fix minimums for days worked and trips flown, United pilots get paid for 81 hours a month but actually fly, on average, only 50 hours. Considering that a Boeing 747-400 captain gets a top rate of $302 an hour, you can see what a drain this is. Though pilots spend many nights away from home, a hardship that is worth some extra compensation, they freely admit that flying, on most days, is hardly the risky proposition it was when the first contracts were penned. "It's not a hard job for a guy that has been around," says one 40-year-old United pilot I talked to. "Because of advances in technology, we have great airplanes to fly." Their flexible schedules allow many pilots to carry on second careers. 
By 1986, Ferris decided that United couldn't make money just flying planes. So he stitched together a hotel and car-rental conglomerate, aiming to use the airline to feed the travel businesses -- synergy! He paid a consultant $7 million to rename United's parent the Allegis Corporation. Wall Street snickered. The pilots did not. They feared that Ferris would divert capital into the other divisions until the airline was a rump operation and then start cutting jobs.
The ALPA adviser was the illustrious F. Lee Bailey, and he told them that their jobs would never be safe unless they really took control -- a message that the pilots, being pilots, were happy to hear. Dubinsky and Bailey flew to Chicago to meet with a leader of the International Association of Machinists and dropped a proposal for an employee buyout into his lap. 
The machinists didn't like it. Presciently, they saw the plan as leaving workers to bargain with themselves, an obvious conflict. But Dubinsky made his bid public. It was a strange time on Wall Street, in which anybody could seemingly acquire anyone else and companies were said to be worth more dead than alive. Coniston Partners, a hedge fund, bought a chunk of stock and agitated for a breakup. The board, feeling pressured, sacked Ferris and agreed to sell the travel assets. Stephen Wolf, a veteran of two previous airline turnarounds, was named C.E.O. late in 1987.
After briefly joining with ALPA to attempt a high-priced buyout (which, when it failed, set off the stock-market crash of October 1989), Wolf embarked on an expansion kick, snatching up international routes and ordering $22 billion worth of equipment. His competitors followed suit. Since wages rise sharply with experience, airlines were desperate to hire younger crews. "So how do you get more new pilots?" says Harry C. Pinson, an investment banker who worked with Wolf. "You grow the airline." 
The logic was so compelling that airlines bought many more planes than they needed. In aviation, such capital mistakes don't go away. Equipment is so expensive that once a plane is delivered it must be flown. Even carriers that file for bankruptcy limp along for years, usually operating at lower costs and undercutting the rest. 
Wolf discovered this in 1990, when conflict in the Mideast and a recession at home (sound familiar?) sent the industry into a nose dive. Making matters worse, Southwest, then a relative upstart, was tormenting the industry and, in particular, stealing United's traffic in California. 
As losses mounted, Wolf clamored for union givebacks. He and Dubinsky began to shadowbox. When United ordered new 747's, a dispute with the pilots' union kept them parked on a ramp. When United tried to start service to India, the pilots delayed it by demanding private restrooms and Western food. Dubinsky kept up the pressure, but his time was running out. His term at ALPA expired. (He lost an effort to rescind a term-limits clause and wrote an acid farewell remembered within the union as "the Nixon letter.") Wolf, a tall, aloof C.E.O. who arrived at United's headquarters near O'Hare Airport at 6 each morning, seized the opportunity. He sold off the flight kitchens, which made the machinists fear that their jobs would be next. Then, with their cooperation, Wolf and the pilots, now led by Roger Hall, a less tempestuous chief, cobbled together an audacious employee stock-ownership plan. 
Similar ideas had been tried at Northwest and Eastern, but never with workers in control -- that was what bred such hope at United. The pilots, machinists and nonunion salaried employees (the flight attendants opted out) got three board directors, various control provisions and, critically, 55 percent of the stock. The pilots, the biggest bloc, got 25 percent, in exchange for an equivalent percentage cut in wages and benefits. 
A new era of worker-management cooperation was born. Optimism ran high. Robert Reich, the secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, gushed that the employee-ownership plan "could change the face of the airline industry." But there was one devastating oversight: yes, you could turn employees into owners, but could you get them to act that way? Could you get them to place the same value on their stock as on their weekly paychecks? 
The difficulty, as Dubinsky would shrewdly observe when he was back battling United management, is that "you can't eat stock" -- particularly when employees were barred from selling their shares until retirement. In any case, airlines had never generated value for their stockholders. Donald Washburn, a former executive at Northwest Airlines, has observed that airlines are merely "cash accumulators for other constituencies" -- the various government entities that tax it, the cartel that sells it equipment and the industry's bankers. Its hungriest constituent is labor, which gobbles up nearly 40 percent of operating expenses. The employee buyout temporarily lowered wages, but it didn't change these dismal economics. Arguably, it weakened United. The pilots had always sought control; now they could pursue it from inside the boardroom.
As owners, the pilots could pick their own C.E.O., and they did: Gerald Greenwald, famed for helping save Chrysler and fresh from running a trucking concern in newly capitalist Czechoslovakia. When Greenwald told his Czech managers that he was leaving to take over the new worker-owned United, one of them stared incredulously. "We just finished with all that," he said.
Greenwald figured that with workers owning a stake, their interests would have to shift. So he invited pilots and mechanics into strategy sessions and consulted with Fortune to learn how to qualify for the magazine's list of 100 most desirable companies to work for.
Many pilots caught the spirit. Absenteeism declined. A captain in Chicago cleaned food trays to shorten turnaround times. And miraculously the good times started to roll. United's stock, $22 when the ownership plan began, broke $90 three years later. (Today it is $12.) Partly, airlines were the beneficiaries of good fortune: fuel prices were low and the economy was strong. But they also had learned to be more efficient, eliminating frills, reducing commissions to travel agents, reaping savings from automatic check-in. Unlike in the previous decade, most avoided the trap of overexpanding. Greenwald strengthened his hubs and eliminated unprofitable, marginal routes. He also enhanced United's unmatched network overseas. These were heady days for the big airlines, as they finally capitalized on the promises of deregulation.
Except for one little thing. They still could not keep wages under control.
Through the 90's, airline wages rose 43 percent, just slightly above inflation. Not bad until you consider that air fares rose only 6 percent. This was, significantly, a time when other industries were holding the line on every conceivable employee benefit. Only the airline industry, shackled by 40-year traditions, continued to kneel to its unions. The regional airlines are a perfect illustration. These carriers, like American Eagle or United Express, fly under the majors' flags and serve an essential role connecting smaller cities to hubs. They also pay their pilots, most of whom are represented by ALPA, significantly lower wages. The business has grown smartly, thanks to a new generation of high-performance jets, but the unions don't like these smaller planes and the lower wages that go with them, so they have successfully negotiated "scope clauses" that limit the size and number of regional jets that a major can hire out. 
If it were up to the market, a new-generation, 50-seat Canadair might fly from New York to Chicago at off hours, when there wasn't demand for a DC-9 or a Boeing 737. Presumably, that would result in more flexibility and choice for customers. But scope clauses, a bit of protectionism that seems wildly out of place in the 21st century, make it extremely difficult. 
With their hands tied on costs, airlines turned their attention to revenues. In the 90's, they perfected the art of "yield management," exploiting computers to monitor bookings continuously and adjust ticket prices according to availability. Yield management is why you can pay $1,000 to fly coast to coast and sit next to someone who paid $200. It is also why so many people hate the airlines. 
It may seem unfair, but to an airline economist, the passenger -- say a student heading home for the holidays -- who books in advance and the executive who sidles up to the counter without a reservation are not buying the same "product," even if they are on the same flight. One is buying a surplus seat, akin to last year's sweater on the bargain rack. The other is buying that sweater when it's hot.
It is a good business tactic, but the airlines overplayed it. During the late 90's, they jacked up the premium for business fares as never before. I.P.O. money rained on Wall Street, and plenty of it got spent on plane tickets. United's San Francisco hub, a gateway to Silicon Valley, became a gold mine. 
Airline unions exploited the boom to demand higher wages, but the good times for airlines -- flying utilities, remember? -- were never good enough. In one recent year, carriers filled 72.4 percent of their seats, just a tad more than their break-even level of 70.4 percent. What this means is that on a typical flight, the entire profit was generated by the last three passengers. From 1995 to 1999, the industry's best half-decade ever, airlines earned only 3 1/2 cents on every dollar of sales, whereas American industry typically earns 6 cents. And through the full cycle -- that is, for all of the 1990's -- airlines made less than a pitiable penny for every dollar of sales.
If this were another industry, C.E.O.'s would be forced to resign in disgrace, but airline execs were buoyed. At United, Greenwald gave the pilots and machinists consecutive 5 percent wage hikes, the maximum allowed by the terms of the ownership plan. Then the unions demanded a "snap back" to take effect in 2000, restoring them to pre-ownership levels. Greenwald consented and, remarkably, so did United's board. It may be unkind to say the company lived in fear of upsetting its employees, but everyone, especially at United, knew what the unions were capable of doing.
Meanwhile, management's relations with the AirLine Pilots Association deteriorated. As Greenwald neared retirement from United in 1999, the union nixed his choice of successor; instead, the pilots tapped Goodwin, a company man that many deemed controllable. As negotiations started for the first post-ownership contract, the drumbeat rose for a more confrontational approach -- rose, that is, for Dubinsky. The rank and file were mostly unaware that while out of office, Dubinsky had been busy suing his own union. He would soon collect a six-figure settlement paid from his pilots' dues. No matter. With a big negotiation looming, the union's 26-member governing body voted him in. 
United's pilots were counting on a contract by April 2000, when the ownership plan expired. The deadline was unrealistic, and it gave Dubinsky a cudgel to wield against the company. Goodwin compounded his problem when, late in 1999, he and Wolf -- who was now running US Airways -- began to plot a merger. The timing was suicidal.
Dubinsky, as a board member, was informed of the talks but could not disclose them to the rank and file. He certainly knew the pilots would oppose a merger, because many would lose seniority to US Airways pilots. Thus, Dubinsky had every reason not to conclude a contract until the merger was announced. By early 2000, wage negotiations, predictably, had stalled, and United's increasingly impatient pilots were getting stickers from the union reading, "On Top/On Time." They put them on flight bags, in the cockpit, everywhere. 
As the deadline neared, Dubinsky reminded his pilots that they weren't obligated to fly overtime, as they normally did, and that they should fly "to the letter of our agreement" -- a euphemism for going slow. Late flights began to mount. Passengers went nuts. Goodwin was living a nightmare.
In May, he announced the merger, and the war with the pilots reignited. The nasty labor sore, bandaged but never healed, oozed with all the ugliness of the past. The pilots refused to fly overtime; some of them taxied at 3 knots instead of 15; others flew low, to burn more fuel, or opened landing gear prematurely, adding to wear and tear. Delays and cancellations soared; United, notably, suffered a fourfold increase in delays caused by pilots insisting on repairing inconsequential items, like a broken coffee maker or a burned-out reading light.
A pilot in California walked off a full 747, claiming nerves. An executive from a competing airline tells the story of a United flight from Los Angeles to J.F.K. when the captain announced that because of "low clouds" he wanted to recheck his instruments. They sat for three hours. The pilots were sabotaging their own company.
They did have reason to be upset. United, having grown more quickly than US Airways, had far more newer hires. Pilots feared for their careers and were infuriated that their counterparts at a weaker airline might supplant them -- especially since, they reckoned, management was paying for the deal with the very money it had saved on pilot wages. 
Their anger was, of course, given a significant push from ALPA. Geoff Garrett, a United pilot from Seattle, says, "I never received an order to slow down." However, he admits, there was peer pressure. Pilots who flew overtime would see their names tacked to a bulletin board, and those who arrived on time got flack for "not flying safe." Mysteriously, an unsigned publication, The Gardener, began to turn up in cockpits, often in pilots' sun visors. The Gardener was a colored sheet written in country vernacular, reminding pilots to "fly safe" and so forth. Many pilots think it was produced by the Industrial Relations Committee, a secretive wing of ALPA formed by Dubinsky during the strike. 
I asked Dubinsky about United's dismal summer -- 20,000 flights were canceled and on-time performance fell to 40 percent, disruptions that cost the airline $700 million. He said: "The company was short on manpower; we told them that. And the weather was terrible. Also, our pilots decided to not fly overtime." Does that mean there was no coordinated effort? "That's what I'm telling you. If there had been, they could have taken us to federal court."
In fact, United's management had hotly debated whether to do that. Many were in favor, but Goodwin, who had the longest tenure and remembered the 1985 strike vividly, was unwilling to further antagonize the pilots. 
And so in August, Goodwin agreed to an immediate pay raise of 22 to 28 percent and to additional 4.5 percent raises in each successive year through 2004. This pace-setting and lavish package stunned United's competitors, who had, of course, been guilty of no less in their turn. 
Then the bottom dropped out. By 2001, high tech had gone bust, and big corporations like Hewlett-Packard, Cisco and Accenture were taking a hatchet to travel budgets. "We aren't talking about single-digit cuts," notes Jake Brace, United's chief financial officer. "Some of them reduced their flying by 25 to 50 percent." 
These two grim developments were capped by a third misfortune when, last spring, the department of transportation blocked United's merger with US Airways. Thus, in the space of a year, United had suffered punishing blows from labor, the government and the economy -- a modest summary of the industry's troubles since deregulation. All that was before Sept. 11.
After the tragedy, Goodwin eliminated 20,000 jobs, but a cruel twist of businesses with high fixed capital, like aviation, is that cutbacks often worsen the problem. Though United saved 23 percent in expenses, it lost a whopping 39 percent in revenue. One reason is that union rules dictate that each pilot be able to bid for a better assignment (the bigger the plane, the higher the pay) whenever a vacancy opens. So while United furloughed 591 of its 10,500 pilots, it was also forced to retrain hundreds for new assignments, an enormous waste. "Now you have a ton of people being paid and not flying," notes Herb Hunter, an ALPA spokesman. "When they talk about laying off, you get to a point of diminishing returns."
This is why airlines cannot cut their way to solvency; needing cash to service debt on those $100 million jets, they must keep selling assets, a downward spiral charted by the dearly departed Pan American. Realizing this, Goodwin warned that without concessions from labor, United could "perish." The unions demanded his head. 
Over the years, major airlines have improved just enough for most to survive -- to limp from crisis to crisis, to turn a small profit occasionally -- but not to build lasting equity. And increasingly they are haunted by Southwest, haunted because they can never match it. Southwest is in a different business from United, and its model is infuriatingly simple: it flies a single aircraft type, greatly reducing the cost of training pilots and mechanics, with no frills or first class, mostly on point-to-point routes and usually from secondary, less congested airports. Its Boeing 737's land and take off in only 20 minutes -- unthinkable for planes connecting through hubs -- and its pilots usually fly more than 70 hours a month, far more than at American, Delta and United. 
The traditional carriers, whose systems are built around hubs, can't do this. United's Chicago hub, for instance, draws customers from all over the Midwest, including people in smaller cities connecting to the coasts. Like the old phone company, this fulfills a vital need, but it is much more costly. 
Jack W. Creighton Jr., United's new C.E.O., has become the latest chief to demand concessions from each employee group. He faces heavy sledding because United's mechanics, as well as its baggage personnel and ticket agents, are still working at pre-ownership-plan (1994) wages. They want a raise, like the pilots got, before they think about concessions. If the mechanics do not accept Creighton's offer and vote to strike, Congress, with the White House's authorization, could impose a settlement. And the White House has been signaling that it will tolerate fewer airline strikes in the future. 
So is government the answer to shareholders' prayers? Not exactly. Federal arbitration boards tend to resolve disputes by slicing down the middle, generally pleasing nobody. But they do force both sides to talk. And Creighton has held serious discussions with the AirLine Pilots Association. For now, they are talking only wage concessions -- not the work rule amendments that would be needed for United (and Delta, American, et al.) to join the rest of the 21st century. But the talks raise the germ of a possibility. 
ALPA is demanding something in return for wage cuts. Since the value of the employees' stock from the ownership plan has crashed from $5 billion to about $750 million, they certainly won't take more of that. But Creighton and the union have talked about linking wage cuts, in some fashion, to United's profits or revenues. This brings to mind something Dubinsky -- at year-end, when he was retiring -- told me over vodkas in a restaurant near O'Hare. People say the pilots are self-destructive, he acknowledged, "but we aren't crazy." Meaning even pilots will ultimately do what is in their interest.
That is what's so interesting about Southwest, which has been able to co-opt its workers (who also are unionized) into behaving like owners. For sure, relationships with unions are multifaceted, but one difference at Southwest stands out, which is that workers get much of their annual profit sharing in cash. Maybe you can't eat stock, but you can eat cash. And if wages were to vary with performance, not only would United's labor costs stay tuned to the business cycle but its workers -- just maybe -- would also start to think differently about their employer. Over time, they, and potentially workers at other carriers as well, might be willing to fly more hours, to let the market determine the schedule for regional jets, to let airlines design their networks with profits as the main consideration. It sounds rather radical -- downright subversive in this industry -- but it is no more than what deregulation was supposed to accomplish almost 25 years ago.

HEADLINE: Gary Condit Is Still Running 

BYLINE:  By Frank Bruni; Frank Bruni, a staff writer for the magazine, is author of the coming book "Ambling Into History: The Unlikely Odyssey of George W. Bush."

 BODY:
Gary Condit barrels down the highway in the back seat of a white Ford Excursion, musing about what a faithful and dedicated congressman he has been, when the bleat of his cellphone stops him short. It is not just any call but a warning from an aide at Condit's destination -- a Starbucks in Merced, Calif., where he intends to meet voters -- that reporters have learned about his appearance and are waiting for him. They are, needless to say, not there to tap his thoughts on an economic stimulus package.
 "Somebody has to control that," Condit tells the aide, the kind of wishful instruction he has been issuing for the better part of a year, to little avail. This Saturday morning in late January is no different. The minute he pulls into the Starbucks parking lot and steps out of the Excursion, tape recorders and microphones are inches from his chin. 
 When he tells a television reporter that he wants to talk about issues important to California's 18th Congressional District, she fires back, "One of the issues that's definitely important to voters is your credibility." He moves on, but she presses: "A lot of people think you lied to the Washington police." Condit looks elsewhere, searching the scrum for someone -- anyone -- without a notepad or camera. He settles on a rotund, bearded man who dupes him into what begins as a friendly conversation. 
"I only have one other question," the man says as Condit leans in close to him, the way solicitous politicians on the campaign trail do. "Where did you bury the body?"
Condit flinches and lurches back several steps, as if he has been shot. "You're a joke," he says furiously, then turns away.
"No," the man sputters. "You're a joke."
The day is young. A few hours later, as Condit shakes hands with supporters in the back room of a nearby restaurant, a band of about eight protesters huddles outside on the curb. Their signs -- Gary's Scary," "Fire the Liar" -- are comically blunt. Their words are simply vicious. At one point, when they see a couple who they assume to be Condit supporters leave the restaurant with a young girl in tow, one protester shouts, "Oh, my God. They brought children to this." To which another protester responds, acidly, "Gary might appreciate that."
Condit does not hear most of this, but when he emerges from the restaurant and makes his way -- quickly -- through another parking lot, he is treated to the protesters' preferred chant: "We have not forgotten! Gary Condit's rotten!" He slips into the Excursion and slumps into the back seat, his feet brushing against a box of Twinkies. 
He tells me he is not bothered by the ugliness he encountered. The man at the Starbucks, he says, is a well-known racist angry at Condit for thwarting his efforts to bring the Ku Klux Klan into town -- Condit just did not recognize him at first. As for the other protesters, he says, "Even on your best day, there are people who are going to come and disagree with something you've done." He also points out that there were many more patrons inside the restaurant who posed for pictures with him than antagonists outside who pilloried him.
Which is true. But it is also true that as Condit pursues one of the most unusual and improbable re-election campaigns in recent memory, his poll numbers are abysmal, his fund-raising is pathetic and many important people who once linked arms with him have turned their backs. Although he is a longtime Democratic incumbent in a year in which the Democrats want desperately to recapture the majority in the House -- which usually means holding tight to proven winners -- the party is more or less throwing him overboard, convinced that he is dead in the water. Several of his colleagues from California, including the state's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, have taken the extraordinary step of endorsing his challenger, State Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, in the Democratic primary on March 5.
Even Paul Warda, the prominent local farmer and longtime friend who let Condit use his house for an interview with Connie Chung on ABC's "Primetime Thursday" last summer, has abandoned him, and when I call Warda to talk about Condit, he refuses to comment. That puts him in the company of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the second-highest-ranking Democrat in the House, who used to be one of Condit's staunchest allies but withdrew her endorsement of him in December and has since gone mum. As has former Representative John Kasich, an Ohio Republican who was a good buddy of Condit's -- they went to a Pearl Jam concert together -- but scurries off the phone as soon as I state my business. 
"I don't personalize it," Condit tells me as we ride through the flat Central Valley farmland of what many residents used to call Condit Country, a phrase that underscores how long and large he loomed over its political landscape and how far and fast he came tumbling down. It is a curious statement, but it offers a clue to how and why he forges on. So does the far-fetched parallel he draws between what happened to him after the disappearance of Chandra Levy and what happened to Muhammad Ali after he refused to participate in the draft.
Condit went to see the movie "Ali" a few nights earlier, and it struck him that "there are some messages in that. Here's a guy -- everything had turned on him. He stood up for principle, and the country was going the other way. They caught up with him, eventually. In the short term, it looked like he was doomed. But in the long term, he kept his faith and he kept his principled position, and now look at what we think of Ali."
Gary Condit's principled position, as he defines it, is that even a public figure should not let the news media trudge into the private corners of his life. And his downfall, as he sees it, was his noble refusal to invite them there. Condit's view of his own situation is not widely held, to put it mildly. But in his heart he knows that he is right and that he has been wronged, and he is ready to be redeemed.
Although law-enforcement officials questioned Condit repeatedly after Chandra Levy disappeared from her Washington apartment on May 1, 2001, they never publicly accused him of foul play or tagged him as a suspect in the unsolved case. If you consider those facts and only those facts -- and they are precisely the facts that Condit chooses to consider -- it is not hard to understand his grievance, because he became the news media's most hunted quarry until Sept. 11.
Television crews set up lawn chairs outside his home in Ceres, Calif., near Modesto, and klieg lights outside his condominium building in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood of Washington. Cable news channels turned the story of the 53-year-old Congressman and the 24-year-old intern for the Bureau of Prisons into an all-day, all-night soap opera, opening their doors wide to almost any putative expert with a shrill voice, uninformed opinion and willingness to jettison the presumption of innocence. The scandal pundits feasted on Condit, at least until they had to cede the airwaves to the terrorism pundits and wait for a new day and a next carcass.
The media's excesses have become Condit's obsession when he talks about the last year, and he glides over any mention of his evasions and deceptions, which tilled the soil in which his notoriety flourished. In the beginning, as he sought to quell budding gossip about him and Levy and other affairs, his representatives asked a flight attendant to deny a sexual involvement with him that she nonetheless asserted. Democratic colleagues and Chandra Levy's parents said that Condit deliberately misled them about his involvement with the missing woman, and law-enforcement officials said that he was initially vague with them, his impulse to protect his privacy trumping his potential usefulness to their investigation.
Condit rejected or explained away these complaints, thereby underscoring what he did not ultimately deny: a romantic relationship with Chandra Levy. This he simply refused to discuss (and still does). Advisers counseled him otherwise, arguing that innuendo was best fought with candor. But Condit remained silent, a frightened-looking rabbit darting away from the media wolves.
When he finally agreed in late August to a few interviews, including one with Chung, many Democrats who had yet to forsake him thought and hoped he might come clean. He did not, simply stating and restating that he was not "a perfect man." All but Condit's most ardent supporters thought the interview was a disaster. Polls echoed that assessment, and at the urging of prominent California Democrats, Cardoza, a onetime Condit protege, entered the race.
Condit, it seemed, was finished. Except that he refused to call it quits. The lower he sank and the lonelier his circumstances got, the more he turned outward for explanations and the greater his sense of persecution became. It was other Democrats' fault, because they did not have the mettle to stand by him. It was the Washington Police Department's fault, because it tried to paper over its woeful record for finding missing people by accusing him of obstruction. It was Chung's fault, because she was fixated on Levy and did not let him talk about the lies and inaccuracies in the reporting about him. Above all, it was the rest of the news media's fault, because they set out to punish him for not opening up. "The press -- I think, in my opinion -- decided to teach me a lesson," Condit tells me.
Gary Condit's victimhood is one of the main themes of a private campaign pep rally that he allows me to attend one January night. About 30 stalwart supporters -- trusting people who have known him too long to think anything bad, angry people who believe that life often conspires against the unfortunate -- gather in an upstairs banquet room at a restaurant in Merced, about 40 miles south of Modesto. The pamphlets they are given include a picture of Condit with Nelson Mandela. The signs on the wall say: "We Decide! Not the Media." When Condit comes through the doorway with his wife, Carolyn, and his 34-year-old son, Chad, they are greeted by loud applause. They beam.
Chad Condit tells the small crowd that they are the "foot soldiers" in a righteous crusade. He also says that they have the ability, through a Condit victory, to "rock the nation," and that a fitting slogan for Gary Condit might be "tough as nails." His father promises that if he goes down, he will go down swinging, and so should they. He talks about "people power." "We have a mission," he explains.
There are lighter moments. When the supporters are invited to ask any questions they would like -- an offer without much risk in this crowd -- Chad Condit stretches his arm toward his father and, like a carnival barker, trumpets, "The most sought-after congressman in the world!" 
Gary Condit chuckles. "You don't realize how many people would really like to ask me questions," he says. "So go for it! You've got a free shot." 
"we've gone to the mattresses," Chad Condit tells me from behind a pair of Ray-Bans as he steers his Aunt Leona's white Cadillac around town. He is referring to the Condit family, and he smiles slyly as he explains that the term applies to Mafia clans who band close together, under one roof, during times of war. "We're all bunkered down." In August, Chad and his sister, Cadee, who is 26, abruptly quit their jobs with Gov. Gray Davis, once one of their father's closest Democratic allies, after Davis spoke ill of Condit and was judged by the family as yet another traitor to the cause. 
The Condit kids also gave up their own places and moved into their parents' four-bedroom ranch house on Acorn Lane, which has become the campaign's de facto headquarters; these days, the people running the Condit show are the Condits themselves. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer, and Marina Ein, a public relations consultant, who both tried to coach Condit and control the damage through the cruel summer, decamped shortly after the Chung interview, their mission unaccomplished and their client uncooperative. Now Chad Condit supervises his father's publicity operation. Cadee Condit takes charge of the fund-raising, such as it is. Although her father collected about $180,000 during the first half of 2001, he raised only $34,000 during the last half of the year. His campaign coffers shrunk from about $315,000 in July to $72,000 in December, a result of more than $100,000 in payments to Lowell's firm, almost $17,000 to Ein and $1,000 for a private polygraph test that, according to Condit, proved he had nothing to do with Levy's disappearance.
As others have stopped believing in Condit, his family has rushed in to fill the void, standing closer to him -- and to one another -- than ever before. The first time I see them all together is at a modest fund-raising buffet in the home of a longtime family friend. The price tag is just $50 a head. (Several weeks later, Cardoza will charge $500 for a Washington event that draws party bigwigs.) Carolyn and Cadee Condit stand by the front door, both blond, both petite, both with crosses dangling from their necks, and when I tell them how alike they look, they thank me profusely. Carolyn talks about reincarnation. "If I ever come back," she says in a chirping, bubbly voice, "I want to come back as Cadee." Cadee gazes at her in adoration. "And every day," Cadee says sweetly, "I want to be more like her." They reach out and squeeze one another's forearms. 
When it is time for remarks, Gary stands beside his father, Adrian, a Baptist preacher who lives nearby. Adrian Condit speaks first. "You know, we went through quite an ordeal, a storm," he tells the 50 or so guests. "Well, it wasn't a storm -- it was an Oklahoma tornado." Everybody laughs, but then he lowers his voice and renders a kind of prayer: "Lord, when that day comes, when we go to the polls and cast votes, I'm going to expect Gary to come out on top. I'm going to believe that, because we know that you know that you're always for those who lift up the holy banner of right and good and love and peace."
This conviction contradicts a recent poll by Cardoza that showed Condit trailing Cardoza among Democratic voters, 24 percent to 52 percent. For Condit, it is a stunning reversal of fortune. Since 1989, when he was first elected to Congress, he has regularly received more than 65 percent of the vote. His moderate-to-conservative voting record -- he supports abortion rights, but he wanted the Ten Commandments posted in public buildings -- was in perfect sync with the region's prevailing sensibilities. His federal and local offices were so diligent about constituent services that if you visit Modesto and stop six people at random, you will most likely find two with personal stories about something Condit did to help them. Contrary to his portrayal in many news reports over the last nine months as a flaky yahoo, he is a practiced and polished pol. He talks knowledgeably, authoritatively and smoothly about everything from the collapse of Enron to Central Valley smog.
This is the oddity of his situation: Condit, among all politicians, had built up enough good will and respect to survive the kind of scandal he faced, to be granted the benefit of the doubt and to be forgiven for the Levy affair. So why did he not ask to be? Many Democrats contend that such a request, wrapped in the right kind of contrition, would have saved him. Perhaps he did refuse on principle -- he tells me several times, in a fiery voice, that the news media is "not the church, not the father confessor." But there is clearly more to it than that, including a romantic, self-aggrandizing sense of himself as someone tilting at establishment windmills. When Condit was a California assemblyman in the 1980's, he belonged to a "Gang of Five" renegade Democrats who tried to oust the liberal Democratic speaker Willie Brown. In Washington, Condit helped found the "Blue Dogs," a group of conservative Democrats who constantly buck the party. He relishes the role of disobedient contrarian.
He is stubborn, and he is vain. Acquaintances titter about the photographs of Condit -- on a motorcycle, in Western garb -- that he liked to show off. He now looks like a man trying to appear 25 years younger than he really is. His hair is puffy and frosty, his footwear trendy, his shirt collar open beneath a sporty fleece pullover. But he has new lines around his eyes and hollows beneath his cheekbones: the Condits, all naturally slender, are now positively gaunt, as if scandal has whittled them down to almost nothing. "Before all of this started," Chad Condit tells me, searching for a sympathetic illustration of what his father has endured, "he was a good-looking man."
When I visit the Condits one night in their spotless beige living room on Acorn Lane, Carolyn, whom Gary married in their native Oklahoma when they were 18, picks up on that theme. "I'm still waiting for the twinkle to come back," she says, using the family nickname for her husband's pearly, emphatic smile. "When it comes back, I'll let you know." She serves me chocolate-covered biscotti and constantly refills my water glass and her husband's tea cup, hovering within earshot even as I ask Condit about Levy and the flight attendant and a famously discarded box for a watch that he supposedly got from a paramour. (He repeatedly refuses to discuss anything having to do with accusations of philandering.) 
Although Carolyn was portrayed in news accounts as a reclusive invalid -- at one point, Condit's staff had to shoot down rumors that she did not have thumbs -- she is energetic, even frenetic, and not the least bit abashed. In my presence, she pecks her husband on the lips and rubs his back. "I've known this guy since he was 15 years old," she says. "And he's always told me the truth."
It is as if the Condits, transfixed by their suffering, have all but forgotten Gary Condit's hand in it -- all but banished any thought that if he had not been involved with Levy, he would not have become the focus of media investigations and speculation about her disappearance. Chad Condit tells me at one point that I must remember that his father "didn't hurt anybody." I ask him: even if his father's only transgression was an affair with Levy, did that not hurt Carolyn Condit? "I'm just not going there," he responds, and that is the end of that. I do not mention the Levys, who have steered clear of Condit's campaign, which is not easy for them to watch. "It's painful to see him out there acting like he's a compassionate human being," Chandra's father, Robert, tells me. "Like he's a real human being."
In his home, sipping his tea, Condit implies that the Levys should be glad he is running, because it is his prominence as a congressman that keeps the search for their daughter in the news and on law-enforcement officials' radar. "As a matter of fact," he says, "I may be the best hope they have to keep the issue alive. Somebody else gets elected -- you probably won't hear much about Chandra." He also says that he prays for her every day.
He is wearing a University of California sweatshirt, shiny sweat pants and tan sandals over gray socks. He is speaking in a calm, complacent voice. He insists that if he wins re-election, his clout and effectiveness on Capitol Hill will not be compromised and may even be enhanced. His fellow members of Congress "respect people who've been through adversity and survived," he says. Deep down, he adds, they know -- and sympathize with -- how unjustly he has been treated by the media, and so do many voters. "Strangers just grab and hug me," he reports, referring to clutches that apparently happened outside my view. "People are going to be wondering, years from now, Why in the heck did we go there?" Condit says. As they came around to Ali, so they will come around to him.
Condit's parents, Adrian and Jean, drop by, taking a seat on a couch beside a scraggly, Charlie-Brown-like Christmas tree that, nearly four weeks after Dec. 25, still has its white lights. Their arrival during our interview is no accident: the family is making a show of its solidarity and strength. Jean mentions that the Condits have always been about public service. "That's been our life -- our whole life," she says. She seems to be forgetting -- or exempting -- Darrell Condit, one of Gary's two brothers, who has been in and out of prison on drug possession, car-theft and check-forging charges.
The next morning, Gary Condit will appear on a radio show on which the host, in a seemingly facetious manner, will spin the bluegrass classic "Man of Constant Sorrow" and dub it the Condit theme song. Several callers will question Condit's morality. A few days after that, Condit will participate in a televised primary debate that will begin with newsreel highlights of the Levy case.
But for now, as he sits among his most loyal defenders, he says that no matter what happens during this campaign, he is in some senses a victor already, because "the game" that the media wanted him to play was "not good for America," and he had the guts to say so. "I will feel good for the fact that we didn't walk away, that we didn't back down," Condit says. He adds that to the surprise of his detractors, "I'm still standing."

HEADLINE: Going the Extra Mile for the Exotic 

BYLINE:  By DEBBIE SEAMAN; DEBBIE SEAMAN writes frequently about travel.

 BODY:
OUR vacation in Bora-Bora arrived in the mail the other day. I am not referring to airline tickets -- it will be a while before we can spring for such a luxury again -- but what may be the next best thing: several beige-and-brown boxes of the unique soap we had in our hotel room when we visited that French Polynesian island last year. Redolent of coconut and the tiare, a petite but potent Tahitian gardenia, it smells like nothing else on earth.
 I hold the soap to my nose, close my eyes, and am immediately transported to an azure lagoon framed in coconut palms. My feet are bare against fine, warm sand, and I can almost feel the breeze and the sun against my face. I inhale this fragrance and heave the sigh of the serene. 
 We had brought with us from Bora-Bora as much soap as we could garner from the hotel, augmented by several five-packs from the grocery store in Vaitape, the island's main village. Back home, wafting out of the bathroom in a cloud of shower steam, its aroma evokes murmurs of appreciation and instant nostalgia from adults and children alike. (I conveniently forget the heaps of laundry I did over the hotel sink with that same soap in the spirit of saving a few French Pacific francs.) 
When the stash had dwindled to a few fragrant slivers in the soap dish, we searched the Internet for it. We ordered boxes from one or two manufacturers and discovered to our disappointment that they were not the same brands as ours: they had more cloying, soapier smells that failed to conjure paradise. 
Finally, using the fax number on the soap package, I sent a letter in French to the manufacturer in the Tahitian capital, Papeete, and thus was able to track down a small distributor in California. Never mind that the cost of a bar was more than twice what we would pay in Tahiti -- should we put a price on such an olfactory visitation and the sensations it induced?
There is, indeed, something infinitely pleasurable about possessing products unique to foreign countries. Of course, there is always the sophistication they impart to the user, along with the cachet of having something one's neighbors do not. Underlying all this may be a suspicion on our part, whether warranted or not, that people keep what is best, and more of it, on their own soil.
Better yet, though, are the memories that a taste, a whiff or even a glance at a package can evoke. When I eat bona fide Dijon mustard, for example, I like to pretend I'm back at the Paris bistro where, following the lead of the French, I first tried it on my frites instead of ketchup. I want my eyes to tear up, my nostrils to quiver, and my taste buds to revel in recognition.
Try as I might, I haven't been able to find in America any mustard that passes muster, even the so-called imported brands because they are usually tailored to American tastes. This is why friends from France must arrive bearing, not Champagne or foie gras, but a large jar of Dijon. Nothing fancy -- the mass-market brand does the trick.
Sometimes, the very difficulty of procuring something sentimentally precious can make possession all the sweeter. Russian caviar, reputedly the world's best, surely tasted even better in the days of strict Soviet regulation when I had to seek it out in a clandestine setting in Moscow and smuggle it past stern Slavic officials at the airport. The story also rendered the regaler the instant life of the party when the caviar was served.
Not everyone shares his goodies, though. A friend of ours in Melbourne pines so for a particular Belgian beer made from macerated sour cherries that he recently spent a small fortune ordering a six-pack of it via David Jones, an upscale Australian department store. After a four-month wait for the bottles to arrive, he then rationed them only on special -- and solitary -- occasions.
Fortunately, travelers usually don't have to go to such extremes to get what they want, but the result can make traveling light an impossibility. Consider my sister Marilyn, a serious chef who routinely buys even unusual products in bulk. She once made a pilgrimage to Fauchon, the gourmet's mecca at Place de la Madeleine in Paris, and came away with six jugs of gray sea salt from Brittany. This, she announced to her more culinarily challenged sister, is the layer of salt that most retains the smell of the sea and is excellent in fish recipes. 
So Marilyn was crushed when her rental car was broken into a few days later down in Aix-en-Provence. The thief, you see, greedily grabbed the heaviest suitcase, which turned out to contain the unlikely combination of French lingerie and a veritable motherlode of gray sea salt. 
What Brittany is to salt, King Island is to cream. King Island, which lies in the Bass Strait off Tasmania, is a place where somehow the forces of nature conspire to make the grass greener, the cows happier and the cream richer than perhaps anywhere else on the planet. I'm talking about stuff that will stand up to any spoon, and you can't find it outside Australia.
When my in-laws arrive from Australia, they know to bring us -- along with my husband's supply of that awful Vegemite spread I call La Brea tar pits on toast -- a couple of pints of King Island cream, which they carefully keep cool during the marathon flight to New York. Their arrival will mean that I can make my biannual King Island leek-and-goat-cheese pie. It's an outstanding recipe that will not work -- and I have tried -- with any other dairy product.
Every once in a while, some esoteric but welcome product will find its way into a local store. My friend Bob in New York, driven crazy by a neighbor's renovations, was ecstatic recently to find in an Upper East Side pharmacy a particularly efficient type of French earplug he hadn't seen in years. I was a bit nonplused to hear him waxing enthusiastic about such a mundane gadget. But I came to suspect that the sight of the package had recalled more romantic days in a non-air-conditioned apartment in Paris, where street noise through the open window made sleep elusive, at best. 
My sister Marilyn, meanwhile, may have started taking this foreign romance stuff with a grain of salt. During another European sojourn, she fell in love with a brand of oatcakes, which, she assures me, the Scots serve "so brilliantly" with cheese. Tiring of stocking up on them every time she set foot in Britain, she decided to circumvent the problem when she found a restaurant in Cornwall that made its own excellent oatcakes. "I bribed the waitress to pinch the recipe off the chef," she said.
But the crackers were to remain inimitable. "The recipe is all in metric measures," Marilyn said ruefully. "And I haven't gotten around to translating it." 
Economic globalization, however, can take a lot of the fun out of all this epicurean procuring, rendering goodies into mere goods. Marilyn learned this as far back as the early 90's, when she found some beautiful red and blue crockery with a fish motif in Vietri, Italy. She liked it so much that she spent a fortune having an entire set shipped home to Long Island. 
Back in New York only two weeks later, she was strolling through Macy's Cellar when she spotted ceramic wares identical to the ones she had found in Italy, except for one thing -- when she took the shipping into account, these dishes were half the price.

Argentine Tourism Pins Hopes on Devalued Peso

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
UNTIL early January, Argentina was perhaps the most expensive country in Latin America for tourists. But it has become dramatically cheaper as a result of an almost 50 percent devaluation of the peso, which for more than a decade had been fixed at one to one with the American dollar.
 "Our economic situation continues to be complicated and our image abroad is not favorable, but the prices are now much more attractive, and we hope that will help overcome whatever hesitation foreign travelers may have," said Marco Palacios, president of the Argentine Association of Tourism and Travel Agencies. 
 The currency devaluation and the resignation of President Fernando de la Rua on Dec. 20 were preceded by several days of mass street demonstrations and even food riots in working-class suburbs of the capital that left 27 people dead. On Jan. 3, the State Department issued an announcement cautioning American visitors that "the political, social and security situation is likely to remain fluid" and that they "should avoid large public gatherings." 
The statement was still in effect at press time on Feb. 11, but Argentine officials argue that it is no longer necessary and say that they are lobbying Washington to rescind it. "The end of December was difficult, but that has all been overcome," said Daniel Scioli, the government's Secretary of Tourism. "Social peace has returned, and Argentines have their arms open wide to receive foreign visitors."
Demonstrations continue periodically here in the capital, but they take place at specified times in two locations (on the squares in front of Congress and the Presidential Palace) and are not anti-American in character. There has been no unrest reported in the areas that have traditionally been tourist favorites: Patagonia, including the ski resort and lake district of Bariloche, and the Iguacu Falls, on the northern border with Brazil and Paraguay.
"I was here right around Christmas and found this place so expensive and so chaotic that I decided I'd be better off hanging out in Brazil for a while," said Ellen Marchese, a Pennsylvanian on a yearlong backpacker's tour of Latin America, as she waited outside a currency exchange on Calle Florida in Buenos Aires late last month. "But the situation seems to have calmed down now, and it's amazing how much cheaper everything seems."
To replace the "one peso equals one dollar" policy that had been in place since 1991, Argentina initially opted for a complicated dual exchange rate: 1.40 pesos to the dollar for foreign trade and a free floating rate for most other transactions, including tourism. On Feb. 3, however, a decision was made to simplify things by abandoning the fixed rate and letting the peso float, or find its value on the open market.
During the first few weeks after abandoning the one-to-one policy, the floating exchange rate was running as high as two pesos to the dollar, making the cost of a restaurant meal in early February half of what it was barely a month before. But economists foresee an even greater slippage of the peso throughout 2002, with many of them predicting that the Argentine currency will end the year trading at about 2.70 to the dollar.
Of course, the end of the one peso, one dollar system means that American visitors must once again translate prices from pesos. Exchange rates now fluctuate daily, too, so to get the best rate for their money, visitors should check the financial pages of the Buenos Aires Herald, an English-language paper published here.
In addition, the collapse of the Argentine economy has led several provinces to issue bonds that are used as an alternative legal tender. When they make change, owners of stores and restaurants often try to foist this scrip, which can be easily counterfeited, on unsuspecting tourists. Complaints have been common, so under no circumstances should a visitor accept the bonds, known as patacones or lecops, as change: always insist on receiving pesos and only pesos.
Another consequence of the devaluation has been to force Argentines to stay at home. A strong peso had encouraged them to become inveterate travelers to Europe and the United States; and the money spent by Argentines abroad far exceeded that spent by visitors to Argentina: $5.5 billion versus just over $3 billion in 2000, according to Mr. Palacios.
But the average Argentine can no longer afford foreign travel, and with the Southern Hemisphere summer vacation season in full swing, that means local resorts and attractions, such as Mar del Plata, are more crowded than they have been in recent years, especially on weekends. "There are plenty of empty rooms, but in terms of both availability and prices, the best deals are to be found during the week," said Oscar Ghezzi, president of the national hotel association.

HEADLINE: A Sky-High Work in Progress 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS SOLOMON; CHRIS SOLOMON is a reporter for The Seattle Times.

 BODY:
IN 1882 Maj. A. B. Rogers, an American engineer and former soldier working for the Canadian Pacific Railway, pitched camp with his survey crew in a deep valley between the soaring Rocky and Purcell Mountains. Rogers's supply cache was soon renamed Golden City, in hopes of outglittering a Silver City nearby. Seldom since then has Golden, a fraying timber town in southeastern British Columbia, entertained such dreams of grandeur.
 Until now. Over the past 20 months Golden's once-humble ski hill has been transformed with the addition of two new lifts, two ski lodges, its first slopeside accommodations and other improvements -- steps toward the owner's goal of making Kicking Horse Mountain Resort one of the largest ski areas in North America by 2005, and a major destination. The centerpiece of the revamped ski area is a bottom-to-top gondola lift finished before last season, which helps give the resort a 4,133-foot vertical drop, second in Canada to Whistler Blackcomb. Plans call for the mountain to grow too, from 2,300 acres this season to 4,005 acres by 2005. Kicking Horse would then join a handful of resorts, such as Vail, that have more than 4,000 acres of skiable terrain. 
 As a former ski bum who spent a season in Vail and had long heard talk of cheap, deep powder skiing in this crenelated corner of southeastern British Columbia, I was intrigued by Kicking Horse's ambitions. What a friend and I found here on a visit last February was a rough-cut gem with untamed skiing and few frills.
Kicking Horse was born of desperation. By 1986, Golden was a town three hours' drive west of Calgary that had been whipsawed by the vagaries of the timber industry. Residents cast about for a wholesome diversion. A nonprofit ski club got permission and a public loan to cut several runs on government land at the tail of the Purcells, known as the Dogtooth Range. The ski area, Whitetooth, was modest. To get to the slopes skiers crossed a one-lane bridge, drove up a gravel road and parked next to a log cabin that served as a day lodge. The one chairlift carried a few hundred skiers a day.
Volunteers knew they didn't have the energy or money to exploit the site's potential -- especially the line of snowy cirques, or natural amphitheaters, just above the reach of the lift. In 1997 the 10,000 or so residents of Golden and the rural area around it voted to let investors led by the Netherlands-based construction giant Ballast Nedam International buy the ski club's stake. As part of an effort to revitalize communities like Golden, the provincial government then leased the ski terrain to Ballast Nedam and sold some land at the base to the company for development. Ballast Nedam renamed the ski area Kicking Horse and the provincial government approved the company's plan to spend what may be at least $130 million (United States) to give the mountain a makeover.
Kicking Horse now offers the gondola and two chairlifts; a new day lodge at the base; and a 7,705-foot summit lodge that besides a full restaurant offers two suites with round-the-clock butler service, each costing about $950 a night. Otherwise, the resort is still a work in progress. Fourteen of 60 town homes and condominiums scheduled for construction have been completed, but a 100-room, slopeside hotel that was to open this season was postponed last year when the economy slumped. It won't open until at least the winter of 2003-4.
Golden is also a place where apres ski is a foreign concept. It is a town of 4,300 people bracketed by a train yard and a plywood mill. Window shopping "downtown" takes about 10 minutes unless you stop to buy a pair of Sorels from the mayor at the Shoe Barn. Good food can be found in town, but the best is 6,000 feet above Golden at the summit lodge, which stays open for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights.
The economy may have altered the timing, but Kicking Horse's owners have not abandoned their plans. Five more lifts are on the drawing board for the next seven years. All this depends on demand, of course. Skiers from Calgary must resist the temptation of stopping at any of five popular ski areas, including Banff and Lake Louise, before reaching Golden via one of the most twisty and dangerous sections of the Trans Canada Highway.
Yet Kicking Horse holds some fine cards. Its northeastern aspect, and the valley's frequent temperature inversions, mean long life for the otherwise modest 275-inch annual snowfall. Even so, the Columbia Valley is warm enough that a day's skiing here doesn't feel like eight hours spent in a refrigerator -- a frequent complaint at Banff and Lake Louise. 
Or so the local skiers swore to my friend Andrew and me after our arrival last February. We had ventured here in a season in which nothing was normal. The East Kootenay Weekly said the area was having its worst snow drought in 50 years. (The resort said that this year, as of mid-January, more snow had fallen than in all of last season.) At least we had views few ski areas can trump.
Kicking Horse's base sits on a bench, its slopes facing the Rockies across the deep, green scoop of the Rocky Mountain Trench. On clear days, the ski trails seem to hover on wisps of wood smoke above the homes of Golden and the Kicking Horse River. To the east, the chipped teeth of the Rockies jut from a prognathous jawline. The Purcells, land of famously deep snows, pin up the other horizons. Six national and provincial parks loosely ring the mountain.
JUST two years ago, the only skiers able to enjoy these summit panoramas and the tantalizing bowls above the tree line were skiers using expensive helicopters, or "earn your turns" back-country skiers. Now the eight-passenger-per-car Golden Eagle Express gondola deposits skiers atop a whaleback ridge that separates two high cirques, Crystal Bowl and Bowl Over. We surveyed the bowls after our first top-to-bottom run and concluded the same thing: This is no powder-puff mountain.
More than 4,100 vertical feet of nearly unbroken fall line separate the highest peak from the parking lot, with almost no lifts in between. The high bowls provide an entertaining start to a long mountain, even if they offer only about 800 vertical feet of turns. Their wilder edges are lipped with cornices and threaded with pencil chutes.
Blue (intermediate) runs like Dutch Treat wind through the safe center of the bowls. The mountain quickly grows steeper, however, as skiers descend, and options for intermediates were limited until three blue runs and a snowcat with a winch to groom steep spots were added last summer. True novices will find only one escape hatch from the summit other than a down-bound gondola: a scenic but otherwise unspectacular catwalk that zigzags more than six miles to the base. Over all, half of Kicking Horse's 64 runs are now rated advanced or expert, though the resort expects to add more intermediate and novice runs.
For the skilled, though, Kicking Horse offers a buffet of challenges. The bowls' steep, treeless headwalls funnel to a close, where skiers are thrust into one of several long, ungroomed pitches like Bubbly or Euphoria that stripe the mountain's lower face. Moguls later appear, and the firs between the runs open ranks for those who want to ski the wind-sheltered powder beneath their branches. Just when legs grow rubbery, snowcats take over and smooth the mountain's apron into mellow boulevards.
Unfortunately, picking such smooth lines down the mountain was difficult during last season's snow drought. Snow hides a lot of sins. Without it, many of the slopes were minefields of stumps and rocks, even automobile tires. (Kicking Horse has yet to install snowmaking.) In the lingo of the young snowboarder on our gondola, the mountain was "bony."
Another gondola-mate, Ken, who turned out to be a warden at nearby Yoho National Park, told us to follow him to a run called Kicking Horse. A mogul run somehow fluffy with powder despite the drought, it required minimal jumping over exposed stumps. And the entire mountain was nearly empty -- its usual state, Ken and others said.
The day's itinerary was soon set: Ride to the top. Race down to Kicking Horse. Yo-yo until exhausted.
Skiers needn't feel bad about leaving it all on the hill. The appeal of scuffed little Golden is limited. By the time we showered and changed, the stores had closed. At night the snow-packed town was empty, except for the occasional beer joint or restaurant. Though it was refreshing to visit a ski town where pretense hadn't yet arrived, neither had much else.
One night we avoided Golden entirely and headed back to the mountain. Diners climb into the gondola and burrow under a fleece blanket for a ride to the 140-seat timber-and-stone Eagle's Eye Restaurant atop the mountain, which is open daily for lunch but only on Friday and Saturday for dinner. There we could sit by the fireplace and enjoy modern regional fare such as British Columbia salmon cooked on a cedar plank and served with kumquat-red onion marmalade.
Visitors to Golden can expect more such gastronomic niceties to appear in time. Golden is one of a constellation of down-at-the-heels towns in southeast British Columbia -- Fernie, Kimberley and Invermere are others -- that are fighting off ghost-town status by resurrecting themselves with resorts. Land prices are soaring, and town planners expect the population of the Golden area to grow by at least 13 percent by 2011.
Outsiders, both tourists and immigrants, have long sought out Golden. Late in the 19th century the Canadian Pacific lured visitors to its trains by promoting the area's abundant mountain climbing, even importing Swiss guides and by 1911 building them gingerbread chalets. 
At the five-year-old Alpine Meadows Lodge, where we stayed, the innkeepers were from yet other places: Maria Graham is a native of Spain, while her husband, Irv, was a chemical engineer in the petroleum industry before leaving Calgary. Their 10-room lodge, just off the eight-mile road to the mountain, is similar to several in the area: smallish and friendly, with a fire and magazines in the great room, handsome Douglas fir beams and banisters, a hot tub and a casual European air. Staying at such mom-and-pop places felt like stealing, thanks to the vigorous United States dollar. Our four-night stay, including breakfast each day and a three-day lift ticket, cost just $450 (United States) for the two of us.
Two inches of snow fell the night before our departure. We rose early and nearly exhausted ourselves in a few hours, cutting first tracks down empty slopes. Imagining how it would feel to ski Kicking Horse's steeps and bumps under an even deeper mantle of snow, we agreed to return and watch this mountain mature.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 2-17-02; 
Nothing Personal

BYLINE:  By Bruce Headlam; Bruce Headlam is an editor for the Circuits section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Can anybody get into Harvard? If you're one of the thousands of students who have just completed the grueling college admissions process and are awaiting the results from selective universities, the answer is no, of course. But if you have been to the movies in the past few months, you might think anyone could. In "Legally Blonde," Reese Witherspoon plays a ditzy sorority girl who lands at Harvard Law School thanks to a video resume with generous footage of her in a bikini; in "How High," Method Man and Redman play two small-time pot dealers who light up Cambridge; and in "Orange County," a West Coast variation on the theme, a Stanford reject shows up on campus to plead his case.
 In their own ways, the films provoke a much more interesting question: can anybody succeed at Harvard? In other words, what if what it takes to get into an elite college and what it takes to prosper there are two entirely separate things? The only way to truly test the admissions process would be to accept enough homecoming queens and homeboys to make a meaningful comparison. And not many schools are willing to take that risk. 
 But it has happened. In 1979, the University of Texas Medical School selected 150 first-year students from a pool of 800 interviewees. The State Legislature then mandated that the class size be increased by 50 students, who had to be pulled from the bottom of the original pool. The initially rejected students came in with inferior marks, poorer test scores and lower personal evaluations. Yet at every measurable step during their medical education, from term marks to residency, their performance as a group was indistinguishable not just from the rest of their peers but also from the top 50 students in the class.
What the Texas case illustrates is the distinction between what social psychologists call selection effects and treatment effects. It wasn't the students' qualifications (the selection effect) that determined performance; it was the four years spent in the classroom (the treatment effect) that was transcendent. In other words, the students did well because they were in a good school, not because they were inherently good students.
Freed from the lab, the terms selection and treatment provide a handy division for categorizing all kinds of institutions, those that hire the employees with the best credentials (selection) and those that would rather train their own (treatment). In business, new-economy Enron was a selection company: you either got it or you didn't, as its former C.E.O. Jeffrey Skilling liked to say. G.E., which did as much for Jack Welch as Jack Welch did for G.E. (even if his autobiography doesn't always read that way), is a classic treatment company. In sports, the New York Yankees are the all-selection team, skimming off the best from the rest of the league. The Oakland Athletics are a treatment franchise, developing their own talent, which they invariably lose to the Yankees. In pop music, the Beatles were a selection band: you couldn't just replace Paul McCartney. The Temptations? Pure treatment: they sounded the same no matter who was singing, a lesson not lost on every boy band since.
In addition to making for a great little sociological parlor game, the selection-treatment scheme is a useful one for examining another instance of underqualified students at elite institutions: affirmative action, which once again finds itself under a microscope in the courts. Since the Bakke decision in 1978, the debate has revolved largely around the means of preferential admissions -- the displacement of deserving white candidates by minority applicants -- and less around their outcomes. But the biggest study of race-conscious admissions at selective colleges, "The Shape of the River" (1998), found that students admitted with the benefit of affirmative action performed only slightly below class average and, after graduation, outgained many of their peers. As was the case in Texas, what happened to students after frosh week mattered more than how they were ranked by the admissions office.
Why, then, does affirmative action remain an embarrassing phrase even among some of its supporters? Perhaps part of the problem is that an individualistic society, after all, is predicated on the belief in personal characteristics. We like to believe that Great Men (and Women) shape events and not the other way around. Even the thriving self-help movement emphasizes the recovery of our "authentic selves." Part of this belief is vanity: we all like to think we're irreplaceable. It's difficult to accept that many people could perform equally well if given a seat in the front row. But the evidence is that they can, and not just in the classroom. Over the past few months, some of George Bush's harshest critics have reluctantly conceded that given the right circumstances, even a chief executive with shaky credentials can grow on the job. Is it so hard to believe the same thing about a 17-year-old? Or do we cheer underdogs only when they look like Reese Witherspoon?

As a senior, I feel completely confident in my academic abilities. I can write an articulate English paper in a matter of hours. I can forge close relationships with the very professors who had intimidated me in previous years. I know I made the right choice in staying at Harvard. . . . Now that I am applying to law school and seeking out career options, I find that the Harvard name opens doors that most people never even know exist. Do not underestimate the power and prestige of this institution -- getting into Harvard is a golden ticket that gives you the power to go practically anywhere you choose. Harvard has given me the room and resources to stretch myself out and to become more than I ever guessed that I could be." From a personal Harvard University review on the BroaderMinds Web site

Snowy Profits

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
In our ski town in northern Vermont, many of us carry chains in our four-by-four pickups in the winter. If a local runs his car off the road, we pull him out free, but if a tourist gets stuck in the snow, we charge $20. (We can always tell the difference.) Our rationale: Tourists have more money than locals, and a tow-truck operator charges even more than us. Agreed? Michael Roche, Morrisville, Vt.
 Your rationale, which any carny could use to justify stiffing the rubes, is strained, but your actual behavior is just fine. There's nothing untoward about charging for your labor; you have no obligation to be a volunteer snow patrol. (Although it would, of course, be wrong to ice down the road to drum up customers.) And if the folks in your town want to form what is in effect a mutual-aid society, assisting one another at no charge, that's fine, too. If my imaginary neighbor the plumber helps me with my pipes gratis, her generosity doesn't thus require her to work free for strangers. 
 If you wished to aim higher and be not merely ethical but generous, now and then you could extend a helping hand -- or length of helping chain -- to a stranger, even a tourist, at no charge. Vermont is justly proud of its local industry, tapping maple trees for syrup; it need not tap tourists for $20's.
After working for a year, our daughter enrolled in graduate school. She is fairly self-supporting, lives away from home and hasn't asked us for much financial support, although we can afford to pay her school expenses. Should we encourage her to try for scholarships and aid on her own? How should she answer the school's questions about our ability to pay? Anonymous, Washington
She should answer honestly, noting both your economic circumstances and her financial independence. If you plan to pay her tuition should she not receive financial aid, then that should be clear on the application. If instead she is leading a genuinely autonomous financial life, she should say as much, and the school should respect her admirable self-reliance, offering her the same assistance they'd provide anyone else in similar circumstances.
Situations like this are no doubt familiar to schools, so it would be nice if there were an opportunity for you to discuss this with the university's financial-aid officers. During that conversation, you could inquire about the propriety of a school hoarding its vast endowment while forcing 18-year-olds to encumber themselves with $100,000 worth of debt. Or perhaps that's a question to raise should you find yourself in Cambridge, Mass. You might also inquire, in another city, about an education system that condemns so many hard-working young people to start their professional lives deep in debt. After all, you live right there in Washington.
I received a modest inheritance from an aunt and wished to give some portion of it to charity. Did I have a moral obligation to donate to causes she specifically believed in? M.K., Mamaroneck, N.Y.
Had your aunt wished to donate her money to particular causes, she could have done so herself -- or at least mentioned them in her will. Instead, she gave her money to you. Once it passed into your hands, it became yours to do with as you wished. Even had your aunt been, say, a militant ailurophobe, you could have contributed honorably to a home for recalcitrant cats. If that made you uneasy, you might have sought common ground by donating to organizations both of 
you admired. (How did she feel about obstinate dogs?) But there was no ethical necessity to do so.

S.O.U.

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
If you were president of the United States, and someone asked you to describe -- in one word -- what kind of state the Union was in, what adjective would you select?
 White House speechwriters struggle with that almost every year. Judson Welliver, who did the writing for Calvin Coolidge under the title of "literary clerk" (and who should get the credit for Silent Cal's reputation for eloquence), elected to use nouns. "It is exceedingly gratifying," said the cool-keeping chief executive in 1925, "to report that the general condition is one of progress and prosperity." No powerful, state-defining adjective. 
 When it came to Harry Truman, the operative word was the modest but solid good. "I am happy to report to this 81st Congress" -- the one after "that Republican, 80th do-nothing Congress" -- that the state of the Union is good." The following year, the plain-spoken Truman said that it "continues to be good."
Dwight Eisenhower avoided the characterizing adjective, preferring to say that the state "continues to vindicate the wisdom of the principles on which this Republic is founded." I thought that evaded the responsibility of the top man to give the country a grade. John Kennedy came back to the Truman tradition, but with a nice buildup: "I can report to you that the state of this old but youthful Union, in the 175th year of its life, is good." Lyndon Johnson copped a plea at one point -- the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon the state of the world." As Vietnam wracked his administration, he used a thoughtful adjective in 1968: "I report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad." Richard Nixon, in his next-to-last "S.O.U.," as we speechwriters called the annual messages (written, as Thomas Jefferson preferred) or addresses (spoken, as Woodrow Wilson preferred), used a defensive adjective, a conservative adjective and an uplifting adjectival phrase. "The basic state of our Union," his writers wrote in February 1973, just before the Watergate scandal took hold, "is sound, and full of promise." The use of the defensive modifier basic may have reflected a concern that the apparent, or surface, state was not so sound or full of promise. 
Gerald Ford, two years after what he had called "our long national nightmare," recalled Harry Truman's word and admitted dolefully but honestly, "I must say to you that the state of the Union is not good." The following year, he called the state "in many ways a lot better -- but still not good enough." In his last such address, in 1977, Ford assessed the nation's state as good, adding with pride, "We have a more perfect Union than when my stewardship began."
Jimmy Carter thrice preferred the Nixonian sound, an adjective often used to reassure the public about the economy, as in "sound money," and also in the firmness of "sound judgment." A digression about sound: the noun, from the Latin sonum, means "the sensation of what we hear." Don't listen to that. The sense here of the adjective sound comes from the second syllable of the Old English gesund, "health" -- similar to the German Gesundheit! wished upon sneezers. In 1601, Robert Johnson wrote about the French king that "Francis the 1 left his credite sound." More recently, as an Arthur Andersen executive testified before Congress, "This policy toward document disposal reflects sound audit practice." In that sense, sound means "financially healthy"; curiously, in these health-conscious times, no president has yet said the state of the Union is healthy. 
In each of Jimmy Carter's uses, he chose to change one word in the language of the Constitution, which requires the president to "give to the Congress information of the state of the Union," and said "the state of our Union."
Ronald Reagan, during 1982's recession, looked ahead: "In the near future the state of the Union and the economy will be better -- much better." The following year, he admitted that "our economy is troubled," but that "the state of our Union is strong." This picked up the Carter our, which ever since has been most often preferred by presidents, but chiseled in granite the adjectives strong and stronger.
Although Ford showed that it was possible to say not good, no president has said or is ever likely to call our state weak. The first President Bush used "sound and strong" in 1990, combining Nixon-Carter with Reagan, but the following year departed from tradition to use the word union in a sense that illuminated his "thousand points of light": "The state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other -- the sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities." 
Bill Clinton put the constitutional phrase into a question and then answered it in 1994: "What's the state of our Union? It is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still." In 1996, he said "the state of the Union is strong" and in the next two years repeated that phrase, reverting to his initial our Union, but sticking to strong. In 2000, with the economy still booming and surpluses projected as far as the eye could see, Clinton concluded his string of S.O.U. addresses with "the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been."
George W. Bush last month also used stronger, but his speechwriter Michael Gerson used it in a creative way, pointing to a seeming paradox: "Our nation is at war, our economy is in recession and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has never been stronger." This anomaly was apparent in the victory in Afghanistan and was largely brought about by "the might of the United States military." In Bush's first S.O.U., he was able to point out how a justified pride in our power and national will overwhelmed both the economic strains and the dangers of terrorism. The favorite adjective of recent presidents to characterize the nation's state -- strong -- was thus unarguably applicable. Do presidents and their writers think about the one-word summation of the state of the Union (always capitalized) when the time for the report required by the Constitution rolls around? Do they read the way their predecessors handled it and chew over whether to stick with previous usage (Good? Sound? Strong?), or play off one of those usages, or come up with something fresh? As this history should show, you bet they do.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Holding Pattern Is Seen After Law Firm Expansions

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
HOW to predict the effect of the changing economic climate on commercial real estate in New Jersey? At least one broker tracks law firms.
 "Law firms are a very good economic barometer, said G. Thomas Grenier, a broker at the Trammell Crow Company, who has handled several recent law office expansions in the state. 
 "They make a formal accounting every year of the revenue earned -- distributing some to partners, setting some aside for reserve," Mr. Grenier said. "They always know how they're doing. So the minute the economy starts to turn in a favorable direction, the law firms will be out there looking to expand." 
Right now, there is something of a holding pattern, according to Mr. Grenier.
Since the downturn in the economy and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, law firms have been hurt like every other kind of business, Mr. Grenier said, and billable hours are down. Mr. Grenier said he was aware of some firms that had been expecting to expand their offices in early 2002 but that were now "sitting tight."
"I also know a few," he added, "that are talking to their landlords, asking if they are willing to take space back to sublease."
The lull, if that is what it is, comes after a long period of steady expansion of legal office space in New Jersey, notably in Newark and Princeton. In Newark, where most of the largest state firms maintain a presence, a half-dozen firms expanded or established offices in the last year. In Princeton, where the picture is similar, the Pittsburgh-based firm of Reed Smith recently increased the square footage of its offices by more than two and a half times, to 47,000 square feet.
Some object -- in the polite, courtroom sense -- to the suggestion that there is any slowdown now in the growth of law offices.
"What you're seeing in New Jersey is a lot of consolidation," said Reed Smith's New York-New Jersey managing partner, Steven J. Picco. "That's the trend in most of the professional services, especially those servicing large multinational or interstate clientele -- since it seems big companies feel more comfortable dealing with entities of like size and mind."
Of course, consolidation is growth on only one side of any particular transaction; one firm involved needs increased office space but the other needs less space. But Mr. Picco would contend that over all, this leads to more growth.
"The trend to consolidation and large firms does sort of feed on itself," he said. "As more national and global firms establish offices and others consolidate, that enhances the appeal of New Jersey as an important place to be and attracts even more firms to look at locating here."
Reed Smith is on a merger and acquisition binge, Mr. Picco said, and expanding at a very rapid clip. The firm had two lawyers in New Jersey in 1994. By 1998, it had 25 lawyers in two locations: Newark and Princeton. Now, it has 100 lawyers in the two cities.
Sheldon Bonovitz, chairman of Duane Morris, which is based in Philadelphia, said his firm planned robust expansion in coming years -- and proceeded to "lease ahead" last year in Newark, securing a space for 20 lawyers that could hold 60. 
Duane Morris now has 475 lawyers nationwide, with 200 of them in Philadelphia and the others scattered in major markets.
"The goal is to double the number of lawyers in cities other than Philadelphia over the next five years -- fill out those offices so we become a major, recognizable presence in those marketplaces," Mr. Bonovitz said.
"We see northern New Jersey, especially, as a very good market," he added. "Newark is the fastest growth market, presenting the most business opportunities now. Princeton is second."
HE and other leaders of law firms said that even if the state of the general economy deteriorated, they expected to grow because large firms that pursued many lines of practice could adjust to the flow of business.
"Right now, for instance," Mr. Bonovitz said, "transactional law is slow. Corporate finance loans, slow. But litigation, employment law, health care, bankruptcy and intellectual property are really growing for us."
Duane Morris first opened in Newark with 10,000 square feet at the Legal Center, an 18-story building near Penn Station. Recently, the firm moved to a 25,000-square-foot office in a 30-story building at 744 Broad Street. The broker who handled Duane Morris's expansion move, Jack Fatigati of the Garibaldi Group of Chatham, said the law firm's old office at the Legal Center is one of the few pieces of Class A space available in Newark.
"Newark is a federal, state and county court seat," Mr. Fatigati noted. "It is easily accessible by highway or mass transit. It is also the home of the Seton Hall University Law School and the Rutgers Law School. The city is a great place for lawyers to be."
Reed Smith opened an office at the Legal Center last year, but it chose to make a major expansion at its Princeton office even though that entailed staying at the Princeton Forrestal Center during reconstruction.
"We looked around at other spaces, and in the end decided this location suited us best,"Mr. Picco of Reed Smith said.. "But we are in acquisition mode.
"We needed a great deal more space -- 47,000 square feet, when we previously had only 18,000. We also needed a lot of flexibility in the makeup of our office space. As we aggressively expand, the mix of partners and associates keeps changing, the types of law we do keeps changing. Those things change the way we use space."
The solution Reed Smith's architects came up with is flexibility through furniture.
Design elements that signify tradition and permanence -- marble floors, coffered ceilings, a grand staircase -- were used for the upgraded office space, said Charles O. Logan, president of the Aztec Corporation. an architecture and design concern. 
"With the office furniture, we took a manufacturer's product, with all its flexible features, such as adjustable-height shelves, adjustable depth for work surfaces, printer and fax machine spaces, collating and prep areas," Mr. Logan said, "and then we created custom elements -- we had them milled in Canada -- to make the pieces look built-in." 
The furniture can be moved and reconfigured, he said. Furthermore, since it is not built in, it is not considered a fixed asset when calculating depreciation for tax purposes, Mr. Logan said. With fixed assets, a landlord is assigned a share of depreciation. But as a tenant, Reed Smith may claim the full depreciation over seven and a half years on the value of its furniture.
MR. BONOVITZ of Duane Morris said the rapid expansion of law firms might well lead to even more pronounced moves to provide office flexibility. One sacred tradition of legal life is surely that the move from associate to partner means a bigger office. But Mr. Bonovitz said, "We're thinking about one-size-office-fits-all."
He said many transitions would be more efficient with that arrangement. And, of course, it would be cut costs significantly, since quality space rents for approximately $30 per square foot.
Mr. Bonovitz said that a large-scale shift to scaled-down offices was coming for law firms. His firm occupies about 800 square feet per lawyer at its primary office in Philadelphia. At its new office in Newark, the figure is down to about 575 square feet. 
"Digital technology has reduced the amount of needed work space," Mr. Bonovitz said. "It has made law libraries smaller." He added that when Duane Morris sublet its office in London, lawyers found themselves shopping for ceramics to fill empty built-in bookshelves.
Mr. Grenier, the broker who sees law firms as economic barometers, said that whatever the economic realities might be, law firms would quickly reflect them. In summation, he argued: "That's really the only definitive thing to be said."

HEADLINE: FILM; 
When Neo-Realism Collided With Reality

BYLINE:  By PETER BRUNETTE; Peter Brunette, the author of several books on Italian cinema, is a film critic for indieWIRE.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Vittorio De Sica's relentless dissection of postwar Italian society, "Umberto D.," appeared in 1952, he was accused by the government's minister of entertainment of "washing Italy's dirty linen in public." The open letter, published in a newspaper, hinted strongly that Italian filmmakers should henceforth be more upbeat -- especially if they wanted to continue receiving government subsidies.
 The letter effectively put an end to the glorious movement known as Italian neo-realism, with its emphasis on the use of real locations and nonprofessional actors and its rejection of any hint of cinematic glamour. And it was delivered at the very moment the movement had achieved perhaps its purest expression, with "Umberto." 
 Less well-known than Roberto Rossellini's "Open City" (1945), which began the movement, or De Sica's 1948 masterpiece, "Bicycle Thief," "Umberto D." was overdue for revival. And now, expertly restored, it is playing at the Film Forum in Manhattan, exemplifying a movement that has had an immeasurable impact on the last 50 years of filmmaking around the world. 
As in most neo-realist films, the plot of "Umberto D." is resolutely unadorned. Umberto D. Ferrari, a retired bureaucrat who can't survive on his meager pension, battles with an unfeeling landlady to keep his rented room. One by one, former colleagues and insensitive social institutions fail him, until his only emotional connections in the world are with his dog and with the landlady's uneducated and unmarried maid, who is pregnant and herself desperately in need of assistance. Unfortunately, Umberto, obsessed with keeping up appearances, is not always able to provide it. He ultimately considers suicide, but the film ends on a hopeful note that may be little more than wish-fulfillment on the part of filmmaker and audience.
Cesare Zavattini, De Sica's scriptwriter and the major theorist of neo-realism, wrote both "Bicycle Thief" and "Umberto D." and was intent on carrying out his theories more fully in the second film. For this hyper-realist, the truest cinematic expression was one fully congruent with lived time -- a 90-minute movie would portray 90 minutes of a person's life -- and, it goes without saying, would focus solely on the small details of everyday reality. De Sica was in fact able to achieve five full minutes of this hopelessly idealistic but hardly ignoble goal during a famous and powerful scene, about 30 minutes into the movie, in which the camera follows the maid around the kitchen as she prepares breakfast. In the midst of her wordless preparations, she pats her pregnant belly and tears stream down her face. It is one of cinema's most sublime sequences.
Beginning with a demonstration by pensioners against the government, "Umberto D." leads the viewer to expect a political analysis of its protagonist's desperate situation, but it quickly becomes clear that De Sica isn't really interested in pursuing that idea. Though the bourgeois landlady and the fatuous friends in her music circle come in for some well-deserved drubbing -- the landlady hypocritically rents out Umberto's room by the hour to illicit lovers -- De Sica is quoted in Roy Armes's book "Patterns of Realism" insisting that politics are not the point: "It is not Umberto's economic condition that interests us, it is his moral and human relationships with society. What concerns us is the solitude of an old man." To the continual consternation of the Communist party, which was then highly influential in artistic circles, most neo-realist films tended to see their characters' problems as a result of failings in human nature rather than as a function of capitalism. "Umberto D." was no exception.
The film is composed primarily of vignettes and tiny, telling scenes filled with expressive human gestures that have little in common with the grand sweep of Hollywood narrative. Though common enough now, this procedure was, at the time, rather unorthodox, even in neo-realism. In fact, the most fascinating thing about "Umberto D." today is that so much of it is so wonderfully silent, relying, for once, on the pictures to tell the story. Many of the film's most memorable moments owe an obvious debt to the visual dexterity of Charlie Chaplin's best scenes, as when Umberto, who has been practicing begging, suddenly turns his hand over, as though checking for rain, when a passerby makes a move to give him some money.
Much of the film's business is taken up with Umberto's adorable dog, and, like Chaplin's films, "Umberto D." constantly flirts with sentimentality. To counter this, De Sica makes Umberto more than a little irascible and selfish, and any "cute" moments with the dog are always revelations of Umberto's inner psychological state rather than simply indulged for their own sake. The strategy seems to have worked. In his recent magisterial documentary on Italian cinema, "My Voyage to Italy" ("Il Mio Viaggio in Italia"), no less an authority than Martin Scorsese, who admits to preferring "Umberto D." to "Bicycle Thief," says: "There's nothing easy about 'Umberto D.' The emotions are never forced, and the pathos is always genuine."
The film's visual style also contributes to the storytelling. Virtually all of "Umberto D." is shot in elaborate deep-focus, a technique popularized by Orson Welles some 10 years earlier in "Citizen Kane." By emphasizing the physical space in the foreground, the camera reveals the vastness of Umberto's social isolation. Furthermore, the characters move among the Roman statuary and monuments, always in focus, giving us a sense that what is happening to Umberto has its roots in the human condition that stretches back centuries.
Umberto is played by a nonprofessional actor, a professor from Florence named Carlo Battisti whom, legend has it, De Sica stopped one day on the street. It's no accident that his character, Umberto D., has the same name as the director's father, an impoverished bank clerk and insurance company employee. The film is dedicated to De Sica's father because, as De Sica said later, "He himself was an old bourgeois who fought against poverty and to maintain his dignity."
While the subtitles are occasionally inexact or anachronistic, and seem, unfortunately, not to have been retranslated for the restoration, the visual and sound tracks are superb. The restoration was undertaken under the guidance of Giuseppe Rotunno, the famous cinematographer of Fellini and Visconti, and by the nonagenarian film stock expert Vincenzo Verzini, who has worked on many of the classics of Italian cinema, including Antonioni's "Notte" and Fellini's "Dolce Vita" and who has in recent years restored a great many of the films he helped to make years ago. Damaged or missing frames in the original negative of "Umberto D." were replaced, the splicing between reels upgraded and the lighting improved. The soundtrack was also restored by transferring it to digital audio tape and filtering it with modern equipment.
Zavattini's hope of making a feature-length commercial film that would constitute a real and raw "slice of life" was never to be realized, of course, and perhaps that's as it should be. For a sense of what this impossible dream might have looked like, though, you can't do better than "Umberto D."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
Inspired by Dance, A Circus Is Writing The Poetry of Flight

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH; Matthew Gurewitsch's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the use of supertitles with opera.

 BODY:
EVERY soul is a circus," Martha Graham, earth mother of modern dance, declared in the title of one of her pieces. The high-flying Nijinsky, having crashed into the hell of madness, proclaimed himself the clown of God. Why marvel, then, when actual circuses aspire to higher spheres?
 The international phenomenon widely known as cirque nouveau (free of animal acts on ideological grounds, brimming with poetic suggestion) is now well into its second decade. Thanks in great part to the National Circus School in Montreal, Canada has proved especially fertile ground. Since 1984, Cirque du Soleil, the acknowledged Lexus of the type, has produced four touring and three resident shows. All are still running, and a fifth touring attraction is in development. 
 Of course, there are innumerable European troupes, several of which have toured to the United States. And then there is Cirque Eloize, founded in 1993 by a group of friends from the Magdalen Islands, off the coast of Quebec. (Eloize, an island term pronounced el-WAHZ, means heat lightning.) "Excentricus," the company's first show, was the opening attraction at the lovingly restored New Victory Theater on 42nd Street in 1995. 
The second, entitled "Cirque Orchestra," was unveiled in 2000 at the Festival International de Lanaudiere in Quebec. Conceived as a marriage of circus arts with dance and live classical music, it, too, is now making its way to Manhattan. The engagement, Wednesday through next Sunday, is presented by Lincoln Center, operating off campus at City Center. As always, the troupe is entrusting the musical component -- a 70-minute program of mostly light classics -- to a local ensemble, in this case the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Miguel Harth-Bedoya. 
Many Cirque Eloize artistes being alumni of Cirque du Soleil, a family resemblance would be hard to deny. Acts easily transfer back and forth, and a spiritual overlay -- an implication that the pageant hints at a quest of the spirit -- is certainly common to both. Yet Cirque Eloize is gaining a name, in the words of The San Francisco Chronicle, as "almost the anti-Cirque du Soleil."
How so? "The difference is the budget," Jano Chiasson said with a gentle chuckle over the phone from Montreal. A founding member of Cirque Eloize, the son of an engineer from the Magdalen Islands and grandson of a fisherman and a house carpenter, Mr. Chiasson is the Flying Man whose act (accompanied by Samuel Barber's "Adagio for Strings") opens "Cirque Orchestra" on what many regard as its very highest note.
As audiences around the world have discovered, the shows of Cirque du Soleil are high-ticket commercial blockbusters, their tents or purpose-built theaters surrounded by bazaars teeming with deluxe memorabilia that some deplore, some descend on and others ignore. Cirque Eloize, by contrast, travels light and keeps merchandising to basics. "There's not much," said Jeannot Painchaud, the artistic director. "A program book. A T-shirt. That's about it."
The troupe's production values are correspondingly humble, the palette of colors in costumes and decor restrained. But the economy of the trappings only enhances the show's poetic luster. So, in its way, does the deliberately narrow spectrum of acts, mostly aerial in their emphasis. (Notably excluded are juggling or trick cycling. There are, however, first-class examples of hand-balancing. Contortion, that creepy specialty, is on view as well.)
For a newcomer to cirque nouveau, and perhaps to devotees as well, "Cirque Orchestra" represents the genre at a pinnacle of refinement. "That's absolutely our philosophy," Mr. Painchaud said. "To work on the natural presence of the artists, to give the public an emotional experience of great immediacy."
You're reading this article on the dance page. Is that where it belongs? "That's up to you," Mr. Painchaud answered. " 'Cirque Orchestra' is pretty much acrobatics, dance and music. You could call it dance. Or you could call it theater."
In a separate conversation, the show's choreographer, Johanne Madore, had this to add: "It's true that there are no dance numbers as such. But within numbers, I worked with everyone to draw out an artistic sensibility, to give the acrobats a new language, a new fluency. The idea is to fuse dance with the arts of the circus. Dancing isn't just a question of combining steps. You can incorporate the spirit of dance into anything. Look at break-dancing. Look at capoeira. Dance is like a thread that runs through everything you do, even the way you walk. It's not just a technical thing. It's a consciousness, a poetic feeling. It's a way of thinking."
The dramatic thread of "Cirque Orchestra" -- for it has a dramatic thread, too -- unspools from the character of a violinist, played by the actor Peter James, who steps out of the orchestra, hypnotically drawn to his dream of flight. At one level, his attempts to do as the acrobats do introduce the touches of comic relief traditionally delivered by the clowns.
Seen another way, he is the spectator's surrogate, aspiring to soar up to the acrobats' divertissement of angels. But his weak attempts to pull free of gravity leave him gasping and airsick. Alain Francoeur, the director of "Cirque Orchestra," is too truthful to grant his gauche Everyman the metamorphosis that audiences may wish for. The chord of transcendent surprise that the finale demands is struck by other means.
All in all, it is an archetypal scenario, played out by artistic means that incorporate elements of the timeless, the familiar and the fashionable. The interest in aerial mechanics puts "Cirque Orchestra" into proximity with the daredevil experiments of Elizabeth Streb as well as that long-running Latin carnival "De La Guarda." And to dance lovers south of the 49th parallel, Ms. Madore's transitional ensembles may bring to mind the Paul Taylor of "Aureole" or "Arden Court." The influence, if any, is at several removes. Ms. Madore does not really know Mr. Taylor's work. (She acknowledges, however, that the current generation of choreographers at work in Montreal all work in a "common language that comes from the United States.") Elsewhere, the dancers' antics suggest the vengeful Wilis from "Giselle" as they might be seen through the prism of Matthew Bourne.
But from a dance lover's perspective, the most fascinating aspect of "Cirque Orchestra" is the way it invites us to rediscover what dance is. Mr. Chiasson's flight at the top of the show, on the cusp between lyric and heroic, is remarkable in this respect. A second Icarus, borne aloft by two broad bands of hanging silk, soars in a spiral and plummets like a stone. As the danseur in the adagio of a classical pas de deux discreetly extends the leaps of the ballerina, the silk supports him, counteracting the pull of earth. Mr. Chiasson's arrow-sharp arabesques and panther-soft turning jumps reinforce the resemblance.
"I can't describe exactly how I see the fabric," Mr. Chiasson said. "But I see it as alive, not just fabric, but like my partner, actually. Like a woman, most of the time. And then, the sails are my wings, helping me to fly, bringing me up to the air." Unlike a ballerina, he himself supplies the muscular strength, but the silk is not dead matter. In his hands, it, too, seems to breathe and dance.
The so-called "German wheel," consisting of two conjoined giant hoops in which Antoine Carabinier Lepine rolls like a runaway wheel or a giant penny around the axis of his navel, is another instance of a prop that takes on a life of its own.
Genevieve Lemay performs trapeze-style on the flying rings to the strains of the perfumed "Valse triste" of Sibelius, one of the program's many musical numbers conceived in the spirit of the dance. Here, however, a spectator may make a disappointing discovery. Unlike Mr. Chiasson's silk or Mr. Lepine's German wheel, Ms. Lemay's equipment is effectively a pendulum, a mechanical device once indispensable to clockmakers for its regularity of motion. That very regularity makes it an intractable partner for a dancer, subjugating any give-and-take of elegant phrasing to its Procrustean tick-tock.
Identified in the program as "principal dancers," Lucie Vigneault and Koichi Yano benefit from greater freedom. They enter from above, suspended from the thinnest of guy wires, Ms. Vigneault as a siren preening above Everyman's head, Mr. Yano as her counterpart who over the course of the show evolves into Everyman's discreet guardian spirit. At the first encounter, Mr. Yano -- suspended horizontally -- calmly circumambulates Mr. James's midriff. Not coincidentally, he is also the first to lift Mr. James off his feet. Later in the show, Mr. Yano -- directly above Mr. James's head -- goes into a handstand that ends with his feet closing into a classical ballerina's fifth on pointe, only upside down. It is an exquisite stylistic flourish that also turns out to be highly functional. "Actually," Ms. Madore said, "closing the feet this way helps Koichi keep the position."
Who knows? Maybe it is the rightness of the mechanics that makes the picture look so beautiful. Matter and spirit: they are one.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
From the Ferment of Liberation Comes a Revolution in African Art

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
AFRICA, whatever it is, is everywhere. It's far more than just a continent. It's a global diaspora, an international culture and a metaphor with fantastical associations for the West: gold, savages, "darkest," "deepest," liberation, devastation. 
 There are Africas wherever you turn: in the streets of Paris, Los Angeles and Port-au-Prince, Haiti; in classrooms, museums and dance clubs, on movie screens and the airwaves. Africa has long flowed in New York City's bloodstream. And a fresh infusion has just arrived with "The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945-1994," an exhibition at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Queens. 
 It's an "art of a continent" affair -- why do we keep getting these? -- so it has problems. It covers too many countries ( Africa, taken from Algiers to Cape Town as it is here, has nearly 50) and too many media (art, film, literature, film, music), and includes too few women, which may be a curatorial choice or a reflection of the time span covered. It has agendas you could argue with and doesn't have some artists you wish were there. That said, it's packed with stimulating images. It's thrilling to think about, and purely in terms of new information, it's one of most important shows to hit town in years. 
Like most ambitious shows, it tells a story, one that began in two places at once. In 1903, the Nigerian artist Aina Onabolu started painting portraits in the city of Lagos, adapting a style from European magazine photographs. His portraits were a hit with his Nigerian clientele. There was just something about them. They looked African, but different, new, chic, modern. Suddenly everybody wanted to look like that. Commissions poured in.
A few years later, Pablo Picasso was wandering the galleries of the ethnological museum in Paris, the Trocadero. What on earth, friends wondered, was he doing in that old place? (Picasso himself referred to it as "that awful museum.") What he was doing was trying to think and feel his way out of a stifling 19th-century European tradition and into a new art, an art with some give, some crackle, some air. Standing in front of a vitrine of African masks, he found what he was after.
I'm simplifying, but the essentials are true. Picasso invented modern European art with the help of Africa. Onabolu invented modern African art with the help of Europe. Which of the two made the more revolutionary move? In most accounts, Picasso gets the nod by default, because Onabolu doesn't exist for Western art history, nor does the modern African art that followed him.
The situation is changing. Up to the late 1980's, almost nobody in the West knew, or wanted to know, about modern and contemporary art from Africa, meaning art that wasn't "tribal," that was maybe conversant with Western trends and styles. Then came an exhibition titled "Magicians of the Earth," in Paris in 1989, which mixed young African artists with some of their hip Western and Asian counterparts. Whatever its shortcomings, the show put contemporary African work on the postmodern map and opened a dialogue.
African work began to appear in zeitgeisty showcases like the Venice Biennale. Africa organized biennials of its own in Cairo, Dakar and Johannesburg. Stars emerged: Ghada Amer of Egypt, William Kentridge of South Africa, Chris Ofili of "Sensation" fame who is of Nigerian descent and born in England. The global art trade routes are now populous with promising new figures, among them Odalele Ajiboye Bamgboye, Zineb Sedira, Wangechi Mutu, Romuald Hazoume, Moshekwa Langa, Tracey Rose, Fatimah Tuggar, Kendell Geers, Siemon Allen, Zwelethu Mthethwa, Pascale Marthine Tayou. The list keeps growing. 
Some of these artists live in Africa. Many have left and move between multiple addresses elsewhere. This is an old, old story; non-Western artists seeking international careers have always floated around. The self-taught Onabolu moved from Lagos to London, then to Paris to study art. He then returned to Lagos, where he introduced art courses into Nigerian schools, nurturing the African modernism he had helped initiate. 
That modernism makes a thrilling but complex and difficult subject, prickly with preconceptions and contradictions. In the West, "African" and "modern" were mutually exclusive terms from the start. Modern meant movement, change, cities, technology, cultural adulthood. Africa meant stasis, timelessness, tribes, magic, and childlike naivete, the flip side of which was primeval savagery requiring supervision, instruction and punishment.
That was the standard picture, one that gave Europe a pretext for claiming the continent as its own and carving it up into surveyable, exploitable pieces. Then in 1945, Africa gave Europe a surprise. The fifth Pan-African Congress met and issued a clarion call for anticolonial action. Charismatic leaders like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Patrice Lumumba of Congo demanded independence: immediate, no strings attached. Students agitated; workers went on strike; people pushed and pushed and pushed until, in 1960, 17 countries became self-governing. The United Nations declared the Year of Africa. Modern Africa was officially born. 
"The Short Century," organized by the Nigerian-born curator Okwui Enwezor, who is also in charge of Documenta XI in Germany this summer, takes off from this moment and gives a layered, multimedia account of it. African leaders, dressed in flowing robes and Saville Row suits, speak on film. Traditional drum riffs mingle with rock 'n' roll on records. In photographs, young people dance the the night away at the Peppermint Lounge in Bamako, Mali. Karl Marx and Paris Match, Jean-Paul Sartre and Wole Soyinka are on student reading lists.
Art developed less publicly, more quietly, and in several directions at once. Universities offered academic training based on the European model. Communal workshops established by missionaries and emigre artists encouraged a hybrid of traditional and modern forms. A strain of urban popular art flourished, recording (often with editorial comment) political events, religious enthusiasms and advertising's latest fashions in crisp, colorful graphic style. 
From all of these sources an extraordinary generation of artists emerged, all with distinctive histories and interests. Ibrahim El-Salahi, who led the way in mingling figurative and abstract modes, studied at the Khartoum School of Fine and Applied Arts in Sudan, then at the Slade School in London, finally settling in England. 
The pioneering South African painter Ernest Mancoba, born in 1904, had his initial training in missionary schools and later relocated to Paris, where he developed a pattern-rich abstract style and became associated with the Cobra group. The Senegalese-born Iba Ndiaye also studied in France, became a curator at the Musee de l'Homme in Paris, and was asked by the late Leopold Sedar Senghor to assist in developing the National School of Fine Arts in Dakar. He still commutes between the two cities.
Other artists stayed in Africa. Gerard Sekoto has spent most of an extremely productive career as a painter and teacher in Johannesburg, as has Frederic Bruly Bouabre in his hometown, Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Thomas Mukarobgwa (1924-99) remained in Zimbabwe, where he was part of the workshop that produced the much-exhibited, modernist-inflected Shona sculpture, though his best work is his painting. 
But support has been chancy for even the most gifted artists, and lives and careers could easily go awry. The Ivory Coast sculptor Christian Lattier (1925-78) studied in Paris, where his brilliance was quickly recognized. He returned home a celebrity in the independence years, but eventually found himself ignored by a government that might have given him patronage. He died a bitter man, though his work is, for good reason, hugely influential among young artists today. 
Gebre Kristos Desta (1932-81) also had bad luck. He got his start as an apprentice in an Ethiopian Coptic-Orthodox church school painting religious images and later in Germany developed a semiabstract figurative style. But as his art grew more personal and expressive it was dismissed in Europe as old-fashioned and reviled in Ethiopia for breaking with tradition. Desta eventually went into political exile and died in Lawton, Okla., where a local church had taken him in as a refugee.
Seen in an international context, Desta's no-win predicament has also been the fate of African modernism as a whole, with the West, seat of art-world economic power, delivering a hostile critical assessment in the form of almost complete silence. Why? 
Some of the reasons lie in old cultural biases. For many European tastemakers of the colonial period, there was only one kind of African art: traditional art, also known as tribal, also known as primitive. Each tribe or ethnic group, the idea was, had a unique, homogeneous style. This style was passed on by anonymous artist-craftsman from time immemorial, untainted by outside styles, including Western contact. Only objects that met these criteria were Authentic.
But authenticity is ethnographic fiction, a political-control concept. In Africa, as everywhere, cultures are organic and porous, always creatively interacting with other cultures, nearby and far-flung. Traditions are invented, repeated, discarded, exchanged, revived. Those pronounced dead have often simply assumed new, unrecognizable forms. But such fecund activity, life-enhancing though it may be, is exactly what you don't want to know about if you are trying to shape an aesthetic canon, or a viable market, or a scientific taxonomy that will allow you to explain the world in a certain way, to keep certain hierarchies intact. 
Or maybe the problem for Western viewers with modern African art -- art using Western media and styles -- is less with foreignness than with familiarity. African art cast, however superficially, in "our" pictorial language automatically prompts critical responses we don't apply to traditional African art. We are apt to be disappointed in the work as "Western," and blind to it as "African." In the words of the art historian Bogumil Jewsiewicki, "The West resists appropriation by other cultures; it has never agreed that cultural exchange goes in both directions." 
In any case, the whole traditional-versus-modern debate remains very much alive in the present. "Magicians of the Earth" integrated African work into a larger cultural mix only by casting everyone involved in the show into New Age-ish roles of shamans and priests. Two of the most voluble promoters of contemporary African work, the curator Andre Magnin and the collector Jean-Christophe Pigozzi, are interested only in African artists whom they see as untainted by exposure to Western academic influences. 
The two have put their weight behind some fascinating work, from the bristling dance masks by John Goba of Sierra Leone to the vivid narrative paintings by Tishibumba Kanda Matulu of Congo, the gifted visual chronicler of Lumumba's rise and fall, who is also in the P.S. 1 show. But some of their other choices are less sound, and a whiff of neoprimitive exoticizing surrounds their enterprise, similar to that attached to so-called Outsider Art in the West. 
Exoticism is addictive; everyone loves it, and that includes artists and critics. It's the aesthetic version of a carbohydrate diet: it tastes good, it's easily digested, it gives you a quick, warm lift. But it has clear racist implications when "African" is associated exclusively with the fantastic, the occult, the untutored. The same is true of the notion of the authentic. 
"To reject the exoticization of Africa is to reject a whole world view carefully and painstakingly fabricated over centuries," writes the Nigerian-born artist Olu Oguibe. That is the daunting task Mr. Enwezor has set for himself in "The Short Century," and, by placing 20th-century Afrcan art in the context of dominant international styles -- which is, of course, itself a form of exociticism to some eyes -- he comes close to his goal. 
SOME of the work he has chosen plays both sides of the question. This is the case in paintings by the Nigerian-born artist Ouattara, which couch archaic-looking personal symbols in a suave modern style; in the London-born, Nigeria-bred Yinka Shonibare's vivid installation of 19th-century European costumes made from faux-African fabrics; and in the incomparably witty, self-inventing early photographic self-portraits of Samuel Fosso, who lives in Central African Republic and continues to produce intriguing work that has yet to be seen in New York. 
Unsurprisingly, many of the latest contributions in the show fall within the perimeters of a quintessentially postmodern genre: Conceptual Art. This is as true of room-filling installations by Mr. Tayou and Georges Adeagbo as it is of the archival collections of family photographs by Santu Mofokeng, one of South Africa's most important mid-career artists, and the hermetic, data-rich collages of Moshekwa Langa, whom someone should grab for a New York solo, as they should Ms. Sidera and Rachid Koraichi, whose range is only hinted at here.
Postmodernism, and its ideological complement, internationalism, have proved to be deeply flawed concepts. The first has softened into an institutional house-style, a kind of modernism-plus. The second has turned out to be another way for the Western art establishment to stay in charge, control the legitimization process, define a market. Still, under postmodernist auspices, modern and contemporary African art have become increasingly visible on the global scene.
This is certainly the case in New York. Concurrent with "The Short Century," the Studio Museum in Harlem, which has recently assumed a global perspective on African-Amercan art similar to Mr. Enwezor's on African art, is giving Mr. Shonibare a solo turn and is presenting a group show of four impressive African-born women artists, among whom Ms. Mutu is a stand-out. The Contemporary African Gallery on Manhattan's Upper West Side has a small show of postliberation work, with a little Mukarobwa painting, "The Old Man Afraid to Cross," as exquisite as any Paul Klee. 
A harrowing exhibition of photographs of the race wars in apartheid-era South Africa provides a crucial supplement to the watered-down representation of those events at P.S. 1. And a current crisis in the same country is addressed in a show titled "Break the Silence: Art and H.I.V./AIDS in South Africa," which opens today at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the University of California in Los Angeles. 
And there's more in the future. Scheduled to bow next year at the Fowler is "Passport to Paradise: Sufi Arts of Senegal and Beyond," which will draw on popular images of the revered Islamic saint Amadou Bamba, whose cult is omnipresent in the city of Dakar and among Senegalese populations across the world, including in New York. And the Museum for African Art in Manhattan has a diaspora project in the works: a large-scale show devoted to African-born expatriate artists. 
Laurie Farrell, a curator at the museum, will have dozens of names to choose from. The high optimism of Africa's liberation moment ended fast. In the years that followed, the continent has been shaken by political violence, natural disaster and epidemic disease. Given these conditions, along with an absence of exhibition and patronage networks, many contemporary artists, like their modern predecessors, have chosen to live elsewhere. Many of them express no interest in exploring African ethnic identity through art. They are somewhere else now, and sooner or later they will be somewhere else again. 
Will that somewhere ever be Africa? Art tends to move in cycles and circles. Today's hot act is tomorrow's old news, as at least some of the artists carried along by the upsurge of interest in Africa are aware. Yet part of what's making this upsurge happen is a cultural version of eternal return. In Ms. Mutu's collages of cubistically broken-up female bodies, which seem both iconic and tawdry, we're seeing elements borrowed from Africa by early European modernism returning to African in contemporary art, looking both familiar and fresh, radically remade, conceptually repositioned. 
A similar karmic dance was engineered by Mr. Tayou in a conceptual piece created for the Lyon Biennale in France last summer. Titled "The Old New," it consisted of little more than an exhausted-looking wreck of a car seemly ready for the scrap heap, one of thousands of worn-out vehicles sent from Europe to Africa every year. In Africa, these cars are resurrected: their engines are patched together; they are fitted out for new life and hard usage. 
Mr. Tayou had this car shipped back from Africa to Europe and put on display as an African machine: old on the outside, newly reinvented on the inside. "I would like to take this car around the world," he said when the show opened. That goal doesn't seem unrealistic at all.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Page 1 of Arts & Leisure today with an article about African art misspells the surname of the painter of "The Old Man Afraid to Cross." He is Thomas Muka robgwa, not Mukarobwa. The continuation of the article misstates the name of a gallery on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. It is the Contemporary African Art Gallery, not the Contemporary African Gallery.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Of a Big Punjabi Family, By a Big Punjabi Family

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER; Elisabeth Bumiller, a White House correspondent for The New York Times, is the author of "May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons: A Journey Among the Women of India."

 BODY:
THE plan was to make a simple film about an Indian wedding, a home movie, really, in 30 days during New Delhi's glorious, sensuous monsoon. "It was going against the idea of needing millions of rupees and special effects and manipulations," said Mira Nair, the 44-year old director. "It was going back to the essence of drama, good acting, urgency and seeing what you could make out of that self-imposed leanness. But of course it was a circus when we were doing it. I mean, a Punjab wedding -- who was I kidding? This was like a hymn to ostentation."
 That hymn, "Monsoon Wedding," has turned out to be looser and richer than Ms. Nair's previous work, even the highly praised "Mississippi Masala" (1991) or "Salaam Bombay," a 1988 feature about Indian street children that was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign language film. Neither had an eye trained directly on Ms. Nair's own world, a comic, chaotic Punjabi family of New Delhi during one hot month in the summer of 2001. 
 "It's all very, very close to life," Ms. Nair said. "It wasn't like we had to check some authenticity barometer, because we were living in it." 
Shot by hand-held camera, with a 68-member ensemble cast laced with Delhi socialites and Ms. Nair's own family, "Monsoon Wedding" promptly won the Golden Lion, the top prize, at the Venice International Film Festival in September and has filled theaters in India ever since. It is to open on Friday in New York.
"Basically, they're Punjabi relatives," Ms. Nair said of the cast. "You know, all my relatives, and their jewelry and their saris. Everyone." Connoisseurs of Indian fashion may find the saris alone worth the price of admission.
"Stunning saris," Ms. Nair readily agreed. "My mother didn't know what to wear to Venice when we won the Golden Lion, because all the saris were on screen." She laughed. "As if they'd remember."
Ms. Nair held forth on a recent winter evening in a spacious Columbia University faculty apartment on Riverside Drive, overlooking the Hudson River and a cold, plum-colored sunset. There was an animist totem of the Indian god Krishna on a swing in one corner, a display of Lego contraptions created by Ms. Nair's 10-year-old son, Zohran, in another. Just like the Indians in "Monsoon Wedding," Ms. Nair is a charming, take-charge mix of several worlds, with glamorous looks that do little to hide the toughness underneath. 
Sabrina Dhawan, Ms. Nair's screenwriter for "Monsoon Wedding," has seen her deal with American distribution companies. "There's absolutely no apology about being Indian or being female," she says. "That whole colonial hang-up that we've all grown up with, Mira has none of that. Or if she has, she's worked her way far beyond it."
Shashi Tharoor, a senior United Nations official and an Indian novelist who played Marc Antony to Ms. Nair's Cleopatra in a production during their college days, agreed. "There's no question that she was going to define her metier, whether it was acting in films or directing them," he said. As for Ms. Nair's portrayal of Cleopatra, he said, "She had sort of a passing resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor, and she did well."
Like many women of India's privileged classes, Ms. Nair was not raised to take her place at the back of the stage. As the daughter of an officer in the Indian Administrative Service, the country's elite civil service, Ms. Nair grew up in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneshwar, known for its 600 temples. She was educated at Delhi University's women's college, Miranda House, and then at Harvard. Now she divides her time with her family between New York City, New Delhi and Kampala, Uganda, the home of her husband, Mahmood Mamdani, an East African academic of Indian heritage who teaches at Columbia.
I USED to have a joke when people asked where I live," Ms. Nair said in an interview a decade ago. "I'd say, 'I live on Air India.' But the other side is that you live between your ears. You carry your home within yourself. That's a nice-sounding cerebral concept, but the truth is that you're torn."
Perhaps for that reason, "Monsoon Wedding" is a loving look at Ms. Nair's roots, a comedy of manners that pokes fun at the striving materialism of 21st-century upper-class Indian culture but is at heart a celebration of modern Indian family life. Ms. Nair recoils at the word "sweet" to describe the film, but it has an undeniable sunny disposition. "You know, it's different now, being a parent," Ms. Nair acknowledged. "I've always been committed to family, but being in this time of life, it makes such a difference in how I feel. I feel very much cushioned by my family." 
Still, Ms. Nair has also called her film "an homage to major vulgarity" that romps all over the Punjabis, the northern Indians from the prosperous region of Punjab who poured into New Delhi after the 1947 partition of the British Empire into India and Pakistan. Since then, Punjabis have come to dominate the capital economically, culturally and socially. When I lived in New Delhi for three and a half years in the mid-1980's, Punjabis were the ruling entrepreneurial class, and liked to call themselves "puppies" instead of yuppies. They made fun of their nouveau riche ways, but no one laughed at their ability to make money.
Ms. Nair clearly had a good time mixing the cell phones and Gucci wraparound sunglasses of "Monsoon Wedding" with the traditional Indian social mores, like the semi-arranged marriage at the center of the film. The plot flows from the preparations for the wedding, and the overlapping relationships in a family that speaks, authentically, a mix of English, Punjabi and Hindi.
Aditi Verma (Vasundhara Das), a peaches-and-cream, Cosmo-reading Punjabi princess, is to be married to Hemant (Parvin Dabas), a young, sensitive and very handsome Indian computer software consultant she barely knows. Her parents have found him for her. But they are also sad because Hemant, who lives in Houston, will soon be whisking their only daughter off to America.
Rather than objecting to all this, Aditi, just like many of her real-life counterparts, is pleased that her mother and father have so expertly fulfilled a major parental obligation. (In a modern Indian arranged marriage, the potential bride and groom have veto power over the parents' choice.) So all is well, except that Aditi is secretly in love with a Delhi talk show host -- a married, self-absorbed cad -- and is still stealing off for assignations with him as the wedding party descends on the harried Verma household.
And that's just the beginning. Interwoven with the story of Aditi and Hemant are four others, including one of incest, a particular Indian taboo. "Probably more than in the West, we prefer to believe that it doesn't exist," said Ms. Dhawan, the screenwriter, who said she had drawn from the experiences of friends. "I was very keen to set it in the upper middle class."
The crisis of the incest provides the father of the bride, played by Naseeruddin Shah, a well-known Indian actor, with a painful choice. In the end, that choice gives "Monsoon Wedding" its ballast and moral center.
"I think without having made all the other films I made, I would not have made this film," Ms. Nair said. "I just pleased myself, but I was also self-assured." The intention, she added, "was not to think of the result. Therefore, not to think of awards and all that, who will buy it, who will take it, how will they deal with the three languages, how will we do this?"
In 1999, Ms. Nair took the idea for "Monsoon Wedding" to the Cannes International Film Festival, where her reputation ensured that she got all the financing she wanted, $1.5 million, pin money in Hollywood. "It took one and a half days, 18 meetings, no script, and I just said, 'I want to make a contemporary film, very low budget, India now, 30 days.' Everybody said yes."
She set it at the time of the summer monsoon, when the dust storms and 110-degree days of May and June build up to a thunderous release of the rain that turns New Delhi green overnight. Ms. Nair loves the season, but the real reason for using it as a cinematic backdrop was that it enabled her to bring along her son, who was on summer vacation.
She then borrowed furniture, paintings and props from friends and had food delivered daily to the cast from the family kitchen. When in New Delhi, Ms. Nair shares a house in a fashionable colony with her mother, who settled there years ago. Ms. Nair's brothers live nearby. Her father, who is now separated from her mother, lives across the street. 
But they get along, no? Like one big happy Indian family?
"They don't," Ms. Nair said, with who knows how many more film ideas tucked behind a sphinx-like smile. "But the rest of us get along very well."

HEADLINE: OUT OF ORDER; 
Signed, Sealed and Then What?

BYLINE:  By DAVID BOUCHIER; E-mail: liorder@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DELIVERIES are the lifeblood of the suburbs. All day long the trucks rumble through the subdivisions, enlivening the empty days of those of us who are at home waiting for a delivery. Is it our turn at last? What decadent luxuries have the neighbors ordered from the Bed Barn, Seniors 'R' Us or Hot Tub Heaven? The boxes reveal nothing. They could hold a pool table or a gazebo. Often the item was ordered so long ago that it comes as a surprise to the recipients themselves.
 Economists tell us capitalism delivers the goods, and so it does, eventually. But very few things in furniture and appliance stores are actually for immediate delivery. They are there to be admired, and can be ordered for some remote future date, when a box will arrive from a factory in New Jersey or China containing something more or less similar to what you saw in the showroom, if you can still remember it. A couple of summers back we ordered some deck furniture around Memorial Day, and it arrived just in time for Labor Day. 
 Very elderly readers may remember that, many years ago, stores would offer to deliver any large item "at your convenience." Now they deliver at their convenience, with instructions like, "Make sure somebody is at home 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday."
It's a throwback to the old days of the house-bound wife, who had no car and nothing better to do but wait breathlessly on the front porch for the truck to arrive.
This would be less aggravating if deliveries were free, or at least cheap. But in most cases it would be cheaper to hire a limousine and a young weightlifter. We've been charged up to $50 for a 10-mile drive and a five-minute unloading job. Allowing for traffic stops and a quick visit to Dunkin' Donuts, this works out to about $100 per billable hour.
In spite of these very high rates of remuneration, the drivers are not great navigators. They call up, asking plaintively for directions.
"What's the cross street?" they always demand, and I always reply, "We're on the map." (At $100 an hour, surely they can read a map.) Long silence. Then again, "Yeah, but what's the cross street?"
Even after the driver has grasped the local geography, we can't relax. Preparations must be made: old appliances removed and disconnected, a pathway cleared, cats warned. Everything has to be just right, or you can say goodbye to your delivery.
Sometimes, there's only one deliveryman, with a huge refrigerator or table. He takes it for granted that the customer will go out to the truck and help, and perhaps provide a dolly if there is none on the truck. I don't mind this when my wife is at home, but I hate physical labor myself.
Even when your treasured purchase has arrived and has been dumped in the spot closest to the front door, your work is far from over. Most deliveries come with vast volumes of packaging, like Russian dolls, one layer inside another. A computer printer 15 inches across was hidden inside a box 25 inches wide and 16 inches high. A two-drawer filing cabinet came in a box big enough to live in. The total packaging for the filing cabinet weighed 22 pounds, only slightly less than the object itself.
This amount of protection suggests that delivery operatives are not always as careful as they might be.
Once you have disentangled your purchase from its wrappings, you often find nothing but fragments and a note saying "Some assembly required." There's no such thing as furniture any more, only furniture kits. When you ask in the showroom how long it will take to assemble, they invariably reply, "About an hour."
"How long will it take to put together this bookcase?"
"Oh, about an hour."
"What about this Boeing 747?"
"About an hour."
A twin bed we ordered was just a heap of lumber with a few screws and a sheet of instructions written by someone who had obviously not been an English major. An adjustable chair arrived in 32 parts, with assembly instructions that seem to have been designed for a different product -- perhaps a mainframe computer. It took most of the day to put together. The results never look like the thing you ordered from the catalog or showroom.
The deliverymen know this, and it amuses them. "That'll keep you busy till April," they say cheerfully, dumping the cartons in the middle of the floor. Perhaps they are cheerful because they know a secret source of assembled furniture, just like we used to get in the old days when a bed or a dog kennel arrived looking just like itself, and ready for use.
You can guess that we've had several big deliveries to the house recently. I'm waiting for one right now. The neighbors are bursting with curiosity -- and so am I.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
Stamford Median Up; Greenwich Stratosphere Cools

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
DURING the four to six weeks after the catastrophic events of Sept. 11, home buyers were almost nowhere to be seen in Fairfield County real estate offices, and agents shrank from making calls for fear of offending clients' sensibilities. 
 But house hunters were soon on the prowl again, swarming back in large numbers as though making up for the hiatus. A few of them are so determined to get the house they want that they engage in bidding wars and pay more than the list price. 
 Such buyers do not represent the whole residential market, however. Sales are fewer and although some prices have risen above the 2000 level and others are dropping, most homes are selling below their asking prices, and those that are overpriced are sitting on the sidelines for months. According to figures compiled by William Raveis Real Estate, the median asking price in Stamford for 2001 was $560,000, but the median sale price was $455,000, which is 5 percent above the median sale price of $431,500 in 2000. Coldwell Banker's median sale price for 2001 was $452,500. 
"We got a beautiful brand new home in Stamford," said Debbie Nuzzo. She and her husband, John, who was transferred by his company from Cockeysville, Md., to White Plains, will move in next month. The house, on 1.2 acres, was built on spec by Harry Webski, a Stamford builder. 
"We looked in Rye Brook, Pound Ridge, Bedford, Purchase, New Canaan and Greenwich," Mrs. Nuzzo said. "The taxes in Westchester were a big deterrent -- $16,000 to $35,000 for some of the homes we were shown. New Canaan was more expensive than Stamford, but not worth it. And Greenwich? Forget it! Besides, we both like Stamford. It's more cosmopolitan, livelier." 
Peter Helie, president and chief executive of Prudential Connecticut Realty, said he thinks the county is positioned to withstand this recession far better than it was able to face the glut of vacant overbuilt office buildings and foreclosed homes in the recession of the early 90's.
"We are not hearing about a lot of people losing their jobs in Connecticut," he said, "and help from Greenspan on interest rates has been a godsend. If interest and unemployment rates stay stable, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a good year ahead."
The state unemployment rate in December was 3.1 percent, far below the national rate of 5.6 percent. In Fairfield County the interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was 7.125 percent at the end of last year, and the rate on a one-year adjustable was 6.375 percent, according to the Geosegment Systems Corporation and the Commercial Record Publishing Company. The number of loans dropped from 4,961 in the last four months of 2000 to 1,397 in the corresponding period last year.
Mary Ann Evick, president of Raveis Homelink Real Estate, noted that "one area of the state lagging behind is midshore from Cheshire to Guilford." But, she added, "New London County is roaring ahead, and Fairfield came back stronger than ever. In January of this year our business was up 70 percent -- record breaking, even with a lack of inventory."
Inventory is cited by real estate companies as a multifaceted problem. As renters have recently rushed to buy houses while interest rates were low, they leave no houses behind to sell. 
Corporations, said Beth Williams, corporate services director at Prudential, "are avoiding the cost of moving employees permanently by encouraging them to rent in the new location and rent rather than sell their existing homes." Single-family homes are also kept off the market by individual owners who move out but keep the old houses as income-producing rentals. 
"There is a strong feeling that real estate is a solid place to invest your money after the stock market dropped," said Elayne Jassey, sales executive at Prudential in Stamford. "Homes are even achieving a significance they didn't have before Sept. 11 -- home is a safety net, whether or not you were personally affected. There is almost nobody who doesn't know somebody whose life was blown apart."
FOR some families who lost breadwinners on Sept. 11, a measure of help came from an unexpected source -- the National Association of Realtors. Sums equal to three months of mortgage or rent payments totaling $8.4 million were given to more than 1,300 affected families nationwide, 37 of them in Connecticut. The program, called the Realtors' Housing Relief Fund was put together at the association headquarters in Chicago on Sept. 12. "None of us had ever done anything like this before," said Lisa Governale, vice-president of public affairs for the Connecticut affiliate of the national association.
Money was contributed by affiliate associations in 49 states, by real estate companies and individuals, distributed through an application and approval process to families in danger of losing their homes. The fund was closed out on Dec. 31.
Optimism that the vacancy rate in the office market in Fairfield County, now about 12 percent, will improve in the next 12 to 18 months when Citigroup, Crompton, American Express and other companies complete the movement of secondary offices to the county has prompted Raveis to hire two full-time "corporate callers," who will set up programs for relocating employees, tailored to a company's policies and budgets.
There is a pool of about 600 potential new residents at companies that have announced moves, and building continues or has recently been completed on some 900 apartments in Stamford. In the urban renewal section of South Norwalk, the Spinnaker Company is scheduled to build up to 245 apartments in the next year. 
But a 932-unit apartment complex approved by Stamford's planning and zoning boards is on hold, said Marshall Teicher, a partner at Roseland Properties of New Jersey, contract purchasers from the Milstein Brothers of New York. "Vacancy rates are up and rents are trending down, so we're struggling with the economics," he said.
Samuel B. Fuller, executive vice president of development and construction at AvalonBay Communities, said: "Sept. 11 clearly affected our business. There has been a clear reduction in demand. In spite of the low unemployment rate, there isn't any growth, and that's what attracts apartment renters." Rents at the six Avalon complexes in Stamford have been reduced slightly, he said, and are now at $876 for a one-bedroom apartment at Greyrock to $3,600 for a three-bedroom unit at Avalon Harbor, a newly opened luxury complex on the water. 
The number of apartments on the market in Norwalk recently was 90, double the44 available a year earlier, said Carol Ann Falasco, sales agent at Coldwell Banker. "Home buyers have dwindled in the $500,000 range, but the $200,000 to $400,000 market is very strong, and investors are looking for large older homes to convert into two- and three-family rentals." 
Paul Breunich, managing partner of William Pitt Real Estate, headquartered in Stamford, said, "After 9/11 a lot of big deals fell through at the high end." September was down 50 percent from the previous year, and while sales and dollar volume increased steadily through December and January, "the upper end is still not there," he said.
TRANSACTIONS at Kelly Associates in Darien were off by 7.6 percent in 2001 compared with 2000, according to the company's owner, Eugene Kelly. "All of the decline was during the fourth quarter," he said. "December was the slowest month in memory. But in January of this year we had 38 sales, a record for the month."
Nevertheless, he added: "With Enron and the stock market overlaying our fragile economy, it's difficult to be ebullient about the prospects for 2002. The smart guys discount the present and look to the future. We'll have to wait and see."
Prices of homes at the top of the market in Greenwich have softened, as has been the case in New Canaan, Westport and Wilton.
"Normally sales of $15 million-plus happen after every Labor Day," said Gideon Fountain, an agent at the Cleveland Duble & Arnold Corporation, a Greenwich firm. "Of course, 9/11 short-circuited that." The median price for Greenwich homes, he estimates, is slightly above $1 million, and $500,000 is the median for a two-bedroom, two-bath condo. "I was amazed," he said, "to see the highest sale here in 2001 was only $13.75 million. 
"Greenwich is not Beverly Hills," he noted. "We still have a supply of relatively affordable housing on small lots. The cheapest right now is $385,000 in the center of town. Greenwich and the Upper East Side of Manhattan had the most serious losses of wealth, but most people here do not live beyond their means so they can take quite a hit and keep the house. We still get those who bite off more than they can chew, but I see no signs of the young dot-com-ers putting their houses on the market."

 BODY:
IT is one of the truly gut-wrenching decisions in most people's lives: why buy, or sell, a home now? 
 "Real estate is a very psychological phenomenon," said Robert Campbell, a professor of real estate finance at Hofstra whose bachelor's degree from Yale was in psychology. "Just talk to somebody who's buying for the first time and it'll be someone going through a trauma." 
 "It's a frightening event, a big risk, a big investment," Dr. Campbell said. "It means you're going to move, taking all your money and more and putting it into a house -- more because you're taking out a mortgage." 
Into that standard tangle of psychological tremors, recent events have infused an even greater degree of uncertainty. The stories of the New York region's manic residential real estate market -- the frenzied bidding wars, tales of fisticuffs on the front lawn, the champagne-and-brie bragging rites over a newly snared penthouse, the trauma of the turndown -- have abated a bit in the more sobering circumstances of the last five months.
Yet now as in the past, market observers -- from those wandering the halls of higher learning to the numbers-crunchers at their spreadsheets to the brokers on the phone -- still wonder just what goes on in the minds of potential home buyers.
In recent years, their hunches have come under a more careful, systematic scrutiny. There is an increasingly prominent wrinkle in the study of economics, something beyond the numbers -- the psychology of finances.
In the field of real estate economics, it may well have surfaced back in the 50's with a research paper that has long been considered a classic. In that paper, "A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures," Charles Tiebout, an economics professor at Northwestern University, postulated that potential suburbanites really buy a community first -- the package of local services, the schools, their sense of the neighborhood -- and then the house. That observation is, perhaps, not so surprising now. But those were the days when suburbs were just encroaching on vast tracts of farmland, before they had become a sprawling concern.
These days, such studies fall under a new designation: behavioral finance.
It is a discipline that looks at macroeconomic concepts like loss-aversion theory (why people buy or sell differently depending on whether the market is going up or down) and price anchoring (how during a boom the recently outlandish price soon becomes acceptable).
And it looks at how micro you-wouldn't-believe-how-peculiarly-personal factors can sometimes influence home buying behavior. A broker tells the tale of a woman who insists on living near a Dairy Barn. A Harvard professor has written a book titled "Sex and Real Estate." The fireplace as deal-breaker.
It was during the big real estate boom of the late 1980's -- the one preceding the big boom of the late 1990's and early 2000's -- that two economics professors were introduced by a mutual friend who knew they were both musing over the same question: how do buyers behave in boom and post-boom markets? Together, they surveyed hundreds of buyers across the country.
"The answers were remarkably insipid, actually," said Robert J. Shiller of Yale University who, with Karl E. Case of Wellesley College, conducted the study.
"They would report on what they saw while driving," Dr. Shiller said. "Things like, 'There's so much traffic here, so many cars.' Or, 'Everybody wants to live in California, and it's getting so crowded, so prices have to go up.' Or they would repeat stories about how hot the market was, houses selling on the first day, and express anxiety that 'If I don't buy now, I won't be able to afford one later.' "
"But nobody quoted any numbers, any population extrapolations," Dr. Shiller said. "Our uniform impression was that these buying decisions were not based on careful analysis. It's real people, and the decision to buy a house is inherently a very emotional one."
While market players and observers, obviously, cannot quantify those individually internal factors, they all agree that the housing market is driven at least as much by psychology as it is by economic fundamentals.
At the same time -- personal though buying decisions may be -- there certainly have been broadly embracing national and regional mood swings in the market over the decades, notes James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
"People respond, at least in the short term, to cyclical swings and external shocks," Dr. Hughes said. "But in the long term, housing has always bounced back as one of the more ebullient sectors of the economy."
In the early 70's, with inflation climbing, "housing was seen as a much better investment than stocks," Dr. Hughes said, "certainly better than your passbook savings account, which had a lower interest rate than inflation. The psychology built up that housing was the super piggy-bank."
But from 1974 to 1979, with the nation in an energy crisis, housing slumped. "People had been moving into bigger houses," Dr. Hughes said, "so the fear was whether those would turn out to be white elephants due to the higher heating and cooling costs." 
Pessimism seeped deep into the market for average-sized homes, as well. "We had double-digit mortgage rates, 16-plus percent," Dr. Hughes said. "People wondered about the death of the American dream house."
Real estate would roar again. "Particularly in our region," the professor said, "we had the great boom from '82 to '89, and housing experienced probably its biggest price rise ever." According to the Federal Office of Housing Enterprise Oversight, home prices across the nation jumped 45 percent from 1980 to 1988. And in the New York region, they skyrocketed by 145 percent.
"Housing ownership replaced sex as an everyday fantasy," Dr. Hughes said. "It was the subject at white wine and brie parties: 'How much did the house down the street sell for? What's my property worth now?' "
THEN came the worst recession, for the region, since the Great Depression. It lasted 38 months in the Northeast, '88 through '92, as opposed to eight months for most of the nation.
"During the boom years," Dr. Hughes said of the New York region, "we had built a 20-year supply of office space, on speculation, and that was true even for big condo and town house complexes. That was followed by vast bankruptcies among developers, the collapse of the S.&L. industry."
Then, during the post-recession early 90's, housing was held more as shelter than investment. "The notion was 'don't overinvest' in housing," he said, "and people, obviously, put a lot of money into the stock market."
Yet housing kept creeping back. And by 1998 prices reached, and then surpassed, their peak of 1988. "Housing again became a major obsession," Dr. Hughes said. 
Nowhere more so than in Manhattan. According to one leading survey, the Insignia Douglas Elliman Market Report, the median price for apartments in Manhattan increased by 19.1 percent in 1998, to $280,000; by 14.3 percent in 1999, to $320,000; and by no less than 50 percent, to $480,000, in 2000.
"And when the stock market started to tank a year or so ago, housing proved an even greater winner," Dr. Hughes said. "It was the safe port in the economic storm."
Barbara Corcoran, one of Manhattan's leading brokers and boosters, has a phrase for the frenzy that fuels booms: "pack mentality."
"Everybody likes to buy when everybody is buying, and nobody likes to buy when no one is buying," said Ms. Corcoran, the chairwoman of the Corcoran Group. 
"Pack mentality starts with a shift in a buyers' market, which soon becomes a snowball and then an avalanche into a sellers' market," Ms. Corcoran said. "The craziness is that everyone is buying with their hearts and justifying it with their heads -- or so they think. But all it really is is buying in the crowd."
"In actuality, it's the opposite," she said. "Smart people buy near the bottom. When the market bottoms, very few people have the courage to be out there. And if they are, they're the ones that make the steal of a deal."
Professor Shiller at Yale, co-author of that 1980's study on buyer behavior, argues that the media play a part in fueling pack mentality.
"The media are promulgating optimistic stories," Dr. Shiller said. "I'm not saying it's biased; they do report both sides. But people are receptive to the optimistic stories, so they just get more attention."
"It's the stories of people paying more than the asking price, of selling on the first day a house is listed, fistfights on the front lawn," he said. "They're great stories, so they resonate. And they get repeated by word of mouth, so there's a natural process in a boom market, which sustains the market, for a while."
And during the boom, according to behavioral finance theory, a phenomenon called "anchoring" comes into play.
"When people have to come up with a number for how much something is worth, they are easily influenced by other numbers that they hear," Dr. Shiller said. "Anchoring means that whatever value something has recently surpassed soon starts to sound reasonable."
In a volatile market, if prices have gone up a lot, he said, "people think, 'I wouldn't pay so much for that house but, hey, it might go up more. So I'll pay much more than I would have otherwise.' "
"In New York, people say the prices are outrageous," Dr. Shiller said. "But they've seen it before, so it starts to seem O.K. They buy anyway, because nobody really knows what the price should be."
"Unfortunately, that only works when prices are going up," he added.
For sellers, the primary psychological motivation is loss aversion -- even in the face of current market conditions.
"People make financial decisions differently on assets that have declined in value as opposed to assets that have increased in value," said Chris Mayer, a professor of real estate at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Dr. Mayer is co-author, with Prof. David Genesove at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of "Loss Aversion and Seller Behavior: Evidence From the Housing Market," an article in the November 2000 Quarterly Journal of Economics.
"Let's say I bought a house and the housing market has gone up 30 percent," Dr. Mayer said. "Now I'm thinking of selling, and maybe somebody makes an offer for a gain of 25 percent. A typical homeowner would look at that and say, 'Hey, I did pretty well.' But that homeowner actually did worse than the market."
"Still," Dr. Mayer continued, "if they got an offer for 25 percent appreciation, they would likely take it and be happy."
The key to that decision, the professor pointed out, is that the seller's benchmark is what he or she paid for the house, "not some index of how houses in that market have done recently."
In a down market, the seller would probably react differently.
"Let's say prices fall 30 percent," Dr. Mayer said. "If the seller got an offer from someone to buy for 25 percent below what they paid, no matter how long before, they would be very likely to turn down the offer and leave the house on the market in the hopes of getting a better offer."
"This behavior is odd to most economists because we believe people should benchmark performance against a market indicator," he said. "The person who receives an offer of a 25 percent gain over their original price will view themselves as being successful, even though they've done worse than the market. But the homeowner where the market went down 30 percent and the offer is only 25 percent down, they will actually have outperformed the market."
What that means for the real estate market is that at least at the start of a downturn many overpriced houses remain on the market. "Prices are sticky -- believe it or not, that's an old economics term -- meaning they stay high even when demand has fallen," Dr. Mayer said.
Eventually, as the number of houses on the market grows and the number of closed deals declines, sellers revise their prices downward. Many sellers, however, never drop their asking price enough and eventually withdraw from the market. Then, when there is a new upturn, houses start selling quickly because sellers are again accepting offers based on what they paid -- sometimes decades ago -- and not the current market value.
If loss aversion confounds classic economic calculations for the housing market, so, too, does the fact that pricing statistics are often months out of date, yet subject to more recent mood swings.
Real estate markets are very inefficient in setting prices, Dr. Mayer said. "That's because the comps, the comparables, used by buyers and sellers are old news. People look at sales that went to contract six to nine months ago in order to determine today's asking price."
"If you thought about buying or selling a stock, you wouldn't decide how much a share of I.B.M. is worth by looking at the closing price six months ago," he said. "But that's what people do in real estate all the time." 
And then they subject those numbers to current interpretations.
Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, the appraisal company that prepares the Elliman market report, strives for statistical understatement. Yet he admits that in his business a kind of verbal inflation can color the numbers.
"My brother-in-law is a research scientist in Ohio, and he sent me a list of tongue-in-cheek translations of official sounding statistical phrases that's been floating around the Internet," Mr. Miller said. "He thought it would apply to real estate, and I agree."
The list includes phrases like "in case after case," which it then defines as really meaning "twice." The phrase "in a series of cases" is really "thrice." "A definite trend is evident" is code for "these data are practically meaningless."
Mr. Miller believes the Internet has created some contradictory effects on real estate dealings. "With the ease of computing and the advent of desktop publishing," he said, "there's a tremendous amount of information available. Buyers and sellers and the people they depend on -- the broker, the mortgage broker, the banker, the appraiser -- all have access to much more information. So the market is much more sophisticated."
On the other hand, information certainly "can be presented in an impressive format that looks official, that's made to look pretty with fancy charts and graphs," Mr. Miller said, "but often there isn't much behind it. If it's a small number of transactions, they mean nothing."
And often, what buyers and sellers do with those statistics depends on what is influencing them at the time, he said, "on their emotional state."
By his own interpretation, Mr. Miller said, "The mind-set now in the current recession is significantly different than in the last recession, in 1991. I call that recession the glass-half-empty period. And now we're in a glass-half-full period."
Whatever the numbers, there is no accounting for the purely personal preferences that come to play in a real estate deal. With a hint of academic impishness, Dr. Campbell at Hofstra contends that -- beyond pricing, beyond community and commuting considerations, beyond the required number of bedrooms -- gender affects final choices.
"Women buy the house," he said. "The man is almost irrelevant. He'll go down to the basement and look at the furnace. He probably doesn't know whether it's gas or oil, but he'll look at the furnace. Meanwhile, the broker talks to the woman. And she's looking at the kitchen, whether it's big and modern; where the family room is; whether she can see the kids from the kitchen."
The backyard is a toss-up. "We can be nonsexist about that," Dr. Campbell said. "It's the place where suburban people congregate: the barbecues, the parties, kids playing. But a lot of guys have green thumbs, and the yard is the farm, like going off into the fields. I think there's dispute for control of the yard. It's analogous to the remote control."
And then there's the fireplace -- the hunter-gatherer's deal breaker.
"A man is not a man until he can throw wood on the fire and watch it burn," Dr. Campbell insisted. "My grandfather was born in a log cabin and if he didn't have fire, he didn't have heat."
"The fire evokes a sense of family history, of security, confidence," he said. "I'm just going back to the log cabin, but it probably goes back to the caves."
And out of the hearth comes property value way out of proportion to its cost. "We have run regressions indicating that a fireplace is worth about $10,000 in added value," Dr. Campbell said. Mr. Miller, the appraiser, placed that added value at $25,000 to $50,000 in Manhattan.
EVEN such traditionally quantifiable real estate values as "location, location, location" can take forms having as much to do with psychological needs as with convenience.
Francine Wojciechowski will attest to that.
Ms. Wojciechowski, a broker in the Douglas Elliman office in Locust Valley, Long Island, tells of the woman who insisted on living right by a Dairy Barn convenience store. "When she ran out of milk, she wanted to be able to go in her nightgown to get milk," Ms. Wojciechowski said.
Family dynamics can also take unexpected twists. "One couple wanted to downsize -- 'Get us a little apartment' -- so that there would be no way for any of the kids to come home,' " Ms. Wojciechowski recalled. "They said, 'No room at all, even if they want to stay overnight.' We got them a little co-op apartment in the Flushing area."
And then there is the woman who has long been waiting for her tide to come in. "She says, 'I have to be able to stare out on the water,' " Ms. Wojciechowski said. "She and I have been looking for maybe six years."
Marjorie Garber sees the home as analogous to "the other person in your life." 
In her book "Sex and Real Estate" (Anchor Books, 2000), Dr. Garber, the director of the Harvard University Humanities Center, wrote: "When you stop to think about it, buying and selling a house is a lot like dating. The same emotional overinvestment; the same daydreaming; the same quickening of the pulse; the lingering around the phone, willing it to ring. And, of course, all too often, the same broken heart."
The house, Dr. Garber said, "makes you feel loved, is something you can love unconditionally in return; it's the repository for unmet needs, nostalgic longings."
Asked to assess how much of the real estate market is a function of psychology, Yale's Professor Shiller guessed: "70 percent?"

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
When It Comes to Diversifying, the More the Merrier

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE extraordinary volatility of stocks in recent years is not an illusion created by people with short memories. The average stock really has been much more volatile than ever.
 In most cases, of course, it is dangerous to bet that any market development is unique -- that "this time is different." But a recent academic study is compelling enough to counteract that skepticism. The study helps to resolve a mysterious pattern within the performances of investment newsletters. 
 The study, published last year, found that the average stock today is about twice as volatile as it was in the 1960's. The authors were John Y. Campbell, an economics professor at Harvard; Burton G. Malkiel, an economics professor at Princeton; Yexiao Xu, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Dallas; and Martin Lettau, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Surprisingly, the researchers found that the greater volatility of individual stocks had not translated into greater volatility for the overall stock market. Individual stocks, it seems, have been canceling one another out. On a day when more stocks than ever are rising by extraordinary amounts, there will almost always be many others that are plummeting.
That has common-sense significance for investors: By expanding their portfolios to own more stocks, they can immunize themselves from the greater volatility of individual stocks. Research conducted in the 1960's found that a 15- to 20-stock portfolio is large enough to be adequately diversified. The more recent study suggests that a diversified portfolio needs to be at least twice as large today.
The researchers' discovery also places in a new light the finding that newsletters' recent performances are related to the size of their model portfolios. Within the five-year rankings, through the end of 2001, of 135 stock newsletter portfolios by The Hulbert Financial Digest, the best performances come from newsletters whose model portfolios typically own more than 40 stocks.
The performance differences are so large that they are unlikely to be a chance occurrence. The average newsletter whose model portfolio usually owns 11 to 20 stocks gained 4.3 percent, annualized, over the last five years. In contrast, the average newsletter whose model portfolio typically owns more than 40 stocks gained 10.4 percent, annualized, while being 12 percent less volatile.
Why should portfolios containing fewer stocks perform worse? I suspect that the equity markets are not so wasteful as to reward thrill seekers who take on unnecessary risk. While most investors would agree that a five-stock portfolio falls into the thrill-seeking category, the researchers' study shows us that even a 15- to 20-stock portfolio does, too. So owners of such portfolios should be aware that they are taking a risk that the markets are unlikely to reward.
During market declines, investors with portfolios containing too few stocks can expect outsized losses. This has been the case for many technology-oriented newsletters over the last two years, since their once-favorite stocks were among the biggest casualties of the bear market.
Unless you enjoy losing sleep, your stock portfolio should contain at least 40 stocks. You can invest in mutual funds instead, since the typical equity fund owns at least that many different issues. The benefits should be similar to those associated with stock newsletters whose model portfolios contain many individual issues.
Over the last five years, the 162 mutual fund newsletter model portfolios tracked by The Hulbert Financial Digest returned 2.4 percentage points more a year, on average, than stock newsletters whose model portfolios owned 11 to 20 stocks, with the fund portfolios nevertheless being less than half as volatile.

A month ago, Gov. James E. McGreevey tried to shake off doubts about whether he could carry off his campaign promise not to raise taxes. What he meant, in a "clarification" that sounded artful but still in the realm of the possible, was that he would leave sales and income taxes alone.
 Surely there would be ways to skirt the commandment, which could be named after Jim Florio, that taxes shall not be raised. There are user fees, excise taxes and other revenue-raisers. Whatever you call them, they could be tapped, no? 
 But while he spoke, the January numbers were adding up, and in the end they make a point about the governor's options. The state collected $1.7 billion in January, of which $1.5 billion came from the "big three" -- sales, income and corporate taxes -- and the lottery.
The remaining taxes, including cigarette and gas taxes, casino revenue, inheritance taxes and a dozen others, contributed $200 million. That's barely enough to buy a few elementary schools.
At these rates, if the governor can fix the $6 billion hole in the next budget without touching the big three, he will look brilliant. To those putting together that budget, and trying to pull threads on the current one, it's obvious that nothing short of a booming recovery can bring in enough to balance the budget. But none of them want to talk about the other possibilities.
That cheerful blindness, which some say left the state in its current precarious situation, dates to the day in 1990 when Governor Florio signed the $2.8 billion tax increase that was meant to bail out the treasury in the last recession. As it turned out, in the received wisdom of Trenton, he was writing the end to his own political career, a scenario that would never be repeated here.
A few people outside the State House doubt, as they can afford to do, that New Jerseyans are utterly resistant to tax increases. 
"It's hung on for a long time in the minds and actions of politicians, but that doesn't mean the public is in the same place," said Jon Shure, the president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a research group with an undisguisedly liberal cast that focuses on economic issues.
Mr. Shure noted that even after promising the largest tax cut in the state's history, Christie Whitman defeated Mr. Florio by just one percentage point. Then, he said, in 1997, after delivering on her promise of the largest tax cut in history, she won re-election by one percentage point.
Mr. Shure would like a completely reworked tax system that would rely more on progressive taxes -- read, income tax. That would relieve the poorest 20 percent of New Jersey's residents; a study by the Citizens for Tax Justice in Washington shows that state and local taxes cost this group almost 16 percent of average family income, more than the same group pays in 47 other states and a much higher percentage than other New Jerseyans pay. 
Leaving aside progressivity and regressivity, or any other measure of fairness, it makes sense to hit higher-earning taxpayers because, even in a bad stock market, that's where the money is. In California, which has a deficit of more than $12 billion, some Democrats are proposing to restore the 11.3 percent income tax rate on the wealthiest 2 percent of taxpayers, who now pay 9.3 percent. (The top rate in New Jersey is 6.37 percent.)
But in any state, that is pretty dreamy. "Florio's ghost doesn't exist just in New Jersey," said Arturo Perez, a tax analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Mr. Perez believes that legislators are still suffering the effects of 1994, when voters all over the country turned the Congress and many legislatures over to candidates who, Whitmanlike, promised tax cuts. 
Most legislatures, it seems, are still in the earlier stages of denial, when they cut spending and then seek out reserves to tap -- a process that Mr. McGreevey spelled out Monday in his address to the Legislature. 
And no legislature or governor likes to discuss the trajectory of local property taxes, except in introducing a rebate like the TaxSaver program to relieve the pain that state government has succeeded in transferring.
But even local officials hesitate to suggest transferring it back. William Dressel, the director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said that "we've always argued that the property tax is the most regressive tax there is" and urged amending the state to allow other forms of local taxes. 
But an increase in the state income tax? "You can make an argument on the ability-to-pay issue," Mr. Dressel said, rather tentatively. "But it's a controversial issue. It's extremely controversial."

HEADLINE: In America, Where Business Is King 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In the last two decades or so of my 50-year career in marketing, sales and public relations, I have seen firsthand much of the executive excess described by Paul Krugman in "Business Versus Biznes" (column, Feb. 12) and in countless other articles about the current scandals. 
 Quite a few executives I encountered seemed to me to be modern-day pharaohs. 
Too many of us now worship at the altar of business success. Success leads some managers and entrepreneurs to believe that their talents and skills, their very persons, put them above everyone else. Sometimes it's as if they've become gods, accountable and beholden to no one, their sense of entitlement unbounded. Are they entirely to blame, given the veneration and often the subservience of the peers, professionals and underlings who surround them?
A senior manager of a major tobacco company once gloatingly said to me, "Greed resolves all ethical dilemmas." How true. And with ethics sidetracked, doesn't that clear the way for what after all is the highest possible good, joining the business deity? What could be bad about that? Can pharaohs be wrong? Who would tell them that they were? Would they listen? Not in my experience.

At Troubled Bargemusic, Discord Amid the Sonatas

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 BODY:
Bargemusic, the floating chamber music spot at Fulton Ferry Landing, has for two decades been an idyllic spot where you could listen to intimate sonatas resonate off the cherrywood interior while waves lapped against the outer walls of the docked boat.
 But the 25-year-old organization has recently undergone a shakeup over finances in which four of nine board members resigned and the four full-time staff members were fired. As remaining board members prepared to meet this week to discuss new candidates, Bargemusic's founder, Olga Bloom, said she stood by her decision to raise musicians' salaries, the move that started the fight. 
 According to current and former board members, tension started after Ms. Bloom proposed doubling the money musicians received for each performance from $500 to $1,000. The board approved the raise last spring, bringing Bargemusic's annual budget from $1.2 million to $1.6 million. But after Sept. 11, attendance flagged, and some board members said the nonprofit organization, which gets most of its money from donations, could no longer afford the raises. 
"There was a feeling that unless we effected certain economies, the future of the barge was in doubt," said John Young, who was on the board for 10 years before resigning in November. 
"Deficits were increasing at an alarming rate," he said. "I didn't feel I could continue, leaving the future in doubt." But Ms. Bloom said she would not continue "subjecting artists to bargain prices."
"It's taken me 25 years to get them a successful salary, and I would have a burial at sea before I'd do that," she said of proposals to retract the raise or hold fewer performances. Chamber groups from around the world have performed at Bargemusic, and two years ago, the number of weekly performances was increased to four from two. 
Mary McCormick, a current board member, said that without the pay raise, "We were losing the ability to attract the best musicians in the world." She said she was confident the organization could sustain the new rates, adding that on Wednesday, an anonymous benefactor donated $75,000.
Regarding the firing of staff members, Ms. McCormick said, "We had to make sure there was a fit between staff talent and Bargemusic's needs." 
Keith O'Brien, who was fired last month after almost 10 years as manager, said he wished Bargemusic well, but added that doubling the number of performances "made it very difficult for us to be as effective as we would have liked." TARA BAHRAMPOUR

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Sandor Cseh; 
Dreyfus International Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MEETING with a company's management can be more informative than the company intends, says the multilingual Sandor Cseh, who runs the $300 million Dreyfus International Value fund.
 "I can't surprise Hungarians because of my Hungarian name," he said recently from his office in Boston. But in Madrid several years ago, his hosts did not realize that he understood Spanish as they freely discussed what they should say to him. 
 "They weren't trying to cheat me," he said, "They were just trying to embellish the story. But it gave me the idea that there were other possibilities." 
The fund returned 1.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus a 2.4 percent loss for its peer group of foreign stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 12.2 percent in the last 12 months, versus a 21.8 percent loss for its group.
Mr. Cseh, 55, scouts for bargains anywhere outside the United States.
"We buy stocks that have good value characteristics relative to the country where they're located and that are temporarily depressed in price," he said.
The 130 or so stocks in the fund trade for an average of 14.3 times 2002 earnings, compared with a multiple of 21.3 for the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia, Far East index, Mr. Cseh said. The price-to-book multiple of the portfolio companies is 1.7, versus 2.1 for the index.
He applies computer models to screen about 3,000 companies outside the United States with market capitalizations of at least $600 million. The screening finds about 1,200 of the cheapest value stocks, based mostly on price-to-earnings multiples.
Mr. Cseh whittles down the list to 400 to 500 by screening for favorable earnings momentum -- specifically, companies that were able to exceed earnings expectations, on average, in the last 3, 6 and 12 months. Next, he works with seven analysts to research those companies in depth. 
To ensure diversification, Mr. Cseh allocates the fund's assets among countries, using calculations that take into account the country's gross domestic product and its weight in the benchmark index. 
He has less than 5 percent of assets in emerging markets. "We're very risk-averse," he said.
Right now, his biggest allocations are Japan, at 20 percent of assets, and Britain, at 19 percent.
He is finding few bargains in Britain. "Relative to its G.D.P., the U.K. market is valued quite richly," Mr. Cseh said. "Its stock market is worth about 25 percent more than Japan, yet its G.D.P. is significantly less than half of Japan's."
But he says he is finding value in Italy, where the fund now has more than 5 percent of its assets.
In Italy, Mr. Cseh likes Eni, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, an international oil company. Shares trade for about 12.5 times estimated 2002 earnings, versus a multiple of 20 for Exxon Mobil, he said, because the Italian government owns an Eni stake of roughly 30 percent. "A lot of oil companies that have significant government ownership eventually end up being sold to the public," he said, "and the stock trades at a higher multiple."
While the Italian government has recently shown few signs of wanting to sell the company, he said, management has full authority to run it. He said he has been buying shares since October 1996, paying an average price equivalent to $9.55. The stock closed on Friday at 15.49 euros, or $13.53.
He also likes Hunter Douglas, a Dutch company that sells blinds, shades and other window treatments worldwide. Based in the United States during World War II, and then in Montreal, the company moved its headquarters to Rotterdam two years after it went public in 1969.
The fund has been buying shares since January 1996, paying an average price equivalent to $24.50. On Friday, they closed at 33.41 euros, or $29.17.
"Share prices get depressed when people expect the economy to slow down," he said, "But a lot of what they sell is not related to new construction. It's related to remodeling," which is less sensitive to economic downturns.
Mr. Cseh bought shares of National Australia Bank for 26.80 Australian dollars, then worth $13.91, in October 2000. They now trade at 35.58 Australian dollars, or $18.41. The price has been low, he said, because the company's costs have been higher than those of other Australian banks. Recently, management announced a cost-cutting program. The company lost money expanding operations into the United States, he said, and is now refocusing on its home markets of Australia and New Zealand.

Looking for Nuggets In the Garbage Trade

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
THE stock prices of trash haulers have plunged recently, but many analysts say they are likely to rise when the economy recovers and businesses churn out more garbage.
 "Today there are lower valuations and lower expectations," said Jaimi Goodfriend, an analyst at First Analysis Securities in Chicago. "That means some names are more attractive." 
 The biggest companies in the sector -- Waste Management Inc. of Houston, Allied Waste Industries of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Republic Services Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- have recently issued warnings of revenue and earnings shortfalls. 
Residential garbage pickups have held steady during the recession, but commercial hauling from shopping malls, construction sites and industrial plants, the most profitable part of the business, has declined. The trend is expected to reverse itself as the economy expands.
A smaller company, Waste Connections Inc. of Folsom, Calif., is well regarded by analysts. Trip Rodgers, at UBS Warburg in New York, called it "the big fish in the small pond" because it dominates many nonurban Western markets. Long-term contracts account for 54 percent of its business. Mr. Rodgers has a 12-month price target of $35 on the stock, which now trades at $25.96. 
"It has locked in 75 percent of its contracts this year with a 4 to 5 percent price increase," Ms. Goodfriend said. "That's very high for this economy." 
She said Waste Connections looked good "on an Ebitda basis, with an expected '02 growth of 19 percent, while the other firms in the sector will get 1 to 7 percent growth." 
Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- measures cash flow. Analysts use it to assess operating strength in this mature industry.
Thomas Ford, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, said he expected earnings growth of 20 percent a year through 2004 from Waste Connections. "The valuation does not reflect that type of outlook, simply because of concerns over poor performance of the larger companies," Mr. Ford said.
Waste Management, the largest company in the sector, gets mixed reviews because of its troubled history. That includes two big class-action settlements involving accounting, management shake-ups and an acquisition so painful that Sarah Voss, a company spokeswoman, calls it a "failed merger." 
In 1998, Waste Management reduced its earnings from 1992 to 1997 by $2.9 billion because it had overstated the value of its landfills. Shareholders sued Waste Management and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, in a class action settled in December 1998 for $220 million. 
Earlier that year, USA Waste of Houston merged with Waste Management, then of Chicago. The combined company kept the Waste Management name but had serious difficulties integrating the two businesses, Ms. Voss said. In July 1999, it announced that it would miss earnings estimates by $250 million. 
Shareholders again sued Waste Management and Arthur Andersen, resulting in a settlement of $457 million by Waste Management, announced last fall, in which Andersen is to pay the company $20 million.
Maurice Myers, who took over as chief executive in November 1999, has turned the company around, Mr. Rodgers said, adding that profits would probably rise once the economy improved. Mr. Ford recommends Waste Management on the basis of "value that has the potential to be unlocked." The company says it will buy back $1 billion of its shares this year.
Others are wary. "This is not the first management team that said they would turn things around," said Amanda Tepper, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities. "There's a real question: Is this stock cheap enough?" 
Stewart Scharf, an analyst at Standard & Poor's in New York, credits Mr. Myers with going over the company's systems with a fine-tooth comb, yet says the stock has had its run. It rose to $31.25 early this year from $21 in August 2000, he said. It is now $24.55.
THE shares of Allied Waste, now at $11.45, get a 12-month target price of $15 to $17 from several analysts. "Its debt has scared investors away," Mr. Rodgers said. The company bought Browning-Ferris Industries in 1999 for $9.7 billion. It has reduced debt to $9.3 billion from $11.5 billion in the last two years.
When garbage volume rises, Ms. Tepper said, new cash flow will pay down debt and prompt earnings growth. Looking at Ebitda or earnings per share, she said, "they are at a discount to their competitors."
Republic Services has been a steady, slow-growth company with a consistent share price; it now trades at $17.50. Mr. Rodgers says he recommends it with a 12-month target price of $22 because 60 percent of the company's business is in the Sun Belt, and one-third of its revenue is from exclusive markets. 
Will Flower, a spokesman for Republic, cites its strong cash flow. "We said we'd make $145 million in free cash flow in 2001, and we made $147 million," he said. 
In fact, said Thomas Van Weelden, the chief executive of Allied, the entire industry is maintaining free cash flow, a sign of resiliency. "The reality is, garbage isn't going away," he said. "We're not hanging black crepe around here."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES; 
A 'Stealth Tax' Is Creeping Up on Growing Numbers of Americans

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Nancy Hukkanen Campbell won a sex discrimination case 12 years ago, the trial judge promised to make her whole with an award of lost pay and pension benefits. 
 Now, Congress has put her in a financial hole because it has allowed a little-known tax, intended to make sure that the rich cannot escape taxes entirely, to hit the middle class as well. 
 In lawsuits like Mrs. Hukkanen Campbell's, one result can be double taxes on awards. In December a federal appeals court denied her relief, saying it was up to Congress to fix the double-taxation problem. 
Mrs. Hukkanen Campbell was tripped up by what critics call a "stealth tax" because it gets little public attention and operates to reduce regular income tax breaks. 
The tax, properly named the alternative minimum tax, is likely, however, to become a well-known and unpopular tax in the next few years, because of the growing number of people affected by it. The growth has accelerated under the Bush tax cuts enacted last year, to a rate of 38 percent annually, according to the Treasury Department.
Most people who find they owe the A.M.T. for 2001 can do little now but pay it. However, if you learn you may be liable for it this year, some precautions can be taken in the fall. You might choose not to prepay state and local taxes for the next year, for example, as people often do to get a deduction under the regular system, because the A.M.T. disallows such deductions. You might also want to seek professional advice before exercising incentive stock options: if you are liable for the A.M.T., you might owe some taxes immediately, though you would not under the regular system.
One new resource is the TurboTax A.M.T. Evaluator at the site www.quicken.com /taxes/taxslashing/amteval. Users can enter information to analyze their situations for A.M.T. risk -- and how much might be owed -- and to find advice on what to do.
The alternative tax will affect 2.7 million taxpayers this year, double the number two years ago, the Treasury Department says. In 2010, it will affect 35 million taxpayers, including most families with three or more children and incomes of $100,000 or more. It snares more people as the gap narrows between regular tax rates, which are falling, and A.M.T. rates, which are not. 
Those affected will lose two-thirds, or $88 billion, of their Bush tax cuts in 2010, according to a new analysis by Jerry Tempalski of the Office of Tax Analysis at the Treasury Department. The alternative minimum tax, as Mrs. Hukkanen Campbell learned, traps people by reducing breaks allowed in the regular tax system and then taxing the remaining income at either 26 percent or 28 percent. Exemptions for the taxpayer and his dependents are taken away, as are some deductions for medical expenses and all deductions for state and local income and property taxes and miscellaneous deductions, like fees paid to lawyers in job discrimination lawsuits.
Mrs. Hukkanen Campbell settled her case in 1993 for $150,000, paid her lawyers nearly half and paid taxes on the $76,601 she received. But the Internal Revenue Service, in an audit, said that because of the alternative minimum tax she could not deduct the $73,399 she paid her lawyers and billed her for an additional $17,000 in taxes. Her lawyers must also report the $73,399 as gross income and pay taxes on it, so the money is taxed twice.
Judge Monroe G. McKay, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in December, upheld a Tax Court opinion that fees paid to lawyers cannot be deducted under the A.M.T. in noninjury cases. The opposite conclusion was reached by some other circuit courts, which cited state laws giving lawyers a lien on a settlement, meaning that their fees are not counted under the A.M.T. Judge McKay wrote, "Congress, not this court, must correct any shortcomings in the A.M.T.'s application."
Mrs. Hukkanen Campbell said that her lawyers would take the case to the United States Supreme Court and that she hoped Congress would change the law.
"It was a very long hard fight just to get this case to court, and the judge found for me," she said. "I settled for less than what the judge gave me, and now the government is leaving me with almost none of my lost wages and pension benefits. It's just not fair."
There is a move in Congress to repeal the alternative minimum tax, but only for corporations. Bill Allison, managing editor of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit government watchdog organization in Washington run by investigative reporters, said the individual A.M.T. was getting little attention from Congress because few taxpayers were complaining, while the corporate A.M.T. was opposed by a host of major corporations, which are major campaign contributors.
"Members of Congress spend a lot more time talking to corporate lobbyists than people from Main Street," Mr. Allison said, adding that "I don't know of any lobbyists for middle-class wage earners."
Representative Jim McCrery, a Louisiana Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, has issued many statements denouncing the corporate alternative minimum tax as "a punitive tax on businesses during a recession and a source of endless complexity." 
Mr. McCrery, a lawyer who has studied the individual A.M.T., said he had not spoken about the alternative minimum tax for individuals in recent years because there was no drive in Congress to repeal it, while repeal of the corporate A.M.T. is part of President Bush's stimulus package. He did not hold out much hope for refocusing the individual A.M.T. on high-income taxpayers.
"I suspect we will only tinker with it to try to reduce the number of people who are affected because it is so expensive now to repeal it," Mr. McCrery said. "If we start running huge surpluses again in a few years there is a possibility we could repeal the A.M.T., but with all the other problems we are going to have to address -- Medicare and Social Security being the primary ones -- I really don't expect the outright repeal of the A.M.T., which is unfortunate."
The cost of repealing the A.M.T. rises each year. In December, Mr. Tempalski, the Treasury economist who calculates its impact, raised his estimate of the 10-year cost of repeal by $100 billion, to $619 billion.
His latest analysis shows that in 2010 more than 90 percent of families with three or more children and income of $100,000 or more will pay more in taxes under the A.M.T. than under the regular income tax system. Taxpayers are supposed to calculate their taxes both ways and pay whichever is highest.
The largest organization of tax preparers, the National Association of Enrolled Agents, says the alternative minimum tax is the "biggest headache for practitioners and their clients." 
W. Val Oveson, the former national taxpayer advocate at the I.R.S., describes the A.M.T. as "absolutely, asininely stupid."
The commissioner of Internal Revenue, Charles O. Rossotti, told Congress that one need not be engaged in any tax-avoidance techniques to owe A.M.T. He cited the example of a family with five children whose only income in 2000 was a $70,000 salary and who took only the standard deduction and exemptions. He said they would pay a small amount of A.M.T.
Two tax law professors, Daniel Shaviro of New York University, and Deborah A. Geier of Cleveland State University, have both written treatises calling the A.M.T. unfair and proposing its repeal. 
"The A.M.T. is having consequences that Congress never intended," Professor Geier said.
Indeed, the tax, which was adopted in 1969 because of public outrage after the disclosure that 155 taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more paid no taxes, rarely applies to very high-income taxpayers any more. Seldom does anyone who makes more than $627,000 owe A.M.T. these days, according to calculations by Al Davis, an economist on the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
Owners of small businesses may be among those seeking repeal because of another recent court ruling on the A.M.T. 
In January, the United States Tax Court held that six members of the Charles Allen family of Seaford, Del., whose Allen Family Foods is one of the largest chicken growing and processing operations in Delaware, owed $255,000 in additional taxes for 1994 and 1995 because of the A.M.T.
The decision, by Judge David Laro, has drawn attention among lawyers who represent family-owned businesses because he held that the regular income tax and the A.M.T. were not parallel universes with separate rules, as the official description from Congress said in 1986.
Instead, he said, the two systems interact when it comes to certain tax breaks, like the tax credit that the Allen family took for providing jobs to people who had been chronically unemployed. The judge disallowed this tax credit.
As a result of Judge Laro's ruling, "the A.M.T. may also have unforeseen implications in other investment situations where business tax credits get involved, such as the low-income housing credit," Burgess J. W. Raby, an Arizona tax lawyer, and William L. Raby, an accountant, wrote in the journal Tax Notes.
They said business owners and their lawyers must now evaluate interactions between the regular and alternative tax systems, some of which may not occur until years after a deal is made. That would add both complexity and uncertainty to investment decisions.
Victoria L. Herring, an employment discrimination lawyer in Des Moines, said she had a client who was awarded $15,000 in punitive damages and $1 in actual damages in a job discrimination case. The I.R.S. billed him $67,791 for income taxes under the A.M.T., because a judge also awarded $170,000 in legal fees for Ms. Herring as a result of the extraordinary efforts the other side made to thwart her.
'My client won, but he is far worse off for having brought this case," Ms. Herring said.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Watchdog? LapDog? Why Have To Guess?

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
ONE of the upsides in the Enron collapse is that investors have been awakened from their perilous dream state, brought on by the beautiful stock market bubble of the late 1990's. Before Enron, investors believed every utterance from corporate executives, Wall Street analysts and prestigious accounting firms. Now all of these players are viewed, justifiably, with more of a gimlet eye. 
 Trust in accounting firms has taken perhaps the biggest hit. That Wall Street is populated with sharpies and that corporate executives act as spinmeisters was not exactly breaking news. That accounting firms would sign off on opaque financial statements, now that was breathtaking. 
 Until Enron imploded, most investors still held the view that an auditor's opinion was exactly that: an opinion of the company's financial position gleaned from the scrutiny of its books. Investors relied upon this understanding when buying and selling shares.
Now we know that the auditor's role is not quite that simple. A second element may often help shape an auditor's opinion: the considerable money the auditing firm earns by providing consulting services to the companies it audits.
How considerable is this money? Very, according to a new study by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. Researchers at the center analyzed proxy statements of 1,224 large United States companies to calculate the fees these companies paid to their auditors last year. 
The study found that the fees for nonauditing services, usually consulting, were two and a half times greater than the fees for audits. Nonauditing fees exceeded $4 billion last year, while audit fees totaled $1.58 billion.
The risk is obvious when an accounting firm earns more in consulting fees than audit fees from a client: the audit work, which generates lower fees, could be jeopardized by the desire to maintain the more lucrative consulting relationship. 
"Fees attributed to nonaudit services appear to be disproportionate, and they held up through the entire year," said Carol Bowie, director for governance research services at the center. "The greater the number, the greater the possibility that the auditor independence may be compromised."
Given that nearly 20 percent of the nonaudit fees earned by accounting firms were related to the design of financial systems, the potential for a compromised audit becomes even greater. 
AS companies grow, so does the proportion of nonaudit fees they pay to accounting firms. At the largest companies, with revenue of more than $20 billion, nonaudit fees accounted for 76 percent of total fees paid to auditing firms. At industrial companies with less than $1 billion in revenue, nonaudit fees came in at 61 percent. Service companies of the same size paid, on average, 66 percent of their total fees for nonaudit services.
Only 9 of the 1,224 companies analyzed paid nothing to their accountants in nonaudit fees.
Just because a company pays big fees to an accounting firm for consulting work does not mean that the same firm's work on company audits will necessarily be dubious. But nowadays even the perception of risk to the auditor's independence can be damaging to a company. If companies don't put an end to this conflicted situation, their shareholders should.

HEADLINE: Hot Dogs, Apple Pie and Toyota 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: GEORGETOWN, Ky. 

 BODY:
IN the cafeteria, there are sticky rice and hush puppies, soy sauce and ketchup, chopsticks and forks. 
 This is Toyota, bluegrass style. 
 People used to buy only American here. But the Toyota plant has been on a flat patch of land between Lexington and Cincinnati for 14 years now. After a recent expansion, it could cover 156 football fields, and almost all its 7,000 workers are Kentuckians. 
"If there's such a thing as a politically correct car in central Kentucky, it's a Toyota," said Mike Tewell, a local Toyota dealer. 
And John M. Stewart, 32, an assembly-line manager who started here at 19, said, "I think everybody sees Toyota as a local company now." Like many other workers, he did not grow up driving foreign cars. "When I first got hired," he said, "I didn't even know what a Camry was."
Toyota, with 13 plants and operations in eight states and 29,000 local workers, becomes more American by the day. Last year, for the first time, it sold more automobiles in the United States -- 1.7 million -- than in Japan, excluding its half-owned Daihatsu unit. Toyota's sales were fourth in the American market, setting off speculation that overtaking Chrysler, which is just 500,000 ahead, is only a matter of time. In 1994, the gap was more than a million.
A decade ago, Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, said it was time for Americans to pull back Japan's "Teflon kimono" and realize that American cars were just as good. But it is becoming harder to put the competition in nationalistic terms. Sixty-three percent of the Toyotas sold in North America are now built in North America. And in 1998, Chrysler was acquired by DaimlerBenz of Germany to form DaimlerChrysler.
Still, the rise of foreign automakers has been a huge blow to the United Automobile Workers because the union has never succeeded in organizing a plant owned solely by a foreign manufacturer. As the Big Three's market share has dwindled, so has U.A.W. membership -- to 700,000 from 1.5 million two decades ago. 
"The majority of the parts come from the homeland," said Stephen P. Yokich, the union's president. "Not only have we lost jobs, but the suppliers have lost jobs as well."
Toyota has countered by saying that almost three-quarters of the parts used in the vehicles that it assembles here are domestically made. 
Mr. Yokich said both European and Japanese automakers had built plants in areas where workers were used to low wages. "We're not denying they've brought jobs here," he said, "even though they're nonunion jobs and they bitterly oppose the union. The places they've built their plants are nonunion areas, down South."
Toyota poses two big threats to the Big Three. It is adding more pickups and S.U.V.'s, once the sole domain of Detroit. And Detroit has ceded much of the car market to companies like Toyota and Honda. If trucks are Detroit's profit center, cars are a crucial entry point; a car customer may never return.
Perhaps most galling to Detroit is the fact that Toyota earned $4.7 billion last year, according to a Morgan Stanley estimate. Chrysler lost an estimated $2 billion last year, and Ford Motor lost $5.4 billion. Even a resurgent General Motors made only $601 million, down 87 percent from 2000.
A big chunk of Toyota's earnings can be traced to the weak Japanese yen, which has made exchange rates highly favorable for cars and parts from Japan and for profits sent back home. Detroit has complained loudly about the advantage, but the Bush administration has not criticized Japan because its economy is deep in the doldrums.
Each of the Big Three has a particular worry. G.M. worries because Toyota leads the market in used cars that carry dealers' certifications, even though G.M. sells six times as many new vehicles. Automakers get a cut of these sales, and dealers love them because they are so profitable. Ford worries because the gap between the Camry and the Ford Taurus, America's best-selling car in the mid-1990's, is growing wider. Chrysler worries because its drive to profitability is being thwarted by every Toyota sale. 
Toyota says overtaking Chrysler is not on its radar. "Focusing on whether or not we're going to pass Chrysler is largely irrelevant, it really is," said James R. Olson, Toyota's top Washington lobbyist. He added that Mercedes-Benz sales should be lumped in with Chrysler's anyway, just as Lexus sales are combined with Toyota's. 
But Toyota has taken steps that show it cares more than it lets on.

Overcoming Obstacles
The introduction of the redesigned Camry, Toyota's flagship car, began 18 months ahead of time.
"It's a coordinated effort," said Donald V. Esmond, general manager of the Toyota brand in the United States. "I don't think there's another manufacturer that works as closely as we do with suppliers."
The process led to a month-long delay for the last new Camry, in 1996, when officials in Kentucky were having trouble getting it ready. Ten days before production was supposed to begin, the plant's general manager called Mr. Esmond to say he had good news and bad news. 
The bad news: the side-view mirrors were falling off. The good news: that had occurred on only 3,000 cars. All were caught before they were shipped and could be fixed in three weeks. Mr. Esmond wanted it done faster. The next day, 27 employees volunteered, and a day later, 250 more. The cars were on their way in three days. 
It wasn't so simple this time. Toyota began an advertising blitz on Sept. 5 but pulled the ads after Sept. 11. The Big Three, led by G.M., started huge campaigns that wrapped car sales in the flag, promoted interest-free financing and urged Americans, in G.M.'s words, to "keep America rolling."
Nothing tests globalization like a war, especially one in which the enemy favors Toyota pickups. (A Toyota spokesman, Wade Hoyt, said, "It shows that the Taliban are looking for the same qualities as any truck buyer: durability and reliability.")
In October, Toyota hired a polling company to conduct a telephone survey, asking 3,100 consumers how they would feel about Toyota if it passed Chrysler as the No. 3 American auto company.
Sixty-five percent had a favorable, or at least neutral, attitude, a margin that Toyota considers a victory. Of those who said they would have a problem with that, most were white men over 55 from the Midwest, never a core Toyota demographic group. 
"Chrysler is not Chrysler anymore; it's owned by Mercedes-Benz," one respondent said in the poll, according to the results, which were not made public. "So if Toyota is displacing them, I don't care. G.M. owns Saab, Ford owns Jaguar, and Toyotas are made in America."
Soon afterward, Toyota resumed its Camry campaign. Dealers had already been notifying previous Camry customers to tell them that the car was coming. By December, Toyota's overall sales were still growing faster than any of the Big Three's. 

A World of Sharp Elbows
"It's not that we're passing Chrysler," said James E. Press, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota's American sales arm. "Chrysler stopped."
In October 2000, a former Mercedes executive, Dieter Zetsche, was dispatched to take over Chrysler and stop its precipitous decline. Wall Street thinks highly of Mr. Zetsche, but that does not mean it believes that he, or anyone, can return Chrysler to the good old days. 
"Somebody else is more interested in crushing them than we are," said Yoshimi Inaba, president and chief executive of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. 
That somebody would be G.M., whose interest-free financing push did reignite sales, but at a cost to profits. Toyota and Honda maintained sales while offering less of a financing incentive because they could rely on customers' loyalty.
"It's unavoidable" that the Big Three attack one another, said John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. 
"These companies have huge fixed costs and a huge motivation to keep the factories running," he added. "In the long run, Toyota is the competitive threat. In the short run, you're more likely to steal sales from competitors in Detroit."
In a few ways, Toyota is not so different from a Detroit company, especially given its growing reliance on truck sales. Many of its American executives started at the Big Three. And even though Toyota's earnings growth is the envy of Detroit, Toyota draws as little interest from American investors as the Big Three automakers' stocks do, but for different reasons. Japanese investors have already given Toyota an expensive valuation, and its disclosure is less frequent and extensive than that of American companies. 
Analysts say Toyota's biggest hurdle is one that beset G.M. and Ford in the 1970's and 1980's. Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, summed it up as the "I don't want to drive my father's Oldsmobile" problem. 
"The same younger generation buying Korean cars today don't want to buy their fathers' Toyota Camry," he said, adding that Toyota was "a little concerned about Hyundai because they are doing nifty stuff and capturing some of that youth market."
Toyota appears close to starting a third, youth-oriented brand in addition to Toyota and Lexus. But one challenge, analysts say, will be the problem of shaking the Japanese automakers' conservatism when it comes to style. 
Some potential for attracting youthful buyers can be seen in the 2003 Toyota Matrix, a funky vehicle known as a crossover design because it combines elements of a car with a small S.U.V. Toyota is running advertising showing spies on a manhunt struggling to describe the car but unable to find the words. The Matrix swooshes by, undetected. 

Paying Attention to Details
The factory floor sounds like a video arcade invaded by ice cream trucks and riveters. Floating overhead is the piped-in sound of "Suzy Q."
"We do country, we do oldies, adult contemporary, rock," Rick Hesterberg, the plant's communications director, said as he piloted a golf cart, weaving around workers on three-wheeled bicycles and automatic carts. "We try to keep everybody happy."
In one cavernous corner, a huge yellow claw descends to scoop up coils of steel that weigh up to 17 tons. The coils are hauled over to machines that unroll them, chop them into pieces and stack them. Robotic arms pass the flattened sheets through enormous presses that crunch together in thundering industrial rhythms, while recognizable shapes -- a hood, a roof -- are impressed on the steel.
Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky produces the Camry and Avalon sedans and the Sienna minivan. The path from coil to car, by way of myriad assembly lines, presses and a paint shop, takes about 20 hours. Every 55 seconds or so, a car or minivan comes off the line. 
To an untrained eye, it is hard to tell what makes one auto factory different from the next. There are few Japanese employees, but some telltale Japanese devices, like scoreboards, called andons, that blink when a certain segment of the line stops. Such scoreboards are now found in some Big Three plants. 
Toyota's overriding philosophy, honed since it began life in the 1930's as a loom-making company, preaches putting the customer first. That does not sound radical -- Burger King does the same. The difference is that everybody's a customer at Toyota, starting with the next guy down the assembly line. Pass on a problem, let down a customer. 
Mr. Stewart explained how workers could treat one another as customers. He manages a part of the assembly line called Trim 1, where wires are hooked to a piece of the frame in the front of the car. 
"Before, you had to do the work hanging over the fender," he explained. But a group of line workers, recruited to consult with Toyota's designers, suggested that the front metal strip be added farther down the line so workers could easily step inside the front of the car.
Obviously, details are important, but Toyota does make mistakes. This month, Toyota started sending letters to 3.3 million customers, offering to repair engine sludge damage in some 1997 to 2001 models. Some customers criticized the company for not moving sooner to fix the problem, which Toyota says stems from improper maintenance.
And not all of Toyota's vehicles have been hits. The light sales for the Echo subcompact and T-100 pickup, the predecessor of the current Tundra, attest to that. 
Mr. Esmond said bluntly that Toyota officials in Japan had not given the American operation a vehicle that could compete with G.M. and Ford pickups. But the Tundra, rated the nation's best pickup by Consumer Reports, reversed that. Mr. Press added that the American operation had gained even more leverage with the home office now that the United States was Toyota's biggest market. 
So far, glitches have not dented the company's brand.
"People overlook that stuff if their overall experience is good," said Mr. Spinella, of CNW. "These things aren't junk -- they're just off the mark as far as Toyota is concerned."

At Home in America
One of the American converts to Toyota's approach is Gary Convis. He started at G.M. Then, as a Ford executive, he moved five times in 18 years -- to Southern California and Michigan, then to Ohio and Kansas City and back to Detroit. 
"I never owned a foreign car," he said.
Frustration with the approach of the Big Three convinced him that American workers could do better. He became the head of Toyota's first foray into the American work force, at a plant in Fremont, Calif., operated jointly with G.M. Now, as president of the Kentucky operation, he is one of Toyota's most prominent American executives. 
"We don't think we're foreign," he said. "We're an American company. We are as American as they are."

HEADLINE: Correspondence/Urban Glory; 
New York and Bombay, Two Great Cities, Keep Faith With What Matters

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: BOMBAY 

 BODY:
NEW YORK, the place I came from six weeks ago, recently rediscovered, at terrible cost, some of the reasons cities are great. They are, as New York has showed, humanity's great reservoirs of kindness, civility and resilience. Only cities can turn ruin and death into a kind of collective grandeur.
 Grandeur may not be the first thing you think of, watching as, with a look that says, "I will get a seat on this train even if I have to kill you," the working girls of Bombay sprint in their sweat-stained saris up the platform of the Churchgate railroad station and jump on board before the arriving train comes to a halt. 
 A seat on a rush-hour train, as it wends its way north from Churchgate, is as precious as sleep, and anyone who stands idly in the way will most certainly be bruised, bonked and subjected, in rapid-fire Hindi, to Bombay's worst insult: "When did she get here from the village?" 
Then again, by the time the working girls of the second-class ladies compartment ("For Ladies Only, all the 24 hours," it is marked outside) get on board, they have dodged Bombay's nearly homicidal rush-hour traffic, skipped over a bandaged or limbless beggar (some authentic, some fake, some children), haggled over the price of bananas and green beans or pumpkin or eggplant from the hawkers lining the corridor to the station and passed a small army of men urinating along the streets. 
Much is made of Bombay's glorious past. In Indian lore, this was the city of gold, a citadel of civility. In modern times, Bombay became India's equivalent of Manhattan -- the big town an ambitious boy from the provinces could go to make it among the soaring skyscrapers.
But these days, Bombay has come to represent another sort of urbanity. The buildings are falling down and the streets are clogged and the stench is enough to make the dogs howl. Indeed Bombay has become the subject of great debate. This month, Outlook, a national news magazine, declared in a cover story on Bombay: "The Death of a Great City." 
The story listed some of the city's innumerable ills: crumbling infrastructure, rising religious intolerance, the miserable state of its poor.
To all of which Midday, Bombay's afternoon tabloid, roared back: "Dead? Not Us!"
In fact, Bombay continues, somehow, to thrive. And part of its magic lies in being able to turn its appalling disorder into an idiosyncratic, improvisational, style of life. As the formal, planned city falls into disrepair, the scrappy, informal one finds a way to make do. A boy from the provinces may think twice about coming here (he may go to New York instead), but dreams are still here and people still come to realize them.
To many who live here, that Bombay is getting worse, while demonstrably true, is beside the point. The brawl of daily life is what you sign up for. "Bombay is a terrible place but a great city," Charles Correa, the city's most famous architect, said in a new and much talked about documentary about Bombay called "One City, Two Worlds." If he had to choose, he added, he would choose the great city.
A kind of communal grandeur can be experienced daily, in a small way, on the train rumbling slowly out of Churchgate station. Those with seats start chopping and peeling in preparation for dinner. Among the standees, pressed shoulder to hip in the sweltering heat, the luckiest find space near the open train doors, saris trailing in the wind. 
Bombay's trains ferry seven million commuters a day, several times their capacity, and fatal accidents are a regular occurrence. But by some daily miracle of civility and forbearance few ever seem to go mad from the heat, the hustle, the claustrophobic press of sweating midriffs.
Instead, the women open their tiffin canisters and share grapes. They inspect the baskets of hawkers selling sesame candy, potato chips, glass bangles, feather dusters, hair clips and packets of delicate stick-on bindis to adorn the forehead. One or two somehow sleep through it all. (One of the men's cars, equally crowded, is devoted to passengers who like to sing the bouncy Hindu hymns called bhajans all the way home.)
A sorority of the daily commute emerges this way -- "train friends" they are called. Chances are these women know only each others' first names, workplaces and stations of embarkation and disembarkation. But it is real friendship, nonetheless. A journalist friend tells me a story about a colleague who, out of the blue, was diagnosed with cancer and immediately checked into a hospital for treatment. Two weeks later, a stranger popped into the sick woman's office and asked after her. "She is my train friend," the visitor said. "We haven't seen her in two weeks. Is everything all right?"
Several days later, a gaggle of train friends showed up at her hospital bedside.
The journalist tells this story with an only-in-Bombay sort of wistfulness that puzzles the casual visitor. But this is how Bombayites are. They won't live anywhere else. As a New Yorker, commuting by subway and living in my closet-sized allotment of space, I think I understand.
According to the 2001 census, 11.9 million people live within the city limits and nearly 16 in the entire metropolitan region. By 2015, Bombay is projected to be the largest city in the world, with an almost unimaginable 28 million souls. It's the third world city of the future, a megalopolis of nightmarish statistics stained with red-black juice of the betel nut, the city's chewing gum.
Sleep in Bombay, even if you're staying at the ultra-posh Taj Hotel, is fleeting. There may be a convention of argumentative crows outside your window. Or a pack of stray dogs may be disputing ownership of a garbage heap. All through the day, knife-sharpeners and vegetable peddlers and ice-cream sellers and monkey tricksters parade down the streets, each with their own distinct sirens to announce their coming.
A friend from Brooklyn has just come back to Bombay. He wants me to see the oasis of temples tucked in the middle of the city. He wants me to smell the spice factory from the roaring train. He is waiting for the monsoon to come. To watch it pour, he will go to Marine Drive, that curving, glittering thoroughfare along the Arabian Sea that people here call the Queen's Necklace.
T HE monsoons here will make you cry, the locals tell me; to see it, tourists from the Arab world pack the Taj Mahal hotel. They check into the coveted seaward rooms and watch the rain pouring down on the harbor. They take home parrots.
Marine Drive is also famous for a unique Bombay creature: the tetrapod. They are the octopus-like concrete structures placed along the seaside. They have many uses: to sprawl out on for an afternoon siesta, to sit and stare at the water, to squat on and defecate at dawn should you be among the millions of Bombayites who lack access to a toilet.
The tetrapods are designed to keep back the sea, and they make Kiran Nagarkar, a novelist and another Bombay native in love, giggle with pleasure. "There are times when I could just hug this city," Mr. Nagarkar tells me, eyes closed in a beatific smile. "The sea. The tetrapods..." his voice trails off. 
My Brooklynite friend sends me something from the Bombay poet, Nissim Ezekiel. I suspect he wants me to understand why he's not coming back to Brooklyn. The poem is called "Island."
Unsuitable for song as well as sense
the island flowers into slums
and skyscrapers, reflecting
precisely the growth of my mind.
I am here to find my way in it.
Just like New York.

HEADLINE: Where No Air Is Too Rare 

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
BUDGETING for spring-break travel or that mid-winter holiday? Here's one option. A family of four from Southern California can enjoy a seven-night stay at the spiffy Portofino Bay Resort Hotel in the Universal Studios theme park near Orlando, Fla. The price: $3,072.37, including air fare and a mid-sized car. 
 That's a discount package, but it's still a hefty piece of change in a sour economy. But as you read this, a family of four, names withheld by the proprietors, is wrapping up a weeklong vacation at a very private resort called Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. The price: $15,000 a day, not including air fare, car or minibar. 
 Yes, everyone knows the rich are different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald reminded Ernest Hemingway a long time ago. But that was a simpler era, before the rich became so rich that they got their own niche to rope them off from what are known in the poshest-end travel business as merely the "mass affluents."
"The rich are very rich," said Douglas D. Gollan, president and editor in chief of Elite Traveler, a glossy bimonthly magazine designed to get Mr. or Mrs. Moneybags salivating over that private island (Turtle Island in Fiji goes for $20,000 a day "with a two-week minimum stay," the current issue says) or that custom trip through the South Seas in a yacht-sized private submarine.
Clearly this isn't the sort of magazine you order through Publishers Clearing House. Instead, it is given out on corporate jets (like the briskly selling airliner-sized Boeing Business Jet, which features a bedroom and conference room and costs over $45 million). It's also distributed on chartered yachts, through V.I.P. limousine services, at first-class airline lounges and in locker rooms of pro sports teams.
Locker rooms?
"Our approach is to reach the wealthiest people in environments where they have time to read," Mr. Gollan said, "and professional athletes spend inordinate amounts of time in locker rooms and training facilities.
The top-elite travel market, he explained, is occupied by people for whom "price is not an object." Besides multimillionaire N.B.A. players, that would include potentates, entrepreneurs, celebrities and other bigwigs, as well as their entourages, who can run up huge bills in spas and other amenities. "Not just people who will stay at the Ritz Carlton or the Four Seasons," Mr. Gollan said, "but people who will stay in the presidential suite and rent out maybe half a floor as well." 
Some travel industry skeptics regard such magazines as "travel porn," advertising vehicles designed to wow the mass affluents as well as sell to those in the market for $150 million yachts.
Many people really do cough up this kind of dough. "Our bookings have come right back" after a post-Sept. 11 fall-off, said Janine Cifelli, vice president of Resorts Management Inc., which books private islands around the world, including Necker Island, where the top rate is $31,000 a day.
Not that it's all fun and games. U.S. Submarine Inc., a maker of luxury subs for personal use and tourism, sells one model for $20 million. On its Web site, the company helpfully notes that "in the event of a biological, chemical or nuclear warfare-related attack on the U.S., arguably the best alternative you could have would be your own personal luxury submarine."

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT; 
In Miami, a Welcome Diversion

BYLINE:  By HERB McCORMICK; Herb McCormick is the editor of Cruising World magazine.

DATELINE: MIAMI, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The zebra, in full yelp, did not seem happy. Then again, the bustling scene last Thursday morning on the ground floor of the Miami Convention Center -- just one of three sites making up the 61st Miami Beach International Boat Show -- was nobody's idea of the wide-open spaces. 
 Actually, the animal trainer Shane Ayon said, the zebra was fine, just lonely. As a marketing prop to underscore a "black-and-white" advertising theme in the merger of two diesel-engine manufacturers, Cummins Marine and Mercury Marine, the zebra was certainly out of its element. But given the boats, gear, accessories and, for that matter, people, the striped horse was hardly the only head turner in sight. 
 The Miami Boat Show, produced by the National Marine Manufacturer's Association, is a sort of maritime Disney World: A few hundred miles south of the real thing in Orlando, the show carries its own brand of spectacle and entertainment, all centered around a nautical theme. 
And in a season when the greater Miami economy has suffered because of a noticeable decline in tourism, the show is a welcome diversion for locals and visitors alike.
As noted, the Miami show, which runs through Tuesday -- for information visit the Internet Web site, www.discoverboating.com -- is really three events in one. The vast indoor-outdoor displays of boats, as well as the aisles and aisles of exhibitor booths, makes the Convention Center site the show's largest. From kayaks to Jet Skis to fishing boats to family cruisers, there is something here for nearly every budget.
In addition, there are two dedicated in-the-water sites. The first, at the Sealine Marina and Convention Center, is chock-full of powerboats of every make and description. At the nearby Miamarina at Bayside, the Strictly Sail-Miami Show is just that, a sailboat-only event.
As if that were not enough, down Collins Avenue along the Indian Creek Waterway, the concurrent but separate Yacht & Brokerage Show is under way with an incredible fleet of new and used boats on display. With many of the hundreds of boats there carrying price tags in the millions of dollars, it is a mind-boggling testimony to the joys of conspicuous consumption. 
A passerby on Thursday caught a snippet of conversation from a stogie-wielding attendee on a cellphone, who captured some of the prevailing sentiment. "Somebody's got to work today," he said. "But I don't."

Voyages, Interrupted
On Thursday, the 110-foot maxi-catamaran Orange, skippered by the French offshore star Bruno Peyron, set off from the seaside town of Brest to begin an attempt for the Trophee Jules Verne signifying the fastest nonstop voyage around the world.
It did not get far. Just 35 minutes into what was meant to be a two-month trip, Peyron was returning to France after a two-foot section at the top of the big boat's wing mast suddenly failed, putting a quick and ignominious end to the proceedings. Peyron hopes to quickly effect repairs and set out once again.
Meanwhile, several thousand miles to the south, the Volvo Ocean Race entry News Corporation -- with 1,200 nautical miles to the finish of the event's brutal fourth leg from Auckland, New Zealand, to Rio de Janeiro -- was also left limping after unexpectedly losing its rudder.
"At the time, the boat was sailing at speeds up to 22 knots on a shy spinnaker reach with a full mainsail when all of a sudden the rudder sheared off below the hull," wrote the skipper, Ross Field, in an e-mail message. "There was no other damage, other than a blown spinnaker. There were no injuries."
Field and his team were continuing under jury rig. A fast boat to Rio was suddenly a slow one.

A Fine Cup Mess
Before all is said and done, the Seattle telecommunications entrepreneur Craig McCaw may wonder why he ever decided to challenge for the America's Cup. In fact, he may already be doing so. McCaw's OneWorld team has already faced financial difficulties. Now it is involved in a potentially far greater controversy.
An exhibition regatta featuring a handful of syndicates -- including McCaw's -- that will begin actual competition for the Cup later this year was staged in Auckland, last week. But the action on the water paled in comparison to the storms brewing onshore.
In a nutshell, according to reports last week in The New Zealand Herald and elsewhere, a former OneWorld employee, Sean Reeves, has accused members of McCaw's team of illegally obtaining design secrets from the current Cup defender, Team New Zealand. Such an offense would be a breach of Cup protocol and punishable by anything from fines to outright expulsion from the event.
OneWorld, on the other hand, denies the charges and has an ongoing civil suit pending against Reeves.
Reeves's allegations will reportedly be addressed by the America's Cup arbitration panel, which is expected to issue a ruling in three to four weeks. And a new chapter in the Cup's murkier history unfolds.

HEADLINE: Enrollment Is Up Sharply At CUNY, To 197,089 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
A weaker economy, higher enrollment standards and even the attack on the World Trade Center have helped drive total enrollment at the City University of New York up 3.5 percent this semester over the same semester last year, officials said. The increase is partly a result of a 23 percent jump in the number of freshmen at the university's senior colleges.
 Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor, said last week that the enrollment gains should help quiet fears that the removal of remedial courses at the senior colleges would result in big declines in the number of students attending those colleges. 
 "It is a real affirmation of our remedial policy," Dr. Goldstein said. "We're having our biggest enrollment increases at our senior colleges in a very long time."
The total number of students at the university this semester has reached 197,089, up from 190,335 last year.
Enrollment at the senior colleges is up an average of 4 percent, while enrollment at the community colleges has risen 2.6 percent.
Total enrollment increased at all of CUNY's campuses except for Baruch College, where it slipped very slightly -- by 252 students -- to 15,445. The increases at the senior college campuses ranged from 1.7 percent at New York City Technical to 7 percent at Hunter College and 9 percent at John Jay.
Among the community colleges, enrollments rose most at Bronx Community College (up 4 percent) and Borough of Manhattan Community College (up 6 percent). Because one of the Manhattan college's buildings -- Fiterman Hall -- was next to the World Trade Center and was badly damaged in the Sept. 11 attack, some of its students are now attending classes on the City College campus.
The post-September interest in law and public safety careers focused new attention on the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which enrolled 674 new transfer students this semester -- 44 percent more than last year -- pushing its total enrollment to 11,366 students from 10,423 a year ago.
Lehman College in the Bronx, York College in Queens and Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn -- all senior campuses that dropped remedial courses this school year -- also saw sizable gains in freshmen enrollment. The number of freshmen enrolling this semester at Lehman doubled to 188 students, compared with 2000 figures. At Medgar Evers, the number more than doubled, to 499. And at York, the number of new freshmen rose 50 percent, to 270.

HEADLINE: Blacks at Home Support a Judge Liberals Assail 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: LAUREL, Miss., Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Back in Washington, his opponents have depicted Judge Charles W. Pickering as the personification of white Mississippi's oppressive past, a man so hostile to civil rights and black progress that he is unfit for promotion to a federal appeals court.
 But here on the streets of his small and largely black hometown, far from the bitterness of partisan agendas and position papers, Charles Pickering is a widely admired figure of a very different present. 
 In funeral parlors and pharmacies, used-car lots and the City Council chambers, the city's black establishment overwhelmingly supports his nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which is heading toward a contentious vote in the Senate in the first major judicial battle of the Bush administration.
Though few black residents here subscribe to Judge Pickering's staunchly Republican politics, many say they admire his efforts at racial reconciliation, which they describe as highly unusual for a white Republican in the state.
"I have never seen Trent Lott open his arms to the black community the way Charles Pickering has," said Larry E. Thomas, owner of Thomas Pharmacy, referring to the Senate minority leader, who is Judge Pickering's friend and patron. "Over the years I've seen him work with black leaders and really try to make an effort to understand and help the community. That's a progressiveness that we need to see more of in this state." 
Progressive is not exactly the description used by the national black officials who are making an intense effort to prevent the judge's appointment. "A vote for Pickering is a vote against civil rights," said Julian Bond, the national chairman of the N.A.A.C.P. Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, speaking against the nomination with other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, "It's hard to imagine a person who is more hostile to civil rights." Judge Pickering has also been condemned by a variety of big-city newspaper editorial boards and columnists.
But such comments carry little weight among those who actually know the man personally here in Laurel, in southeast Mississippi. Judge Pickering, now a federal district judge in the nearby city of Hattiesburg, was praised by black city officials for helping to set up after-school youth programs here, and for directing federal money to medical clinics in low-income areas when he was a state senator. Black business leaders say he was influential in persuading white-owned banks to lend money to black entrepreneurs, helping to strengthen the city's black middle class.
"I can't believe the man they're describing in Washington is the same one I've known for years," said Thaddeus Edmonson, a former local president of the N.A.A.C.P. who is now president of the seven-member Laurel City Council and one of its five black members. "If those people who are voting against him because of some press release would just come down here and talk to the people who know him, I think they would have a very different opinion."
The judge's widespread popularity in his hometown has been frustrating to the many civil rights and abortion rights groups that have worked to portray him as an ideological relic of the Old South.
Several opponents of his nomination have tried unsuccessfully to get his supporters to change their minds, and their inability to do so reflects the distance between national liberal groups and many Southern blacks in small towns. In a city like Laurel, with a population of 18,393, one's personality and faith are often more important than a judicial paper trail or an adherence to an agenda.
People for the American Way, a liberal organization based in Washington, has criticized Judge Pickering for disregarding the separation of church and state by promoting religious programs from the bench. But many prominent blacks here say it is precisely his religious background -- he was president of the Mississippi Baptist Convention in the 1980's -- that they admire.
"I know Judge Pickering is a fair and impartial person grounded with Christian ethics and beliefs, who ought to be given this chance," said the Rev. Arthur Logan, the black pastor of the Union Baptist Church and a member of the City Council. "There are many people in Mississippi who made these same mistakes early in life, but their strong Christian character brought them closer to God and helped them change."
Four of the five black council members, in fact, said they enthusiastically supported Judge Pickering's appointment. The fifth, Manuel Jones, said he opposed the nomination, largely because he differed with Judge Pickering's efforts in the late 1980's to integrate the largely black city schools with the largely white county schools.
Judge Pickering, then in private practice in Laurel, was one of several white city leaders who argued that the city could not attract economic development with an effectively segregated school system. At the time, Mr. Jones was president of the Laurel-Jones County branch of the N.A.A.C.P., which maintained that consolidation would dilute black administrative power over the city schools. The consolidation plan was eventually overturned by a federal judge, who said it was not justified.
Mr. Jones said he rebuffed a recent telephone request by Judge Pickering that he write the Senate a letter of support. (He had publicly opposed the judge's original appointment to the federal bench in 1990.) Several other council members did agree to the judge's request, however, and their letters are on file with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"It's hard to go against a sitting federal judge," said Mr. Jones, searching for an explanation of why his colleagues have taken a position that differs so sharply from his.
Many of the judge's critics have cited actions or statements he made in the 1960's and 70's. They have pointed to an article he wrote in 1959 that appeared to support strengthening the state's law against interracial marriages, and to his votes in the state senate that appeared to dilute black voting strength.
But his many black supporters here -- all lifelong Democrats -- say they are more interested in his journey than his starting point. They say Judge Pickering, like many white Mississippians, has moved beyond his all-too-common origins.
"He grew up like a lot of white people here," said the Rev. George L. Barnes, a black minister who is pastor at two Missionary Baptist churches and owns a used-car lot. "But his daddy and my daddy used to swim together down in the creek, and I've never heard him say a racist thing. I would say, of people in his age bracket, he's probably come further than any white man I know of."
Local leaders' support for Judge Pickering has put them at odds with several black state officials and the Mississippi conference of the N.A.A.C.P., which oppose his appointment. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents the Delta region on the opposite side of the state in Congress, has called the judge's black supporters "Judases." State N.A.A.C.P. officials say the judge's supporters in Laurel have succumbed to an effort to cover up his feelings with small acts of kindness. This alternately angers and amuses local residents, who say no such masquerade can last for decades.
"If he's been putting on a show for us, it's the greatest show on earth," said Mr. Thomas, who runs the city's only black-owned pharmacy and who served with Mr. Pickering on the local economic development board in the 1980's.
Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, which is leading the opposition to the appointment, said many of the judge's supporters in Laurel simply did not know the full details of his record.
"We don't dispute that he has support from a number of African-Americans at the local level, and we have never said he is a racist," Mr. Neas said. "He may be a decent person on a one-to-one basis, but that's not the issue. It's his actions as a public official that demonstrate insensitivity and hostility toward basic civil rights principles."
People for the American Way said that as a state senator in the 1970's, Mr. Pickering voted for measures to reduce black voting strength and approved giving state money to the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, which became notorious for opposing the civil rights movement. On the federal bench, the group said, he has strongly criticized the creation of largely black political districts as a remedy for past discrimination.
Many local residents said they were not familiar with such statements. But they do remember that in 1967, Judge Pickering testified against Sam Bowers, a Ku Klux Klan leader based in Laurel who was on trial for the firebombing death of a black civil rights worker. Several said that just as the judge broke with prevailing white opinion in the state to do so, they have no trouble differing with black opinion.
"What blacks have fought for is freedom, and that means the freedom of expression to differ among ourselves," said Johnny Magee, a black councilman who supports the judge. "So many people are still angry about the past. But if the judge has moved beyond his past, I think we should all try to do the same."

HEADLINE: From Modest Business Loans, the Fulfillment of Modest Dreams 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
So New York City's economy is battered from a recession and a terrorist attack, and people are thinking twice and even three times about spending on nonessentials. Is this really the time to start or expand a business? 
 Sure, says Yougnesse Williams, a 28-year-old Brooklyn woman. 
 Ms. Williams, a social worker from East New York, has developed a business over the last year as a masseuse and hairstylist, visiting clients in their homes on evenings and weekends. From three customers and $180 in revenue last March, her house-call business grew to 16 customers and close to $1,700 last month. 
Now, with a $13,000 loan from a nonprofit group, the Women's Venture Fund, and $2,500 in savings, she is making a financial commitment to enlarging her business by having a massage and hairstyling salon built in the basement of her home. 
"Maybe in a year or two," Ms. Williams said, "I can leave my day job and devote my energies to this." 
Ms. Williams's enterprising spirit reflects a sometimes overlooked aspect of the city's economic life: the smallest of the small businesses that are being started or expanded by optimistic entrepreneurs despite the recession and the economic damage from the Sept. 11 attack.
This is especially the case, the experts say, with ventures requiring less than $100,000 in financing, in which personal savings may be used, along with modest loans from banks or government agencies like the Small Business Administration. 
"With mom-and-pop small-business formations, I think there's a pretty constant flow of activity because they're typically financed through relatively small amounts of funding from bank or S.B.A. sources that are pretty steady," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce. This is not incidental in a city in which businesses with 20 or fewer employees provide jobs for 700,000 people, or about a quarter of the labor force, according to state statistics.
While Lower Manhattan was economically crippled by the World Trade Center's destruction, Aubrey Rogers, district director of the Small Business Administration, said that elsewhere in the city, "we have not been seeing a diminution of small businesses seeking to get started or expand." He cited a corollary of down economic times: "When things are going bad in the economy, we find that people want to start their own businesses. 
"Sometimes people are forced into it because they have been laid off and there are no jobs." 
But other dismissed workers, he added, have long wanted to go into business for themselves and see their layoffs as an opportunity to pursue the dream.
Still, the ranks of fledgling small-business owners have thinned over the last year, and "dramatically since 9/11," Ms. Wylde said, based on the number of applications for the loans and equity investments that her group makes available to start-up businesses. 
The loans and investments come from a $100 million fund provided by sources including major corporations and financial institutions. Ms. Wylde said that last year the group received 343 applications, down from 410 in 2000. It got only 36 in the fourth quarter of last year, compared with 116 in the fourth quarter of 2000.
Moreover, those seeking aid to start or expand small businesses in recent months have faced harder scrutiny of their income projections from groups like the Women's Venture Fund, which approved Ms. Williams's loan application in December. She had submitted it before Sept. 11.
"We found that her relationships with her clients were solid, and that Sept. 11 would not have a long-term impact on her business," said Maria Semidei-Otero, president of the Manhattan-based fund, which is dedicated to helping women get businesses that show promise off the ground by providing loans the women cannot get from banks. 
The loans, of up to $15,000, come from a pool of money that the eight-year-old group receives from corporations, foundations, banks, individuals and the Small Business Administration. Most women it has helped are members of minority groups who are "unable to get financing from a traditional lender," Ms. Semidei-Otero said.
Ms. Williams, whose masseuse house calls began when a son's illness created financial pressures for her and her husband, Ellis Ferdinand, a house painter, said she had given "a little thought" after Sept. 11 to withdrawing her application and scrapping her plans for expanding as a home-based business.
"I was concerned that with all that was going on, people would consider it vanity to get an hour of relaxation," she said. "But then I saw it was therapeutic -- people used it as a distraction or as an outlet." 
Ms. Semidei-Otero cited an application that did not survive her group's post-Sept. 11 reassessment of requests it had pending on that day. It was for a $10,000 loan from the owner of a year-old South Bronx Laundromat who wanted to expand into the 25 percent of her space that she was not using. 
Updated information that the fund requested showed a decline in business, Ms. Semidei-Otero said. "We couldn't see how quickly it would take her to overcome it," she explained. 
Elsewhere in the Bronx, Jabbie Bahoreh did get a $10,000 loan he sought in December from another nonprofit group, Accion New York, which also provides financing for small-business start-ups and expansions. He used the loan, and $11,000 of his own money, to convert a meat market on East 170th Street near the Grand Concourse into an African-American restaurant that, he said last week, he planned to open soon. 
"I think I will make out well," he said. "There are a lot of Africans living in the neighborhood." Mr. Bahoreh, who emigrated from Gambia and is employed as a building painter, said he would operate the restaurant with his wife, working there when he was not at his painting job. 
"I want the restaurant because I want to make more money," said Mr. Bahoreh, who is 50 and has three young children. 
In Harlem, Ndiogou Dione, who comes from Senegal, is also trying to make it with a new African-American restaurant, which he opened at Frederick Douglass Boulevard at 129th Street in October with more than $60,000 from his savings and a $10,000 loan from Accion New York.
When Mr. Dione was embarking on his venture early last year, he was well aware that business conditions were declining, he said. But having worked as a manager of similar restaurants owned by others, he no longer wanted to put off owning his own -- "something I dreamed of a long time ago," he said.
"Only God knows when it's a good time," said Mr. Dione, 47. "Whatever happens, happens." 
What has happened so far is that "business is not too good," he said. But he expressed determination to stick with it. "I don't want to owe anybody money."

HEADLINE: India Says Man in Attack On U.S. Site Has Terror Tie 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The main suspect in an attack last month outside an American diplomatic office in Calcutta has denied that he was the mastermind behind it and has contended that he falsely claimed responsibility in phone calls at the time to puff up his reputation as a gangster, officials here said today.
 But the suspect, Aftab Ansari, who won his reputation as a kidnapper, has told officials from the Central Bureau of Investigation that in 2000 and 2001 he gave substantial sums of money to Ahmed Omar Sheikh, a Muslim militant who is a suspect in the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, bureau officials said. 
 During a week of interrogations, those officials say, Mr. Ansari said he and Mr. Sheikh, a London School of Economics dropout who had joined Islamic militants in Pakistan, met in the late 1990's when they were both imprisoned in the Tihar jail here in New Delhi. 
Indian officials cite Mr. Sheikh and Mr. Ansari as likely examples of the interconnections they say exist between criminal gangs, radical Islamic groups and Pakistan's military intelligence agency. Pakistani officials privately concede that the Pakistani agency has, for years, financed and managed Islamic militant groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir, but say those ties have been severed recently.
India has made a big issue of such alleged ties. After a Dec. 13 attack on Parliament here, which India said was the work of Pakistan-based militant groups, India demanded that Pakistan hand over 20 people wanted as criminals or terrorists who it said had found refuge in Pakistan. Pakistani officials have denied that the suspects -- 14 of whom are Indian citizens -- are in Pakistan.
The authorities in Dubai deported Mr. Ansari to India on Feb. 9 after apprehending him at the airport there before he could board a flight to Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan. He was traveling on a Pakistani passport, Indian officials said.
A Central Bureau of Investigation official said Mr. Ansari and Mr. Sheikh got to know each other during the late 1990's, when they were both in Tihar, meeting on Muslim festival days and other occasions when prisoners from different parts of the jail were allowed to mingle.
Mr. Ansari was released on bail in October 1999 and fled the country. Intelligence officials said he went to the Rawalpindi, the home of a Pakistani criminal he had met in Tihar, and married the man's daughter.
Hijackers of an Indian Airlines commercial flight won Mr. Sheikh's release on Dec. 31, 1999, in a prisoner-for-passengers exchange.
Mr. Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani descent, was being held on charges that he kidnapped three Britons and one American in 1994 in an effort to engineer the release of Islamic militants held in Indian jails.
After Indian authorities released Mr. Sheikh to end the hijacking crisis, he made his way from Kandahar, where the Indian flight was taken by hijackers, to Rawalpindi, where he again met up with Mr. Ansari, officials here say.
In Lahore, Pakistan, Mr. Sheikh used his connections to help Mr. Ansari, an Indian citizen, obtain a Pakistani citizenship card and a Pakistani passport, officials said.
Indian officials say that they suspect Mr. Sheikh, associated with Harkat-ul Ansar and Harkat-ul Mujahedeen -- groups on the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations -- used his connections with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency to get Mr. Ansari settled in Pakistan.
Indian officials say they suspect that Mr. Sheikh may have transferred some of Mr. Ansari's ransom money to Mohamed Atta, believed to have been the ringleader of the hijackers who flew into the World Trade Center, but Mr. Ansari has confessed to no such thing under interrogation.
The bureau will have Mr. Ansari for another seven days of interrogation, but police officials from Calcutta, Gujarat and Delhi -- where he is a suspect in other crimes -- are in line to question him.
In addition to his own claim of responsibility at the time of the Calcutta attack, Indian officials say they also have other evidence that implicates Mr. Ansari in that attack, which killed five policemen. "I believe by the end of interrogation, he will admit the whole story," an official said.
Investigators suspect that his motive was just what he said it was when he phoned newspapers on Jan. 22, the day of the attack. He said he sought to avenge the killing of an associate in police custody. He struck outside the American center to get more publicity, not specifically to target the United States, they said.
"He was having his own agenda," said an official of the bureau of investigations. "He wanted to make a name as a big man in crime. He also wanted to create terror in the Indian police."

HEADLINE: After a Mess or Two, a Star Chef Starts Over 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
The 18th-century French walnut door is back, hanging at the entrance of his latest restaurant in TriBeCa. In the foyer, the welcoming smell of apples has returned as well. And behind the stove, David Bouley himself is back, promising to cook every night just the way he did at his first restaurant, which many diners viewed as the best in New York City.
 Six years ago, Mr. Bouley was a man of grand dreams and dazzling ambitions, arguably the city's most brilliant chef, a man whose cooking talent was as wide as his ego. He closed his four-star restaurant, Bouley, at the top of its game, spinning out a vision of a gastronomic empire that would stretch from TriBeCa to Midtown. 
 But today, New York's star chef and restaurateur is alone at the stove again. After a succession of unsuccessful partnerships, a run of feuds with colleagues and collaborators, and the upheaval caused by the World Trade Center attack, Mr. Bouley has abandoned -- or deferred, as he prefers to describe it -- nearly all of his plans: the restaurants, the cooking school, the huge food store. Even the Mohawk Building, a seven-story complex on Hudson Street that was to be Mr. Bouley's monument to cooking, is up for sale. 
Mr. Bouley's vision of a culinary empire has come down to this: the low-slung building on West Broadway where his four-star Bouley Bakery has operated since 1997, and Danube, his three-star Austrian restaurant around the corner. Bouley Bakery, which Mr. Bouley had opened as a relatively modest restaurant and bakery to hold him over until his bigger dreams were realized, will henceforth be known as Bouley, and will be his signature restaurant, as the walnut door that came from the original Bouley around the corner and the apples are intended to make clear.
"I decided I didn't want to wear that real estate hat anymore," said Mr. Bouley, speaking at once softly and urgently, amid the construction clutter of his new -- or is it old? -- restaurant near Duane Street. "I want to be a chef again. So I decided to put the door back on, and put the apples back."
"This is going to be my flagship," he proclaimed. "I'm back with my jacket. I'm cooking every day. I've got to get back to where I left off."
That Mr. Bouley has settled back to where he was six years ago is, to a certain extent, part of the story of what has happened to downtown New York since Sept. 11. The front windows of Bouley Bakery splintered from the force of the trade center collapse seven blocks south, and police barricades shut down both of Mr. Bouley's restaurants for months. In a neighborhood where the future of even the corner delicatessen seemed in doubt, Mr. Bouley's hopes vanished in the space of a morning.
Yet in many ways, the terrorist attack only hastened what even some of his former colleagues believe was the inevitable collapse of an enterprise that always seemed far too ambitious, proposed by a man whose business skills were not up to his culinary ones. From that perspective, Mr. Bouley is as much a victim of his own ambition and, in the view of a few former colleagues, arrogance, as of anything that might have befallen downtown New York.
If Mr. Bouley is universally praised as one of the best chefs cooking today, he remains one of the most polarizing figures in his field. Even in this world, where a four-star review stirs envy and resentment, the kitchen knives come out for Mr. Bouley. For many of his colleagues, the news that the Mohawk Building is up for sale is Mr. Bouley's comeuppance.
Whatever his successes, Mr. Bouley has left in the trail of his career a line of creditors, furious former employees and estranged friends. Many of the familiar faces at the old Bouley Bakery, among them his maitre d'hotel and his executive chef, have abandoned him. The exodus was hastened as details of Mr. Bouley's contract with the Red Cross to provide meals to rescue workers at the trade center were reported in The New York Observer.
Mr. Bouley was paid $5.8 million to produce 1,547,496 meals over 50 days, according to the Red Cross. He relied to some extent on donated food and volunteer workers, including some of his own employees, who were working without pay.
Mr. Bouley said the donated food and labor were crucial to ensure that he could provide Bouley-quality meals to the workers sifting through the destruction. Red Cross officials said they had approved the arrangement from the start, and factored in the savings in computing the fee per meal, which averaged $3.75. At the time, both of Mr. Bouley's restaurants were being used solely for the relief effort; he said he was not sure then that he would ever be able to reopen them.
Still, fairly or not, Mr. Bouley found himself accused of profiteering by employees whose own Bouley paychecks stopped after Sept. 11. The report in The Observer singed his reputation when Mr. Bouley's business practices were already the subject of gossip, with food suppliers going to court to try to recover money they said he owed them.
"This man is just single-minded: what's good for him is all that matters," said Dominique Simon, Mr. Bouley's former maitre d'hotel, who quit last fall after 10 years at Mr. Bouley's side. "He is the best cook that I know. But if you live with him, it's 'me, me, me, me.' "
"I think it's immoral to make money from misery," Mr. Simon said.
Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of Wallse in the West Village, and a former chef for Mr. Bouley, said he had once considered Mr. Bouley "a very close friend" but had severed their relationship in frustration and anger after he came to the United States from Germany to help Mr. Bouley with his plans.
"He told me when I left in 1997 that I will be crying because I will not be part of his big empire," Mr. Gutenbrunner said. "Well, I'm not crying. I'm doing pretty well."
"I don't speak to him anymore," he said. "He lives in his own world."
Mr. Bouley suggested that Mr. Simon was peeved that he had not been offered a position in Mr. Bouley's new restaurant. Beyond that, Mr. Bouley shrugged off such criticism, saying he did not want to get drawn into personal exchanges.
The last chapter for Mr. Bouley began in 1996, when he entered what turned out to be a short-lived deal with Warner LeRoy, the owner of Tavern on the Green, to finance the culinary empire. At the time, Bouley Bakery and Danube were just the beginning. There would also be Bouley at Home, a 17,000-square-foot food store in TriBeCa. Mr. Bouley would design the menu at another LeRoy restaurant, the Russian Tea Room. And finally, there would be the Mohawk Building.
Mr. Bouley had given up on the food store before Sept. 11, and Mr. LeRoy and Mr. Bouley dissolved their relationship in 1998 after an acrimonious court battle. Mr. LeRoy died last year.
But the Mohawk Building remained central to Mr. Bouley's vision, even as it remained vacant and the subject of shifting plans year after year. As it turned out, Mr. Bouley said, on Sept. 14 he was to sign an agreement with new creditors that would have permitted him to build a 35-room boutique hotel above two restaurants in the building.
While this in many ways might be a story of a culinary Icarus, it would be a mistake to underestimate Mr. Bouley's prospects for success at the new Bouley, where the bakery was moved out to make room for an elegant 45-seat second dining room, and the restaurant is now open for business. For all the chaos and spatting over the years, he has managed to simultaneously operate both a four-star and a three-star restaurant in New York City. And at 48 years old, Mr. Bouley is engaging, enormously intelligent and an inexhaustible fountain of ideas on subjects including cooking and design.
"David can be the most charming man on the planet; that's part of his appeal," said Jay Cohen, a former Bouley sous-chef who is now the owner of Rio Bamba in Rochester. "He also can be the most competitive man on the planet. Sometimes a person stops being themselves, and becomes their name and career. Sometimes it's hard for stuff like that not to go to your head.
"But it does not affect his cooking," Mr. Cohen continued. "He's the best cook I've ever come into contact with. What he does is magic."
Mr. Bouley's skills at the stove would appear not to extend to the details of running a business. Mr. Bouley is notorious for being slow to pay his bills, infuriating suppliers who have long gotten past debating whether this is the behavior of an absent-minded chef or the evasions of someone who has extended his finances too thin.
"I had to sue him; I had to freeze his bank accounts," said Robert Demasco, a partner at Pierless Fish Company. "I don't care if he's a great chef or not; he doesn't do justice to the food industry. His big joke is that he gets away with it. Why does the media play him up?"
Ariane Daguin, the owner of D'Artagnan, a large supplier of specialty meats, said she was still trying to get Mr. Bouley to pay her $12,000. She said that the last time she encountered him, at a party at the restaurant Alain Ducasse, "he really made his best not to say hello to me, not to be in the same corner of the room."
When told that he was reopening his restaurant, Ms. Daguin burst out laughing. "I'm not sure who's going to be his supplier, but whoever it is, he's going to be sorry," she said.
For his most recent late payments, Mr. Bouley blamed a difficult stretch in which his bakery was losing money while he was saddled with the obligations of the Mohawk project. Mr. Bouley said he was mostly up to date and was trying to settle accounts.
"We had a hard time in the summer, and this year was tough because of the economy," he said.
More problematic for Mr. Bouley's reputation, in the view of his friends, was the way his deal with the Red Cross was portrayed, as some of his employees suggested that he was using money from the disaster to cover his restaurant debts.
But from the start, according to Mr. Bouley and the Red Cross, Mr. Bouley made it clear that he would use volunteers and donated food to produce his meals. Red Cross officials offered praise for Mr. Bouley's performance during the disaster.
"He had kept his restaurant open and was feeding disaster workers," said Bob Chlopak, a spokesman for the Red Cross. "There was a feeling on our front lines that this was a guy whose heart seemed to be into this thing. He may well have made a little bit of money off of this, but given the service provided, and the terms under which he provided it, we certainly felt it was fair and reasonable."
Even Drew Nieporent, the Montrachet owner who leads the list of former Bouley partners who have spent years feuding with him, came to his defense here. "There's a fine line between grandstanding and doing the right thing in a crisis," Mr. Nieporent said. "I really don't believe he was grandstanding. I think he meant to do the right thing. I don't think he was capable of being malicious in this situation."
As for Mr. Bouley, he said he was turning his attention to trying to adjust to this latest chapter in a very colorful career. 
"Sure, I'm emotionally upset when I think about how much I put into it," he said. But then he perked up.
"My tractor has been in the mud for five years," he said. "Now I'm going to take it across the room and see what I can harvest."

HEADLINE: Scores of Bodies Strewn at Site Of Crematory 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE with ROBERT D. McFADDEN

DATELINE: NOBLE, Ga., Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Every funeral director for 100 miles did business with the Tri-State Crematory on the assumption that the owners were doing their job of transforming dead bodies into ashes. But today, horrified authorities discovered decomposing evidence that the furnace at the crematory had not worked for years.
 After a dog walker stumbled over a skull on Friday, law enforcement officers discovered at least 120 rotting corpses in sheds and on the ground near the crematory, and state officials said that that figure could double by the time the area is fully excavated. Some of the bodies had been there for years and were nearly skeletal, while others, fresh from the funeral home, still bore toe tags. 
 Human bones, weathered white, were scattered through the woods like leaves, skulls mixed with leg bones in a ghoulish jumble that one state trooper compared to a scene from a Stephen King novel. An infant's body was found in a box in the back of a rusting hearse. 
Some bodies had become mummified and may have been at the site more than 20 years, said Dr. Kris Sperry, Georgia's chief medical examiner. Nearly two dozen coffins that had once been buried were also found on the ground, Dr. Sperry said, and in some cases their embalmed contents had been dragged out and left exposed to the elements for years. It was unclear why those bodies were at the site.
Officials said there was no foul play involved. But even hardened law enforcement officers were left shaken and nauseated by the sight that greeted them in the sheds.
"There were bodies stacked like cordwood, just discarded and thrown in a pile," said Vernon Keenan, assistant director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. "After 30 years in law enforcement, you think you've seen everything. And then you see something you can't even imagine."
Dr. Sperry, who deals with corpses every day, said nothing in his experience prepared him for what he saw today.
"I have to say, the utter lack of respect in which they were piled on top of one another was very disturbing," he said.
State officials, who declared Walker County a disaster area to enable state funds to be spent on the cleanup, said that apparently the furnace had broken down several years ago and the owners could not afford repairs. The crematory's manager, Ray Brent Marsh, 28, was charged with five counts of theft by deception and was in the county jail tonight. His parents, Ray and Clara Marsh, who own the business, were not charged.
Mr. Keenan said the fraud charges were necessary because the state does not have any laws barring such treatment of corpses.
"We have laws against desecrating graves, but we can't find one against desecration of bodies," he said. "I guess nobody in the Legislature ever thought something like this could happen."
In many cases, families who thought their relatives had been cremated received urns containing what they believed were ashes, were in fact a mixture of burned wood chips and dirt, officials said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation urged any families who had received urns through Tri-State to bring them in for examination.
By nightfall, officials had tagged and numbered 80 bodies, and planned to continue their task throughout the week. Earth-moving equipment was ordered, and there was talk of draining a lake on the crematory's property to see what might be on the bottom.
Thirteen bodies were fresh enough to be identified, and some of the families who were notified gathered at a nearby church to exchange tales of shock.
Neva and Tim Mason, accountants who live in nearby La Fayette, were told on Friday night that the body of Mr. Mason's father, Luther P. Mason, had been found. Luther Mason died on Dec. 19, Neva Mason said, and the family believed he had been cremated and his ashes buried at La Fayette Memory Gardens, just down Highway 27 from Noble.
They had had a ceremony at the cemetery, she said, and were shocked to hear that his body had been found bearing a toe tag.
"He was stacked in a barn," Mrs. Mason said. "We don't know if he was stacked on top of people or with people stacked on top of him. We don't know if he was wearing clothes. I don't know what's worse, him dying, or this."
The Masons, like almost everyone else in this small town in northwest Georgia, 17 miles south of Chattanooga, knew the Marsh family and never had any reason to suspect that anything was awry at the crematory. 
"I've known the Marshes all my life," Mrs. Mason said. "My brother graduated college with Brent. They're wonderful people. Mrs. Marsh helped hundreds of kids in this area."
Clara Marsh, a local schoolteacher, was president of the Walker County Association of Educators and chairwoman of the Walker County Democratic Committee. Ray Brent Marsh was active in local civic affairs, and Sheriff Steve Wilson said he served with Mr. Marsh on several boards and commissions.
The authorities set up a makeshift morgue on the site today, and began removing the newer bodies to a nearby site where families can come and identify them.
At least 20 funeral homes that may have sent bodies to the Tri-State Crematory over the last six years were contacted and asked to review their records in hopes of identifying many of the corpses, but Mr. Keenan said he believed many of the remains would never be identified.
Although all crematoriums and funeral homes are supposed to be inspected regularly, state officials said Georgia has only two inspectors, and could not provide records today of the last inspection of Tri-State.
W. E. McGill, who was the elected Walker County coroner for 23 years until his retirement in 2000, said that Tri-State Crematory had operated illegally for a decade by not having a licensed funeral director on its premises during business hours, as required by a state law passed in 1992. He said the crematory also failed to meet various state sanitation requirements.
"I filed complaints, but nothing was ever done about it," Mr. McGill said.
Mr. McGill said that Mr. and Mrs. Marsh had started out in the businesses of grave digging and burial vault supply, and that Tri-State had been the only crematory in the county when they founded it three decades ago. (The family lives next to the crematorium.) In those days, he said, a decision to cremate a body was rare.
"This is the Bible Belt South, and everybody had their own community or church cemetery," he said. In recent years, however, cremation has become more common, and several more crematories have begun operating in the area, he said.
"Cremation was not popular down here until six or seven years ago," Mr. McGill said, adding that the change " has to do with the economy -- it's so much cheaper."
But Sheila Horton, the niece of the elder Ray Marsh, said greed was to blame for the ghoulish scene.
"His wife and son just didn't want to spend the money to fix it up," said Mrs. Horton, who grew up in Noble and now lives in Atlanta. "Lord Jesus, I don't know how they could go to bed at night with all that outside their window."

HEADLINE: Pataki Works Out Deal With Indians For Upstate Land 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WAMPSVILLE, N.Y., Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has brokered a tentative deal with the Oneida Indian Nation that, if ratified by the New York State Legislature and Congress, could resolve a bitter 31-year-old dispute over a quarter-million acres the Oneidas maintain the state bought from them illegally through treaties in the 19th century.
 Under the agreement, the state and federal governments would pay three branches of the tribe $500 million and the tribe would drop its claim to most of the land. Tribal leaders would use part of the money to buy back about 35,000 acres from willing sellers in Madison and Oneida Counties, with about 5,000 acres set aside as wilderness. The land would not be contiguous, and the current owners would not be forced to give up their property. 
 The Oneida Nation already owns 14,000 acres in the two counties. 
"This agreement represents an historic breakthrough in a decades-long legal struggle that has produced nothing but animosity and uncertainty," the governor said in a prepared statement.
The Indians and the state would also set up a $100 million fund to compensate the counties for lost tax revenues, and would agree not to acquire more than 5,000 acres in the first 10 years of the deal. To mollify angry merchants who say Indian convenience stores undercut their prices, the Oneidas would also charge an Indian tax equivalent to the sales taxes collected at other stores.
In addition to gaining legislative approvals, the tentative agreement assumes that one of the three Oneida branches, a group from Wisconsin, will agree to end the current litigation, which is far from a certainty. Mr. Pataki, however, played down the potential of the Wisconsin Oneidas scuttling the deal.
The deal comes as the New York Oneidas are negotiating with the state over a compact for a second casino in Sullivan County, and though the two negotiations are not officially linked, the Pataki administration anticipates putting some of the state's revenues from the new casino in the fund for the counties.
If approved by Congress and the Legislature and the people of the Oneida Nation, the land deal would be a major coup for Mr. Pataki, a Republican seeking re-election in the fall. The Oneida land claim has been wending its way through federal court since 1970, the subject of several fruitless negotiations. 
In recent years, the land claims have also provoked widespread anxiety and anger among private landowners and local government officials. Local business owners also contended that the Oneidas' tax-free status was putting them out of business, especially given the draw of Turning Stone, the tribe's casino near Oneida, which had become one of the region's largest employers.
The claim stems from Oneidas' contention that New York State violated the Federal Indian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790, which banned states from buying land from Indians without federal approval. Between 1795 and 1840, the state and local governments acquired more than 270,000 acres from the Oneidas through 26 treaties and several other agreements with the Oneidas. None of those transactions were approved by Congress.
In 1985, the Oneida claim gained greater weight when the United States Supreme Court agreed with the tribe in a case involving just 900 acres. In 1998 the Justice Department intervened in the large land-claim suit on the part of the Indians, creating great anxiety on the part of homeowners. Later the governor prevailed on Washington to drop the homeowners from the suit.
Pataki administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said today that it was the Legislature's decision last fall granting the governor the ability to negotiate deals for six new Indian casinos that finally made the tentative agreement possible. Seeing a second, more lucrative casino on the horizon, they said, the Oneidas agreed to accept far less land than they had originally sought, and to help finance the fund to pay the county governments in lieu of taxes.
A final deal faces several obstacles. To begin with, the Wisconsin branch has been pushing the Pataki administration for a Catskills casino, and has threatened to continue the land-claim lawsuit if it does not get one, officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
The governor and leaders of the New York Oneidas pledged today to fight together against any legal action the Wisconsin Oneidas might take. Without a united front, the out-of-state group has little chance of prevailing in court, Mr. Pataki said. 
The State Legislature must also appropriate the money for the deal, and getting the Assembly Democratic majority and Senate Republican majority to agree on such a large appropriation is never easy. Such bills often become entangled in extraneous legislative bargains built into the state's budget. Congress must also contribute $250 million to make the proposal work.
Even so, the tentative agreement represented the most hopeful moment in many years of stymied talks, which have frustrated mediators and federal jurists alike. "This agreement in concept is an historic step toward resolving an issue that has plagued the region for many years," said the highest-ranking official in the Oneida Indian Nation, Ray Halbritter.
The proposal would give the New York Oneidas $225 million, the Wisconsin group $250 million and a smaller group in Ontario, Canada, $25 million. 
The outlines of the deal are essentially the same as one drawn up by a federal mediator two years ago. Still, some landowners at the announcement today were skeptical.
Leon Koziol, a lawyer who represents a group of landowners, said that while his clients welcomed the possibility of the cloud of the Indians' lawsuit being lifted from their properties, the deal seemed far from solid since it was reached without including federal authorities or the Wisconsin group at the table.
"One of the things that surprises me," he said, "is Pataki said this would end litigation. In the same breath he says we are going to litigate with the Wisconsin tribe as long as it takes. What he's saying, then, is this is far from over." 
In addition to the Oneidas, New York State is embroiled in land-claim cases with three other tribes, the Mohawks, the Senecas and the Cayugas. But nowhere has the animosity between the local people and the Indians been more bitter than in this economically depressed part of the state.
No one answered the telephone at the headquarters of the Wisconsin Oneidas, who have a separate and distinct government from the New York Oneida nation. The Wisconsin group has threatened to file new suits against certain private landowners later this month. One reason the dispute has dragged on so long is that the three groups of Oneidas have often feuded about strategy and goals.
State and Indian officials have said in the past that a land-claims settlement could be used to resolve several longstanding disputes between the tribe and the state. For instance, the Oneidas have sought state approval for slot machines and a liquor license for their Turning Stone casino, near Verona. They are also seeking approval for a casino in the Catskills. None of these issues are resolved in the proposed agreement.
For county leaders and homeowners, the main source of friction has been the Oneidas' tax-free status. The Turning Stone casino does not pay taxes to the local governments. Neither do Oneida-owned gas stations and tobacco stores.
"There's hundreds of millions of dollars in that casino and they're not paying any property taxes," said Jerry Langford, 49, an electrician who echoed the views of many local residents at the announcement of the deal.
The Oneida tribe in New York does not have a contiguous reservation, but rather owns a checkerboard of property across Madison and Oneida Counties, about 14,000 acres in all. Under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua, any land the tribe buys automatically becomes part of its reservation and is taken off the tax rolls, much like land owned by churches.
Mr. Pataki's negotiators said the pivotal concession by the Oneidas was their acceptance of 35,000 acres rather than the 250,000 they first sought. The other key to the deal is the $100 million fund which, once invested, will produce income for the counties to offset the loss of property taxes, they said.

Nassau Assembly Seat Goes to the Republican

BYLINE:  By Vivian S. Toy 

 BODY:
David McDonough, the Republican candidate for the Assembly seat that represents Merrick and Bellmore -- an area long considered solidly Republican territory -- won the seat in an extremely close special election last week.
 Mr. 
McDonough, who owns a credit collections agency in downtown Merrick, got 5,440 votes to the 5,186 for his Democratic opponent, Steve November, according to unofficial results. Mr. November said he would not concede the election until the Board of Elections had completed its usual recount and added absentee tallies, which may be completed this week. 
 Mr. McDonough, 64, heads the Nassau Council of Chambers of Commerce and is the coordinator for Merrick's downtown revitalization project. "I see this as an opportunity to do more of what I've been doing for the last 20 years and I look forward to it," he said.
Mr. November, a former junior high school science teacher who now practices law in Manhattan, said the fact that the race was so close in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats three to two shows the growing strength of the Democratic Party. "It was a squeaker for them and they're not going to have it so easy from now on," he said.
Both parties spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on the election. The Democrats saw it as a chance to capitalize on the popularity of the Nassau county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, and the Republicans saw a victory as an important response to the Democrats' recent successes on the county level. Vivian S. Toy

HOME PRICES

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 Home prices continued to climb in most New Jersey metropolitan areas during 2001 despite a slowing economy, according to a survey by the National Association of Realtors. Home prices in the Bergen and Passaic county area remain the sixth highest in the country, according to the survey, which compared 2001 fourth quarter sales prices with prices from the fourth quarter a year earlier. The median home price in the northern New Jersey region was $296,400, an increase of 13.5 percent from the preceding year. Prices rose more in Monmouth County where the median price was $214,300, an increase of 21.3 percent from the previous year.

HEADLINE: 10 Years After 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
IN the early morning of Feb. 15, 1992, just hours before Foxwoods Resort Casino was scheduled to open, Richard (Skip) Hayward, the chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots at the time, sat at a bar with the head of the tribal gaming commission and the casino's chief executive officer.
 As work crews scurried around them, putting ashtrays on tables, cleaning bathrooms and stacking chips, Mr. Hayward posed a question. 
 "What do we do tomorrow if nobody shows up?" he said, according to G. Michael Brown, who was the gaming commission chairman.
The remark may have been made in jest, but less than 12 hours later, Mr. Hayward learned he had nothing to worry about. With employees applauding, Foxwoods opened its doors and hundreds of gamblers rushed in to try their luck at the first legalized casino in New England. 
The doors have never closed since.
Ten years later, Foxwoods has achieved legendary status. It is one of the largest casinos in the world. It has drawn stars like Frank Sinatra to this quiet corner of the state. And it is responsible for the rags-to-riches story of the Mashantuckets, a tribe many never even knew existed.
In southeastern Connecticut, Foxwoods cushioned the region from the downturn in the defense industry, helped double the number of hotel rooms and paved the way for the neighboring Mohegan Indians to open a casino. It drew cars and tour buses to narrow country roads and ignited a heated debate about Indian gaming and land rights.
In fact, Foxwoods and its slot revenues have touched every municipality in the state. And its impact has rippled south to Atlantic City, which used to hold the East Coast monopoly on casino gambling.
"It showed that the gaming market in the Northeast was much larger than anyone had previously anticipated," said Michael Pollock, publisher of Gaming Industry Observer, which tracks industry trends. "I think it also showed that Indian gaming is a force to be reckoned with in this industry. I don't think anyone really anticipated the success that Foxwoods has had."
And that success has led to the biggest impact Foxwoods has left on the entire state: the possibility of more casinos. With 10 groups seeking federal recognition, many worry that Connecticut, which has long been known as the land of steady habits, could become associated with one habit: gambling.
"With the addition of more casinos, especially if they are located closer to New York City, I think Connecticut would become known as the casino state," said the state Senate majority leader, George C. Jepsen, a Democrat of Stamford who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. 
"And additional casinos would probably have as big an impact in changing the nature of Connecticut as any event probably since the addition of I-95 and the interstate system." 
Before Foxwoods, few people probably paid much attention to Indian gaming, a phenomenon that was legalized in 1988. But that changed after Foxwoods opened in the center of the densely populated Boston-New York corridor. 
Soon thousands of people from throughout the Northeast arrived at the casino each day. Limousines rolled down Route 2 and it was not uncommon to see tribal members driving BMWs. The Mashantuckets became major political players, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to national political committees and landing invitations to White House events. Books were written. Political careers were made and broken. 
"It was a once-in-a-century experience," said Mr. Brown, who later became Foxwoods's chief executive, but now works as a gaming consultant. "It never happened before. It's never going to happen again."
Just how much money the casino makes is unknown, because the tribe is not required to release full financial statements. Instead, the only glimpse of this cash cow comes from the monthly slot revenue reports the casino files under an agreement that requires it to give 25 percent of those revenues to the state. 
Since its first slot machines went on line in January 1993, nearly a year after the casino opened, Foxwoods has taken in more than $5.5 billion in slot revenue. If it's true that slot machines generate about 70 percent of a casino's gaming revenue, Foxwoods has taken in nearly $8 billion since it opened.
Yet the Mashantuckets have only about 750 members, more than half of whom are under 18, said Bruce Kirchner, a tribal member who is senior vice president of administration at Foxwoods. The tribe has used the money to pay for everything from a $193.4 million tribal museum and research center to tuition bills. 
"In the early days I was the only member, I think, with a college degree," Mr. Kirchner said. 
"And now we have about close to 150 who either have their degrees or are working on them at this point."
The state's coffers have benefited as well. To date, it has received about $1.4 billion in slot revenues from Foxwoods. 
In the fiscal year that ended June 30, the state's share of Foxwoods's slot revenues totaled $190.7 million.
The money goes to the state's general fund, so it is difficult to pinpoint where it has been spent, said Dean Pagani, spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland. But, he said, "it's contributed to the ability to reduce taxes because it's an additional source or revenue that doesn't come directly from taxpayers." 
The state disburses a sizeable portion of that money to its 169 municipalities. For towns like Kent, which received about $45,000 this year, the money, though welcome, does not represent a major revenue source, said First Selectwoman Dolores R. Schiesel.
In Woodstock, where residents are concerned the Nipmuc Nation may some day build a casino nearby, First Selectman Ernest Wetzel would be willing to give up the estimated $60,000 his town receives if casinos were banned in the state. But even he thinks that is unlikely. 
"At a time when the state's desperate for money, I'm going to come along and say, 'We should get rid of the casinos?' " Mr. Wetzel asked. "That would be very unpopular."
Mr. Wetzel's concerns stem from another legacy of Foxwoods -- the legal precedent that enabled the Mohegans to open a casino and created the possibility of future tribal casinos.
And unlike 1992, when few may have anticipated what kind of impact Foxwoods would have on a community, these towns are closely monitoring the petitions of other tribes. Kent, for one, has allocated $200,000 to research the petition of the Schaghticoke Indians, who have said they want to pursue a gaming venture if they are recognized.
"I think we are much more aware because we have watched what happens," Ms. Schiesel said. "When the Mashantuckets received congressional recognition, I don't think everyone was quite as aware or savvy to what the impacts would be."
As William Curry, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, put it, Foxwoods's "greatest value to the state is as a lesson: Don't build really big stuff without thinking about the consequences first."
Nowhere is that lesson more evident than in the three communities that surround Foxwoods: North Stonington, Ledyard and Preston. These towns have long said they should receive more of the slot revenues to offset the casino's impact. In response, Mr. Rowland has proposed giving those towns, along with Montville and Norwich, an additional $500,000 each for impact aid in his 2002-2003 budget, Mr. Pagani said.
In North Stonington, where the population is less than 5,000, the town's police force has expanded from one resident trooper to three since Foxwoods opened, said First Selectman Nicholas H. Mullane II. The once volunteer ambulance company is now paid staff.
"You have to look at it this way," Mr. Mullane said. "We live next to a Fenway Park that is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That's about what it adds up to."
The casino has spawned some economic development, including a pornography store and a doughnut shop, but nothing significant, he said.
Meanwhile, property values along Route 2, the main access road to the casino, have decreased by about 10 percent since the casino opened, he said. Just recently, the town instituted an ordinance that bans tour buses from using certain town roads, he said. 
Yet others note that the casino created much-needed jobs when defense companies, like Electric Boat, were cutting back. While the service jobs often don't pay as well as manufacturing jobs, Foxwoods has offered good benefits to its employees. That has attracted people like Mark Sulik of Griswold, who began working for Foxwoods in 1993 after Electric Boat laid him off.
"It looked like some place that was steady and some place where I could grow a little bit," said Mr. Sulik, a count room manager who used to be a shipfitter and carpenter.
The people who worked at the casinos aren't the only ones making money from the venture. In 2001, the casino did $54.6 million in business with Connecticut companies, like J. P. Jarjura & Sons. The Waterbury produce business has supplied more than 9,500 oranges a week to the casino, said William G. Jarjura, an owner. 
"It's a very big account," said Mr. Jarjura, whose company also sells bananas, strawberries and other produce to the casino.
And Foxwoods has been a boon to the hotel industry in southeastern Connecticut, where the number of rooms jumped from 3,280 in 1992 to 6,322 a decade later, said Deborah Donovan, director of marketing for CT's Mystic and More! Convention and Visitors Bureau. When the Mohegan Indians' new hotel opens later this year, there will be 7,522 hotel rooms in the region. 
"There isn't a week that goes by that I don't get calls from developers wanting to know about numbers because they are thinking of building another hotel here," Ms. Donovan said.
Yet some said the casino has not benefited many of the existing businesses or spurred new economic growth. 
"We have had no spinoff industries or restaurants or anything like that, because the reality is that gamblers have one thing in mind," said Wesley J. Johnson Sr., the major of Ledyard. "Get to the casino. Lose or win some money. Then go back home."
The tribe tried to diversify by opening a shipbuilding company in New London, but it later closed. It owns a pharmaceutical network and hotels in the region, but its greatest success has been gaming. 
In fact, Foxwoods has done so well that it may have siphoned off business from other gambling sites in the state. The state's last jai alai fronton closed last year and many charitable games, like church bingos, folded after Foxwoods opened, dropping from about 390 weekly games in 1987 to about 235 now, said Paul Bernstein, assistant unit chief in the State Division of Special Revenue's gambling regulation unit.
The casino industry, however, has thrived. It grew even more when the Mohegans opened the Mohegan Sun Casino in 1996. 
Having two major casinos in the state has raised concerns about problem gambling. Several people have been arrested for embezzling money to feed their habit. But to date, the actual rate of problem gambling among Connecticut residents remains unclear.
Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun each donate $200,000 annually to the problem gambling council and have programs on gambling responsibly.
When it comes to tourism, the casinos have successfully increased the region's visibility, said Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the Connecticut Office of Tourism. While there has been a "modest" spillover to attractions like the Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration, that is expected to change as the casinos cultivate convention business, said Lisa Jaccoma, vice president of public affairs for the aquarium.
"That's where we actually see getting a tremendous amount of positive bounce from being near these guys," she said.

HEADLINE: For One Day, Disney Is Coming to Hartford 

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA GROARK 

 BODY:
COULD it really be true that when you wish upon a star, or in the case of Hartford simply label yourself New England's rising star, dreams come true?
 Maybe. But whatever the reason, the Walt Disney Company has touched Hartford with some if its magic and selected the Hartford Civic Center as the site of its annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday. 
 "This is a huge deal," said Andrea Comer, executive assistant and press secretary to Hartford Mayor Eddie A. Perez. "I think it shows that people and businesses are having faith in coming to Hartford to have their conventions and their meetings and hopefully it's the start of more of these kinds of events." 
No, this is not some goofy stunt dreamed up by the creators of Mickey Mouse. The California-based company owns ESPN, the sports cable network in Bristol.
With a large base of shareholders living within a radius of Hartford that includes New York City and Boston, it is only logical that Hartford would be chosen to play host to the meeting, according to a Disney spokesman.
"Hartford has been on a list of places that at some point we would have it," said John Dreyer, senior vice president of corporate communications for Disney.
ESPN, he said, "is a major brand for us and it's one of our major businesses. It's not just a U.S. brand. It's an international brand."
While the event will only last a few hours, it is expected to draw at least 1,000 people, including Michael D. Eisner, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, Mr. Dreyer said. That is exciting for Hartford's business and political leaders, who hope this is the beginning of things to come.
In fact, Hartford is striving to increase its corporate meeting and convention business. Work is under way for a 500,000-square-foot convention center that will be an important component of the Adriaen's Landing project in the city's downtown. But that development is still years from being completed, so the fact that Disney has chosen Hartford now is even more exciting, observers said.
"It's a shot in the arm for a city that is trying to kind of position itself into a market like that," said Steven Lanza, executive editor of The Connecticut Economy, a University of Connecticut quarterly review. "Apparently, Hartford shows up on the radar now, and that can only be good news for a town that is maybe trying to do a little bit more."
H. Scott Phelps, president of the Greater Hartford Convention and Visitors Bureau, for one, said that he believed Disney's decision shows that Hartford has "outstanding demographics." After all, the city is within a two-and-a-half-hour drive of 23 million people, it is just down the road from a major airport and it is at the intersection of two interstate highways, he said.
Despite the excitement about Disney, the city plays regular host to major stars like Elton John and Billy Joel, who performed this month. Within 30 days last year, the Goodwin Hotel played host to two members of Jordan's royal family, said Robert Dorr, the downtown hotel's director of sales.
But the location has raised a few eyebrows of those who said they think it is an interesting choice given the fact that recent shareholders meetings have been in places like Dallas and Seattle.
"Oh my goodness. Why is it there?" said Alana Smith, director of research and development for Harrington Investments in Napa, Calif., which is a Disney shareholder, recalling her first reaction to the site of the meeting. "But you know on the other hand, a few years ago Nike had one in the Netherlands. So we've really heard it all."
People like Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth, a nonprofit organization in Boston that has proposed a shareholder resolution that would limit the amount of stock options Disney's top officers could receive, said that Hartford may have been picked because it is less likely to draw large crowds of protesters than some other cities. 
"A lot of companies, especially companies that have had controversies from human rights and environmental groups, have tended to move their meetings to harder-to-get places," said Mr. Klinger, who expects about 20 people from his organization to go to Hartford for the meeting. "We have seen companies move away from places where they would be especially vulnerable. L.A. would be a place that would attract a lot of sweat shop interests pretty easily." 
Mr. Dreyer denied that was the case. But Disney, which is being challenged by a falloff in attendance at its theme parks and a slump in ratings and advertising at its ABC television network, has asked that there be little fanfare surrounding the meeting. 
So rather than let Hartford roll out the red carpet for Mr. Eisner and other top executives who are expected to attend, Hartford business and political officials are trying to keep things low key.
The city, for one, will do a special sweep of downtown streets on Feb. 15 and again on Tuesday, according to Ms. Comer. In addition, Hartford Proud and Beautiful will take extra efforts to keep the area, and particularly the "gateways" to the Civic Center, clean, she said.
The convention and visitors bureau has offered to provide a welcome sign, but is waiting to get approval from Madison Square Garden, which manages the Civic Center and booked the event, Mr. Phelps said. The bureau does plan to distribute gift bags to shareholders.
In addition, the MetroHartford Regional Economic Alliance has joined the governor's office, the Capital City Economic Development Authority and other groups to let Madison Square Garden know they are ready to do anything that Disney would like, said R. Nelson Griebel, the alliance's president. 
"The fact is we are doing what Disney wants to be done," Mr. Griebel said. "Our preference would be that, in a pure marketing mode, we would like to take full advantage of the fact that Disney is here, that their C.E.O. is here, that many if not all of their board members are here.
"We think that's a great thing," he added. "At the same time, we have to be respectful of the fact that they have chosen to come here for their meeting and of however they want to run their meeting."
If given the opportunity, political and business leaders would like to tell Mr. Eisner and other company officials how much they value ESPN's presence, he said. In addition, they are willing to provide an overview of projects that are going on in the area.
If they wish, a tour could be arranged to see places like the future site of Adriaen's Landing, to which Disney has committed a $5 million investment to create "an ESPN-branded venue," like an ESPN Zone there, said Matt J. Fleury, director of marketing and communications for the Capital City Economic Development Authority.
But even if they never have a chance to show off the city to Mr. Eisner, business officials should figure out what made Hartford attractive to Disney and then capitalize on it, Mr. Lanza said.
"I think what it should say to city leaders is that sort of: 'Holy cow. Look at this. We didn't even do anything and somebody noticed us,' " Mr. Lanza said. "Maybe this should tell us something. Why? What makes Hartford so attractive? And what can we do, not in terms of using Disney to try to sell Hartford, but what is it about Hartford that was attractive to Disney and try to build on those strengths."

PERSON: Toby Bright 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Selling Airplanes With a Smile

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
FEW jobs seem more challenging after Sept. 11 than selling commercial airplanes. In the teeth of the most dramatic downturn in aviation history, most of the world's airlines are trying to put off paying for the new jets they had on order, much less buy new ones.
 But Toby Bright, recently named to lead commercial airplane sales at the Boeing Company, is philosophical. "It's going to be tough, but on the other hand, it can only go one direction," he said. "It can't get any worse." 
 Commercial airplanes accounted for $35 billion of Boeing's $58 billion in sales last year, but that proportion is now expected to shrink sharply. Boeing plans to deliver 380 jets this year, down from 527 in 2001. The number is expected to drop next year to 275 to 300 deliveries. 
But Mr. Bright, 49, has thrived in the face of similar adversity. During the last big airline industry recession, in the early 1990's, he was given the account of United Airlines, then Boeing's largest customer. 
Soon after, United asked to cancel orders worth several billion dollars. By the time Mr. Bright left the account five years later for a bigger job within Boeing, his friends at United presented him with a graph that still hangs in his office, showing that he had still not made up those lost sales. 
"Only Toby could have negative sales and get promoted," said Frederic F. Brace, who worked closely with Mr. Bright at the time and is now United's chief financial officer. "I have not met anyone that doesn't like Toby." 
Mr. Bright's relaxed manner is in marked contrast to John Leahy, the brash, intense chief salesman at Airbus Industrie, Boeing's archrival. Mr. Leahy, who is American and has presided over Airbus's rise to parity with Boeing in global airplane sales in the last decade, always seems to be selling and rarely misses an opportunity to knock the competition. 
Mr. Bright is more likely to make his point with humor. During the mid-90's, when the slogan of the Seattle Mariners baseball team was "Refuse to Lose," he had bumper stickers printed that said "Refuse Toulouse," a reference to the French city where Airbus has its headquarters. 
Mr. Bright has large shoes to fill within Boeing. His predecessor, Seddik Belyamani, spent 28 years at the company before announcing his retirement last month. Born in Morocco, Mr. Belyamani speaks French and Arabic as well as English and forged many close relationships around the globe.
Mr. Bright said Alan Mulally, the head of Boeing's commercial airplane division, told him that before he got his new job, there had been some discussion about whether Boeing "needed a Leahy." 
Mr. Mulally decided that it did not. In an interview last week, Mr. Mulally said he had chosen Mr. Bright because he was so skilled at managing the relationship between Boeing and its customers. 
"When you buy an airplane, it is like getting married," Mr. Mulally said. "It is a long-term relationship." 
Mr. Bright, he explained, is excellent at understanding the customer's needs and relaying them back to the home office. "He seeks to understand more than he seeks to be understood," he said. "Those were the characteristics that we needed and that I wanted in a leader." 
Mr. Bright says he was concerned that he does not speak a foreign language when 70 percent of Boeing's airplane sales are outside the United States. Mr. Belyamani, however, assured him that language was less important than understanding and appreciating foreign cultures. 
"Even in the Middle East, we do not discuss airplane sales in Arabic," Mr. Belyamani said. "Toby will be fine. He is the best choice. We have been thinking about Toby for quite some time." 
Like most of Boeing's other top executives, Mr. Bright began his career as an engineer, but his love of flight goes back a long way. As a boy in the 1960's in Mullens, W. Va., population 2,000, where his father was a letter carrier, Mr. Bright dreamed of becoming an astronaut. 
As a teenager, he hitchhiked 45 miles to the nearest airport, where he fueled airplanes in exchange for flying lessons. By the time he was 17, he was flying single-engine airplanes up and down the East Coast. One of his jobs was with the Veterans Administration, helping to ferry bodies back from the nearest V.A. hospital for burial.
Mr. Bright was set on life as a pilot, he said, when the father of a high school girlfriend convinced him to get an engineering degree, telling him it would broaden his options. He went to Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and was the only person in his high school class who went to college out of state. 
After graduating in 1997, Mr. Bright interviewed with Boeing but decided to take a job with Grumman on Long Island after the company treated Mr. Bright and his wife, Linda, to a trip to New York.
But before he started, he received a call from Mr. Mulally, who was running a Boeing program for NASA in Langley, Va. "Alan was very persuasive and persistent then as now," Mr. Bright recalled. He signed with Boeing. 
After working on the flight controls, which include the autopilot and auto-landing controls, throughout the development of the 757, Mr. Bright decided that he wanted to move into sales, having found that he enjoyed contact with customers. It took him almost a year to convince the company that he was right for the job. 
He started out handling Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand and Aloha Airlines, making a Pacific circuit once a month to service his accounts. Since then, he has held increasingly important jobs, including head of European sales and, most recently, head of business strategy and marketing for the airplane division. 
During the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Mr. Bright was tapped to set up an aircraft trading arm to sell Boeing's growing inventory of orphan aircraft that were returned by Asian carriers short on cash. He also played a role in a controversial deal in which Boeing agreed to buy 17 Airbus A340's from Singapore Airlines so the carrier could replace them with Boeing 777's.
Mr. Bright said he felt relieved when he left that job because he would not be the one who would have to resell all those A340's. "But now I do," he laughed. "It's come back to me." 
But Boeing has not done too badly, he added. The company has sold five. "We sold more A340's last year than Airbus," he said, one of his few jibes at the competition.
Mr. Bright still likes to fly. He has a 1953 Cessna 170B that he uses to carry himself, his wife and dog to their weekend cabin on one of the San Juan Islands north of Seattle in Puget Sound. 
It's a refuge that Mr. Bright may not see too often in the coming years; Mr. Belyamani sometimes traveled 250 days a year. "I always wanted to travel," Mr. Bright said. "I got my wish there."

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES: TAX TIPS; 
In Filing, One Size Does Not Fit All

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
THE more politicians talk about simplifying the tax system, it seems, the more complex it becomes, and that makes it difficult to keep up with all the ins and outs of the law that can trip or benefit you.
 "You can't do a tax return on the back of an envelope anymore," said Laurence I. Foster, a partner at Richard A. Eisner & Company in New York. "Years ago, I literally could. I could meet someone, talk a few minutes" and quickly figure the person's approximate tax liability. 
 Today, with the various choices the law allows, it may be necessary to calculate one's taxes several ways to get the best results.
For example, Mr. Foster said, most couples assume that they should file a joint return, but "it's not always better to file jointly." If one spouse has big medical expenses, which can be deducted only to the extent that they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, the category "married filing separately" may result in a lower tax bill for the two. The same is true if one spouse has a big casualty loss, which can be taken only to the extent that it exceeds 10 percent of adjusted gross income, plus $100, or miscellaneous itemized deductions like professional dues, which can be deducted only to the extent that the total exceeds the first 2 percent of adjusted income. But they need to calculate the returns both ways -- jointly and separately -- to know which filing category to choose.
Mr. Foster and several other tax experts offered a variety of tips, both for whittling the tax due on this year's return and for getting into shape for next year's.

UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION -- This money is taxable, Mr. Foster said, even though no tax is withheld. "The key is the word 'compensation,' " he added. That means that failure to report it could result in added tax and penalties. Never mind that an unemployed person may not be awash in cash.

ABOVE-THE-LINE ITEMS -- These are what accountants call the adjustments to income on the front of Form 1040 that lower adjusted gross income. They include contributions to deductible I.R.A.'s and retirement plans for the self-employed, interest paid on student loans, medical savings accounts, health insurance for the self-employed and paid alimony.
"Watch out for those items," said Lorin D. Luchs, a tax partner in the Washington national office of BDO Seidman. They bring a double benefit: the value of the deduction itself and the lowering of adjusted gross income, which may help them qualify for other deductions and credits. The full child credit, for example, is available only to couples whose adjusted gross income is below $110,000 (less than $75,000 for single filers).

CHARITABLE GIFTS -- To be deductible, these need not be made in cash or by check. "You can get paid to clean out your closet," Mr. Foster said. Old clothing or toys given to a charity's thrift shop or rummage sale, for example, are deductible -- but at the thrift shop value, not at your purchase price. For more valuable things -- like paintings -- an appraisal is needed. Appreciated securities are good for sizable gifts to charity because you can deduct the full value and do not have to pay capital gains tax.
"If you donate a vehicle, be sure you get a proper valuation," cautioned Sidney Kess, a New York accountant and tax lawyer. "The I.R.S. looks closely at these deductions because there has been tremendous abuse."
Many charitably inclined people run up out-of-pocket expenses and use their cars while doing volunteer work, said Alan E. Weiner, a partner at Holtz Rubenstein & Company in Melville, N.Y. Mileage may be deducted at 14 cents a mile. If these expenses exceed $250, get a statement from the charity, he said, just as you must for any other donation that exceeds that amount. 

MUTUAL FUND STATEMENTS -- These statements, which come with 1099 forms, should be read carefully, Mr. Luchs said, but many people throw them out. Funds often disclose in the statements that a percentage of their income came from United States Treasury securities, and such interest is exempt from state tax. Some bond funds report that a portion of their income is from municipals, which are exempt from federal tax.

WORTHLESS STOCK -- This is gener-ally deductible as a capital loss, Mr. Luchs said, but only $3,000 of the loss may offset ordinary income; any excess must be carried forward to future years. However, if you receive a statement that a stock is worthless, check whether it is what is known as section 1244 stock, which was issued by a qualifying small business, he said. If so, you may be able to deduct the entire loss against ordinary income in one year.

THIRD-PARTY DESIGNEE -- A new line on Page 2 of the 1040 this year, just above the place where taxpayers sign their returns, asks, "Do you want to allow another person to discuss this return with the I.R.S.?" Mr. Weiner said, "It could be good for senior citizens, for example," who might list the name of one of their children, or for anyone who relies on another person to help with tax preparation and filing.

SENDING IN THE RETURN -- "Anyone who files an income tax return should get a receipt," Mr. Weiner said. If using the Postal Service, send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. Private delivery services like FedEx, Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express and United Parcel Service can be used, too, but taxpayers must use the street address for the I.R.S. service center where the return must be filed, not a post office box. "Don't automatically use last year's address." he added. Then go to the Web site of the service you use and print out the tracking receipt. This helps avoid headaches if the I.R.S. says you did not file or were late. Such slip-ups, while rare, have happened.

PERSONAL GIFTS -- Those of more than $10,000 last year or $11,000 this year generally have gift tax consequences. But if you pay tuition directly to a school for a grandchild, for example, or pay an elderly relative's medical costs directly, there is no gift tax consequence, regardless of the amount, Mr. Kess said.

LOOKING AHEAD -- "After Dec. 31, you are limited in what you can do" to lower the year's tax liabilities, Mr. Luchs said, so he suggests putting a note on the calendar for next November, to "see if it makes sense to defer or accelerate income," make any securities trades or do any other year-end maneuvers. Many strategies will be listed on his firm's Web site, www.bdo.com.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Why a Scandal Became a Spectacle

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE Enron scandal, which began with transactions complex enough to make an accountant's eyes glaze over, has by now morphed into something more: an American-style cultural spectacle, complete with Congressional hearings, movie rights and memorabilia available on E-Bay (see Page 4).
 But Enron is more than fodder for radio talk shows and late-night comedy routines. Its collapse was unsettling in a way that seized and continues to hold the nation's attention. 
 Ultimately, say analysts and commentators from a variety of disciplines, the public fascination with Enron expresses an anxiety over whether the trust people place in their employers, political leaders,and even capitalism as it is currently practiced, is misplaced.
Other relatively recent high-profile cases of financial malfeasance, like Michael R. Milken's manipulation of junk bonds or the failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan under Charles H. Keating Jr., generated headlines and plenty of commentary, but there was never a sense that the average person cared that much, beyond the soap-operatic pleasure of following the doings of the rich and unscrupulous. 
Enron's demise, however, is the first morality play of the post-boom era. 
"One of the reasons scandals have become so important in our societies today is because they impinge upon the forms of trust which underpin social relations and institutions," said John B. Thompson, who teaches sociology at Cambridge University and is the author of "Political Scandal: Power and Visibility in the Media Age."
"The Enron scandal makes them realize how fragile this trust is, and how much they stand to lose if and when this trust is betrayed," Mr. Thompson said. "And unlike the savings and loan scandal, which was difficult for ordinary people to understand and relate to personally, the Enron scandal can be easily translated into the language of the greed of corporate bosses and the losses suffered by ordinary individuals."
In the most general sense, the Enron debacle is about whether we as employees, investors, consumers and voters were suckered into buying a boom-time vision of new business paradigms, one-way stock prices and pain-free choices -- only to find, after the economy turned, that much of the promise was a fantasy, if not a fraud. 
"It's a case where the rich guy took the upside and stuffed the poor guy with the downside," said Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pimco, an investment firm. "And it exposed genuine economic uncertainty among people: if it could happen there, then maybe some of the other supposed icons of capitalism were not as robust and enduring as people had thought." 
Enron, Mr. McCulley said, is a reminder that market-based economies are inherently volatile -- something many people had forgotten after a 10-year business expansion, the longest on record. 
Indeed, part of what gives the story of Enron its power is the timing. The end of the 1990's boom could be dated as far back as March 2000, when the Nasdaq began its tumble and many dot-coms were exposed as empty vessels. But with few other signs of deterioration, the nation remained at least partly in denial through that year and into last year. 
The consensus through last summer was that the expansion had slowed but not expired and that its bounty -- most notably the huge projected federal budget surplus -- remained intact.
AFTER Sept. 11, confidence and optimism waned. And then, as if to confirm that an era had ended, the nation's seventh-largest company, one that had reinvented itself using the tools of the moment -- technology, faith in markets, canny lobbying and an ability to exploit deregulation to create new businesses -- went poof.
"If the crash of Enron had happened at the peak of the business cycle, it would not have had the same effect on the psyche," said Laura Tyson, dean of the London Business School. "It was 2001 before people accepted that the business cycle was not dead. This happened at the moment of acceptance, and it's become emblematic."
The saga was distinguished by two other factors as well. More than anything, it had victims, lots of them, average people who woke up one day to find that their jobs and retirement savings had disappeared. And that sent shivers down the spines of the new investor class, the millions of working people who had begun buying stocks through mutual funds and 401(k) plans during the previous decade.
Worse, the guys in the executive suite seemed to make out just fine, suggesting that the real legacy of the 90's boom was that the rich got richer, while everyone else was left holding the bag.
Intensifying business competition and the brutal judgments of global financial markets "created a sense that capitalism in the United States was becoming more of an affair that benefits just a few at the expense of the masses," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
There was some justification for that feeling. True, most people did well during the long expansion. Unemployment fell to three-decade lows, helping to bring many people into the world of work for the first time and making an early success of the new limits on welfare. Incomes rose; household wealth shot up.
In fact, Enron aside, much of what was good about the boom appears to have been for real, including the application of technology in a way that has made the economy fundamentally more efficient and productive.
But a relative few did much better than everyone else. Income inequality widened through the late 1990's, if not beyond. 
And now that evidence of fraud has been added to a sense of inequity, there has been a populist-style reaction that is already reworking the businessman-as-hero image of the 1990's back into the more familiar one of businessman-as-villain. 
"What we saw was that besides the fact that people at the top get a very large reward for innovation and risk taking, they sometimes cheat," said Alice M. Rivlin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. "The relationship between these two problems is that people at the bottom get more and more disaffected."
DURING the presidential campaign in 2000, Al Gore tried, with only mixed success, to cast himself as a populist running against the powerful. With Enron to point to, Democrats are trying again to paint President Bush and the Republicans as tools of big business.
They do not seem, as yet, to be having a lot of success, no doubt in part because of Mr. Bush's spectacular wartime popularity. Conservatives have warned that reading too much into Enron's demise could stifle innovation and growth. 
Market forces may have been slow to react, conservatives say, but they ultimately dealt with Enron more harshly than any judge, regulatory agency or Congressional committee could have, cutting off the company's access to capital and effectively executing it.
Still, it is possible that Enron's downfall could lead to a reexamination of what kind of capitalism the country is most comfortable with. The swing toward unfettered market-based capitalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union could give way to a push toward some modest reregulation and more government scrutiny of some markets.
"The issue of unfettered capitalism and the distribution of the fruits of unfettered capitalism are the two dominant themes developing here," said Mr. McCulley. "We may be swinging back toward a system that is trying to blend the upside of capitalism and at the same time truncate a little bit its less favorable consequences."
Whether that happens depends to some degree on whether there are other Enrons out there. But if nothing else, we can probably look forward to "Enron: The Movie."

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING; 
One Year Later, Nascar's Discovery Rolls On

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
A year ago, before Dale Earnhardt crashed into the wall and died on the final lap of the Daytona 500, hard-core fans camping on the infield dirt waved Confederate battle flags superimposed with his grinning face. Bumper stickers on their pickup trucks proclaimed "Anybody but Jeff Gordon." Comedians among them hung menu boards advertising grilled fresh roadkill.
 Hours later, they were slumped, weeping, in a communal shocked grief I had last seen in Memphis after Elvis died. Would stock car racing be the same? Would the red clay fans drift away now that their signifying hero was gone; would the upscale fans, drawn to the TV network window, be turned off; would drivers lose their nerve after the death of an immortal; and, most important, would the new generation of sponsors fear for their brands? 
 Gentlemen, start your cash registers. The crowd keens but the pack drives on. 
Today's running of the Daytona 500 offers more prize money than ever and a fascinating field of emerging stars behind Gordon, the defending Winston Cup champion. His interpretation of the golden rule -- race me clean and I'll try not to bump you into the wall -- is slowly allowing hard-core fans to forgive his pretty face. 
There is Dale Earnhardt Jr., the sentimental favorite, who is able to straddle the old and new worlds. While Buck's Gun Rack here is still selling Junior's limited edition .22 Remington, the shooter himself is spending more time with his trigger finger on his computer mouse. He listens to far less country music than to Mary J. Blige or Nirvana. 
My own pick for the driver to watch is Tony Stewart, whose darkly surly suburban look -- think rumba teacher -- masks the intensity of an amazing athlete. Last year, for the second time, he drove in the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. 
Nascar has been discovered. The dramatic death of Earnhardt woke the national news media at the same time that a sagging interest in most other mainstream American sports allowed Nascar to slip into the moral vacuum with its own version of authenticity, however false it sometimes seems. 
This is the only major sport in which death and serious injury are not considered an aberration. Earnhardt's death reinforced that reality, which is clearly a major selling point. Yet it took that almost mythical death to create an official climate in which drivers finally did not feel unmanly wearing advanced safety equipment. Since Nascar did not mandate helmets, no wonder that a year ago only 20 percent of drivers wore the head and neck restraints that might have saved Earnhardt. Now most wear them. 
Not only has Nascar been overly deliberate in its precautionary measures, but it also has yet to clarify an early statement that made a torn seat belt a factor in Earnhardt's death. Bill Simpson, former owner of the company that manufactured that belt, the highly respected Simpson Performance Products, filed a defamation of character suit last week against Nascar. Simpson has said that he would not have filed it if Nascar had apologized.
Where else is commercialism so openly and honestly embraced and celebrated? But the market does not promise a level playing field. A sagging economy that has affected the sponsorship deals of several racing teams has also widened the gap between the haves and have-nots. All those logos make a car go faster. A rich sponsor can simply buy better equipment, personnel and testing time. Earnhardt Sr., who won seven championships, and Gordon, who has won four, had deep-pocket owners. 
There are no judges sitting on the sideline holding up numbered cards here; you can hear Nascar fans cackle. Yet the continual rules changing and the politicking for performance parity would be shocking even in the figure skating world. For example, in an attempt to make the Fords more competitive, Nascar recently trimmed the wind-resistant spoilers mounted on the back of the cars. It has been estimated that a quarter-inch trim can represent as much as a 7-horsepower boost, enough to make a pass and win. The Dodges, who claimed that their cars were unique, want their spoilers trimmed, too. Now they say their cars are just like the Fords. 
Just try to dredge up charges of racism, sexism or jingoism here. Not when most Nascar garages are almost 100 percent pale male American. Thirty-seven-year-old Shawna Robinson's qualifying makes her only the second woman to drive in the Daytona 500. Janet Guthrie did it in 1980.
The only African-American in a Nascar driver's seat, Bill Lester, is a 41-year-old rookie in the third-level truck series. Lester, a former Hewlett-Packard engineer, has a degree from the University of California. He got his ride through the Dodge Diversity program. 
There is a cheerfully politically incorrect sensibility around stock car racing -- the beer and the cigarettes add flavor -- which may be engaging to the new demographics that Nascar and its sponsors are trying to lure into the tent. In the same way that hip-hop musical styles and basketball appeal to white suburban boys, so do redneck musical styles and car racing appeal to the frat boys and their dates swarming to the speedways, or at least to the broadcasts. But you better believe it's not all style. 
"You know how I get my sister going?" a middle-aged fan asked me last week. "She loves Junior and when Jeff Gordon beat him yesterday, I said, 'How you feel, your man whipped by a gay?' She near went nuts!" 
He collapsed laughing. When he finally recovered, I asked him if Gordon's wife also knew he was gay. He sheepishly waved the question away and giggled. "It's just to get my sister going," he said. "Don't mean nothing."
That retrograde sensibility is not going to hold, not in an MTV world. A slick racing magazine, Last Lap, recently commissioned Lewis Franck to write "The Hunks of Nascar." Franck, whose racing articles are carried regularly by the Reuters news agency and by various international magazines, is known for his access to figures in Gearhead Nation and his evenhanded, precise reports. A lawyer, Franck was concerned that his subjects -- including Dale Jr., Elliott Sadler and Kevin Harvick -- might be put off by his atypically unserious approach. 
"They loved it," he said. "They couldn't wait to tell me about the bands they listened to, what games they had on their PlayStations. These are not guys who go hunting and fishing on their days off."
Franck squinted into the sunlight dazzling off a car hood and into the near future. He said, "You think there's a calendar in this?"

A Foul-Weather Bet Has a Following

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

 BODY:
COAL-MINING stocks are paying a price for their emergence from obscurity a year ago. They became an unlikely glamour sector during the harsh winter of 2001 and California's energy crisis, only to plummet when the weather improved and fears of imminent power shortages subsided.
 Yet even as stocks like Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, Consol Energy, Massey Energy and Canada's Fording Inc. languish well below their highs for the last year, some analysts and fund managers say investments in coal will be profitable over the long term. 
 "This may take a year or two to play out," said Scott Kuensell, managing director of Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del., which made its first foray into Arch Coal in 1999 and last year built up a 1.4 percent stake in Peabody, the nation's biggest coal producer. "Even on reduced earnings estimates, coal stocks look cheap to us," Mr. Kuensell said. "If you were taking your first look at coal today, you'd be quite interested." 
Daniel A. Roling, an analyst who covers the sector at Merrill Lynch, has reiterated "strong buy" recommendations for Peabody, Consol and Arch in recent weeks.
Still, coal stocks have been on a roller-coaster ride. They reached a peak last May, then slid through the summer until fears of supply constraints bolstered the sector last fall. The mood has soured again since Massey Energy, the fifth-biggest producer, warned in early January that a combination of mild weather, softening steel demand and the general economic recession was hurting the coal market. Bad weather is good for coal because it increases electricity demand for a variety of uses, including lighting and heating for offices and factories.
Despite the midyear dip, coal stocks were among the best performers on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, with the Dow Jones coal index still up 64 percent over all. But the stocks have retreated since Massey's profit warning. Peabody, which went public as the market crested last May, closed at $23.95 on Friday, down from a peak of $38.05, but still above its midsummer low of $22.20. 
"The outlook for coal is still very good," Mr. Roling said. "Utilities are saying, 'We want to dispatch the lowest-cost electricity,' and that's coal."
Still, many critics say coal-fired power plants generate enormous environmental problems, including air pollution and acid rain. "A lot of folks make the argument that the full cost of coal, in terms of the environment and health, is not being accounted for," said William Spratley, executive director of Green Energy Ohio, a nonprofit group based in Columbus, Ohio, that encourages greater use of renewable energy sources. "Where the coal industry is vulnerable is on new environmental requirements."
THE United States produces about 1.1 billion tons of coal a year from 1,400 mines, mostly in Appalachia and in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming. About 92 percent of production is used for power generation. The remainder is metallurgical, or coking, coal used in making steel.
Charles Linderman, director of energy policy at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the power generation industry, said the relative stability of the coal market, compared with other energy sources, especially natural gas, meant that "a number of us view the future of coal differently from its past."
The California energy crisis and the surge in natural gas prices in early 2001 underscored the two biggest advantages of coal -- a relatively stable price and security of supply.
The coal and electric utility industries say a cheaper fuel for large-scale power generation has yet to be found, and coal reserves in the United States are strong.
"You could triple the price of coal and not price it out of the market," Mr. Roling said. While fears of energy shortages lifted the price of coal last year, it moved far less than the price of natural gas.
During most of the 1990's, low prices and tightening environmental controls discouraged investment in new coal mines in the United States, especially in central Appalachia. The long decline of the eastern coal fields also led many miners to leave the industry.
Coal's share of the power generation market has changed little in recent years, standing at about 51 to 52 percent. But nuclear plants, which account for about 20 percent of power generation in the United States, are operating close to capacity, and the prospect of new ones starting soon is remote.
Natural gas units, which are relatively clean, have become popular in recent years. But gas plants are expensive to build and operate, and are relatively small, compared with coal and nuclear power stations.
According to Mr. Linderman, gas plants are used mainly to meet peak demand, leaving coal and nuclear power stations to do the heavy lifting of day-to-day supply. A typical coal plant generates 800 to 1,200 megawatts of electricity. The biggest gas-fired power stations have a capacity of about 750 megawatts.
The regulatory climate in Washington has become more favorable to coal under President Bush, given a new emphasis on American self-sufficiency in energy.
Mr. Bush's plan to combat global warming, unveiled this week, avoided mandatory targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other industries. Instead, Mr. Bush called for voluntary reductions. Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund called the plan "a valentine to the coal and oil industry."
Top federal regulators recently recommended informally that the White House relax regulations that require power plants to install new pollution control equipment when they upgrade operations. Coal and other energy producers say the rules impose billions of dollars in extra costs that block utilities from modernizing plants to make them more energy efficient.
"There is a sense that this administration is not anticoal, and this has encouraged some utilities to look at new coal plants," said Forrest Hill of Hill & Associates, a consulting firm in Annapolis, Md.
Mr. Spratley at Green Energy Ohio sees a combination of natural gas, renewable energy and coal filling future needs, including any shortfall caused by the decommissioning of nuclear plants.
Many coal mines capitalized on the energy scare last year by locking in a big portion of future production at high prices. Peabody has already sold 93 percent of its planned 2002 output and 66 percent of 2003 production. Massey, which has similar commitments from its customers, has predicted an average sales price of $31.50 to $32 a ton in 2002, up from $28 last year.
WITH these contracts already factored into share prices and spot prices still sliding, some investors see little to excite them for now. "Demand is down, inventories are up," said David Beard a New York hedge fund manager, who rode the coal wave last year by buying not only Arch and Massey, but also stocks of mining machinery, construction and railroad companies that stood to benefit from the coal renaissance. "The fundamentals are not that great." He sold his holdings in Arch and Massey last year after they reached his price targets.
Some investors are looking further ahead. "At this level, the valuations are really compelling," said Barnett Osman, a principal at Lexington Partners, a private equity fund manager and Peabody's biggest single shareholder, with a 6.7 percent stake. Lexington invested $50 million in Peabody in 1998; the stake's value is up 65 percent.
Normally, it would have taken its profits shortly after Peabody went public. But Mr. Osman sees Peabody's stock rising to $35 to $40, at least $11 above its current level. "I don't see a lot of downside risk," he said.

HEADLINE: The Fiber Optic Fantasy SlipsAway 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
ONLY a few years ago, the dream of striking it rich by transmitting Internet data and telephone calls across continents and under oceans, through endless ribbons of fiber optic cable, captivated one company after another. But rarely in economic history have so many people with so much money got it so wrong.
 Instead of a stampede of customers to fill up these fiber optic highways, the industry found itself with too many vacant lanes -- way too many. What had once seemed like a brilliant idea -- carriers' buying and selling future access on those fiber networks to meet expected customer demand -- became a swap meet unto itself, with its own peculiar bookkeeping. 
 As an element of the telecommunications meltdown that has come to light only recently, the market for fiber network access seems to have been an important common ingredient in the epidemic of accounting fiascos bursting out all over. Certainly, it played a major role in the unraveling of Global Crossing, which filed for bankruptcy protection last month. Fiber swaps hurt other big communications companies, like Qwest Communications International and Cable and Wireless. And they played roles in the cascading problems of Enron and Tyco International. 
Significantly, the Securities and Exchange Commission took a close look at the practices involved in fiber deals a few years ago and apparently did little to contain transactions that later became the basis for a vibrant swapping market. Now, though, the S.E.C. and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are taking a new look, searching for signs of accounting fraud. Investors and former employees of the companies laid low by fiber swaps probably wish the government had stepped in sooner. 
The S.E.C. has declined to comment on its previous or current look at Global Crossing. But its silence, together with copies of correspondence between the company and the commission obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by SEC Insight, a private research company in Plymouth, Minn., prompt a flurry of questions.
Among them are these: Did liberal use of such long-term capacity sales encourage the creation of an active swapping market? Did the S.E.C. accept Global Crossing's assertion of its accountants' independence without a fuss? More troubling, and perhaps hardest to answer: How can the telecommunications industry, now plagued by suspicions of sham transactions and accounting, right itself?
"There is no sector that illustrates creative destruction so effectively," said Howard Holme, president of Bandwidth Exchange, a capacity broker in Denver, referring to the theory of the economist Joseph A. Schumpeter that entrepreneurs generate innovation by rendering their predecessors' ideas obsolete.
There are few other industries aside from telecommunications that changed so quickly and produced so much confusion, Mr. Holme said.
Certainly, telecommunications is no stranger to turmoil after a meltdown at upstart carriers and established equipment makers resulted in the loss of more than 500,000 jobs worldwide in the last two years. Communications companies large and small are now in for an unexpected extension of this instability.
Among the most obvious candidates for closer scrutiny is Qwest, which said last week that it had received an S.E.C. subpoena demanding details of its dealings with Global Crossing. 
Qwest has been forced out of the short-term debt markets amid growing doubts about the legitimacy of off-balance-sheet transactions involving Global Crossing and other companies. Fortunately for Qwest, which is based in Denver, it can count on a stream of revenue from local phone operations in 14 states. 
The stress from the Global Crossing inquiry also extended to Europe, where Cable and Wireless of Britain and KPNQwest of the Netherlands came under pressure last week as investors questioned their use of swap transactions to show healthy revenue gains when little or no money was actually generated.
Roy L. Olofson, a former vice president for finance at Global Crossing, contends that the company misled investors by engaging in these swaps, in which the outgoing transfer of capacity was counted as revenue while the incoming capacity was considered a capital expense, making it seem as if the company's cash flow kept climbing from such deals.
In some of the deals, Global Crossing and its counterparts issued checks to each other in equal amounts, potentially allowing each to use the proceeds as an increase in revenue, according to Mr. Olofson's lawyer, Brian C. Lysaght. In other transactions, no money may have changed hands.
Qwest and Cable and Wireless are just two companies known to have done swaps of this type with Global Crossing. Other companies include Flag Telecom of Britain, China Netcom and Telecom New Zealand, according to people close to Global Crossing. Many other companies, including Tyco and WorldCom, used the same type of transaction to show growing revenue before the market for such transactions abruptly collapsed about the middle of last year.
The collapse was caused, in effect, by market forces. With the spot price of bandwidth down 90 percent and bound to fall further, it made no economic sense for carriers to make long-term leasing arrangements. 
Such complexity was much less common in the telecommunications world just five years ago, when big companies like AT&T, British Telecommunications and Deutsche Telekom dominated the business.
Long-distance phone calls were of decent quality but expensive. The Internet was not the big deal it is today. When the industry's titans ran short of capacity on their own systems or on crowded transoceanic cables, they hammered out deals with one another by swapping space on their networks.
THIS system worked fairly well, partly because it helped the companies avoid the need to raise additional money for the installation of cables across the Atlantic or the Pacific. That changed in 1997 with the creation of Global Crossing. It dreamed of profitably transmitting phone calls and Internet data across a 100,000-mile fiber optic network spanning more than two dozen countries. Companies like Level 3 Communications and 360networks quickly sprang up as rivals. 
There was no way the average investor could have known that Global Crossing's business model had come under scrutiny in June 2000, when the company's potential appeared almost as unlimited as that of the Internet itself. But on June 5 of that year, the S.E.C. began to take a close look at Global Crossing's books. 
Among the S.E.C.'s concerns were how Global Crossing accounted for capacity swaps and the independence of its auditor, Arthur Andersen. Global Crossing had recently hired as its executive vice president for finance Joseph Perrone, the Arthur Andersen executive in charge of auditing Global Crossing.
In fact, according to people close to Global Crossing, Mr. Perrone was already known at the company as co-author of a two-page memo dated Feb. 10, 1999, before his hiring, in which he recommended how to best account for capacity swaps. 
Among Mr. Perrone's suggestions in the memo, these people said, were to keep the contracts 60 days apart, apparently to avoid suspicion that the deals were reached merely to help each party meet its quarterly financial objectives, and to require each party to submit separate cash payments, apparently to create the look of a valid deal.
In its July 20, 2000, response to the S.E.C. query, Global Crossing made it clear that its accounting had been accepted by Arthur Andersen. Global Crossing also said it had based its long-term leases on an arcane interpretation of Statement 66, a rule for recognizing profit or loss from sales of real estate developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the group that sets accounting standards for business.
The S.E.C. apparently gave Global Crossing its blessing to proceed with the long-term leases of capacity on its network that eventually were the basis for the swaps the company made with Qwest and several other companies in 2000 and 2001. 
Global Crossing continues to deny that it has done anything wrong. And transactions by Global Crossing and others that have been called into question are based on a legitimate, longstanding practice in the telecom industry known as an I.R.U. sale.
I.R.U. stands for the indefeasible right to use a certain amount of bandwidth on a communications company's network. For instance, Company A might own a network that links Seattle and Chicago. Company B has customers in those two cities who want to communicate.
Company A might sell Company B the right to use 622 megabits of capacity on the Seattle-Chicago route for 25 years, meaning that Company B would have the right to transmit 622 million bits of digital information each second on that route. In exchange, Company B might write a check to Company A for $100 million.
Company A must now choose between two methods of accounting for the $100 million, both potentially legal. The more conservative path would be to record the $100 million as income gradually, over the life of the I.R.U. contract. If the contract were for 25 years, the company would record $4 million in revenue each year, or $1 million each quarter. Most well-established telecommunications companies, like AT&T, use the more conservative method.
The more aggressive method would be to record the $100 million as revenue all at once. Under certain circumstances, this method can fall within generally accepted accounting principles. Nonetheless, it is generally shunned. In fact, Qwest appears to be one of the only major companies to use it.
GLOBAL CROSSING essentially tried to have it both ways at once, and even then did not follow its own rules and may have misled investors, according to statements by Mr. Olofson.
In some cases, Global Crossing appeared to use the more conservative method in its formal revenue statements. Global Crossing, however, encouraged investors to focus not on its formal revenue statements but rather on an unofficial measure that it called "cash revenue." Many analysts and investors did just that.
It was in its cash revenue statements that Global Crossing often recorded all of its I.R.U. sales at once, helping the company meet its quarterly financial targets. In the first quarter of 2001, for instance, about one-third of Global Crossing's roughly $1.6 billion in cash revenue appeared to come from the upfront recognition of I.R.U. sales.
A result, according to Mr. Olofson, is that Global Crossing did not even follow its own rules for reporting cash revenue, rules that investors relied upon. Last year, Global Crossing recorded $150 million in cash revenue from a transaction in which it did not actually receive any cash, according to Mr. Olofson.
Among the company's partners in various reciprocal deals, EPIK and Qwest have publicly acknowledged working with Global Crossing. A Cable and Wireless spokesman said, "Certainly we have purchased capacity from Global Crossing, mainly capacity within Europe." He declined to specify the size of the deals. A spokesman for Flag declined to say whether his company had any dealings with Global Crossing. Calls to China Netcom and Telecom New Zealand were not returned.
As far as the other companies' accounting practices are concerned, EPIK has said that it uses the more conservative method, as has Flag. Cable and Wireless reports its results under the accounting standards of both Britain and the United States. Under British standards, the company often records I.R.U. sales all at once. Under American standards, the company says it spreads out those sales over the life of the various contracts. It is unclear how China Netcom and Telecom New Zealand report results.
WHERE will it all end? One clue may lie in the history of the nation's railroads, which are often compared to relatively young fiber optic systems. Some fiber optic operators, like Qwest, even got their start by laying fiber along existing rail lines.
By now it is almost forgotten that railroad companies expanded with ferocity in a post-Civil War boom that resulted in a spectacular financial collapse called the Panic of 1873. Many small investors were burned by the scandalous activities of concerns like Union Pacific Railroad, which, like Global Crossing, stretched the boundaries of corporate behavior in its day.
But eventually, as true believers of the fiber optic age are quick to point out, the glut of unused railway capacity was absorbed.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Money & Business last Sunday about accounting by Global Crossing, the telecommunications company, for the sale and purchase of fiber optic cable capacity misstated the equivalent practices at Tyco International and WorldCom. Tyco recorded the money received as deferred revenue. WorldCom accounted for it as an asset sale. Neither company used the sales to show increased revenue on its income statements.

July 18, 1999Qwest and Global Crossing agree not to fight. Qwest gets US West and Global Crossing takes Frontier. June 5, 2000The Securities and Exchange Commission asks for information on 185 points of accounting and disclosure from Global Crossing. June 14, 2000The company responds to the S.E.C. request. July 10, 2000The S.E.C. asks the company for more information. July 20, 2000Global Crossing sends the S.E.C. the information and says its accounting was certified by Arthur Andersen. Aug. 1, 2000The S.E.C. questions the independence of Arthur Andersen. Jan. 28, 2002The company files for bankruptcy protection. Feb. 8, 2002Global Crossing tells the public about the S.E.C. investigation. Feb. 11, 2002The investigation widens to include dealings with Qwest. (Sources: Bloomberg Financial Markets; Bandwidth Market; SEC Insight)(pg. 7) Chart: "How Network Capacity Was Traded . . ."Telecommunications companies that wanted to provide fiber optic service in areas where they did not have coverage said they traded the right to use some of their high-speed, or broadband, capacity for the right to use other companies' cables. Here is how they said it worked. COMPANY AOwned transcontinental fiber optic cable, but wanted to carry broadband signals across the Atlantic. COMPANY BOwned trans-Atlantic fiber optic cable, but wanted to carry broadband signals across the United States. The two companies agreed to swap some of their capacity. In the swap, each company granted the other the right to use some of its fiber optic cables, usually for a period of 15 to 25 years. Because the trans-Atlantic cables are more expensive to lay, theoretically, Company B gave Company A less capacity than it received in return. . . . And How It Was Accounted For Trading broadband capacity can be accounted for in different ways. One method is conservative. Two others are more aggressive. METHOD 1: As an asset swapThe most conservative method, it treats the swap as an exchange of assets that does not affect a company's income statement. METHOD 2: As a leaseThis aggressive method treats the swap as two unrelated agreements by the companies to lease capacity on each other's cables. The value of the leases, in the form of revenue, can be included in the companies' financial statements each year, adding to operating income. METHOD 3: As a saleThis method, even more aggressive, treats the swap as two unrelated sales by the companies involved. In this case, a company adds up the value of the leased cable over the term of the agreement and counts it as a sale in the first year of the agreement. (Source: Bandwidth Market)(pg. 7)

HEADLINE: POLITICS; 
Indian Point As Backdrop

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
THE small hamlet of Buchanan has become a popular news conference locale in recent months. Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, there has been broad public debate about whether the Indian Point nuclear power plant there is a target for terrorism.
 Showing at the plant has promised plenty of news coverage, and many politicians have taken the plant's officials to task over various issues, including shutting the plant down. But more and more plant supporters are now accusing politicians of jumping on the Indian Point bandwagon and exploiting the issue for their own political gain. 
 Central in this backlash is Gavin J. Donohue, executive director of the Independent Power Producers of New York. Mr. Donohue has accused politicians of using the plant as a news conference backdrop and "inducing hysteria and fear in residents."
Mr. Donohue, whose trade association represents electric generators and marketers, contended that "these politicians know very little about a complex issue" but have simply seized upon it to get themselves some camera time. He called their calls to shut down Indian Point permanently "a self-serving attempt to take advantage of Sept. 11 by manipulating the fears of Westchester residents."
"It's political opportunism by politicians who don't know the impact of such a decision," said Mr. Donohue. Closing the plant, he contended, would increase electric rates for residents by 40 percent and cost more than 1,500 jobs. It would also delete a tax base of $45 million and $356 million in payroll and expenditures that the plant adds to the local economy, he said, and overtax the state's electric system.
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Charles E. Schumer have appeared in front of Indian Point. So have Representatives Nita M. Lowey and Eliot L. Engel, both of whom have advocated closing or decommissioning the plant.
Elizabeth G. Stanley, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lowey said that most of the congresswoman's meetings and events for Indian Point have not been media events. "Congresswoman Lowey has been working for years on Indian Point safety issues," she said. "She spent many months of careful consideration before arriving at her decision to call for a gradual decommission."
Representative Engel was more blunt about being accused of political grandstanding.
"If being concerned about the safety of 20 million people is grandstanding, then count me in," he said. "No one ever thought two planes would crash into the World Trade Center, but they did. Sept. 11 has taught us we need to be prepared for anything."
Indian Point supporters also complain that anti-nuclear activists who for years have wanted the plant closed are now using the security issue to achieve their longtime goal.
Larry Gottlieb, a spokesman for the Entergy Corporation, the company that owns Indian Point, said some elected officials had indeed educated themselves about Indian Point, "but those who call the site a terrorist threat, just don't have a firm grasp on the issues.
"At some point, it gets to be a political stunt and not a healthy dialogue," said Mr. Gottlieb, who asserted that Entergy has more than adequately addressed security issues. "They're using it for political gain, and when you ask them for a viable solution, they don't have answers."
Entergy has begun to wage an aggressive campaign assuring the public that the plant is safe, including placing full-page advertisements in newspapers.
Many Indian Point employees have also joined the fray. Several hundred Indian Point workers and supporters held a rally earlier this month to oppose shutting the plant.
In an interview this week, Jerry Waters, vice president for Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which represents about 700 workers at Indian Point, accused politicians of "seizing upon the heightened fears of local residents."
Mr. Waters criticized Andrew M. Cuomo, who at a Feb. 4 news conference in front of the plant, said that it should be shut down. Mr. Waters accused Mr. Cuomo, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, of using the issue to get exposure for his campaign.
"It's purely politics and opportunism," he said. "Andy Cuomo wants to be governor and get Westchester behind him. If our workers thought their lives were in any danger, they'd be the first ones to complain."
Josh Isay, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, dismissed the criticism. "Secretary Cuomo lives in Westchester and has three young children in Westchester," he said. "He understands firsthand the concerns of residents and the need to put safety first."
Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat who represents the area in the State Assembly, contended that some groups in the power industry have begun to lash out "because they're beginning to lose control of the debate, now that the people have taken control."
Mr. Brodsky, who has criticized Indian Point over various issues, said that political pressure is crucial in getting Entergy to take the public's concerns seriously.
"This not a soccer mom issue," he said. "This is a life and death issue and has to be treated that way."
Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Senator Clinton, scoffed at charges of political grandstanding, adding that "Senator Clinton does not need more publicity."
"Senator Clinton not only lives in Westchester but represents millions of people near the power plant and is concerned for their security," she said. "It is the job of federal officials to fight for the safety and security of their constituents, especially at a time when we know that power plants are terrorist targets."

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
IN sporting jargon, the Big Mo, meaning momentum, is defined as that intangible "X" factor that emerges in a game and propels one contestant exorably toward victory.
 A year ago the momentum seemed to be with Newark, New Jersey's largest city, in its quest for a new arena to house the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils. For one thing, the combined ownership of the teams, the YankeeNets, wanted passionately to move to Newark from the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands of Bergen County and was willing to put up some cash to seal the deal. 
 Equally significant was the fact that, after long resistance, Gov. Christie Todd Whitman, and her successor, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco, both Republicans, were finally embracing the idea of some state backing for the project with considerable enthusiasm. This gave an uncommon boost to redevelopment in an overwhelmingly Democratic city from powerful leaders whose party was generally viewed as sympathetic to suburban areas and downright hostile to urban areas. 
If that weren't enough, months before, James E. McGreevey, who was then front runner in the Democratic race for governor, had been chairman of a conference at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center that focused on the benefits of the arena for Newark. He said a McGreevey administration would unequivocally support the proposal. That support became even more solidified several months later when Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, brought together a number of Essex County Democrats to deflate a trial balloon by Senator Robert Torricelli, who was threatening to run for governor race against Mr. McGreevey.
What a difference a year makes.
All of this momentum has seemingly vanished. Now when arena supporters talk of the proposal they favor the jargon of theology where the key word is faith, which has been defined as "the evidence of things hoped for, the proof of things unseen."
Few are prepared to write off the proposal. But many, including Jerome Gottesman, the president and chief executive officer of Edison Properties, are concerned that the city's redevelopment hopes might be run aground by the faltering economy.
"I hear positive things about what Governor McGreevey is working on, but I think perhaps the recession is the worst problem for Newark rather than a lack of a start to date on the arena," said Mr. Gottesman, whose company has extensive holdings in real estate and parking lots in Newark and elsewhere in the metropolitan area. "In the end Newark competes with Manhattan, and after Sept. 11 there is so much space empty downtown and will be in the future that Newark will have difficulty producing new buildings that will be economically viable."
Dennis E. Gale, executive director of the Joseph C. Cornwall Center for Metropolitan Studies at Rutgers University in Newark, said the slowdown was all the more sad because "the arena had been so close that the city could taste it."
Lawrence Goldman, the president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, one of the city's key redevelopment projects, conceded that momentum was important for projects such as the arena. But he believes the momentum is still there, noting that the arc of history of any great urban redevelopment project was a long one.
"The power of the arena idea is so great that it will easily survive the economic cycles, current budget problems and changes in political leadership," he said.
With Mr. DiFrancesco gone from the scene, also gone are the political deals that he had worked out for other parts of the state to make the Newark arena palatable to a Republican-controlled state legislature. Gone too is the complex financing plan that Lewis Eisenberg put together for the proposed $355 million arena.
And after winning last November, Mr. McGreevey found himself facing a budget crisis and an economic downturn that threatens to constrict state revenues for years. While he continued to voice support for the idea of a Newark arena, he seemed unwilling to allow the lame-duck Legislature to approve an arena financing plan or to put forward his own plan.
The new governor, once he took office, focused on closing a budget gap of $2.9 billion rather than on new initiatives. He pronounced the financing plan developed by his predecessor unworkable and tapped Anthony Coscia, the chairman of the Economic Development Authority. Last week Mr. Coscia, fresh from helping Mr. McGreevey develop his plan to close the state budget gap, said he was now turning his whole attention to the arena issue.
"The governor is still committed to finding a way to develop the arena in Newark and he would now like to see it as part of a larger redevelopment package for the city, which goes beyond the arena area itself," said Mr. Coscia, adding that many had doubts about the previous plan's ability to generate enough revenue to pay off what would have to be borrowed as well as to spread redevelopment to the city's neighborhoods. "We want the impact of the arena to reach the city's neighborhoods and communities and I realize that is a difficult thing to do, especially in a budget crisis."
Mr. Coscia also said that Mr. McGreevey believed that any new Newark arena would have to be linked to some plan for future redevelopment of the Meadowlands and the Continental Airlines Arena site. But the Democratic administration is known to be cool to Mr. DiFrancesco's proposal to create a Disney World-type entertainment, sports and retail complex on the Meadowlands site, a plan that carried with it almost $1 billion worth of transportation and other kinds of enhancements for the Bergen County area.
"You want to minimize the political fallout as a result of the move from the Meadowlands," said State Senator Richard Codey, the Democrat leader of the evenly split state senate and a strong supporter of the arena. "I want to see it done, the Governor wants to see it done. But we are all mindful that we have to do it without tax money."
In an election year Mayor James would like to have a completed arena deal to help him with voters and as a return on all of the political capital he has invested in Mr. McGreevey.
Last month Mr. McGreevey, in what some saw as a clumsy attempt to reassure Mr. James and Newark of his continuing support for the arena, suggested that with a Sharpe James re-election the city would have an arena. But there were no specifics.
Mr. James did not respond to requests to comment on the pace of efforts to get the arena, but others lauded his patience.
"My guess is that Sharpe James has to bite his tongue every day," said Mr. Gale of the Cornwall Center. "He would love to move this ball forward and wear the arena on his lapel, but he can't do that. The mayor of another city in New Jersey can't be seen to be pushing the state during the biggest budget crunch in the state's history, so he has to bide his time." 
Mr. Codey suggested that Mayor James would not be hurt if the governor did not come up with an arena plan that could win approval before the May 14 election in which the four-term incumbent is facing Councilman Cory Booker.
"Of course Sharpe James wants to be able to seal the deal before the second week in May, and I think it is important, too," said Mr. Codey. "But it's not make or break for him. He has a track record as mayor and people will vote on that track record."

Big Returns, Minus the Pleasantries

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
HE is known as secretive, controlling and so impatient for success and obsessed with work that some who know him say he takes little note of people unless he needs them.
 Warm and fuzzy Edward S. Lampert is not. But that has not seemed to matter. Mr. Lampert, a 39-year-old money manager, has scored an extraordinary 14-year record of value investing, with an average annual return of 24.5 percent. The 2001 performance of the ESL Partnerships, a group of hedge funds he controls, was particularly stunning: it soared 66 percent as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 13 percent. Even after the typically high hedge fund fees, his investors had a 53 percent return. 
 He has attracted a host of superwealthy clients over the last decade, including David Geffen, the media mogul; Thomas J. Tisch, a son of Laurence Tisch, the co-chairman of the Loews Corporation; Michael S. Dell of Dell Computer; and Ziff Brothers Investments, the principals of which are the sons of the publisher William B. Ziff Jr. 
"Eddie is probably the best single money manager of his generation, but he has never thought that a great bedside manner in investing was the No. 1 thing," said Richard Rainwater, the Texas financier. In fact, Mr. Rainwater, one of his first big backers, had his own run-in with Mr. Lampert years ago.
Mr. Lampert is dismissive of the criticism. "Our focus has been first and foremost on earning returns for our partners," he said.
His dazzling returns have come from a high-wire act of intensely heavy concentration in a handful of companies and of betting for the longer term. Currently, 85 percent of the $5 billion that ESL invests is in just eight companies. He has avoided Internet stocks and other fads over the years and has instead sought holdings in more mundane companies like AutoZone, a car parts retailer, and the Deluxe Corporation, a check-printing and electronic payment services concern. During the 1990's, his fund made killings in American Express and I.B.M.
Because of such heavy concentration, poor performance of a single stock can drag down total returns, and selling out of such illiquid positions can be tough. But, he said, "If you have just 10 names and one blows up, you have less risk than if you are highly leveraged and you don't really understand the other companies well."
Clearly, he has made it work. Since he started his fund business in 1988, he has had returns there that are nearly double the 13 percent of the S.& P. 500, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times.
"There are very few investors who have done that over time," said Jeffrey Tarrant, the founder and an advisory board member of Altvest, which tracks hedge funds.
Even last year, when short-selling funds did well in a falling market, his returns came from plain-vanilla, long-term investing, though his hedge fund can go short, or bet on market declines. In 2001, ESL trounced the CSFB Tremont hedge fund long/short equity index, which fell 3.65 percent.
IN the tightknit world of money managers to the superrich, Mr. Lampert is watched closely but is hard to follow. Until he has to file public documents after acquiring more than 5 percent of a company, he is reluctant to share information with even some of his highest-profile investors, like Mr. Tisch and Mr. Geffen.
That is noteworthy, given that both are longtime investors, that Mr. Tisch is a friend as well, and that Mr. Geffen's $200 million investment in 1992 helped put Mr. Lampert on the money management map.
In an interview in his low-key suite of offices in Greenwich, Conn., where he works with a staff of 15, Mr. Lampert said: "I tell people in advance what our practices are. If they don't like those practices, they have a choice not to invest." He is extremely proud of -- some say arrogant about -- his track record, which he likens to that of the basketball superstar Michael Jordan. "People keep criticizing him," Mr. Lampert said, "but he keeps winning."
For the privilege of riding along, ESL investors are asked to put up at least $10 million. They must pay a 1 percent management fee and 20 percent of profits -- standard requirements for hedge funds, those investment vehicles for institutions and the superwealthy. They must also agree to lock up their money for at least five years -- a highly unusual requirement. Most hedge funds allow annual withdrawals.
The lockup provision has discouraged several foundations from putting money into ESL, according to one hedge fund manager who serves on some foundation boards. But it has not deterred a host of sophisticated investors. "You know your money is tucked in safe every night," Mr. Tisch said. "You know it isn't chasing some silliness. He's investing with solid, proven principles."
The five-year lockup "gives us time to build and to exit a position without having to worry about investors forcing liquidations," Mr. Lampert said. ESL has kept its most profitable holdings an average of four years, qualifying them as long-term gains for tax purposes.
Mr. Lampert began requiring the lockup after his only down year: in 1990, investors lost 16 percent. Mr. Lampert had bought stock in the middle of the year, though by December the market had plunged. "It was terrible," he recalled. But for investors who stayed, the fund soared 56 percent in 1991. That underscored for him the value of having capital locked up through weak periods. 
AutoZone was the big payoff last year. It also reflects another of his tactics -- an increasingly active role in companies in which he invests. Attracted by AutoZone's cash flows, brand name and low profile on Wall Street, he began acquiring shares in 1997. For two years, the stock barely budged, but Mr. Lampert kept buying. In mid-1999, James Hedges IV, a hedge fund consultant and a mutual friend of Mr. Lampert and AutoZone's founder, Joseph Hyde III, arranged for them to meet.
Mr. Hyde recalls vividly the lunch at his 600-acre ranch, WildCat, in Aspen, Colo. "He had visited our stores, talked to management up and down the line and knew everything -- far more than most money managers," Mr. Hyde recalled. "Most investors talk to management and that's it. But he had a fanatical awareness of the company."
(The scrutiny continues: A report sent to shareholders in 2001 states that ESL employees had visited or spoken with people at 690 of the more than 3,000 AutoZone stores.)
In 1999, Mr. Lampert, who then owned about 15 percent of AutoZone stock, also gained a seat on the board. He believes that board membership allows him to participate in discussions of important decisions. 
A year later, the board put in a poison-pill provision that would have been set off had he increased his stake. He fought it, and the board backed down. The poison pill was rescinded and the chief executive, John C. Adams, resigned. Mr. Lampert led the committee that in early 2001 brought in Steve Odland, an executive at Ahold USA, the subsidiary of the Dutch company. Under Mr. Odland, AutoZone increased its gross margins by two percentage points in the most recent quarter, ended Nov. 30.
For most of last year, ESL had 30 million shares of AutoZone, or 27.8 percent of the company. In that time, the stock more than doubled in value.
THERE have been disappointments, too. For example, Mr. Lampert holds 12 percent of Payless ShoeSource, the shoe retailer. Its stock fell from $70.75 a share at the end of 2000 to $56.15 at the end of 2001, dragging down Mr. Lampert's investment by 20.6 percent, to $153 million. The shares closed at $56.94 on Friday.
A small investment in the ANC Rental Corporation, the parent of Alamo Rent-a-Car and National Car Rental, ended badly when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November.
The son of a lawyer and a homemaker, Mr. Lampert grew up in Roslyn, N.Y., on Long Island. The family lived in middle-class comfort until he was 14, when his father died of a heart attack. Mr. Lampert says the death put financial pressure on the family and is partly responsible for his relentless drive for financial security.
He became interested in investing during visits to his grandmother's home in Miami, where they would study the stock market together. "She owned a handful of stocks," he recalled. "I.B.M. and AT&T. She always wanted a good dividend. In her simplicity, she was profound."
Mr. Lampert said his grandmother, who did not have much money, invested as a hobby. "I thought she was good," he said, "but I never calculated her returns."
At Yale, he majored in economics, and, contrary to his mother's wishes, he decided to skip law school.
Early on, he showed great skill at cultivating powerful people who could help him move ahead in the elite world of finance. One story, in particular, has long made the rounds. While at Yale, he managed to snare a summer job at Goldman Sachs, and pursued an acquaintance with Robert E. Rubin, then head of risk arbitrage there. One day, Mr. Lampert offered to help carry his heavy briefcases to a rental car, gaining the ear of his quarry. He ultimately landed a job in the risk arbitrage department.
In a recent phone interview, Mr. Rubin, who later became Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and is now chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, said he did not remember the incident but did not dispute it. He said he did recall thinking: "Eddie will go out on his own one day. He won't stay at Goldman Sachs."
Though some associates regarded such efforts by Mr. Lampert to parlay connections into cash as distasteful, Mr. Lampert counters: "I want to be with people who can challenge me to be better."
It was while he was at Goldman that Mr. Lampert met Mr. Rainwater, famous in the investment world for managing the Bass brothers' fortune through the early 1980's. He and Mr. Rainwater were introduced by mutual friends on Nantucket in 1987, and Mr. Lampert made sure to stay in touch.
In 1988, he left Goldman to work with Mr. Rainwater. His drive was evident. Over the summer, again on Nantucket, Mr. Lampert almost never left Mr. Rainwater's house, Mr. Rainwater recalled. "He slept in the room, ate in the room, never went to the beach, never saw the beach," Mr. Rainwater said. "I don't think he ever went out to dinner with us."
Mr. Rainwater backed his protege by putting up the bulk of the $28 million in Mr. Lampert's first fund, which the young investor ran from Mr. Rainwater's Fort Worth office. Mr. Lampert was focusing on risk arbitrage and value investing. But after just a year, the strong-willed men clashed when Mr. Lampert wanted more control over what types of investments he could make. At the time, associates say, the parting was extremely acrimonious, and Mr. Rainwater withdrew his money. 
In 1992, after a few more years of working in Texas, Mr. Lampert moved to Greenwich, at the urging of Mr. Geffen, whom he had met through Mr. Rainwater. "David told me I needed to get a life," he recalled.
But Mr. Lampert's obsessions went with him. According to several people who have worked with him, he still works nonstop and makes all the decisions himself. One former employee said, "Even if you presented a research report and he could not punch holes in it, he would not buy it."
Mr. Lampert concedes the point. "Most of the ideas come from me," he said. "I am the only person who has the ability to allocate capital."
He also exercises very tight control over compensation, a former employee said. "You were expected to work hard to make him rich," he said. "Bonuses were discretionary and Eddie was pretty moody, so you never knew how you would come out."
Mr. Lampert seems to have come out fine. Though he declined to discuss his personal finances, several people who know him say he is worth $700 million or more. He has a home in Aspen and a sprawling estate in Greenwich, where he and his wife, Kinga Lampert, were married last summer.
Several hedge fund managers say the compensation arrangements for members of his staff are a bit controlling, but Mr. Lampert says they are more than fair. While employees are not pressured to invest in the fund, "they were just prohibited from investing anywhere else," he said. That, he said, could work to their interest. 
Employees are not the only ones who can be put off by his style. One veteran money manager described a social lunch several years ago: "He picked my brain on stocks, but offered nothing. The next time, I decided to talk about fishing until he offered something. So we never got past fishing."
EVEN had Mr. Lampert been forthcoming, his investment strategy might have sounded deceptively simple: sticking to the basics. Because he tends to take large positions, each stock decision is crucial.
He studied the Internet but avoided the sector despite its wild run-up: "Most businesses, as they grow, have a model where they make more money as they get more customers. Internet companies seemed to lose more money as that happened."
He also does not like what he calls "the vision thing." "Average investors like themes," he said. "A lot of times you pay a high price for the vision, and you can lose 80 percent of your money."
Mr. Lampert also shies away from capital-intensive businesses. He says he believes that Intel, the computer chip maker, "is a terrific business, but for it to exist, it has to keep feeding more and more money in, and it needs to be right when it does it."
"If it is wrong," he added, "that will be a huge problem."
He doesn't like convoluted financial statements. Even when Enron was soaring, Mr. Lampert said, he was not interested. "Complex financials don't necessarily mean there is something wrong," he said. "But if you don't have a clue, why invest?"
Grandma would have been proud.

 BODY:
 AFGHANISTAN -- Episodes of violence and chaos erupted in Kabul. In the most telling, the interim government's aviation and tourism minister was killed. Early accounts said he had been pulled from a plane at the airport and bludgeoned by hundreds of Muslim pilgrims enraged by a two-day delay in their departure for Mecca. But then Hamid Karzai, the government's leader, said the killing had been engineered by a group of senior officials, including his new intelligence chief: clear evidence that old ethnic and tribal enmities could remain powerful enough to destroy the fragile government.
 With Taliban misinformation a thing of the past, and journalists and aid workers more free to circulate within the country, it is clear that the civilian death toll is certainly in the hundreds and might rise into the thousands. And questions continue to arise from credible reports of possibly misdirected United States airstrikes, only a few of which are being investigated by the military. A messy war, after all, Page 3. 
Efforts to rebuild Afghanistan continue. An $11.5 million grant by the United States Agency for International Development is literally seed money, paying for teams of scientists to deliver 3,850 tons of seed, meant to grow more seed, for dozens of crop varieties that thrive in the region's varied climate. Another 11,000 tons, mainly wheat, corn, barley and other grains, will be sent in the fall for a spring seed harvest. And President Bush said a Peace Corps team would arrive within weeks.

IRAQ -- The Bush administration toughened its stance on Iraq, with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell saying it was considering a variety of options to secure a "regime change," amid indications that President Bush and his top advisers are close to settling on a plan to oust Saddam Hussein. But the White House's increasingly hawkish mood prompted mounting criticism from European allies worried about an unreasonable expansion in the war on terror. Looking post-Hussein, Page 1.

THE ABDUCTED REPORTER -- Ahmed Omar Sheikh admitted under questioning by Pakistani authorities that he participated in the Jan. 23 abduction of Daniel Pearl of The Wall Street Journal. At first, he said that Mr. Pearl was alive, but a few days later said he was dead, a claim that Pakistani officials dismissed. The Pakistani police were searching for an accomplice.

THE ACCUSED -- John Walker Lindh, the Californian found fighting with the Taliban, pleaded not guilty to charges that included conspiring to kill Americans and aiding terrorist groups. His trial was set for Aug. 28 in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va.
The only major suspect held outside the United States in direct connection with the Sept. 11 attacks, an Algerian pilot named Lotfi Raissi, was freed on bail in Britain as the case against him dissolved for lack of evidence. He had been arrested five months ago on suspicion of training the man who flew the hijacked plane that smashed into the Pentagon. 

MIDEAST -- A little over a month after a seized shipload of arms raised fears that the Palestinians intended to bring heavier weapons to bear in their intifada, the Palestinians fired two Hamas-made Qassam-2 rockets toward Israeli settlements in the West Bank. They hurt no one. Israel quickly retaliated, with a sweeping incursion into three towns and a refugee camp in the West Bank during which five Palestinians were killed and many suspected militants arrested.
Then, an Israeli tank responding to a bomb and gunfire attack on a settlers' convoy in the Gaza Strip rolled over a mine. It exploded, destroying the tank and killing three soldiers inside. It was an unprecedented loss for Israel, which depends on armored vehicles to patrol the occupied territories. Israel, which has bitter memories of its long, militarized war with Lebanon, said the Palestinians were moving into conventional warfare and sent F-16 warplanes to bomb a Palestinian police compound about three miles north of Gaza City, killing one Palestinian and injuring 30. 

DOMESTIC -- The F.B.I. issued its most specific security alert since Sept. 11, warning of a possible attack "on or around Feb. 12" in the United States or Yemen and naming 17 possible suspects, at least some of whom were believed to be members of Al Qaeda. Later in the week, as tensions lightened somewhat, the F.B.I. dropped six of the named suspects after learning that they had been in custody in Yemen at the time of the alert. The bureau continued to seek Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei, a Yemeni born in Saudi Arabia in 1979, who they believe is the ringleader of the group. ANDREA KANNAPELL

HEADLINE: Bush Starts Trip Today to Much Less Formidable Japan 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Mitsuo Nozawa's skill at selling elevators has not changed. But his salary has. 
 Mr. Nozawa, a gregarious salesman fired last month by a multinational elevator manufacturer, has bounced back, using his contacts to line up a job for next month. The work will be the same, but his annual pay will be $45,000, only two-thirds of what he has earned annually in the last decade. 
 "That's the reality now -- it is impossible to earn more salary than at your former job," said Mr. Nozawa, 55, tapping for emphasis on a recent copy of a 500-page weekly magazine that lists job openings. Recalling Japan's boom years, he added: "During the bubble years, the market was controlled by the workers. Now the market is controlled by the employers."
More than an anecdote, Mr. Nozawa's story indicates a trend. In a recent survey, 70 percent of Japanese executives polled by the Kyodo News agency said they planned to cut salaries this year. On the labor side, Rengo, the Japanese trade union federation, has said that for the first time since World War II, it will accept wage cuts in exchange for job security in spring wage negotiations.
The Japan of recession and retrenchment that President Bush will visit on Sunday is vastly different from the Japan of self-confidence and invincibility that his father visited as president in January 1992.
A decade ago, American businessmen were poring over Japanese management manuals, American factory workers were bristling at condescending remarks by Japanese leaders, and Japanese finance officials were lecturing President George Bush about his economic recession and daunting budget deficit.
This time the lectures will be from the Americans. From the supermen of a decade ago, Japanese officials are now seen as the world's slow-learning schoolboys, greeted by lectures at every turn, most recently at the World Economic Forum in New York and a meeting in Ottawa of finance ministers. 
Japan's public debt is rising like a hot-air balloon, passing the level of 130 percent of gross domestic product -- the highest level of any major industrialized country -- and heading into unpayable territory. Japan's banks, once the financial Godzillas of the world, have been floundering in dangerously high levels of unpayable debts for years. The major banks' real assets are not worth much more than the $56 billion in public money that was plowed into them three years ago in a "one time" bailout.
As Japan struggles with its fourth recession in a decade, even the government does not forecast that growth will return before 2004. Dropping prices come partly from improved efficiencies, but also from dropping demand, as millions of Japanese learn to live with less. 
In a country that loves benchmarks, a psychological coda to Japan's astounding postwar economic rise came on Feb. 1 when the Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at 9791.43, dipping below the Dow Jones industrial average for the first time in almost 45 years. The Dow had not been above Tokyo's since August 1957, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president and George W. Bush an elementary school pupil.
One year ago, Americans were fearful that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, would be a global anchor, dragging the United States into a deep and lasting recession. With some economic indicators pointing to an American upturn later this year, those fears are easing.
"In the last five years, Japan's best contribution has been to not have collapsed," said Yoshihiko Miyauchi, chairman of a government deregulation panel. 
Next month may bring either bank failures or bank bailouts. Bad bank debts are estimated to be double to quadruple the level of bad debts that set off the savings and loan crisis in the United States in the 1980's.
Unlike Argentina, which depended on foreign capital to balance its books, Japan is expected to work out stopgap solutions within the family. It has the world's largest reserves of foreign exchange, $401 billion. Japan's public debt is the largest in the industrial world, but 95 percent of government bonds are held by Japanese. A loss of confidence by the outside world would have limited effect here. 
"It seems that the world has managed to get along without Japan quite nicely," said Marshall Gittler, the Japan currency strategist for Bank of America. "As long as there is not a financial crisis here, Japan will be just less and less important on the world stage."
"The only thing President Bush can say is to appeal to their pride," Mr. Gittler continued. "You can say, if your economy is in serious trouble and if you don't get it under control, gradually you're going to lose relevance in international politics."
Pride is something in short supply in the newly humble Tokyo. In the last week, Tokyo newspapers carried these headlines to describe news in two countries the Japanese long regarded as economically backward: "Chinese Leader Presses Japan To Speed Reforms: 'Catch Up With Global Trend,' " and "Lessons From Seoul," an editorial praising the restructuring of banks in South Korea. 
In contrast, headlines about Japan's economy benchmarks of recession. Last year, the trade surplus suffered the biggest drop, 38 percent, since 1970, pushing it to the lowest level in almost 20 years. 
Last year's drop in industrial production, 7.9 percent, was the biggest drop since 1975, pushing unemployment in December to 5.6 percent, a postwar high. With unemployment running at five times the level of 30 years ago, Japan, which long prided itself on full employment, now shares the same level of unemployment as the United States.
"I was watching a television program where these guys from prestigious universities were saying they can't get jobs -- and I thought 'That's me!' " said Ayako Inaba, 23, who graduates from college here next month, with no job in sight. 
Mr. Nozawa, the elevator salesman, said of his son's college friends: "Before, those students had top-level companies in mind. Now they say if you get a job you are lucky -- no bonuses, no raises."
Oddly, Japan's unemployment is rising at a time when the labor force is starting to shrink. Japan faces an aging population with a dwindling number of workers. Some economists argue that, without big jumps in productivity, a country with a shrinking work force will never see a return to economic growth. 
In what passes for optimism here, Mr. Myauchi, who is also the chairman of Orix Corporation, a major leasing company, predicted recently, "Many years from now, we will look back and see 2002 as the bottom."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: WHITE HOUSE MEMO; 
Allies Hear Sour Notes In 'Axis of Evil' Chorus

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
As a new and glaring rift emerges between the White House and America's allies over how to pursue the next phase of the war on terrorism, something odd has happened: President Bush and his top aides now seem to welcome, even to egg on, the sharp differences prompted by Mr. Bush's determination to expand his battle against what he calls "evil" regimes.
 In private, his friends and closest aides report, Mr. Bush fumes about weak-kneed "European elites" and scared Arab leaders who, in his view, lack the courage to stand up to states that may one day provide terrorists with nuclear or biological weapons. 
 Today Mr. Bush departed for Asia saying that the goal of his trip was to strengthen his antiterrorism coalition. But it was telling that even before Air Force One departed, the South Korean press was filled with denunciations of his inclusion of North Korea as part of the "axis of evil," protesting that Mr. Bush was undercutting years of diplomacy aimed at luring the Stalinist North out of its frightfully armed shell with economic incentives. 
In China, where Mr. Bush is making a delayed state visit, the country's leadership has warned in the past few weeks of "serious consequences" if the president takes military action against Iraq. Beijing has voiced worries about a re-emergence of American unilateralism, which it thought had faded in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks.
But in the last two weeks, Mr. Bush's strident tone has suggested just the opposite. In appearances across the country, he has built on the "axis of evil" phraseology of his State of the Union address, knowing full well that each repetition irritates and divides the countries he once hailed as his great coalition partners. 
His national security aides -- usually more attuned to how Mr. Bush's words play Poland or Peru than Peoria -- have begun to cite evidence that Americans are behind the broader mission of rooting out rogue states seeking weapons of mass destruction, even if the allies are not.
They compare Mr. Bush's mission to Ronald Reagan's single-minded goal of ridding the world of Communism. They describe their boss as a man who emerged from the first phase of the war more convinced than ever that the United States alone has the power to complete its task, with the coalition if possible -- and without them if necessary.
It is an America-first position that Vice President Dick Cheney voiced with particular clarity on Friday to the Council on Foreign Relations.
"America has friends and allies in this cause, but only we can lead it," he said in a ballroom filled with many of his old friends and former colleagues. "Only we can rally the world in a task of this complexity against an enemy so elusive and so resourceful. The United States and only the United States can see this effort through to victory."
When America's allies have begged to differ in recent days, they have found themselves engaged in open, public bickering with even with the most diplomatic members of Mr. Bush's war council.
It started when France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, dismissed Mr. Bush's approach to Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "simplistic," and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell shot back that his French colleague was "getting the vapors."
Then, all this week, there has been a far more telling war of words between Mr. Powell and Christopher Patten, the European Union's foreign affairs minister. Until a few days ago, he was a favorite of Washington conservatives for the tough line he took against China while serving as Britain's last governor general to Hong Kong.
When Mr. Patten started off the tiff by accusing Mr. Bush of taking an "absolutist" approach to the world, Mr. Powell shot back that his old friend deeply misunderstood and said, "I shall have a word with him, as they say in Britain."
Before he had a chance, Mr. Patten published a lengthy rebuke of the administration in The Financial Times, saying that American success in Afghanistan had "reinforced some dangerous instincts," including the belief that "the projection of military power is the only basis of true security," that "the U.S. can rely only on itself," and that allies were "an optional extra." 
He is hardly alone in that view. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said this week that the Bush administration was treating coalition partners like "satellites," a term clearly meant as a comparison to the old Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc.
And then President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Bush's newest strategic partner, weighed in with the observation that the members of the antiterror coalition signed up to battle the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and "Iraq is not on this list."
Even Canada -- America's closest allies save for Britain -- warned that any effort by the United States to act unilaterally in the next phase of the war "will go nowhere."
What makes these exchanges particularly notable, apart from their bluntness, is the shift they reflect in foreign views of Mr. Bush -- and Mr. Bush's evolving views of his allies.
For the first nine months of his presidency, whenever Mr. Bush was tempted to act on his own -- dumping the Kyoto Protocol on global warming with barely a warning to Japan or Europe, for example -- he usually followed up with an intensive round of fence-mending. By this summer, he was moderating his language, paying off America's dues to the United Nations and talking about the future of new partnerships.
Then came Sept. 11 and a new spirit of alliance. European and Asian leaders said they thought they were seeing a George W. Bush emerge. This was a president who invited foreign leaders to the Oval Office for long conversations, who dialed around the globe the way his father once had, whose go-it-alone tendencies were being sanded down by the realities of operating in a complex world that provided many physical and financial havens for terrorists.
Now, they fear, the old Mr. Bush may be re-emerging. The change in view began with his decision to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, but since Russia seemed to react mildly, so did Europe. It accelerated when he declared that Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were not "prisoners of war." Then came the "axis of evil," a phrase that European and Asian allies alike said dangerously lumped together three countries that pose very different challenges.
What bothers the Europeans the most is not entirely clear: Mr. Bush's goals, his missionary zeal, or the thought that Washington sees its role as wiping out bad governments and the allies' role as one of cleaning up with aid and peacekeepers. 
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage has little patience for that kind of hand-wringing. "It's very hard to attack something like 'axis of evil,' " he said, "because Mr. Bush was not talking about people, but about regimes."
At the core of the debate lies a deeper question about American foreign policy that now bedevils Mr. Bush and his aides: is America stronger when it acts in an unfettered manner and defends its national interests directly, or when it acts with allies whose interests may frustrate Washington's goals?

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES; 
Judging Bush's $1.35 Trillion Bet

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LAST year, President Bush won the political battle over taxes, signing into law a 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut that gradually reduces individual income tax rates, doubles the credit for children, expands retirement and education savings programs and repeals the estate tax in the year 2010. 
 This year, Republicans and Democrats are fighting over the impact of that tax cut: 
 * Was it a prudent measure that will enhance the economy's long-term growth prospects, while holding down the size of government and giving the nation a much-needed dose of recession-fighting medicine?
* Or was it an irresponsible giveaway to the wealthy that squandered the budget surplus, ruined any chance of addressing the big social problems of the day and endangered the economy by putting upward pressure on long-term interest rates? 
Their differences will be central to their political strategies for the midterm Congressional elections in November. The two parties are setting out new arguments to bolster their cases for and against last year's tax cut, and are reiterating old ones. They are fighting over what should be done -- or should have been done -- to give the economy a quick lift as it tries to recover from recession. 
But the debate over what, if anything, to do about last year's tax cut is unlikely to be resolved this year, because any chances of enacting an immediate economic stimulus package that would include tax cuts have all but died in Congress.
As a result, tax experts say, Americans should assume for now that current tax law will not change this year in any substantial way. 
"We'll do a few little things around the edges," said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. "But for individuals working on their taxes, the most likely thing is, what you see is what you get." 
Deloitte advises taxpayers to give themselves "a financial checkup" while they are assembling their tax records. It recommends that they put some provisions of the tax law to work for them to improve their family's financial health -- for example, by contributing the maximum they are allowed to tax-deferred savings plans like I.R.A.'s, 401(k)'s and Keoghs to prepare for retirement and utilizing other tax breaks and credits to help pay for their children's education.
This year, taxpayers will see some benefits from the phase-in of the 2001 law. Most single taxpayers received checks last summer for up to $300, and couples received $600, reflecting the benefit of the new 10 percent income tax rate that the law created starting last year. Rates for middle- and upper-income people -- those in brackets above 15 percent -- are down by one-half of a percentage point on the 2001 returns now being filed and will drop another half-point this year. 
Families with children will benefit from an increase in the child tax credit to $600 from $500 starting in 2001, provided that their income is not too high. The credit starts phasing out when couples' incomes exceed $110,000 and when single filers' incomes go above $75,000. The upper limit depends on the number of children. 
New or expanded tax benefits apply to retirement savings, including 401(k) and similar plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, as well as to programs for education savings. The top rates on the estate tax will begin to fall, and the tax itself is to be repealed in 2010. 
THE political debate over tax cuts is intensifying, meanwhile, as the nation's long-term fiscal outlook grows more troubled.
Both the Congressional Budget Office and the White House's Office of Management and Budget have prepared new 10-year projections of the federal budget surplus concluding that most of the $5.6 trillion in excess revenue they were counting on a year ago has evaporated. 
Part of the change resulted from the tax cuts. Much of the rest was a result of the economic slump and related changes in technical assumptions about tax revenue and spending. Deficits seem certain for the next few years, and there no longer seems much chance of paying off the bulk of the national debt. 
Some Democrats say the re-emergence of budget deficits means that the nation can no longer afford tax cuts as well as increased spending on social needs including health care and education. They want to delay the phase-in of the tax cut over the remainder of the decade. A few Democrats are calling for a reversal of some elements of last year's law, including the gradual reduction in and eventual repeal of the federal estate tax. 
But Mr. Bush said his tax cut would be reversed "over my dead body." Indeed, in his State of the Union Message, Mr. Bush called for making all the provisions in the bill permanent. In making the request, he was seeking to undo a legislative quirk, known as a sunset provision, that would otherwise lead all the provisions in the bill to expire in 2011, leaving the tax code where it was at the beginning of last year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that making the tax cut permanent would add $627 billion to its cost just in 2011 and 2012. 
"The question of rolling back the tax cut will be discussed heatedly this year but not resolved," said Kim Wallace, a political analyst at Lehman Brothers, the investment firm. He predicted that debate over the issue would continue for several years, until the long-term budget outlook could be assessed again with some precision. 
This year, the two parties have already battled to a stalemate over whether to enact additional tax cuts that their advocates said would help the economy recover from the recession. But after a months-long standoff, the Senate effectively abandoned hope of passing anything more than a very narrow measure to extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks beyond the 26-week limit imposed by most states. 
MR. BUSH and most Republicans in Congress had been pressing for an acceleration of the individual rate cuts contained in last year's law, as well as a variety of tax cuts for business, including incentives for new investment. Democrats had wanted to focus the package on helping unemployed people and on providing a more limited incentive for new business investment. 
Should the economy remain weak, or be subject to further shocks like another terrorist attack, the two parties would probably try again to come up with an economic recovery package. 
In the meantime, analysts say, Congress is not likely to pass any major tax bills this year, although there could be some tax breaks for rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and routine extensions of some expiring provisions. 
The next big front in the tax wars is likely to be the alternative minimum tax. Originally enacted to ensure that the wealthy could not escape taxation through clever use of too many tax breaks, the tax is increasingly trapping middle-income people, effectively raising their taxes and complicating the filing of their tax returns. 
But dealing with the problem in a comprehensive way would be expensive -- and right now Washington does not have the money.

HEADLINE: A Blueprint for a New Beginning in the Mideast 

BYLINE:  By Jerome M. Segal; Jerome M. Segal is a senior research scholar at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies and president of the Jewish Peace Lobby.

DATELINE: COLLEGE PARK, Md. 

 BODY:
From the beginning, the Bush administration rejected President Bill Clinton's objective in the Middle East. America went from actively seeking to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to turning away from mediating peace negotiations to trying to manage escalating violence. Such efforts are not likely to succeed, and even if it were possible to manage the violence for a time, the world needs something more. The United States has a responsibility to aim higher.
 The Bush administration is correct in its assessment that there is no possibility today, or in the near future, that the two parties will negotiate a comprehensive peace on their own. This holds true even if a temporary cease-fire might be wrested from both sides. There is, however, an alternative approach that should be considered. It would put the focus on ending the Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza not through bilateral negotiations, but through an external authority, namely, the United Nations Security Council. 
 The Security Council, with American leadership, could prescribe the central elements of a territorial settlement that the adversaries could be made to accept right now. Discussion of the Jerusalem and Palestinian refugee issues, which now have no solutions within reach, would be postponed for three years. 
On what basis might the Security Council assert its authority over territory and statehood? Upon the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, authority over historic Palestine was assumed by the League of Nations; this passed to the United Nations after World War II. The Security Council retains the authority under international law to determine who has sovereignty over the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. This is an authority the United Nations had in 1947 when it called for partition of Palestine into two states with Jerusalem in a zone outside the sovereignty of either. It is an authority that has never been relinquished.
With United States support, the Security Council could move to settle the territorial dimension of this conflict in line with Security Council Resolution 242, which spells out the "land for peace" principle. Here is how the process could work, step by step.
The Security Council would present the Palestine Liberation Organization with concrete conditions for the establishment and recognition of a Palestinian state and its admission into the United Nations: Recognize Israel as a Jewish state, one that is sovereign within the borders established by the Security Council plan, with negotiations on Jerusalem postponed. Pledge not to enter into any defense or assistance treaty with any state not at peace with Israel, and until a bilateral agreement with Israel is achieved, import no weapons. Agree to international inspectors under American leadership with Israeli participation to verify that all these conditions are carried out. And agree that the Palestinian state will demonstrate a monopoly over force within its territory. This would require disarming and possibly disbanding nonstate actors, like the Tanzim, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
When these conditions were accepted, the Security Council would require Israel to submit, within 90 days, a plan for withdrawing from the future state of Palestine. These would be the requirements for Israel: Withdraw from all of the Gaza Strip and from a minimum of 95 percent of the West Bank and provide, on a one-for-one basis, a territorial swap for areas it proposes to retain. Retain no lands that prevent the territorial contiguity of the State of Palestine or access to Jordan. Within evacuated areas, provide for the full evacuation of Israeli citizens. Transfer evacuated settlements to the State of Palestine in good condition, with the understanding that the value of the housing and infrastructure will count as a credit in any ultimate plan for compensation of Palestinian refugees.
After reviewing Israel's withdrawal plan and perhaps amending it, the Security Council would direct the withdrawal within 12 months. When this is completed, the Security Council would affirm that the territorial dimensions of Resolution 242 have been fulfilled, with Jerusalem excepted.
The Security Council would then call for bilateral negotiations on remaining issues like economic and security cooperation and water rights, with settlement of the Jerusalem and refugee rights and compensation questions delayed for three years.
The refugee issue would then be taken up in negotiations between two sovereign nations, within the context of Israel as a Jewish state. For Jerusalem, "what is Arab shall be Palestinian; what is Jewish shall be Israeli" would be the guiding principle for negotiations conducted under the auspices of the Security Council.
It is quite possible, of course, that the P.L.O. would refuse to meet the conditions necessary to get the process started. That would leave us where we are today, with one great difference: The onus for the continued occupation would fall squarely on the P.L.O. The Security Council plan would stand in place awaiting a Palestinian leadership willing to abide by its provisions.
As for Israeli cooperation, there is no doubt that the Israeli government led by Ariel Sharon would not welcome this assertion of authority by the Security Council. However, if the P.L.O. did accept Israel as a Jewish state and did agree that this plan would end the territorial dimension of the conflict, it would be quite difficult for even Mr. Sharon to reject a Security Council directive that had American backing. If he did, the coalition within Israel would be likely to dissolve, and the next elections would essentially be a referendum on ending the conflict.
President Bush's leadership has been embraced by the international community during the war on terrorism. If he pushed forward on this kind of Middle East solution, he might be surprised to find how many Israelis are ready for American leadership and are prepared to recognize that they and the Palestinians can only achieve peace with the help of the outside world as arbitrator.

HEADLINE: As National Oil Giant Struggles, Mexico Agonizes Over Opening It to Foreign Ventures 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: CIUDAD DEL CARMEN, Mexico 

 BODY:
Mexico's state-run energy company, Pemex, certainly looks like a world-class operation. Its rigs pump billions of dollars of crude from the Gulf of Mexico, spewing flame and smoke into the sky, as helicopters shuttle skilled engineers from this port to some of the world's richest oil fields.
 But Pemex, a pillar of the old governing party during its seven-decade rule, is still mired in patronage and intrigue. 
 Today Petroleos Mexicanos, the company's full name, is "a combination of an oil company and a bureaucracy," said its director, Raul Munoz Leos. It was created in 1938, when Mexico nationalized its oil operations. Foreigners, chiefly Americans, had controlled every drop of oil in the country, which at its peak represented one-quarter of the world's production. Mexico's Constitution was amended to forbid foreign exploitation of its oil and gas. 
But now Pemex desperately needs billions in new investment for exploration and refining, financing that Mr. Munoz Leos said could only come from foreign sources. And that would require an ideological shift as radical as the one back in the 1930's.
What is at issue is whether Mexico is ready to open Pemex, a symbol of nationalistic pride, to foreign participation or influence. President Vicente Fox, who ousted the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in elections in 2000, has made promises to modernize the company by allowing some foreign participation. But he faces formidable opposition from Pemex's powerful labor union and other nationalist forces, whose accusations that Mr. Fox is selling out to foreign exploitation could easily become overwhelming.
The PRI, which ruled for 71 years, addicted Mexico's government to Pemex's money. Taxes and duties on Pemex now finance more than one-third of the federal budget. For years, the government has taken almost every peso Pemex made -- and sometimes more, forcing the company to borrow to pay its tax bill. Pemex made $20.9 billion in the first nine months of 2001, and the government took $22.1 billion away.
That practice leaves little for exploring new fields. Nor can Pemex easily repair old plants, Mr. Munoz Leos said, so pollution is pervasive and fatal accidents are not uncommon.
"Pemex has been on a declining trend," Mr. Munoz Leos said. "We have practically reached the limit."
For Mr. Fox to reform Pemex, he will have to confront the old system's byzantine legacy. The company has been shielded from change by its hallowed status as protector of the nation's oil wealth. Schoolchildren still learn that the creation of Pemex after the oil expropriation was the culmination of their nation's independence.
In Mexico, Pemex is power, the "most important entity in the Mexican economy," to quote a United States Energy Department report. It franchises every gas station, fuels every factory and affects every family's pocketbook. Its progress directly affects the United States, which buys about one-sixth of its imported petroleum from Mexico.
For decades, Pemex stoked the political machine of the PRI. The oil workers union, with more than 130,000 members today, was one of the foundations of the party.
"Pemex and the oil union were considered the right arm, financially and ideologically, of the PRI," said George Baker, an independent oil analyst. "One of Fox's goals is to see if you can disassemble that, make the government stand on its own two feet. And the old guard is trying to see that nothing changes."
Mr. Fox pledged to make Pemex a "successful, competitive, honest and transparent" company. But Mexico's Congress has stymied his efforts.
Last year he appointed a new outside board of businessmen to oversee Pemex. Congress spurned it and the board was dissolved. Last month his government charged that the party illegally took $120 million from Pemex during the 2000 campaign against Mr. Fox. Party leaders denied the charges, saying they were politically motivated. 
Manuel Bartlett Diaz, a powerful senator from the party, said the accusations were part of a scheme by Mr. Fox "to privatize Pemex." He vowed to block any effort to open up the company to foreign capital.
But within this decade, Mr. Munoz Leos said, $20 billion to $30 billion in new investment may have to come from abroad.
In March, Mr. Fox will test Mexico's capacity for change when he asks Congress to approve new contracts to allow foreign companies the right to run operations in Mexico's largest natural gas fields. The proposed service contracts, Mr. Munoz Leos argued, are "well within the Constitution."
"If we were dumb enough to just scratch one of the edges," he said, "that would kill us."
That edge is the one that separates foreign participation from foreign exploitation. The fear that Mexico's prime natural resource might once again go to enrich others "is a ghost we have always been fighting," said Javier Hinojosa, Pemex's subdirector for exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico.
But if Congress does not allow more foreign investment, Mr. Munoz Leos warns, Pemex's production will start to plummet, creating severe problems for Mexico's economy.
Mr. Fox staked a good deal of political capital in his first year in office on trying to change Mexico's tax system to reduce its reliance on Pemex and enable the company to spend more of its earnings on its own operations.
But Congress, where the former governing party still holds a plurality, blocked Mr. Fox's tax initiative.
Although Congress in January granted Pemex more money for exploration, it was loath to make the "huge structural changes" required to revamp an "inflexible creature of the state," said Juan Camilo Mourino, a member of Mr. Fox's National Action Party and the chairman of a congressional energy committee.
Although Pemex employs many talented people, its inefficiencies are huge. Mexico is sitting on the second-largest oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere, after Venezuela, and Pemex pumps about 3.5 million barrels of oil a day, exporting roughly 1.6 million. But its refining capacity is overwhelmed: Mexico must import more than a quarter of its gasoline.
Pemex employs about twice as many workers as Venezuela does to produce about the same amount of oil.
With virtually all its profits going to run the government, repairs and renovations can be hard to finance. Asked if that system affects Pemex's safety record, Mr. Munoz Leos replied, "I cannot envision how it would not."
This can result in tragedy, as happened recently in a dirt-poor neighborhood on the edge of Acatzingo, about 110 miles west of Mexico City.
Laura Nolasco Sambrano, 28, was asleep in her shack with her two daughters, Maria Teresa, 4, and Claudia, 10, about 30 feet from a 50-year-old Pemex oil pipeline. At about 11:30 p.m., "an avalanche of black" filled the village, in the words of her sister-in-law, Norma Angelica Gonzales Juarez, 30. Fumes from the spill killed Maria Teresa.
Pemex will have difficulty cleaning up its safety record without new investments in infrastructure. But the corruption charges brought by Mr. Fox's comptroller general in the alleged campaign finance scheme have some senior congressional figures saying they will refuse to help pass his initiatives to open Pemex. The charges accuse the president of the oil workers' union, Carlos Romero Deschamps, who is also a prominent PRI senator, of scheming with a former director of Pemex, Rogelio Montemayor, a former party governor in the state of Coahuila, to divert millions to the party's presidential campaign against Mr. Fox.
Roberto Madrazo, a Gulf Coast politician from the PRI's old school, is using the scandal to try to become the party's leader and its next presidential candidate. Mr. Madrazo, a former governor of Tabasco, whose leaders have long been awash in oil money, is encouraging an investigation of Pemex, calling for an end to "the old vices that hurt the party, like corruption."
Yet those who oppose change at Pemex remain a powerful force. "Even a small change is interpreted as meaning that expropriation was wrong," said Andres Antonius, a former undersecretary for energy policy who now works as director of strategic planning at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. "It was perhaps a very good idea at the time. But it's not a good idea forever."

HEADLINE: Fish and Farmers 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Fish Wars" (editorial, Feb. 14): Should hundreds of farm families be forced out of Oregon's Klamath Basin, where some have grown potatoes and alfalfa for a century? You imply that they should when you say the federal Klamath irrigation project supports a farm economy "where none belongs." 
 Yet the National Academy of Sciences found "no substantial scientific foundation" for last year's cutoff of irrigation in the name of helping suckerfish and coho salmon. 
The findings, though preliminary, hardly suggest that fish and irrigated farming can't live in harmony.
You castigate our organization's lawsuit to remove Klamath Basin coho from the federal endangered list. Yet coho in the region aren't endangered -- not when hatchery-born fish are counted. These are genetically identical to "wild" coho; once born, they follow the same cycle of life, swimming to the ocean, returning to spawn, and interbreeding with stream-born salmon along the way.

Many midsize companies find that 'defensive publishing' is a quick and cheap way to protect intellectual property.

BYLINE:  By Sarah Milstein 

 BODY:
LAST spring Plantronics, a telephone headset manufacturer in Santa Cruz, Calif., developed a technology for reducing microphone noise. The invention was not something the company could use right away, but Plantronics executives did not want to risk letting a competitor patent the idea first. 
 Rather than spend time and money to patent the idea, Plantronics posted a description of it on IP.com, a Web site that enables inventors to establish an idea's legal existence -- a concept known as prior art in patent law. By putting its design in the public domain, Plantronics sought to prevent competitors from patenting it. 
 Such disclosure, known as defensive publishing, is an increasingly common tactic for protecting intellectual property. Publishing an innovation means that competitors have access to it, of course. But many companies say the competitive risk is outweighed by the benefit of making it difficult for someone else to win a patent -- a patent that could give the holder the right to demand licensing fees from all other users of the technology or technique. 
Many major corporations have long pursued the defensive publishing strategy by putting out bulletins or publishing descriptions of their innovations in trade journals. Now smaller companies are adopting the method, often through the Internet. 
One spur to the practice of staking out claims to intellectual property was a 1998 federal court decision declaring that business processes -- like one-click checkout at a merchant's Web site or financial incentives for consumers to view marketing messages -- could be protected by patents just as physical inventions could. 
But protecting intellectual property with a patent is neither cheap nor quick. Domestic patent applications, including legal and filing fees, can cost $15,000, while international filings can run to $50,000. And once issued, patents are subject to annual maintenance fees.
Then there is time. According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, it takes an average of 25 months from the date of filing to process an application. 
Defensive publishing, by comparison, can be done for a fraction of the cost and with relatively informal paperwork. Posting one document on IP.com's Web site, for instance, costs $155 and requires no lawyers. 
Nearly any document that describes an innovation can qualify as publishable evidence of prior art. Brochures, conference papers and company invention disclosure forms are all fair game. The important thing in establishing prior art is to make sure that a document has a clear publication date. 
Plantronics, which had $400 million in revenue in 2001, holds 63 patents and has applications pending for 75 more. In the case of the microphone noise-reduction technology, defensive publishing was simply a cheaper, faster alternative to patenting one invention that was not part of the company's core business. "We published as opposed to patenting so others cannot prevent us from commercializing the idea," said Osman Isvan, senior acoustics engineer for the company. "In fact, if our partners use it, it would benefit us because the technology works with our systems." 
While Plantronics has used defensive publishing to protect just that one invention so far, for other companies, the method has become a common feature in their intellectual property strategies. 
In the last six months, for example, Rich Products, a food company in Buffalo with $1.6 billion in annual sales, has responded to the rising use of patents in its industry by becoming more serious about defensive publishing. It now considers documents like conference presentations to be potentially valuable property that may warrant formal publication. 
"As we've expanded from domestic to international markets, we'd go broke if we tried to patent everything we had," said Bill Grieshober, senior legal counsel for Rich Products. 
The advent of searchable online databases that are available to patent examiners searching for prior art has made defensive publishing more accessible to a range of companies. "People want to have the sense that patent examiners will find their ideas, and the Internet helps," said Edward Kelly, a partner with the Boston law firm of Ropes & Gray. 
Patent examiners have access to the Internet and more than a thousand commercial databases, among other resources. Each examiner is required to search only logs of previously patented ideas and sometimes specific trade journals or databases in his areas of specialization, but patents can be challenged if other inventors can provide evidence of published prior art that the examiner may have missed. 
When IP.com introduced its service in September 2000, the management team thought that the Web site's primary customers would be companies with substantial research and development departments, like Motorola and General Electric. But while a handful of those giants did sign on and do actively use the service, IP.com found more interest among midsize companies. So
IP.com dedicated a sales representative to companies with annual sales bwlow $2 billion.
But lately, even much smaller companies have begun using the service. 
The Nutter Machine Company, a 40-person custom machine builder in Hebron, Ohio, has published one invention on IP.com -- a modular system for making repeatable bends in metal tubing. The publication is the extent of the company's intellectual property portfolio. 
"We read about defensive publishing and thought that for this new product, publishing was the way to go instead of having somebody take our idea and patent it out from under us," said Robert Maron, product manager for Nutter. "We didn't have the market and the time to go through the patent process. The anticipated revenue didn't warrant the tens of thousands of dollars we'd have had to spend." 
Despite the growing interest in defensive publishing, the technique does carry the risk that rivals will learn about a company's innovations and adapt them to their own competitive ends. "The rub is that you wonder whether or not you need to publish somewhere everyone can see it," noted Mr. Grieshober of Rich Products. 
To keep competitors at bay, companies often publish anonymously, and they sometimes use vague language to describe an invention. 
But if competitors are unable to find or understand an idea, there is a good chance that patent examiners will not either. 
To be useful, said Mr. Kelly, the Ropes & Gray partner, defensive publications must be very carefully written. A document that did not clearly establish prior art might be ignored by an examiner who could issue a patent for an invention a company thought that it had defensively covered. "I haven't seen that yet," Mr. Kelly said, "but it's got to be coming."

Getting Tangible Dollars for an Intangible Creation

BYLINE:  By Matthew Mirapaul 

 BODY:
In a strong endorsement of a young genre, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation is acquiring two works of Internet-based art for its permanent collection and today is hanging them, so to speak, on a special section of the foundation's Web site at guggenheim.org/internetart. The works are "net.flag" by Mark Napier and "Unfolding Object" by John F. Simon Jr.
 Jon Ippolito, the Guggenheim Museum's associate curator of media arts, said, "The objective is both to demonstrate our conviction that these forms of cultural expression deserve to be safeguarded for the future and also to demonstrate a method for doing it." 
 Now that the artists' development of the works is finished -- a relative term for projects that will continue to change as online visitors alter them -- the Guggenheim can officially acquire them, a process that is expected to be finalized at the foundation's spring board meeting.
Although there are a few online pieces in other collections, museum acquisitions of Internet art are still rare. Steve Dietz, new-media curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, said, "What the Guggenheim is doing is what every contemporary arts institution should and will do: treat Net art like any other contemporary art in its collection." 
But for a museum whose primary purpose is to collect, exhibit and preserve art, online works pose a fresh set of challenges. How do you collect art that exists everywhere -- and yet nowhere -- in cyberspace? What does one acquire when there is no tangible object to possess? The artists have conceived two new works, but what they have created is computer code, the underlying set of software instructions that determine what is seen on the screen and how it responds to user input.
So what does a museum pay for online art and what does it get? Mr. Ippolito declined to reveal what the Guggenheim is spending, but a person familiar with the acquisition process said it was in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 for each piece. In return, the museum receives the work's code and the exclusive right to exhibit it.
Arguing that a discussion of contract terms misses the point, Mr. Ippolito said: "The Holy Grail of selling a Web site is a red herring. To collect an artist Web site is less about owning property than stewarding heritage."
So the Guggenheim has set up a small preservation fund, the Variable Media Endowment, to pay for recreating works endangered by technological obsolescence. This is part of the museum's larger initiative to work with artists in all ephemeral media, including video and installation art, to make sure that their intentions are followed in case their works are remade under different conditions.
How effective this will be remains to be seen, and the Guggenheim's two Internet-based works are among the guinea pigs. No one knows what it will take to preserve works in a genre that is less than a decade old and subject to constantly evolving technical standards, but some action is inevitable. Mr. Simon said, "With Internet art, it is only a question of time before there will have to be changes to the code."
A painting may require the occasional cleaning, but software-based art could demand a complete overhaul on a regular basis. Thus, for instance, a piece that runs on today's Web browsers may fail in future versions, assuming there will still be browsers in 10 or 20 years. 
There are also shorter-term preservation issues. Both Internet projects build on previous visitors' input, so they must be copied onto multiple computers on a daily basis. A painting may be stashed at a Guggenheim archive on the West Side of Manhattan, but "Unfolding Object" will be stored on computers in Seattle, Mr. Ippolito's office and Mr. Simon's studio. Recalling that the Guggenheim's computer network was knocked out on Sept. 11, Mr. Ippolito said, "I can't let the destiny of these works be at the whim of a power surge."
Although the cost to acquire the Internet works may be modest, Mr. Ippolito said it does not reflect their true value. One must also consider the museum's commitment to sustaining the works.
Mr. Ippolito said: "A pet owner who spends $5 on the runt of the litter may be willing to spend thousands to keep it alive over time. Which is a better marker of the value of that animal?"
Ultimately the works' real value will be determined by their aesthetic impact. Neither "net.flag" nor "Unfolding Object" represents a technological breakthrough, but technology-based art need not be cutting edge. Instead, these projects are refinements of ideas that both artists have gnawed on before.
Mr. Simon's "Unfolding Object" confronts visitors with a Josef Albers-like square within a square. Clicking on one of the central square's edges causes another square to swing open from it, as does clicking on any of the successive squares' edges. As the virtual object unfolds, each square contains marks indicating how many visitors have previously opened that exact square.
Playing with "Unfolding Object" is akin to popping the pockets in Bubble Wrap, but there is a more serious purpose. As in the "Alter Stats" project on his www.numeral.com site, Mr. Simon has built a history of past interactions into the work. Visitors to the new work must decide if they want to follow well-trod paths or strike out on their own, a nice metaphor for the creative process.
In "net.flag," Mr. Napier lets visitors wage a symbolic battle over virtual turf. On the site there is a flag that can be digitally changed however one likes. A French flag could be replaced by an Italian one, or the red stripes in the United States flag could be turned into an Arabic green. The work gained new resonance after Sept. 11, but it is more about whether it is possible to stake a claim in cyberspace, where there are no boundaries.
As in other projects on Mr. Napier's Potatoland.org site, he encourages visitors to obliterate what past viewers have done. But this is the first time that he is ceding control of a work to another. He said: "There's a definite tug for me. It's like the male version of an umbilical cord." 
The acquisitions are the remnants of an ambitious plan conceived in 2000 by Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim director, under which the museum was to commission 20 online works the first year.
Because of the Guggenheim's financial troubles, that plan fell by the wayside along with the stalled Guggenheim.com e-commerce venture. An online exhibition space, the Guggenheim Virtual Museum, also seems moribund. But Mr. Ippolito said he continued to discuss the possibility of future commissions with other digital artists.
For Mr. Simon, the Guggenheim's ownership of his work provides a rare possibility for the digital artist: a promise that his work may outlive him. He said: "If the museum buys the art work and values it as part of its permanent collection, there will be an economic incentive to keep the code running. The museum is the archival storage for my code. Isn't that what a museum does for art anyway?"

Arbitration Panel to Rule On Internet Radio Royalties
An arbitration panel is to rule this week on the amount that Internet radio stations must pay recording companies for songs played online. The ruling may clear up one of the more nettlesome issues facing the Internet radio business.
 Recording companies and Internet radio operators were mandated by a 1998 law, called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to come to terms on royalty fees for artists. The two sides entered arbitration last year worlds apart in their negotiations. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C5. 

Will Microsoft's Xbox Play in Japan?
Not since the industry's early days, when Atari competed for space in video arcades, has a major American game company tried to dethrone Japanese hardware makers on their own turf. When it begins selling its Xbox game system in Japan on Friday, Microsoft will try to use the star power of Bill Gates and a lineup of specialized games to battle the leaders, Sony and Nintendo. Many predict that the Xbox, left, which has sold more than 1.5 million units in North America since November, will face tough going in Japan. C3.

Protecting Intellectual Property
Many midsize companies find that "defensive publishing" is a quick and cheap way to protect intellectual property. Publishing an innovation means that competitors have access to it, of course. But many companies say the competitive risk is outweighed by the benefit of making it difficult for someone else to win a patent. New Economy. C3.

Patent Models' Strange Odyssey
In the 1870's, the United States Patent and Trademark Office was a big tourist attraction in Washington. Its Parthenon-inspired facade dominated the skyline. Inside, glass cases held Lilliputian reproductions of actual inventions, like Morse's telegraph and waltzing dolls. Last week, after a strange odyssey that lasted nearly a century, some of those models went back on display at the patent office's museum in Crystal City, Va. C2.

Reporting the Skating Scandal

Petco Hopes to Raise $275 Million
Petco Animal Supplies, a pet food and supplies retailer based in San Diego, plans to sell 14.5 million shares at $18 to $20 each in an initial public offering on Thursday. The offering is expected to raise $275.5 million. C2.

MTV Ponders a College Network
Hoping to take advantage of efforts by the nation's colleges to provide compelling television entertainment to entice students to live on campus and Madison Avenue's thirst for young audiences, MTV is considering creating a college-only network. It would be called MTV University -- MTVU for short -- and would be piped directly into students' bedrooms, lounges and cafeterias on college-run cable systems, taking advertisers to the places where that young audience is hiding.

HEADLINE: Kashmir's Champion Finds Pitfalls to Peace 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Usmaan Ahmad, a 26-year-old American graduate student of Kashmiri descent, learned again last week why it has been so difficult to find a political settlement for Kashmir, the Himalayan territory in dispute between India and Pakistan.
 Mr. Ahmad is studying international law and conflict resolution at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. He had planned to go to Katmandu, Nepal, for a meeting today through Wednesday of Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri academics, artists and human rights advocates to discuss peaceful political initiatives for ending the crisis over Kashmir. 
 "Many of us who are working for peace in Kashmir got a bizarre Valentine's Day gift from the Indian government," he said on Thursday. He got a message that day from Rita Manchanda, an Indian writer and co-organizer of the informal conference, saying that hotel reservations in Katmandu had been canceled.
The Nepalese office of the South Asian Forum for Human Rights, the sponsoring organization, had been told it needed government permission to meet, and participants from India were asked to produce passports to board flights to Nepal, which are not normally required for travel between the two countries.
"Evidently, democratic governments are fearful of democratic processes, especially when it comes to efforts of civil society to empower itself and reassert itself in nonmilitarist conflict management and peace building in Kashmir," Ms. Manchanda wrote, adding that this was the second time the meeting had to be postponed in recent months under pressure from India.
For Mr. Ahmad, a spokesman in the United States for a nonviolent Kashmiri independence movement, the meeting was doubly important because he has been denied an Indian visa since June 2001, a month after he joined the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, an organization that has not been accused of either atrocities or of significant Pakistani backing.
He made a decision to join the front and to help make it into a strong but nonviolent lobby for peace in Kashmir after several visits to the Kashmir Valley to trek and to learn about the culture of his ancestors.
American human rights organizations are also barred from monitoring events in Kashmir, where hundreds of thousands of Indian troops are trying to put down militarily a movement that began with political and economic grievances in the late 1980's. Pakistan subsequently took advantage of the uprising to wage a proxy war on India in Kashmir, which both countries have claimed since independence in 1947. 
Kashmir is now an obsession for Mr. Ahmad, he said. Since 1994, when he first visited Kashmir after graduating from high school, he has made himself into a respected expert and something of an unofficial envoy of a people without a lobby in the United States. In December, he was invited to take part in a State Department policy brainstorming session of government officials and leading scholars. 
Mr. Ahmad, who describes himself as "about as American as you can get," grew up in Missouri and graduated from Washington University in St. Louis. 
His visits to Kashmir turned to nightmares, he said, and he became sickened by the brutality of both Indian forces and some extremists in the Kashmiri rebel movements. Tens of thousands of people have died there since 1989.
"I was also sad to see that there were many options and better ways to proceed that were being ignored by those heading the Kashmiri struggle and I wanted to help them explore those, and succeed," he said in exchanges of e-mail messages as he prepared for the now-aborted trip to Nepal. His self-described mission led him directly to graduate work in international law negotiation at Fletcher.
The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front is led by Yasin Malik, 35, who was treated in the United States last year for injuries he received while being tortured in Indian custody. The group has been involved recently in plans by Kashmiris, who have an ethnically and linguistically distinct culture, to create their own electoral system for the territory. Many Kashmiris reject elections run by India, which have been rigged in the past to the advantage of parties in power in New Delhi.
India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, has promised to "go off the beaten path" to find peace in Kashmir, Mr. Ahmad said, adding that this is exactly what Kashmiris planning a new political process for the territory want to do. Their proposals would have been discussed with like-minded Indians and Pakistanis in Katmandu.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Forces Out Leader Of European Vote Observers 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Setting up yet another showdown with the European Union, Zimbabwe has expelled the leader of a European mission sent to observe the country's coming presidential election.
 Ambassador Pierre Schori, the head of the observer team, left Harare, the capital, late Saturday after the authorities withdrew his visa and ordered him out of the country. 
 "It's totally unacceptable," Stefan Amer, the spokesman for the observer mission, said from Harare.
Foreign ministers from the European Union, which has threatened sanctions against Zimbabwe's leaders, will meet on Monday in Brussels, where they will receive a report from Mr. Schori. 
Zimbabwe has said it will not accredit observers from Britain, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands or Sweden. Those six countries have been among the most critical of President Robert Mugabe.
Mr. Schori, who is Sweden's ambassador to the United Nations, entered Zimbabwe last weekend, four weeks before the March 9-10 election. He had a six-month visitor's visa obtained in Washington, he said, but was granted only 15 days in the country. He petitioned to stay through the election and to be accredited as the head of the mission, but on Saturday he was told to leave. 
Zimbabwe's home affairs minister, John Nkomo, said in an interview with the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation that by speaking to the news media about Zimbabwe, Mr. Schori had violated the conditions of his visa.
"We warned him about this, but he continued to hold clandestine meetings in defiance of our warning, so we withdrew his visa," Mr. Nkomo said.
In a telephone interview from London, where he arrived early today, Mr. Schori said the Zimbabwean government knew of his appointment in advance and was simply concocting "false pretexts" for his expulsion. 
About 30 European observers already in Harare were supposed to begin fanning out across the country this weekend, and another 120 observers were due to arrive in coming days. Instead, they will all stay where they are until at least Monday when the foreign ministers meet.
"I'm sad to leave my team behind," Mr. Schori said. "I'm also sad that the observers are not being able to go out. The people of Zimbabwe, I know they really want to have international observers." 
Although they are only a fraction of the thousands of observers who are expected to be deployed, the international observers bring experience and logistical resources that are scarce in developing countries. 
Like the United States, the European Union has threatened to freeze the assets and restrict the travel of senior Zimbabwean officials if political conditions in the country do not improve. But with the election now less than three weeks away, the United States and Europe are clearly reluctant to impose such measures, which would almost certainly lead Zimbabwe to bar many more if not all international observers.
With the country's economy crumbling, Mr. Mugabe is facing unprecedented opposition. Clashes between ruling-party loyalists and opposition supporters have become more frequent and more violent. Intimidation of local journalists has continued, and exclusion of much of the foreign news media persists. Fears are widespread that the vote will be rigged.
Effective election observers, many diplomats and analysts say, are the only hope of countering such a climate, and that is why the United States, despite tough talk, has not been eager to impose sanctions. Britain, Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler, has pushed for stronger action, but most European countries have been unwilling to move so aggressively.
With this latest turn of events, however, the European Union's leaders will be asking themselves whether a mission operating under such constraints can be effective.
"The ministers will be meeting tomorrow and they will be discussing this, how credible can the mission be if the country is throwing out the man picked to lead it," a European Union spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach, said in an interview. 
Leaders in the region have encouraged Mr. Mugabe to welcome observers and ensure that the election is free and fair, and today a senior South African official said European observers would best serve that objective by remaining in Zimbabwe.
"I think it would be sad if they leave," the official, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, said in an interview on South African national television. "I think it would be a mistake. I think the Zimbabwean people are hoping that the presence of observers from many countries, including the E.U. countries, will allow them to exercise their democratic right."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: OTTAWA; 
Canada Alters Security Policies to Ease Concerns of U.S.

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Feb. 15 

 BODY:
Canada has thoroughly overhauled its security policy since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, tightening coordination with Washington in military, intelligence and law enforcement matters while easing its traditional concerns over privacy and other civil liberties.
 The effects of this major change stretch from cyberspace, where the government can now freely intercept e-mail in terrorism investigations, to Afghanistan, where more than 750 Canadian troops are in combat operations under American operational control for the first time since the Korean War. 
 Recently enacted antiterrorism laws have given the Canadian police expanded wiretap powers, and law enforcement officers can now detain anyone for up to 72 hours without a warrant on suspicion of terrorism. Financing for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the principal spy agency, is now set to rise 30 percent over the next five years. 
The military and security budgets have also been increased to stem more than a decade of deterioration in Canada's military power. The increases will pay for antiterrorism and commando squads and for planning to respond to biological, chemical and nuclear attacks.
The shift in policies has come in part from a desire to reassure the United States that Canada is not a sanctuary for terrorists exploiting this country's liberal refugee laws and porous border. But it also reflects the economic shock that Canada suffered late last year when long border and port delays throttled Canadian exports to the United States, by far its largest customer.
"Both our pride and our interests demand that we close the northern door of the continent, and the government is trying to do that," said David Bercuson, director of the Center for Military and Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary. "The effort will ultimately bring as much of a change to the way we see ourselves and our relationship with the United States as the free trade agreement" of 1989, which cut Canadian tariffs to integrate the two economies.
The changes have caused lively debates in Parliament, where lawmakers have contended that Prime Minister Jean Chretien has sacrificed Canada's sovereignty and liberal traditions to satisfy the security needs of the United States.
But opinion polls and several public demonstrations expressing support for the United States after Sept. 11 suggest that the political landscape may be shifting to the most pro-American stance since the early years of the cold war. 
The attacks, said Michael Theilmann, director of the counterterrorism division of the solicitor general's office, "made the unimaginable now imaginable -- that mass-casualty attacks are a possibility that we need to plan for."
In this staid Victorian-style capital, it is no longer possible to drive up Parliament Hill without a police search. A permanent no-flight zone has been created over Parliament and the prime minister's residence and traffic has been directed away from the United States Embassy.
Last week, United States and Canadian counterintelligence officials conducted their largest joint exercise since 1989 -- a simulation of a simultaneous mass anthrax attack on Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle. Officials from 14 Canadian and 11 American agencies concluded that more work needed to be done on coordinating public emergency instructions and the use of emergency workers and resources.
Canada has been a concern to American policy makers since a Montreal-based Algerian named Ahmed Ressam, suspected of being a follower of Osama bin Laden, tried to enter Port Angeles, Wash., from Canada in late 1999. He had 130 pounds of explosives in his car, apparently to bomb the Los Angeles airport during millennium celebrations.
There is no evidence that any people involved in the Sept. 11 attacks entered the United States from Canada. But United States officials continue to press Canada to bolster security along the 5,500-mile border and to increase military spending.
American officials express satisfaction with several Canadian policy changes, including putting marshals on all flights to Washington, D.C., and altering privacy laws to let Canadian airlines share with American officials the names and personal information of passengers en route to the United States.
United States officials also commend the Canadian government for reassigning 2,000 officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to antiterrorism and patrol missions along the border. The Mounties are the only police in much of Canada. 
In an agreement signed in December, officials of the two countries pledged to coordinate visa policies so people rejected by one country could not be accepted for entrance by the other, to expand joint border patrols and to use compatible biometrics technology on travel documents to scan thumbprints digitally to identify suspicious travelers.
"We're making lots of progress," said a senior Bush administration official. "They have done a lot, yes, but at the same time, they have a lot to do, and they know it."
Many terrorism experts say that Canada's liberal refugee and immigration policies are of particular concern. These include Quebec's enduring efforts to increase its French-speaking population by encouraging immigration from Algeria and other French-speaking countries.
In Canada, as in many other Western countries, those who claim that they would be tortured or otherwise persecuted if sent home are given refugee status. The refugees are then entitled to hearings on whether permanent asylum is granted, but a large percentage of claimants do not show up. According to a report in The Vancouver Sun, immigration officials have not been able to find half the 40,632 people ordered deported.
When asked specifically about the presence of members of Al Qaeda in Canada, Ward Elcock, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, said in a recent interview, "It's a particularly tough group to target and get inside."
But Canada is taking steps to tighten immigration and refugee policies, including more rigorous screening of people who claim refugee status and stepped up detentions and deportations of claimants suspected of being security risks. The government is also instituting a fraud-resistant cards for permanent residents, which immigrants must show if they apply for social services or want to leave the country.
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled last month that refugees who are suspected terrorists can be promptly deported even if they claim they face torture in their home countries. Immigration officials recently issued warrants for more than 100 people, most from Middle Eastern countries, who came to Canada as students but never attended classes.
For all the safeguards, Canadians remain wary about getting too close to the United States. There have been particularly heated debates in the Commons about Canadian troops in Afghanistan handing prisoners over to Americans.
"Was the prime minister not imprudent in allowing the handover of prisoners, without having in advance obtained firm assurances that the Americans would respect the Geneva Conventions?" asked the Bloc Quebecois leader, Gilles Duceppe, during a recent question period. 
Mr. Chretien shot back that the party's lawmakers had "become defenders of the terrorists" for not backing the government 100 percent in a time of war.

PERSON: John E. Bebout 

HEADLINE: John E. Bebout, 98, Expert on State Constitutions 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
John E. Bebout, an expert on state constitutions, died on Feb. 1 in Hyannis, Mass. He was 98 and lived in Wellfleet, Mass.
 He was involved in the seven-year struggle that led in 1947 to a replacement for New Jersey's Constitution, which critics had called a horse-and-buggy document. The new Constitution gave more scope and responsibility to the executive branch. 
 Mr. Bebout (pronounced BEE-bowt) was the executive vice president of the New Jersey Constitution Foundation and an aide to Gov. Charles A. Edison Jr.
He was an adviser in the drafting of Constitutions for the new states of Alaska and Hawaii and assisted with changes in those of Missouri and Rhode Island.
He was staff director of New York's Temporary State Commission on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution in 1959, when it advocated a broad expansion of local home-rule powers in the state.
He believed that constitutional changes could make local as well as state governments more efficient, economical and responsible. He worked to eliminate what he saw as antiquated restrictions that reflected 19th-century concerns about corruption in state governments.
Mr. Bebout, who was trained as a political scientist, was a professor at Rutgers and the director of its Urban Studies Center from 1960 to 1969. He also taught at New York University, the University of Texas, Western Reserve University and elsewhere before retiring from his teaching and consulting work in the mid-1970's.
He was a co-author of "Where Cities Meet: The Urbanization of New Jersey," published in 1964. 
John Elber Bebout was born in Westwood, N.J., grew up in Long Hill, N.J., and graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers. He received a master's degree in political science from Rutgers and did further graduate work in political science at Princeton and Columbia.
His wife, the former Ann Reed, died last year.
He is survived by two sons, Hugh of Newton, N.J., and John of North Eastham, Mass.; two daughters, Judith Bebout of Stockton, N.J., and Alice Bebout of Lambertville, N.J.; a sister, Betty Harrington of Cape May, N.J.; four stepgrandchildren; and five stepgreat-grandchildren.

Benitez Returns Home to Help Children Build Dreams

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 17 

 BODY:
The house on a dusty road in San Pedro de Macoris was made of cinder blocks and had one room, a place about the size of a garage. It had no windows, no electricity and no running water. But what looked like another eyesore in the Dominican Republic was, to Armando Benitez, the home he loved. It still is.
 Benitez, 29, has never forgotten that home, a place where he managed to live comfortably with his parents and his brothers in harsh conditions and a place where he began throwing the pebbles that turned into the fastballs he now throws for the Mets. When Benitez thinks about his roots, his initial thoughts do not zoom to the Dominican Republic. He thinks on a smaller scale, recalling the humble cinder-block dwelling. 
 "That's what my house was like," he said in a telephone interview on Saturday. "I'm not embarrassed by it." 
Hardly. Benitez is intensely proud of the home his family still owns and the neighborhood where he grew up and still migrates to after the season ends. Benitez sees the children on the street and is not stunned that some of the younger ones are naked. He knows their families cannot afford to purchase clothes they will quickly grow out of. Benitez sees these indigent children and the teenage boys who love baseball and therefore love him, and he thinks of his poor past and how he could make life easier for some fellow Dominicans.
So Benitez found ways. He hired dozens of workers for his 4,200-acre ranch that teems with livestock. He built several apartment complexes so the people would have affordable places to live. And, three months ago, Benitez mimicked Kevin Costner and built his own field of dreams, across the street from his childhood home. Now the neighborhood children, like Benitez, have a home, a baseball home, they will fondly remember.
"It's very important to me because I grew up in this area," he said. "I have to help these guys. It's a way for me to show the kids that if I did it, they can do it. I take the kids out of trouble and get them to play baseball like they can."
Benitez is not at spring training yet and he has received scrutiny because he is the only pitcher who will report after the voluntary workout date of last Saturday. The Mets are disappointed that Benitez is missing three workouts for personal reasons, but they have exhibited public support. More scrutiny will follow Benitez this year because he is an overpowering closer with a tendency to evaporate in pivotal games. Remember last September's two debacles against the Atlanta Braves?
The image of Benitez on the Mets is one of a scowling, talented, sensitive, strong and sometimes childish pitcher. He pumps his fist after strikeouts. He can get perturbed when he is asked about a blown save. He is reserved and trusts few people. The image of Benitez in San Pedro is drastically different. He is bubbly and relaxed, a successful entrepreneur whose business interests help support more than 200 people. He is also the savior who built the most gorgeous field in town.
Benitez navigated his all-terrain vehicle over a series of bumpy roads last month, leading to a dead-end street where he told Bobby Valentine to exit. Valentine, the Mets' manager, accepted Benitez's invitation to see his ranch in the Dominican Republic because he realized Benitez "wanted to share something with me that was special to him." After seeing the ranch, Valentine thought they were stopping for a beer. Instead, they parked near Benitez's old house. Across from it sat a new field.
"We got out and you could tell what the economic climate of the area was and, voila, you looked out and there was this beautiful, Met-blue field," Valentine said. "It was ridiculous to see that among all the poverty. I'm getting chills just thinking about it again."
With a sheepish glance, Benitez told Valentine, "Let me show you my field."
Benitez spent $40,000 to build the field so the children would come. And they come every day. Benitez selected 45 players and hired coaches to help him instruct them. The workouts start at 8 a.m., and the practices and games stretch for 10 or 12 hours. The players do not want to leave their new home. The pristine field has concrete dugouts, batting cages and bullpens beside the outfield lines, shower rooms and a coating of fresh chalk on the foul lines seven days a week. The kids call it Field 49, Benitez's number with the Mets.
"They seem excited," Benitez said. "They told me nobody did anything for them. Everyone talks about doing it. I did it."
No one in the stands at Shea Stadium will care about Field 49 the first time No. 49 botches an important save. Benitez is judged for what he does on the field, like every other major leaguer. For now, the two games that Benitez failed to save against Atlanta, not the 43 he saved or the field he built, are what will surely dangle over him while he is away from home.
"I don't think about those Braves games," he said. "I got 46 chances; I got 43 saves. Only three blown saves. What closer can do that? I'm human. Sometimes, you're on the field and you got a headache. Or your back is sore, your neck is sore. What can I say? I'm human."
He is human. On and off the field.

HEADLINE: Trend Reduces Role of Blacks At Graveside 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
Once or twice a year, an acquaintance calls John Campbell from Detroit, just to chat. How's he doing? How's business? Blah blah blah. 
 "When he hears everything's fine and I'm happy, he doesn't need to talk any more," Mr. Campbell said. "He's waiting to hear that I'm not happy." 
 Mr. Campbell owns and operates the busiest African-American funeral home in Mercer County, and his occasional caller represents a national chain that wants to buy him out. He's not the only one getting friendly queries. Over the last decade or so, the phones have been ringing at black-owned funeral homes across the country, as many of the owners -- whose children have a much bigger range of career opportunities than they did -- are saying yes to the chains.
"The owners on the minority side of the funeral business may do $2 million a year in sales, but they don't get to see $2 million waved in front of their face at one time," said Gregory Burrell, who is black and who recently bought the Terry Funeral Home in West Philadelphia, which was family-owned for generations. "So if you're 65 years old and you've worked at this business for 40 years and you have no children to take over, that $2 million looks like a wonderful deal."
The buyout offers certainly are not unique to black owners, and consolidation is even a running theme in "Six Feet Under," the satirical HBO series about a funeral home owned by a white family. But Mr. Burrell and other African-Americans say the impact is more acute in close-knit communities like their own, where they say people still know their neighbors and loyally patronize locally owned businesses.
"We need African-American businesses in our community, whether it's the funeral business or the barber shop or a lawyer's office," said the Rev. Stanley Justice, pastor of Mount Zion A.M.E. Church here. "It helps take away the whole idea of blacks not being able to make it in corporate America."
The Rev. DeForest Soaries Jr., a former New Jersey secretary of state and the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens, in Somerset, agreed. "The black funeral home is one of the few traditions that is both an economic and a family tradition," he said. "When their ownership passes to a corporation in another city or another state, it can only be a loss to us."
The movement toward consolidation in the funeral business reached its peak about five years ago, when two publicly traded giants, Service Corporation International, of Houston, and what was then the Loewen Group Inc., of Canada, acquired clusters of funeral homes around the country, seeking profits from economies of scale by centralizing services like embalming and transportation.
Over the years the number of funeral homes and crematories nationally has grown some, rising from 14,900 in 1990 to 16,500 in 1997, the latest year for which federal estimates are available.
But the number of homes owned by blacks has fallen, from about 3,100 a decade ago to 2,700 today, according to Miriam E. Pipes, publisher of The Purple Directory, which lists African-American undertakers. Her figures are only estimates, though, she cautioned, because it has become difficult to keep track of the takeovers.
"Companies like the Loewen Group took over so many, but they don't let you know which ones," Ms. Pipes said. "They buy them up and leave the black people in there and they do a black business, but I don't know if you can call them black the way they used to be."
The national chains like the minority market because African-American and other minority communities have generally maintained traditional, and expensive, funerals, while whites have been turning more and more to comparatively inexpensive cremations.
To take advantage of the lucrative minority market, the Loewen Group formed a partnership with the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., the country's biggest association of African-American congregations, to help it acquire and operate black funeral homes.
The Loewen Group eventually was undone by its business approach, and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, re-emerging just last month as the Alderwoods Group.
Mark Utting, the communications director for Alderwoods, whose stock is traded on the Nasdaq market and which has 920 homes and 275 cemeteries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, suggested that his company had learned a lesson about the importance of being service oriented as well as being large.
The company's failure was no surprise to Mr. Campbell, or to some others familiar with the industry.
"This is nothing but a personal-service business," Mr. Campbell said. "And particularly in our community, you have to be ready to perform services" that funeral homes in non-black communities do not traditionally handle.
He said, for instance, that he has served as executor for the estates of several families and helped new widows arrange for Social Security benefits.
The loss of local control, however, often leaves former owners, who now only manage a business belonging to a distant corporation, unable to do things the way they used to.
"Sometimes you have to tell Mrs. Jones you can't give her a particular service because you're working on quotas or you have central embalming, or you don't have your own fleet of cars anymore."said Sharon Seay, executive director of the National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, a trade association that includes chains but whose members are mostly independent black funeral directors." Mr. Burrell, who bought the 63-year-old Terry Funeral Home two years ago, said that he is constantly faced with the suspicion that he is merely a front for white owners.
"I ran into it just the other night," Mr. Burrell said. "A man said, 'I hear a white man owns the Terry Funeral Home,' and I said, 'You're looking at the white man.' "

HEADLINE: Revival of Betting Tradition Leads to Division in Saratoga 

BYLINE:  By DAN BARRY 

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y., Feb. 14 

 BODY:
There was a time when illegal slot machines beckoned from the back rooms of Broadway here. A conspiratorial nod to the proprietor was about all you needed to find one, its body pregnant with coins that might tumble into your hat with a single pull of its come-hither arm.
 A few of those Saratoga slots survived an order of destruction a half-century ago, and serve now as sturdy reminders of this community's historic embrace of gambling. That is what helped to lure the betting barons of the 19th century; that is why the gangsters who ran minicasinos along Saratoga Lake -- Luciano, Lansky and others -- might as well have joined the Rotary. Everyone was wise to it, and most everyone got along. 
 Oh, for those harmonious days of tolerance. 
A state proposal to revive this small city's failing harness racetrack with hundreds of video lottery terminals, many of them mimicking the spinning fruits of the old slots, recently split Saratoga Springs to reveal how much the city has changed, from a gilt-edged gambling town to an oasis for the cultured and refined. The verbal jockeying here also hinted of divisive times to come around the state, as New York lurches toward a new era of legalized gambling as an economic development tool.
The Pataki administration argues that New York residents spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year in the casinos of other states, then return home with pockets emptied and, in some cases, gambling problems intact. "We get none of the positives and all of the negatives," said Michael McKeon, spokesman for Gov. George E. Pataki. "This way we can balance the scales."
But in Saratoga Springs, those scales were knocked over in a battle whose lines were roughly drawn by that most persistent distinction, class. Opposed were the Chamber of Commerce president, the college president, the mayor and various county elders. They said the proposal would hurt the economy, seduce students and endanger the city's delicate mix of culture and fun. In favor were local farmers and the harness track's trainers and employees. They saw the potential for more jobs and the preservation of a way of life in Saratoga County, a mostly rural stretch of 200,000 people about 30 miles north of Albany.
The proponents also detected a certain elitism, as when Joseph Dalton, the president of the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, was quoted as saying that the terminals were unlikely to attract the drivers of Cadillacs. Instead, he said, "It's going to be the person driving the five-year-old Honda."
All in all, these past few months in the city have been painful, acknowledged Donald J. McCormack, a political science professor and the dean of special programs at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs. "It's been a hard kind of a cultural clash."
These days, Saratoga Springs prefers to emphasize its dance recitals, its concerts, and a slots-free Broadway of upscale restaurants, shops and inns. True, it also eagerly promotes the thoroughbred racing at Saratoga Race Course in late summer, when men in linen suits and women in floppy hats bet on races and buy blurred-brown streaks on canvas that, when seen through squinted eyes, might look like horses in full gallop. Still, city officials say, this event lasts only six weeks.
But there is the city's other race track. It is a year-round track for harness racing -- sort of like chariot races at a trot -- that has been operating for more than 60 years, and dying for the last 20. Nothing, not even the fancy name of the Saratoga Equine Sports Center, seemed able to save the track.
Then, late last summer, the Pataki administration began floating ways to generate more revenue in a shrinking economy: why not install slot -- err, video lottery terminals -- at some of the state's racetracks?
The Sept. 11 terror attacks forced the state and a scrum of lobbyists to set aside the issue for a while, but by late October the proposal had resurfaced, wrapped in an applied glow of post-terrorism urgency. Mr. Pataki soon signed into law a broad expansion of gambling that allowed for more Indian-run casinos, the state's enlistment in a multistate lottery and the installation of video lottery terminals at various racetracks around the state.
Critics charge that the new law violates the State Constitution, but the governor's aides say the plan is perfectly legal. They say the terminals are not slot machines, in which a gambler plays against an individual machine. The terminals are more like dressed-up lottery tickets, they say, all connected to a statewide system monitored by the state lottery division.
They estimate that the terminals will bring $61 million to the state in their first year of operation, and $175 million in the second year. In addition, they say, millions more will be generated for the racetracks, increasing purses, creating hundreds of jobs and preserving a chunk of the state's cherished agricultural industry.
For every benefit trumpeted, though, a question is raised. Would the terminals attract tourists from faraway states and counties, or would they attract the locals? And if the locals spend their money on the terminals, would that mean money not spent in local restaurants, on needed car repairs, on children's clothing?
Many studies have suggested that gambling is often more of a drain than a boon for a local economy. But neither the Pataki administration nor the State Legislature conducted any study on the plan's socioeconomic impact on places like Batavia, Monticello and the neighborhoods around Aqueduct Raceway in Queens. 
Saratoga Springs, at least, was one of the locations in the state where the county Board of Supervisors would be allowed to vote on whether to permit video lottery terminals. But that opportunity wound up pitting residents against one another in a battle over the county's future. The two sides railed at public hearings, on the radio and in the newspapers. "Pompous and self-serving team up against video lottery terminals," steamed the headline on a recent letter to The Saratogian, next to another letter that said the terminals were "bad for our families."
On Wednesday, Ken Klotz, an academic adviser at Skidmore who holds the part-time position of mayor, laid out his opposition between hurried sips from a bowl of soup in his City Hall office. Foremost was the matter of that "delicate balance" in Saratoga Springs, with its rows of well-preserved, 19th-century storefronts, dotted here and there with a Gap, a Borders, a Banana Republic. The city has succeeded where most other upstate cities and towns have failed, and has become, in the parlance of the tourism industry, a destination.
"But is that delicate balance in danger of being disrupted by the slot machines at the Saratoga Equine Sports Center?" he asked, with an inflection suggesting that the obvious answer was yes.
An hour later, a horse trainer named Mickey McGivern was bent over in a stable behind the harness track, brushing the brown coat of a filly named No Fine Print. He acknowledged the awkwardness of needing one form of gambling, video lottery terminals, to support another form, harness racing. But he said that without those terminals, the track would close, putting a lot of good people out of work.
Here's how bad things are, he said: No Fine Print finished in the money in more than half of the 30 races she ran last year. Her winnings totaled $7,000, while it costs about $12,000 to feed and groom her. The other day she ran fifth in a race and won $85, from which the driver and groom each get a cut.
"It wasn't a lucrative day," Mr. McGivern said. But if the day's purses had been augmented by an infusion of money from as many as 1,000 video lottery terminals inside the track's pavilion, well then, that would have been a horse of another color -- green.
On Wednesday night, Mr. McGivern and nearly 100 other horse people watched nervously as the county's 23 supervisors -- sitting at tables in the appropriate formation of a horseshoe -- cast their votes in what one supervisor said would be among the most important decisions in county history.
It wasn't even close. As soon as the board finished voting, the audience gave their elected officials a standing ovation for allowing the ching-ching of video lottery terminals to sound in Saratoga Springs by the end of the year.
The approval came as little surprise to most people in Saratoga Springs, including Martha Stonequist. A musicologist by trade and the city's historian by choice, she is old enough to remember seeing patrons of a local plumbing store hurrying to a back room. At first she was puzzled, but then she got wise.
As for slots -- err, video lottery terminals -- at the harness track, she had only one reaction: "It was inevitable."

HEADLINE: Pataki Defends Record Before Black and Hispanic Legislators 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
In an evening that reflected the highly charged racial and ethnic politics of this year's gubernatorial election, Gov. George E. Pataki spoke to a convention of black and Hispanic legislators here tonight and expressed regret that he had not come in the past.
 "There are those who said I should have attended this event before," Mr. Pataki said, addressing a crowd of more than 1,200 at the annual dinner during the statewide meeting of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. "To those, I say, you're right," he added. "But it's not so much what we say at this dinner tonight. It's what we do after this. I'm proud of what we've done over the last seven years." 
 In his remarks, which lasted about five minutes, Mr. Pataki described his desire to allow the mayor of New York City to control the Board of Education, and said policies he had instituted since 1994 had strengthened the state's economy.
 "I'm doing my best to make sure that I am the governor of all the people," he said, adding that officials can make sure that the life of every child and of every citizen of the state is better. "Let's make sure it's not just rhetoric at a dinner," Mr. Pataki said.
Mr. Pataki's remarks were met with polite applause from the black and Hispanic elected officials and other invited guests attending the dinner.
Some listeners said they found it ironic, or at least politically calculating, for Mr. Pataki, a Republican, to attend the conference during the same election year when one of the Democratic candidates, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, was making a bid to become the state's first black governor. Mr. McCall also attended the convention.
Still, Mr. Pataki's presence was hailed by many of the legislators, who said that it was better to have the governor address the group than to stay away.
"I think it's a great thing," said Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr., a Democrat from the Bronx. "I think this is the way it should be, regardless of political ideology or political party. Of course, it's wrong that he has not been here before. But if we hope to have dialogue with people and change their perspectives on issues, we can't complain when they finally do come."
He added, "It's never too late to begin dialogue."
United States Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens, called the evening "an opportunity for the governor and the communities of color around the state to come together, to hear each other."
But, echoing many who saw another motive behind Mr. Pataki's appearance, Mr. Meeks added, "It's clearly the political season and there are political motivations involved. The governor is a political animal and a lot of politics is involved in his decision. But I think the black and Latino community is sophisticated enough to understand that. And they will support Carl McCall this year, no matter what."
Carl E. Heastie, an assemblyman from the Bronx, also praised Mr. Pataki's decision to attend the dinner. "I hope he is not just coming here for show and ceremony," said Mr. Heastie, a Democrat. "I hope he will listen more intently to the African-American and Latino communities. I hope he will agree to provide more money for education in New York City and across the state. Whether there is substance behind his being here remains to be seen. And I don't think he will diminish the fact that this is a Carl McCall weekend here."
In fact, at every turn during the various events during the conference this weekend, Mr. McCall was treated like a conquering hero by the hundreds of elected officials and other guests. Mr. McCall, who is an ordained minister, also offered a rousing sermon at a religious service this morning.
While Mr. McCall was a fixture at the conference, playing host to receptions and shaking hands throughout the weekend, his opponent for the Democratic nomination, Andrew M. Cuomo, a former United States housing secretary, was less visible.
Mr. Cuomo, who attended a few receptions this evening, said he considered it important to have a presence here, acknowledging that many of the officials and guests were supporting Mr. McCall. "I have a few friends and supporters here," Mr. Cuomo said. "There will be different opinions about who should prevail in the primary. But we come together as Democrats when it's all over."
Mr. McCall was greeted with ovations. "We're glad our new friends are here," he said, in his speech following the governor. "But let's make sure we remember the distinction between our new friends and our true friends. Let us remember the distinction between people who show up for the first time in an election year, but who haven't been here before."
Mr. Pataki, speaking to reporters after his speech, denied that there were political considerations attached to his decision to attend.
"It's not a question of wooing votes," he said. "It's about having policies that help all the people of this state. I'm very proud of what we've accomplished."

HEADLINE: Next Door to Two Shadows; 
Residents Near Towers Await Move Back to Unknown

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The floor vibrates as the cranes outside chew at the remains of the World Trade Center. Plywood covers the shattered windows. A musty, burning odor hangs in the air. The pipes leak.
 Kathleen Moore, dressed head to toe in a white "bunny suit," the kind that hazardous-materials workers wear, steps gingerly through dust piles, mounds of singed papers and the scattered detritus filling her beloved loft at 125 Cedar Street, the closest apartment building to what were the twin towers. 
 Somehow, the noises outside and the mess at her feet make it feel as if she and her neighbors have been propelled into the past, back 25 years to when they first moved into this dilapidated turn-of-the-century former office building. 
Back then, they did most of the renovation work themselves, hammering, plastering, whatever it took. Urban pioneers, they considered themselves, carving out a place like no other in the city, a place in the shadows of two towers that people would come to at once love and hate.
But for the artists and other tenants of 125 Cedar, one block south of ground zero, the sights and sounds of demolition and construction in and around the building do not just echo the past. They herald the future, a future of recovery, rebuilding and redefinition that both excites and worries them.
"It was nice being in the shadows of those two huge buildings; now I don't know what it's going to be like," said Ms. Moore, one of 125 Cedar's original residents , who now wakes with a start from dreams of walking through the trade center. "There's no emotion I can put my finger on. We lost more than the towers. We lost something else, indescribable. To look at the site now, my mind cannot grasp it."
The residents are, to some extent, eager to hear all the talk by civic planners and politicians about redeveloping the 16-acre hole left by the trade center's destruction, of once and for all building the kind of downtown that would attract businesses and residents, cultural institutions and more. It is an eagerness to bear witness to a powerfully emotional revival.
But for some there is also anxiety about the unknown and the fear of losing a special place, of losing their former sense of lovely isolation, of losing a neighborhood whose charm came in part from the very oddity of its location in a financial district. There was also the distinction of having the city's tallest buildings as neighbors.
"This was a neighborhood to me," said Jil Mohr, standing amid the dust and debris in her apartment and trying to explain her mixed feelings about coming back. "I never really thought of it as at the trade center." 
All around them, in places like Battery Park City, residents are fleeing downtown. The eclectic band of tenants at 125 Cedar, however, still have an esprit de corps; all but one have vowed to return, from the lady with the birds on the 12th floor to the two Rons with their pet lizards and snakes to the guy who ran the antique kilims gallery on the roof and the several artists who sometimes drew inspiration from the towers.
But their resolve has been challenged in the last five months by the deepening reality of a neighborhood devastated -- the little Greek Orthodox church down the street gone, the Amish Market food store gone, the shopping mall in the trade center concourse gone, not to mention the aura of thousands of lives lost in their backyard.
There have been struggles with insurance inspectors, disputes with the landlord over cleaning up the apartments, negotiations with the recovery bureaucracy, questions about the safety of the air, the discovery that some of their apartments had been looted, possibly by workmen or emergency workers who moved freely through the building in the months after the attack. (The building owner has since installed chains and padlocks on the doors.)
One tenant, the photographer Dianne Blell, has scrawled on her door: "Whomsoever enters my space could you please have the breeding and decency to respect it and not snoop at my work and shut the windows, etc."
They live in one of the few apartment buildings still off limits to reoccupancy because of proximity to ground zero or to other damaged buildings. The waiting -- without knowing when they can move back -- has taxed their patience.
The building's owner, Samson Management, attributes much of the delay in cleaning the building to the limited access to the site allowed by the authorities -- residents must pass two police checkpoints to visit their apartments, and the street is blocked to vehicles -- as well as to negotiations with its insurance company over the amount of money it will give for the work.
Samson has told tenants not to expect to return before August or September, though they are striving to make it before then.
Some tenants have shifted from one temporary apartment to the next, living with friends or leasing apartments nearby. Some have plunged into their work, while others can scarcely muster the energy. Always, they wonder, when can they go back? And to what?
For many, returning is a simple matter of economics. The building is rent stabilized (rents range from about $800 to just under $2,000). The spacious, sunny lofts facing Liberty Street are lined with nearly 20 windows each. Such a deal is not easily found in Manhattan these days.
And for others, particularly those who were away from the buildings when the planes struck and did not endure a harrowing escape, there is excitement over renewal.
When the building was first converted to residential use, the area was devoid of stores and other amenities. But in the past decade, the World Trade Center mall came alive with new stores as chains like Borders moved in. Sure, it gave the area a dash of Middle America, but the convenience was not to be denied. As several other buildings converted to residences, people took pleasure in living in a suddenly hot area.
"Now, I think it will be exciting to be back down there," said Elaine Williamson, a teacher who has lived in the building with her husband, Ron, for 19 years. "I think it will be like another rebirth."
But the tenants expect a difficult labor, fraught with uncertainty over the safety of the area and the uncertainty of what is to come.
The severely damaged 40-story Deutsche Bank building next door may have to be torn down if a mold infestation cannot be stopped. Other buildings may have to be stripped and gutted to be thoroughly cleaned. It makes everybody edgy to think what their building may have to undergo, even as most tenants have tossed out many of their possessions.
Beyond that, they must consider with conflicted feelings the neighborhood and the new atmosphere that may come to prevail there.
Peter Davies, a tenant who has operated a rooftop gallery of antique kilims at 125 Cedar for 24 years, has tried to imagine the future. Would customers who had marveled at the blinking lights of the trade center from his terrace come now?
"I think it will be, unfortunately, a draw," Mr. Davies has concluded, "just like the observation deck on Fulton Street" overlooking the remains of the trade center. "People have that morbid fascination."
Over the past several months, optimism has settled over Mr. Davies. As much as he relished the cachet of his commanding perch in the financial quarter, he also found the area, particularly the trade center plaza, sterile, cold and unwelcoming.
He sent in an application -- without a response -- to sit on one of the advisory committees of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is in charge of rebuilding. He wanted to ensure that neighborhood amenities for residents, like the weekly greenmarket, come back.
Others have sought to come to grips with the loss of life; they wonder how much of the dust in their apartments contained pulverized human remains. Part of the coping means not brooding over it. 
" I still feel sad," said Mary Dierickx, a preservation consultant who has lived in the building for 22 years. "I still have enough post-traumatic stress disorder that I startle when engines make the right pitch. I am not really thrilled with the damaged Deutsche Bank out my windows to the west and knowing it's a graveyard out the north windows. But I can't concentrate on that, I can't make that what I dwell on. It is about life going on. It is about rebuilding."
Some tenants agree, but they note that everybody is 25 years older than the last time they revived the building. Making a statement or symbol of coming back is surely laudable, they say, but doing so under the lingering stress of the attacks and in such an uncertain environment is another thing altogether.
"This is not what we expected to be doing, going back to ground zero to rebuild while everybody is rebuilding around you," said Andy Jurinko, who has lived in the building for nearly 25 years. "It's like living what they said about the Soviet Union, like being in a puzzle inside an enigma."

HEADLINE: Labor Talks At United Air Make Progress 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
United Airlines and the union representing its machinists are progressing on a new contract for 12,800 mechanics and cleaners before a Wednesday strike deadline, the union said.
 The union told members on Saturday that talks had touched on all remaining issues since discussions resumed on Friday. Negotiators are meeting in Chicago. 
 "It seems to be going in the right direction," Tom Reardon, an assistant general chairman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said in an interview. "Right now, it's a game of brinkmanship, who's going to blink first."
United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has declined to comment on the status of the talks.
An agreement would ward off a strike at United, which had a record $2.1 billion loss last year as travel demand fell because of the recession and the Sept. 11 attacks. UAL's chairman and chief executive, John W. Creighton Jr., has said the company will need several billion dollars of concessions from labor groups in the next few years to stem losses.
According to Mr. Reardon, United told employees last week that it had hired a bankruptcy lawyer in case of a strike. A walkout may push the airline into a Chapter 11 filing, some analysts have said. Ticket reservations have dropped for next week because of the strike threat, the company said.
Last week the machinists' union advised members to remove their tool boxes and other items from company property after their last shift; if a strike occurred, they might not be able to retrieve them.
The two sides have been negotiating since December 1999 and had sought an agreement by July 2000, when the contract was opened for changes. President Bush appointed an emergency board in December to postpone a strike for 60 days and review the dispute.
Last Wednesday, the workers rejected the tentative contract proposed by the panel. That agreement would have given the most senior mechanics a 37 percent pay increase this year, to $35.14 an hour, with an additional 3.9 percent increase next year and 2.8 percent increase in 2004.

HEADLINE: For Improvement Districts, Restored Alliance With City 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
He was once so vocal and visible that some people described him as the mayor of Midtown. But Daniel A. Biederman has tried to keep his head down ever since an actual mayor decided he was becoming too powerful and forced him to resign in 1998 as president of the Grand Central Partnership, one of the three business improvement districts under his leadership.
 Mr. Biederman's strained relations with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spilled over to the city's other 43 BID's. From 1999 on, the city froze their budgets, refusing to let the property owners who made up their membership raise their assessments, even when they wanted to spend more of their own money on services like cleaning streets and sprucing up their neighborhoods. 
 Fearing punishment similar to Mr. Biederman's if they spoke out, most BID managers quietly cut back on personnel and services and kept their complaints largely to themselves. "Nobody ever wants to criticize the mayor of New York," Mr. Biederman said.
These days, however, City Hall has been sending a very different message to the BID's, groups of property owners who supplement city services like sanitation and security and promote businesses in their districts. In his preliminary budget, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed cuts in several agencies, including the Parks and Police Departments. He has said that in tough economic times, BID's will be needed to fill in gaps in city services and should be strengthened. To reinforce the point, Mr. Bloomberg put a former executive director of the 14th Street-Union Square BID, Robert Walsh, in charge of the Department of Business Services, the city agency that oversees BID's. 
Mr. Walsh, who takes office as commissioner next week, said in a telephone interview that the city's BID's were once viewed across the country as pioneers but have been "running in place" in recent years because of the budget freeze and restrictive rules imposed by the city.
"We've made the BID's jump through many more hoops than they should have to in doing new, creative programs," said Mr. Walsh, who is returning to New York after five years as the leader of a downtown association in Charlotte, N.C. "We need to shift the agency away from constantly looking over their shoulders. If we have confidence in them, we need simply to get out of the way."
He said the city also wanted to make it easier for BID's to expand, or for new groups to form. By law, a BID can be formed if 49.5 percent of the property owners agree; but in practice, the city has set the bar much higher, at about 70 percent. The city started getting tougher with BID's after several of them ran into trouble. In 1995, members of a social services group employed by the Grand Central Partnership were accused of assaulting homeless people, and in 1997, the president of the Madison Avenue BID was forced to resign after he distributed a flier urging shopkeepers to remove valuables from their windows or to close during the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.
Mr. Walsh's appointment is being cheered by BID managers, but it does not necessarily spell good news for Mr. Biederman, whose contracts with the city expire at the end of June. Mr. Walsh said the city needed to determine whether Mr. Biederman should have to give up one of his two BID's.
For many of the business groups, the main priority now is getting more money. BID's support themselves by assessing charges for their members. Their budgets must be approved by the city, which collects the money as part of the tax bill. As a result of the budget freeze, several BID leaders said, they had to eliminate programs that sounded small but could sometimes do a lot to make an area more inviting. 
For example, the Fashion Center BID in Manhattan's garment center had to stop installing hanging baskets of geraniums and variegated ivy on lampposts, said Barbara Randall, the executive director. 
This year, the Fashion Center group will seek to raise its budget to $4 million from $3 million, in part so that it can add security patrols on weekends, when the neighborhood is filled with shoppers, Ms. Randall said.
In Harlem, the 125th Street BID will seek to augment its $275,000 budget by about $100,000 to improve security, said Barbara Askins, the group's president. The Metrotech BID in downtown Brooklyn, with a $2 million budget, is also likely to ask for an increase so that it can open a tourist center and expand its lunchtime concert series, said Michael Weiss, the executive director.
With a $7.5 million budget, the 34th Street Partnership, one of Mr. Biederman's remaining BID's, is one of the largest. Yet its programs have also suffered because of the budget freeze, Mr. Biederman said. "It's cut services substantially -- stuff that drives me crazy," he said. "All it does is make the problems worse in the long run."
About a dozen sanitation workers have been dismissed, lampposts are not being repainted as quickly as before and the district employs fewer bilingual students to help visitors find their way around.
Still, other work is going on. Two years ago, the group refurbished two small parks in the islands in Herald and Greeley Squares. A stickler for detail, Mr. Biederman also had pay toilets installed in Greeley Square because, he said, women would not frequent a park that smelled of urine.
This year, Mr. Biederman said, the 34th Street Partnership will seek a 12 percent budget increase. His other group, the Bryant Park BID, which gets revenue by renting out park space, is not seeking to raise its assessments, he said.
Despite Mr. Biederman's attempts at maintaining a lower profile, his relationship with the Giuliani administration kept deteriorating. 
Last year, city officials refused to renew his organizations' three-year contracts unless he agreed to give up one of the BID's. They also held up a $2 million check, forcing the 34th Street group to dip into reserve funds, he said. The check was delivered just as Mr. Giuliani was leaving office, and Mr. Biederman's groups were given six-month contracts that expire on June 30.
Mr. Walsh, the new commissioner of business services, praises Mr. Biederman's "track record of excellence," but acknowledges that he and Mr. Biederman are far from friendly. Several years ago, Mr. Walsh said, they quarreled over a proposed code of ethics for BID officials.
One policy issue that will have to be addressed soon is whether a BID leader should be allowed to operate more than one BID. "This is something we need to discuss as a city," Mr. Walsh said. But he added that the question was a tough one, given Mr. Biederman's reputation.
"It would be a lot easier if he weren't doing a good job," Mr. Walsh said.

HEADLINE: U.S. CORPORATIONS ARE USING BERMUDA TO SLASH TAX BILLS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A growing number of American companies, encouraged by their financial advisers, are incorporating in Bermuda to lower their taxes sharply without giving up the benefits of doing business in the United States.
 Insurance companies led the way, but now manufacturers and other kinds of companies are following. 
 Stanley Works, for 159 years a Connecticut maker of hammers and wrenches, is among the latest with plans to become a corporation in Bermuda, where there is no income tax. The company estimates that it will cut its tax bill by $30 million a year, to about $80 million.
Tyco International, a diversified manufacturer with headquarters in Exeter, N.H., says that being a Bermuda corporation saved it more than $400 million last year alone. Other companies that have incorporated in Bermuda or plan to do so include Global Crossing, a Beverly Hills, Calif., telecommunications company; Ingersoll-Rand and Foster Wheeler, both New Jersey industrial manufacturers; Nabors Industries, a Texas company that is the nation's largest oil well services company; and Cooper Industries, a Houston manufacturer of industrial equipment. 
Becoming a Bermuda company is a paper transaction, as easy as securing a mail drop there and paying some fees, while keeping the working headquarters back in the United States.
Bermuda is charging Ingersoll-Rand just $27,653 a year for a move that allows the company to avoid at least $40 million annually in American corporate income taxes.
The company is not required to conduct any meetings in Bermuda and will not even have an office there, said its chief financial officer, David W. Devonshire.
"We just pay a service organization" to accept mail, he said.
Kate Barton, an Ernst & Young tax partner, said that incorporating in Bermuda "is a megatrend we are seeing in the marketplace right now." Many corporations that are planning the move have not yet announced it, she said.
In a Webcast to clients, Ms. Barton cited patriotism as the only potentially troubling issue that corporations consider before moving to Bermuda, and she said that profits trumped patriotism.
"Is it the right time to be migrating a corporation's headquarters to an offshore location?" she asked. "And yet, that said, we are working through a lot of companies who feel that it is, that just the improvement on earnings is powerful enough that maybe the patriotism issue needs to take a back seat to that." 
The White House has said nothing about these moves and their effect on tax revenues. Mark A. Weinberger, chief of tax policy in the Treasury Department, said the moves to Bermuda and other tax havens showed that the American tax system might be driving companies to make such decisions. "We may need to rethink some of our international tax rules that were written 30 years ago when our economy was very different and that now may be impeding the ability of U.S. companies to compete internationally."
But others have expressed concern about the trend. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, expressed alarm. "There is no business reason for doing this, other than to escape U.S. taxation. I believe the Finance Committee needs to investigate this activity."
There is no official estimate of how much the Bermuda moves are costing the government in tax revenues, and the Bush administration is not trying to come up with one.
A Bermuda address is being recommended by many legal, accounting and investment advisers. Stanley Works, for example, relied on Ernst & Young for accounting advice, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom for legal advice, and Goldman, Sachs for investment advice.
Ingersoll-Rand's top tax officer, Gerald Swimmer, said all of the major investment houses and accounting firms had presented the idea to his company. Ingersoll-Rand expects its worldwide income taxes to fall to less than $115 million from about $155 million annually.
Many companies looking for tax havens abroad are choosing Bermuda because it is close, its political system is stable and it uses a legal system similar to that of the United States. But some, like Seagate Technology, the California maker of computer disk drives, have gone to the Cayman Islands and other places.
Insurers have also flocked to Bermuda to escape most insurance regulations, including how much money they must hold in reserve to pay claims.
Since companies that move to Bermuda usually keep their main offices in the United States, they continue to have all the security provided by the American government, the legal system and the courts. 
But by moving to Bermuda, their income from outside the United States becomes exempt from American taxes. Also, when the American company borrows from its Bermuda parent, the interest it pays creates a deduction that reduces U.S. taxes, but there is no tax on the interest earned by the Bermuda parent.
These companies say they are moving because their worldwide tax rates are higher than those of foreign competitors. Stanley Works expects its worldwide tax rate to fall to 23 percent to 25 percent of profits, down from 32 percent now, said Gerard J. Gould, Stanley's vice president for investor relations. 
Another company, Cooper Industries, expects to lower its worldwide income tax bill to $80 million from about $134 million. 
Robert Willens, a tax expert at Lehman Brothers, said that "any company with a decent amount of foreign income will see its tax rate fall dramatically" by moving its nominal headquarters to Bermuda.
"But the political considerations sometimes prevail," he added, "and companies are understandably reluctant to do something like this because it will not necessarily be properly construed in the marketplace. It may be seen as not patriotic and in the wake of Sept. 11, that is not a good posture for a company."
Mr. Willens said that he had personally presented the Bermuda idea to some companies and that the idea had been turned down for just that reason. "The companies most willing to do this are not household names," he said, "but Stanley Works is verging on a household name." 
Mr. Gould said Stanley Works, whose products can be found in many home toolboxes, had not received a single complaint that it was being unpatriotic. Only a few shareholders complained, he said, and all were longtime shareholders who will owe taxes on their capital gains if the deal is approved by two-thirds of the Stanley Works shareholders.
The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that shareholders must pay taxes on any increase in the value of their shares between the date they bought them and the date the company incorporated in Bermuda, even if they do not sell the shares. The government designed this rule to place a price on what it calls tax-motivated expatriation.
With the stock market depressed, Mr. Willens noted, interest in moving to Bermuda is up because fewer shareholders would owe capital gains. And even when a move to a tax haven occurs, the company is not required to report to the I.R.S. on the holdings of each stock owner. Only the integrity of individual taxpayers ensures that the taxes are paid, as is the case with any tax on capital gains.
"I am sure a few get missed," Mr. Willens said with a chuckle.
Peter L. Baumbusch, an international tax lawyer with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher in Washington, said current tax law discriminated against existing multinational corporations with headquarters in the United States.
David A. Weisbach, a University of Chicago professor of tax law, said the corporate moves to Bermuda should prompt Congress to review the American corporate tax regime, which was established when American companies sold primarily to the domestic market and few foreign companies had a major presence in the United States.
"Should we be taxing worldwide income or not?" he asked. "That is the really hard question."
Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the patriotism question also needed to be debated.
"Some companies flying the Stars and Stripes renounce America when it comes to paying their taxes," he said. "They choose profits over patriotism. So far, the Bush Treasury Department has shown no interest in stopping these corporate moves, or even drawing attention to them. Supporting America is more than about waving the flag and saluting -- it's about sharing the sacrifice. That's true of soldiers, citizens, and it should be true of big companies, too."

HEADLINE: Bush, in Tokyo, Hails Koizumi And Repeats Sternness on Iraq 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
President Bush said again today that "all options" are open in dealing with Iraq, and also strongly affirmed American support for the ailing economy of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan.
 At a joint news conference this afternoon, the first day of a six-day diplomatic trip, Mr. Bush said that "I will keep all options on the table" regarding Iraq and "there is nothing else to talk about." 
 Of Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Bush said: "I'm confident in this man's leadership ability, I'm confident in his strategy and I'm confident in his ability to carry ot that strategy." Although the positions of the two leaders appeared close on the need to reform Japan's economy, and on their ability to work together in the campaign against terrorism, they differed on their approaches to North Korea, which Mr. Bush has called an "axis of evil." 
Mr. Bush described North Korea as the creator of starvation and said South Korea was the home of freedom, but Mr. Koizumi was more conciliatory.
The priminister said his nation, "through cooperation and coordination with the U.S. and South Korea, would like to work on normalizing our relationship with North Korea." 
Earlier today, at the start of a one-on-one meeting, Mr. Bush called Mr. Koizumi "a great reformer," but the president was expected to urge the prime minister in private to make urgent reforms in a Japanese economy that is verging on crisis.
The president is at the start of a trip to Japan, South Korea and China, with its mission made more difficult by Mr. Bush's tough talk in the United States of Iraq, Iran and North Korea as part of an "axis of evil."
Mr. Bush's remark has set off alarms, particularly among the South Koreans, who are worried that it could lead to further tensions or war with the North, but also among the European allies.
Asked about the European reaction before the start of the meeting with Mr. Koizumi, Mr. Bush replied, "They understand our point."
Concerns over the Japanese economy were expected to take up much of the discussions between the two leaders. In an interview with Asian journalists in Washington on Friday that was released Saturday by the White House, Mr. Bush said that while Mr. Koizumi had "done everything he said he would do," the Japanese economy needed "significant reforms and restructuring, as well as a focus on its loan portfolios." Mr. Bush added that "the Japanese economy must restructure, and must deal with her loans, her bad loans."
Some Japanese government officials said over the weekend that they were taken aback by the bluntness of Mr. Bush's remarks.
Mr. Bush's trip comes almost exactly a decade after his father made a calamitous visit to Tokyo, when the former president collapsed from an intestinal flu in the lap of the prime minister during a formal banquet. At the time, the economic health of the two nations was reversed, with the United States in recession and Japan still enjoying the boom times of its old "bubble" economy. 
Mr. Bush and Mr. Koizumi were also to discuss global warming. While the Japanese have politely praised Mr. Bush's recent plan to control greenhouse gases as evidence that America is committed to the issue, they have also made clear their hope that the United States will return to a treaty, negotiated in Kyoto, with other industrialized nations. A group of about 50 Japanese and American demonstrators protested Mr. Bush's environmental policies near the American Embassy in Tokyo on Sunday, shortly before Mr. Bush arrived.
This morning, a robust-looking Mr. Bush said that he felt "great" as he began his day with a trip to Meiji Jingu, a Shinto shrine. 
He and Laura Bush, who held hands, were accompanied by a chief priest of the shrine, dressed in full-length cream-colored silk. 
Mr. Bush spent about 10 minutes inside the shrine, then signed a guest book. From there he left for a display of yabusame, or archery from horses, an ancient Japanese religious practice. In a large field near the shrine, Mr. Bush sat next to Mr. Koizumi and watched as horsemen rode by at a breakneck gallop and shot arrows into a small clay target. "Oh, yeah!" the president said when one horseman hit the target.

HEADLINE: Brash Owner of Rolling Stone Struggles to Remake Us Weekly 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CARR 

 BODY:
Just off Jann S. Wenner's office at his Midtown Manhattan headquarters, there is an anteroom with a curiously meditative aura. The focal point is a picture of Mr. Wenner on skis, poised over a cornice with a 15-foot drop. It makes visitors wonder what happened in the next frame.
 "Of course, I landed it," he said, seeming surprised that the question would even come up. 
 Mr. Wenner, 56, has been jumping off cliffs for 35 years, always accompanied by the brash belief that he will land safely. He has experienced enormous success with Rolling Stone -- by now a piece of American iconography -- and come up with a distinctive, profitable magazine in Men's Journal. Although he began as a journalistic bomb thrower, his career as an independent media mogul is not that long of a walk for a young man who idolized William Randolph Hearst and John Lennon in equal measure. But his decision two years ago to take the dowdy monthly Us magazine weekly -- up against Time Inc.'s People magazine -- had the magazine industry wondering if he had spent a little too much recreational time with Hunter S. Thompson. 
It represented the biggest leap of his career. And this time, Mr. Wenner's landing has been a lot rougher.
He had maintained that success was guaranteed for a weekly stars-and-style bulletin that younger women would find irresistible. That is not the way it worked out.
"We were the victims of our own arrogance and hubris," Mr. Wenner said. "We thought we could take our existing newsstand sale and replicate it on a weekly basis and, well, au contraire. We have had to recalibrate everything."
It has been a punishing adjustment for his entire company, Wenner Media. One hundred and fifty employees have been laid off at the privately owned company since Us went weekly in March 2000, leaving 325 employees arrayed over three magazines.
More ominous, while Mr. Wenner has been busy with Us, Rolling Stone's revenues have gone off a cliff. After losing 100 pages in tobacco ads when Philip Morris eliminated advertising in youth-oriented publications in 2000, and being hit by growing competition for the attentiveness of young males from the likes of Dennis Publishing's Maxim and its music magazine Blender, Rolling Stone was off $15 million in ad revenue in 2001. And now MTV, a unit of Viacom, is starting a music magazine in partnership with Hearst, taking aim at Rolling Stone, which has historically printed money for Mr. Wenner's other endeavors.
Mr. Wenner, who is used to being ahead of the curve, will have to struggle to make sure that Rolling Stone does not become the next Playboy, for the swinging young man of its generation but now past its prime.
Us Weekly seems to be finally gaining traction editorially and at the newsstand. Audit Bureau of Circulations numbers for 2001 released this week will put the total paid average circulation at 929,131, with 325,322 copies selling off the newsstand and bringing in significant revenue. The rate base, or readership promised to advertisers, was lowered 20 percent, to 800,000, five months after the magazine went weekly. It is now back up to 950,000, and Kent Brownridge, the general manager of Wenner Media, said that advertising sales had been up 30 percent so far this year. Still, it is not exactly threatening People, which reaches more than 3.7 million readers and booked $650 million in sales last year.
It is the kind of unfair fight that suits a bourgeois revolutionary like Mr. Wenner. "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro," he said last week at a staff party, which he attended while nattily attired in a monogrammed Charvet shirt that would fit nicely in a Men's Journal fashion spread.
Wenner Media is a relatively small company for the industry, with $268.5 million in sales in 2002 at its three magazines, according to the Publishers Information Bureau, and revenues of under $50 million even in a good year. It does not have the kind of scale that would allow it to absorb the $1 million a month in losses that Us was generating, according to company insiders.
Mr. Wenner maintains that he has still not spent the $50 million he originally committed to the project, but the losses had him shopping for deeper pockets. He found them a year ago at Walt Disney, which invested $35 million in return for a 50 percent stake in Us, according to a Wenner executive. He originally expected Us to turn a profit in 18 months, but now, two years later, he is willing to say only that it will be profitable "soon."
Privately, he has said that it could take as long as two more years and that he will re-assess the situation after he churns through Disney's investment. Disney officials say they are comfortable with Us's progress.
"We are quite pleased with the performance, especially given such a difficult environment," said Deborah Dugan, executive vice president of Disney Publishing Worldwide.
Mr. Wenner has always had a soft spot for celebrity, and Us gives him the Hollywood cachet that Rolling Stone never delivered. But he had his own unwanted star turn in 1995, when he left the town house he and his wife, Jane, shared on the West Side and set up a separate living arrangement with the designer Matt Nye. Several articles suggested that the change imperiled his business, but he remains married and is still a business partner with his wife.
Even though the Wenners have no debt and could get a hefty price -- some say a half-billion dollars -- for their company, Mr. Wenner said there were no plans to sell. But even barring that, Mr. Wenner has shown an ability to cut his losses in the past when a magazine did not work. He sold Family Life after just two years and folded Record magazine, along with a number of now-forgotten projects, when it failed to take hold. Not this time, Mr. Wenner said.
"Why would I?" he said. "I have a job I love running three magazines I love, that I read and enjoy personally. Sometimes it's a pain, sometimes it's fun, but when you are exercising your God-given gifts and talents, however bizarre they may be, you feel good."
Mr. Wenner believes that he has a gift for divining middlebrow concerns of the moment. At a recent editorial meeting, a potential cover on makeovers did not impress Mr. Wenner, and he suggested a splash on plastic surgery, or as he dubbed it "Botox and boob jobs," instead.
"I can't think of a fresh angle on makeovers," he said. "I'm not feeling any real heat here."
There is little doubt about who is in charge. He pointed to a headline about people competing on a television show to lose weight. "I don't think that 'Days of Our Thighs' celebrates their achievements or their pain," Mr. Wenner said. "It is an insult, putting people down who are trying to do something with their lives."
Charles Leerhsen, the acting editor at Us, began drumming the table loudly and immediately said that he "couldn't disagree more."
Mr. Wenner was unimpressed. "I know I am right on the basic policy here, so let's just move ahead," he said.
Earlier in the meeting, basic policy notwithstanding, Mr. Wenner suggested that a portrait that reflected Sharon Stone's weight gain since having a baby and recovering from a brain aneurysm should be headlined, "Sharon Chows Down." The mercurial Mr. Wenner is not known at the company as a paragon of consistency.
Mr. Leerhsen said later about Mr. Wenner's persistent meddling: "It can be frustrating, very frustrating, but he does listen. Then there are times when he wants it done his way, and we have done it his way."
Later on in his office, Mr. Wenner said that as the owner-editor, he feels no compunction about overruling the editors of his publications. And he makes no apology about spending time on what many view as the marginalia of American life.
"Hey, excuse me, Botox was on the cover of The New York Times last week," he pointed out. "Is it cosmically important whether you lose 15 pounds?" he said, staring at a reporter's paunch. "No, it's not cosmically important, but I guarantee you will be a lot happier if you lose those 15 pounds. That's what Us Weekly is about."
Us has been doing some trimming of its own -- the company has not started to count paper clips, but writers can no longer seek reimbursement for pens and notebooks. "He will fight over a $5 cab receipt," one former staff member said. Mr. Wenner's Gulfstream jet, however, the one that lets him ski 50 days a year while staying at his ranch in Hailey, Idaho, remains at his disposal.
"The jet is not the issue," Mr. Wenner said. "The issue is what you do as a company in the kind of recession we have. I think that any company would be envious of the kind of cost control we have. I'm proud that I take a real interest."
It's all part of how David gets a piece of Goliath, Mr. Wenner said.
"It is daunting to be up against competition as formidable and well financed as AOL Time Warner or the millions of Si Newhouse," Mr. Wenner said. "Their advantage is incalculable. There is no end to what they can spend to compete, and we have to live by our wits."
Mr. Wenner argues that he has the human assets to overcome his lack of fiscal ones, but three of the company's five vice presidents have recently left, including the Us editor in chief, Terry McDonell, who will become managing editor of Sports Illustrated.
Mr. McDonell is credited with tweaking the magazine's celebrity formula with dollops of style, slavish "Survivor" updates, diet specials and occasional tabloid coverage that increased its appeal among women at supermarkets. "He's no slouch," said Chip Block, vice chairman of USAPubs, a marketer of magazine subscriptions. "It will be difficult to find someone who knows the newsstand as well as Terry."
Mr. Wenner is skiing this week, now that a broken ankle is finally healing, but he expects to make a decision on appointing an editor at Us when he returns. Mr. Wenner told the staff that Mr. Leerhsen was the leading candidate, but many inside and outside the company are betting that Bonnie Fuller, former editor of Cosmopolitan and Glamour magazines, will be tapped because of her newsstand expertise.
In his office last week, Mr. Wenner looked up the Avenue of the Americas toward Central Park from his second-floor quarters, the rumble of a subway the clearest indication that he is still close enough to the street to feed its appetites.
Mr. Wenner, the incorrigible optimist, remains convinced that the Us Weekly leap will end well.
"We just have to deal with it and tough it out," he said.

HEADLINE: The Energy Industry Gauges the Enron Damage 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The leaders of the world's largest energy companies and those who aspire to replace them come to the annual Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference to think big thoughts. This year's four-day conference was devoted to "The New Face of Risk: Energy Strategies for the Changed World" -- a theme chosen months before Enron's spectacular failure changed the energy world more than anyone could have imagined.
 But it was the small thoughts, the niggling doubts, that cast a pall over the conference that ended on Friday, and they centered on Enron. 
 Publicly stoic, the investment bankers, accountants and energy executives said they would weather the larger issues that buffet any commodity-based industry, like the sluggish economy and low prices for oil, natural gas and electricity. But in hotel hallways, over dimly lighted dinners and with their fists wrapped around cocktail glasses, they faced their lurking fear: that the fallout from Enron's collapse might taint the industry and change it in dire ways. 
"There's a sense that we're so close to the collapse of Enron, it's hard to know how it may affect the future," said Lawrence J. Makovich, head of North American Energy and Global Power at Cambridge Energy Research and a ubiquitous host. "Enron is something that people talk about all the time. At receptions, they talk about who they knew at Enron and what they said. It's an icebreaker now."
The paperback-size name tags, hanging from lanyards around the necks of a thousand executives in anonymous suits, identified their bearers as people like Philip Watts, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell; Chekib Khelil, former president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries; and E. Linn Draper Jr., chairman of American Electric Power, among the country's largest electricity concerns.
Just last year, Enron executives glad-handed through the beige halls of the Westin Galleria Hotel. Jeffrey K. Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, gave a speech at the 2001 conference, mainly criticizing a Cambridge Energy report on the power crisis in California because it did not advocate laissez-faire regulation. This year, Stephen G. Butler, chairman of the accounting firm KPMG, was added to the speaker's list at the last minute to talk about "Restoring Investor Confidence: The Future of Public Accounting."
Bluntly or obliquely, most everyone with a microphone intoned the same refrain: "We are not Enron." 
"For the last few years, analysts kept saying, 'Why aren't you more like Enron?' " said Blake Herndon, head of risk management at the Williams Companies, a natural gas and electricity company. "Now they're saying, 'You're exactly like Enron.' There's a perception of impropriety with every company in the energy sector. We're constantly defending ourselves with rating agencies and analysts. It's tiring, but it's ultimately good for the industry."
Mr. Herndon echoed dozens before him who said that the energy companies were embracing the greater transparency and stronger balance sheets being demanded of them by investors. Nearly all companies are re-examining their off-balance-sheet financing and many are doing away with it, though it may be valid, all to avoid the Enron taint.
"I think plain vanilla is in," said Peter Gaw, managing director of ABN Amro's oil and energy business, about the kind of financing that companies will now use. "People are going back to basics, and I think that's healthy. Investors' trust needs to be re-established."
But what seemed a universal that-which-does-not-kill-me-makes-me-stronger attitude fell away in close quarters.
"I'm really concerned," Jeffrey Holzschuh, a managing director with Morgan Stanley, told Marce Fuller, chief executive of the power company Mirant as they stood in a small circle with other bankers. "This is a sobering environment."
"The big issue," Ms. Fuller said to him, leaning forward with urgency, "is that you cannot make a law to keep people from breaking the law."
Energy executives have heard the vitriol Congress has aimed not just at Enron, but at the whole notion of energy deregulation. Enron's collapse was preceded by the California power debacle and the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric. Many politicians blame electricity deregulation, and business people fear a rollback. They worry about the imposition of onerous auditing or disclosure rules. Enron was the failure of integrity at one company, executives argue, not of the newly liberalized energy markets.
One step ahead of the regulators, credit rating agencies, analysts and investors are already turning the screws on the energy industry. The rating agencies are demanding that energy companies reduce their debt-to-equity ratio to less than 50 percent, a particularly burdensome standard for many power companies that have used debt to finance the construction of power plants or to acquire competitors. To reduce debt levels, companies will have to issue new equity and sell their leveraged assets, said Robert K. Green, president of UtiliCorp United, an energy company based in Kansas City, Mo. Already, billions of dollars of power plants and subsidiary businesses have been put on the auction block.
"There are significant advantages to consolidation," Mr. Green said, "but who can buy, who wants to buy and where the bottom of the market is -- those are the real questions."
Mr. Green and others predicted that the downturn in the energy industry and the stock markets could lead to a significant shakeout, leaving a smaller number of serious contenders in the power generation and trading business.
For the next few years, though, companies may play down their trading ventures. Enron's renown was built on its sprawling natural gas and power trading division. Executives like Mr. Skilling espoused businesses drawn from people's minds, like trading, and not those with large physical assets. At the conference, Enron's former rivals made a point of trumpeting the many power plants, pipelines and gas reservoirs they owned, while keeping trading operations out of the light.
Thomas B. Tyree Jr., a managing director of Goldman, Sachs, said: "Trading will no longer be front and center for a company's plan for growth."
But many at the conference would have said that before. Most of them constructed their businesses differently from Enron. Now and then, with a faint smile, they let on how much they were savoring the fall of a company they had suspected was a house of cards. "When you get to the scale Enron had, you can't grow at 40 to 50 percent a year, like they were reporting," said William Utt, manager for North America at Tractebel Electricity and Gas International. "All the highflyers are now returning to reality."

HEADLINE: Ending the Oil Addiction 

 BODY:
President Bush's grand design for reducing America's vulnerability to terrorism lacks one obvious and critical piece -- a realistic strategy for reducing America's crippling reliance on imported oil, especially petroleum from the Persian Gulf. Reducing our dependence on gulf oil would increase our flexibility in the war on terrorism and in other areas of foreign policy as well. If the Bush administration took the most practical approach and explored new methods of energy conservation, the effort could also yield important technological gains and reduce America's unconscionably large contribution to global warming. 
 Right now, the United States uses 25 percent of the world's oil production even though it has only 4 percent of the world's population and 3 percent of its reserves. Two-thirds of world reserves, more than 600 billion barrels, belong to the nations of the Persian Gulf. No matter how many holes are punched on American soil, we simply cannot drill our way to energy independence. The route lies elsewhere. 
 Buying oil from many different nations would help, up to a point. Compared with its allies, the United States already has an advantage in this regard. The gulf supplies only one-quarter of total imports, or 14 percent of the total consumption of seven billion barrels a year. Hemispheric neighbors like Canada and Mexico supply well over 40 percent, and they could be asked for more. Africa remains an important source, while other potential suppliers are ramping up production. Together, Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have more than 6 percent of the world's proven oil reserves, more than the United States and Canada combined, and exploration in the former Soviet Union is continuing. 
Diversification, though, has its limits. Not only is most of the planet's oil located in the Persian Gulf, but that is where America's allies -- which do not have substantial reserves of their own -- must turn to find the bulk of their imports. That won't change, even if the United States finds alternative sources for itself.
The surest road to greater energy independence is a disciplined program of energy efficiency, coupled with a major effort to develop renewable non-petroleum sources. This is the road Jimmy Carter started on after the oil shocks of the 1970's, leading to fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks. Yet Mr. Bush continues to put his chips on an alarmingly unbalanced House bill that provides $27 billion in subsidies for traditional energy sources and only $6 billion for conservation.
Our quarrel is not with Mr. Bush's desire to find more domestic oil. There are untapped resources in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that have long been open for drilling, and, as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force noted, we may be able to double our reserves by using new technologies in older fields. We could also do far more with Alaska's huge natural gas reserves, which could be pumped southward along the route of the existing trans-Alaska pipeline and used as a substitute for oil.
Our quarrel, rather, is with Mr. Bush's fixation on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (as well as other ecologically sensitive areas) and with the impression he leaves that we can somehow drill our way out of dependency. Blinded by its ties to the drillers, the administration cannot or will not concede that conservation is the more reliable path to self-sufficiency and that aggressive investments in new technologies can smooth that path. The numbers are clear. Increasing fuel-efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon -- a reasonable expectation, even with existing technology -- would save about 2.5 million barrels a day by 2020. That is about five times what the Arctic refuge is expected to yield and, as it turns out, is roughly the same amount as our present imports from the Persian Gulf.
Important members of Mr. Bush's own party, like Senator John McCain, are pushing increases in fuel economy. Yet Mr. Bush devoted only one line to conservation in his State of the Union address, and his policy initiatives are modest or mystifying. Recently, for example, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced a program to develop a hydrogen-powered car. Hydrogen may well be the fuel of the future. But Mr. Abraham also took the occasion to downgrade a demonstrably useful program to develop efficient hybrid cars in the near term, in part because it annoyed the automobile industry. Mr. Bush should be using his current political capital to seize all available strategies to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Democrats Start Early On the Presidential Trail

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 17 

 BODY:
It may be a tired joke that all 100 United States senators think they should be president, but it happens to be largely true. Still, if any of the 2,500 party faithful here wondered why three senators had crossed the country to join Gov. Gray Davis at the California Democratic convention this weekend, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts made it plain.
 "You've got Tom Daschle here, you've got John Edwards here, you've got Gray Davis here," Mr. Kerry said as the crowd shrieked approvingly. "Al Gore would have been here, folks, but to make sure Democrats are protected for '04, somebody had to be moved to an undisclosed location." 
 To those who are not political junkies -- who do not look for meaning in Al Gore's beard, or endlessly deliberate over a statistically insignificant rise in Mr. Daschle's disapproval rating -- it may seem perplexing that would-be presidents are already campaigning. Given President Bush's colossal popularity, it may even seem unfathomable. But the Democrats have moved up their primary calendar for 2004; and so, ready or not, the Westin Bonaventure here became host to the first of what will be dozens, maybe hundreds, of Democratic functions -- or "cattle calls" -- around the country at which politicians make the pitch for why they stand the best chance of toppling George W. Bush.
Nobody here declared his intentions, but the speeches were tailored to elicit a fervent response in this state, which boasts the biggest bounty of electoral votes. The politicians urged improving California's economy, protecting abortion rights and preventing coastal oil drilling. Then they worked the crowd, holding private sessions with donors, local officeholders and labor leaders.
What the presidential prospects are doing is akin to test marketing: introducing themselves early to be sized up by partisans and the press, and to become more poised on a national stage. 
"We have 55 electoral votes, which is essentially 25 percent of what you need to be elected president," said Mr. Davis, who is seeking re-election this year and refused to rule out trying for the White House. Many Democrats here consider that unlikely after Mr. Davis's handling of California's energy crisis last year.
While diehards were waiting for Mr. Gore to decide whether to run again, others approved of the new talent, though they seemed most focused on personal traits.
"What's not to like?" asked Roberta Gillis, 64, a delegate from Santa Clarita. "John Kerry and John Edwards were my favorites. Both are good looking. One's tall. One's short. John Kerry just gave his first presidential speech. But I've admired Edwards. I even like his stupid Southern drawl." 
Mark A. Lemke, 25, a lawyer from Los Angeles, had a different take. "Daschle had to be the star," he said. "He was drowned out by applause. Kerry was trying too hard to be great. And Edwards played up the accent -- unless he's confusing Southern California with the rest of the South." 
Two other Democrats enthusiastically preparing to run, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, are expected in town later this week. 
Of those here, Mr. Kerry has been the most unabashed about his plans, and his address showed it. He joked: "A number of you have asked me if I had any interest in running for the most powerful office in the land. But I want to make it clear to all of you today, I have no interest at all in being secretary of state of Florida." 
Mr. Kerry's advisers did stop short of handing out "Kerry for President" buttons, with one saying it felt "premature." 
Mr. Edwards was more guarded, though he acknowledged that California was an "enormously important" proving ground.
While his speech offered no hints about his presidential hopes, Mr. Edwards, a first-term senator from North Carolina, tried to puff up his credentials. Citing what many Democrats and Republicans said was his impressive effort to question Judge Charles W. Pickering, whom Mr. Bush has nominated to a federal appeals court, Mr. Edwards sounded like the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Last week, this judge appeared before our, my, Judiciary Committee and I was able to raise serious questions," he said. Actually, Mr. Edwards is the committee's most junior Democrat.
In another small-bore slip -- but one that prompted snickers -- Mr. Edwards said, "Like many of you, I grew up in a small town in North Carolina." 
Of the three senators, only Mr. Daschle has insistently denied any plans to run, at least not now. Yet he certainly presented himself as the party's fresh face. "We are going to demonstrate that Democrats are the right party to lead this nation at this time of challenge, well into the future," he said.
It may mean nothing, but it was not lost on a Daschle operative that some delegates proudly wore buttons proclaiming, "I'm a Daschle Democrat."

HEADLINE: Hijacking the Brain Circuits With a Nickel Slot Machine 

BYLINE:  By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
Compulsive gambling, attendance at sporting events, vulnerability to telephone scams and exuberant investing in the stock market may not seem to have much in common. But neuroscientists have uncovered a common thread.
 Such behaviors, they say, rely on brain circuits that evolved to help animals assess rewards important to their survival, like food and sex. Researchers have found that those same circuits are used by the human brain to assess social rewards as diverse as investment income and surprise home runs at the bottom of the ninth. 
 And, in a finding that astonishes many people, they found that the brain systems that detect and evaluate such rewards generally operate outside of conscious awareness. In navigating the world and deciding what is rewarding, humans are closer to zombies than sentient beings much of the time. 
The findings, which are gaining wide adherence among neuroscientists, challenge the notion that people always make conscious choices about what they want and how to obtain it. In fact, the neuroscientists say, much of what happens in the brain goes on outside of conscious awareness.
The idea has been around since Freud, said Dr. Gregory Berns, a psychiatrist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. Psychologists have studied unconscious processing of information in terms of subliminal effects, memory and learning, he said, and they have started to map out what parts of the brain are involved in such processing. But only now are they learning how these different circuits interact, he said.
"My hunch is that most decisions are made subconsciously with many gradations of awareness," Dr. Berns said. "For example, I'm vaguely aware of how I got to work this morning. But consciousness seems reserved for more important things." 
Dr. P. Read Montague, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, says the idea that people can get themselves to work on automatic pilot raises two questions: how does the brain know what it must pay conscious attention to? And how did evolution create a brain that could make such distinctions?
The answer emerging from experiments on animals and people is that the brain has evolved to shape itself, starting in infancy, according to what it encounters in the external world.
As Dr. Montague explained it, much of the world is predictable: buildings usually stay in one place, gravity makes objects fall, light falling at an oblique angle makes long shadows and so forth. As children grow, their brains build internal models of everything they encounter, gradually learning to identify objects and to predict how they move through space and time. 
As new information flows into it from the outside world, the brain automatically compares it to what it already knows. If things match up -- as when people drive to work every day along the same route -- events, objects and the passage of time may not reach conscious awareness.
But if there is a surprise -- a car suddenly runs a red light -- the mismatch between what is expected and what is happening instantly shifts the brain into a new state. A brain circuit involved in decision making is activated, again out of conscious awareness. Drawing on past experience held in memory banks, a decision is made: hit the brake, swerve the wheel or keep going. Only a second or so later, after hands and feet have initiated the chosen action, does the sense of having made a conscious decision arise.
Dr. Montague estimates that 90 percent of what people do every day is carried out by this kind of automatic, unconscious system that evolved to help creatures survive.
Animals use these circuits to know what to attend to, what to ignore and what is worth learning about. People use them for the same purposes which, as a result of their bigger brains and culture, include listening to music, eating chocolate, assessing beauty, gambling, investing in stocks and experimenting with drugs -- all topics that have been studied this past year with brain imaging machines that directly measure the activity of human brain circuits.
The two circuits that have been studied most extensively involve how animals and people assess rewards. Both involve a chemical called dopamine. The first circuit, which is in a middle region of the brain, helps animals and people instantly assess rewards or lack of rewards.
The circuit was described in greater detail several years ago by Dr. Wolfram Schultz, a neuroscientist at Cambridge University in England, who tracked dopamine production in a monkey's midbrain and experimented with various types of rewards, usually squirts of apple juice that the animal liked. 
Dr. Schultz found that when the monkey got more juice than it expected, dopamine neurons fired vigorously. When the monkey got an amount of juice that it expected to get, based on previous squirts, dopamine neurons did nothing. And when the monkey expected to get juice but got none, the dopamine neurons decreased their firing rate, as if to signal a lack of reward. 
Scientists believe that this midbrain dopamine system is constantly making predictions about what to expect in terms of rewards. Learning takes place only when something unexpected happens and dopamine firing rates increase or decrease. When nothing unexpected happens, as when the same amount of delicious apple juice keeps coming, the dopamine system is quiet.
In animals, Dr. Montague said, these midbrain dopamine signals are sent directly to brain areas that initiate movements and behavior. These brain areas figure out how to get more apple juice or sit back and do nothing. In humans, though, the dopamine signal is also sent to a higher brain region called the frontal cortex for more elaborate processing.
Dr. Jonathan Cohen, a neuroscientist at Princeton, studies a part of the frontal cortex called the anterior cingulate, located in back of the forehead. This part of the brain has several functions, Dr. Cohen said, including the task of detecting errors and conflict in the flow of information being processed automatically.
Brain imaging experiments are beginning to show that when a person gets an unexpected reward -- the equivalent of a huge shot of delicious apple juice -- more dopamine reaches the anterior cingulate. When a person expects a reward and does not get it, less dopamine reaches the region. And when a person expects a reward and gets it, the anterior cingulate is silent.
When people expect a reward and do not receive it, their brains need a way to register the fact that something is amiss so it can recalibrate expectations for future events, Dr. Cohen said. As in monkeys, human dopamine neurons project to areas that plan and control movements, he said. Fluctuating levels of dopamine make people get up and do things, outside their conscious awareness. The number of things people do to increase their dopamine firing rates is unlimited, neuroscientists are discovering. Several studies were published last year looking at monetary rewards and dopamine. Money is abstract but to the brain it looks like cocaine, food, sex or anything a person expects is rewarding, said Dr. Hans Breiter, a neuroscientist at Harvard. People crave it.
Some people seem to be born with vulnerable dopamine systems that get hijacked by social rewards. The same neural circuitry involved in the highs and lows of abusing drugs is activated by winning or losing money, anticipating a good meal or seeking beautiful faces to look at, Dr. Breiter said.
For example, dopamine circuits are activated by cocaine; people become addicted when their reward circuits have been hijacked by the drug, Dr. Montague said.
Winning in gambling can also hijack the dopamine system, Dr. Berns said. Many people visit a casino, lose money and are not tempted to go back. But compulsive gamblers seem to have vulnerable dopamine systems, he said. The first time they win, they get a huge dopamine rush that gets embedded in their memory. They keep gambling and the occasional dopamine rush of winning overrides their conscious knowledge that they will lose in the long run. 
Other experiments show that reward circuits are activated when young men look at photos of beautiful women and that these circuits are defective in women with eating disorders like bulimia. Bulimics say they are addicted to vomiting because it gives them a warm, positive feeling.
Music activates neural systems of reward and emotion. Older people with age-related impairments to the frontal cortex do poorly on gambling tasks and, experiments show, are prone to believe misleading advertising. 
Neuroscientists say that part of the appeal of live sporting events is their inherent unpredictability. When a baseball player with two outs at the bottom of the ninth inning hits a home run to win the game, thousands of spectators simultaneously experience a huge surge of dopamine. People keep coming back, as if addicted to the euphoria of experiencing unexpected rewards.
One of the most promising areas for looking at unconscious reward circuits in human behavior concerns the stock market, Dr. Montague said. Economists do not study people, they study collective neural systems in people who form mass expectations. For example, when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lowered interest rates twice last year, the market went up, he said. When it lowered interest rates on other occasions and investors knew the move was coming, markets did not respond.
Economists and neuroscientists use the same mathematical equations for modeling market behavior and dopamine behavior, Dr. Montague said. Neuroscience may provide an entirely new set of constructs for understanding economic decision making.

HEADLINE: Review/Fashion; 
For Fall, Chaste Dresses and Uniforms of No Known Land

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
The space alien aspect of fashion goes well beyond galactic shoulders and small heads. It embodies the sensation that fashion is spinning not out of control -- the economy cooled that -- but without any gravitational pull. To sit at the Jeremy Scott show on Friday night, the last of the fall 2002 collections, was to sense this vacuum. Here was inventiveness run amok: party dresses conceived as Manhattan skyscrapers, with windows and cornices picked out in sequins. One laughed. One grinned. But when the music stopped and the audience gathered up its goodies bags (yum, makeup), you knew that these clothes would change nothing.
 The last words in the last show came as a refrain in a song: "Fashion is for fashion people." Strange as it must sound, fashion might not be for fashion people anymore. 
 There will always be a soft spot for the most wayward practitioners of fashion, a kind of padded room for the childish imagination. And many designers who start out that way, like Viktor & Rolf, eventually emerge with grown-up clothes that people can identify with. But Mr. Scott is still dabbling. Two or three years ago, in Paris, he was onto something when he turned fashion back to the 1980's. He is still working in that vein, now with more television game-show brightness, but it's hard to believe that any designer wants to be known for such resplendent vapidity.
On Friday morning, in the same $30,000 tent that Mr. Scott was allowed to use gratis by Seventh on Sixth, the organizer of the shows, Ralph Rucci received a standing ovation for his Chado collection. Mr. Rucci's clothes are not only exquisitely made but they also have a following around the country, and the first on their feet were the buyers from Neiman Marcus, including its chief executive, Burt Tansky. What they were applauding was Mr. Rucci's integrity. After all, here is a guy without a backer or a lot of hype and without a free tent, who just gets down to it and makes beautiful clothes.
Mr. Rucci has the so-called store suits -- and he could do with showing fewer of them -- but tucked in among them was a plain monastic-looking dress in gray wool jersey with a tiny empire belt in oxblood leather. It's a style that a number of designers were keen about this season, including Calvin Klein and Michael Kors. 
Another look that emerged in several collections is the coat or jacket with a big, extravagant collar. For example, Nicolas Ghesquiere opened his Balenciaga show with a black leather jacket that had a ribbed collar drawn up, Bazooka Joe-style, around the face. Mr. Rucci put across the same idea, except that his collar, in sable, spread over the shoulders of a tweed jacket and matching sequined skirt that recalled the jazzy sportswear of Norman Norell.
Mr. Rucci belongs in that tradition, and in a way that makes him an odd man out. He doesn't present himself as a star, and his clothes don't immediately knock you over. Yet the eye, the craft, is there -- in a deluxe twin set embroidered by Lesage in a basket-weave pattern, in the subtle patchwork of a long sleeveless black chiffon dress. All you have to do is look.
What the devoted follower of Calvin Klein needs is a taste for black and a short memory. Mr. Klein reprised Yohji Yamamoto's chic cassocks, which once swept the boards of the Paris shows, and back then his disciples wore black jodhpur boots, too. Yet in a season that is toying with volume and swimming in black, Mr. Klein's renditions looked completely right. 
This was one of those collections where Mr. Klein kept coaxing interest out of the simplest looks. Out came box-pleated georgette tops floating over trim boy trousers; ultrafine turtlenecks that were slightly oversize and shown with pleated skirts that fell just below the knee; and a loose-fitting V-neck dress with black leather insets. 
Somehow, the clothes looked modest and chic without being old maid, though, admittedly, they sound that way. Mr. Klein injected the clothes with femininity, in a band of black satin down the front of a tunic, in the romantic idea of longer skirts. At the same time, he added the harder elements of battle jackets and officer's coats, now in fabrics that looked washed, with rolled collars that nestled under the chin like inflatable airline pillows.
It might appear that Mr. Klein broke no new ground, that he just rearranged the peas on his plate and said, "Bon appetit!" Yet, like Mr. Rucci, his best details were hidden, meant for the connoisseurs who know the difference between a workaday black suede skirt and one that is made entirely of patches of suede.
Strong collections by Ralph Lauren, Balenciaga and Mr. Kors, with more quixotic surprises by a growing pack of new talent -- including Benjamin Cho, Alice Roi and Zac Posen -- gave a much needed boost to the New York shows. From out of them emerged several trends. Although designers reverted to some casual Friday elements, like Mr. Ghesquiere's sweatshirt-inspired tops and Mr. Kors's tailored jeans with fur leg warmers, the overall effect was dressed up, polished. Mr. Ghesquiere handled that by showing his loose gray jersey sweaters with flaring miniskirts and high heels. 
Eccentric knits, fattened with cables and mop fringe, turned up at Helmut Lang and Ms. Roi, who usurped the chunky popcorn gauge of an Irish fisherman knit for a strapless dress. The abundance of knits also pointed up how texture -- more than color or pattern -- will matter for fall. Rick Owens was backstage before his show, cutting off the hem of one of his maxisweaters, presumably to give it a bit more of that hand finish. Many of the fabrics and knits will look as if they have been washed. 
Pants are everywhere, but the newer looks are either pencil-thin, with a high waist, or cropped and cuffed, as in Marc Jacobs's collection, which also captured the vitality of the decorated military jacket. 
Perhaps the most unexpected style to come out of the collections, though, was the plain dress in wool or silk jersey. A cross between a tunic and a nightie, it appeared at Balenciaga and Oscar de la Renta, who gathered it under the bosom and hemmed it with an improbable band of mink.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
A New Toll? No, It's Just Value Pricing

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
CITY officials, afraid of angering drivers and politicians in Brooklyn and Queens, are reluctant to admit that they're considering tolls on the city-controlled East River bridges. But the tolls would actually be a huge favor to most drivers, not to mention everyone else in the city.
 The news of the tolls was buried in the city budget plan, which projects $800 million in new revenue by 2006 from "congestion pricing" and "E-ZPass initiatives." The only obvious way to get that money is from tolls on the East River, which traffic engineers have been urging for decades. When the budget was released last week, that $800 million figure set off rejoicing among an international array of traffic experts that happened to be in town for a conference sponsored by the Manhattan Institute's Center for Civic Innovation. 
 The conference, devised to explore New York's traffic problems, was dedicated to William Vickrey, the Columbia University professor who solved the problem of traffic jams a half century ago. He proposed that drivers pay more to use popular roads at peak times. Shortly before his death, in 1996, he won the Nobel Prize in economics, and today his theory of road pricing is conventional wisdom among traffic experts. 
The only problem is convincing politicians and drivers who like to believe there's such a thing as a free bridge. To make Vickrey's idea sound more palatable, today's traffic engineers have changed the term from "congestion pricing" to "value pricing," the idea being that drivers are paying to get something of value. 
The costs of the East River tolls, the experts at the conference predicted, would be vastly outweighed by the benefits of rapidly moving traffic: less time wasted, less fuel burned, less air pollution, more economic activity. The experts cited estimates that traffic congestion currently costs the New York metropolitan region $10 billion. Gridlock is not good for business unless you're a squeegeeman.
The traffic planners swapped success stories of cities that used tolls to decrease congestion and increase carpooling. Seoul eased bottlenecks in its tunnels and tripled the level of car-pooling by charging high tolls at rush hour. Singapore, by charging drivers to enter the central business district, sharply reduced traffic congestion even while employment was increasing. Most drivers in central Rome have to pay for the privilege of being there, but there are exemptions for people transporting the handicapped -- with a predictable result.
"THERE'S been an enormous rise in compassion for the disabled in Rome," reported Peter Samuel, the editor of Toll Roads Newsletter. He hailed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for its new policy last year of charging higher tolls at peak times, a policy that has reduced some congestion at rush hour. But traffic would flow more smoothly, he said, if politicians in New Jersey and New York would give the Port Authority the leeway to experiment with a greater range of tolls.
The experts at the conference spent a lot of time about the politics of tolls. They're used to lonely fights. They have recently been joined by a few environmentalists -- during the fight over the Hudson River tolls, Environmental Defense supported value pricing as a way to reduce pollution from idling cars -- but most people and politicians instinctively oppose new tolls.
The city's budget crisis, though, could be just the right moment for tolls, said Samuel I. Schwartz, who coined the term "gridlock" when he was chief engineer of the city's Department of Transportation. In the keynote address at the conference, he proposed emulating Singapore by charging a fee for driving in Manhattan's central business district. He also proposed tolls on the East River bridges, and suggested having higher-priced express lanes in which drivers would be guaranteed a three-minute crossing or their money back.
The tolls could be used to ease the city's cash woes, subsidize mass transit and restore the dilapidated bridges to their former glory, Mr. Schwartz said. He suggested that Brooklyn and Queens drivers compare their four "free" bridges with the toll crossings of the East and Hudson Rivers. 
"There were times, over the past two decades, that as many as half of the 30 lanes on the four East River bridges were closed due to emergencies and construction," Mr. Schwartz said. "The culprit: corrosion from lack of maintenance from lack of dedicated funds. There has never been a full or even significant emergency shutdown at any of the neighboring tolled facilities." Sooner or later, you pay to cross the East River.

HEADLINE: Supercomputing and Business Move Closer 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
A worldwide computing project known as grid, whose long-term vision is to bring the power of supercomputing to individuals, is taking a step out of the laboratory and into the commercial mainstream. 
 In a paper that was presented yesterday at a conference in Toronto, four computer scientists laid out a plan for marrying their grid technology for distributed computing with so-called Web services -- the technical standards that major computer companies are betting on to deliver a new generation of offerings on the Internet. 
 Web services promise a new level of computerized automation and convenience to companies and consumers over the Internet, all made possible by special software. A Web service application might, for example, enable a company's inventory database to talk to a supplier's for automatic reordering. Another application might allow an individual's personal calendar to communicate with the appointment database of a doctor to automatically schedule a checkup. 
The grid technology has grown up over the last few years mainly in government supercomputer centers and university laboratories. The notion of computing power as an electricity-like utility, available anytime and anywhere, has long been pursued. The grid, which takes its name from the utility analogy, is a computing concept that first surfaced in the 1950's. And computer time-sharing -- fashionable both intellectually and on Wall Street in the 1960's -- was an earlier incarnation of the distributed computing vision that the grid's advocates are chasing.
Yet continuing advances in processing power, network capacity and software, the grid scientists say, have finally brought the long-sought ideal of distributed computing within reach. A comparatively simple, but well-known distributed computing application is the SETI@home program, begun in 1999, which harnesses the power of millions of personal computers to seek signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.
The grid researchers in the labs have used their technology to enable far-flung groups of scientists to collaborate on complex projects that require lots of computing firepower including climate modeling, high-energy physics, genetic research and earthquake simulations. 
The software that has allowed the sharing of computing resources and information in scientific grid programs is called Globus, a software development project that uses the open-source model, in which programmers from around the world freely share ideas, code and bug fixes.
Still, the grid technology has been tailored to only specialized scientific applications so far. The paper, presented at the Global Grid Forum in Toronto, laid out a technical framework for taking the grid technology squarely into the more commercial world of Web services. These Web services are based on a series of industry-standard protocols -- XML, SOAP, WDSL and UDDI -- for describing, identifying and communicating data over the Web. 
The paper's title was "The Physiology of the Grid: An Open Grid Services Architecture for Distributed Systems Integration." It defined, in the language of Web services, how to build Web service applications that can flourish in the distributed computing environment of the grid. 
Draft versions of the paper have been on the Web for weeks, seeking comments from the academic and corporate research communities. The Globus project -- led by Ian Foster, a senior scientist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, and Carl Kesselman, director of the center for grid technologies at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute -- has welcomed and encouraged the research contribution and financial support of computer companies.
An I.B.M. researcher, Jeffrey M. Nick, was one of four authors of the grid paper, along with Mr. Foster, Mr. Kesselman and Steven Tuecke, a scientist at the Argonne lab.
I.B.M. and Microsoft, along with three specialist companies, Platform Computing, Entropia and Avaki, are expected to announce their support for the grid architecture to integrate Web services. Other companies are expected to follow their lead.
"The emerging commercial support is going to accelerate the process of moving grid technologies out of the lab and into the mainstream," said Mr. Foster of the Argonne lab.
The long-range goal, Mr. Foster explained, is "to transform the use of computing by putting in place concepts, infrastructure, and tools that can enable resource sharing on a large scale."
The established companies are supporting the Globus software project for different business reasons. I.B.M., for example, has embraced the major open-source efforts like the Linux operating system, in part to undermine rivals with strong operating system businesses, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.
For Microsoft, the business motivation is more complicated. Globus is an open-source project, whose software in research labs often runs on computers using Linux, a competitor to Microsoft's Windows. But Microsoft sees its future as increasingly dependent on the rise of Web services, whose communications protocols allow the software of many vendors to share data and interoperate.
So, Microsoft executives say, they see the grid as creating a larger software "ecosystem" -- or market, in business terms -- in which Microsoft offerings can thrive.

HEADLINE: Round One in New Jersey's Budget 

 BODY:
Gov. James McGreevey of New Jersey uttered a cry of primal political pain as he announced his plan to plug the holes in this year's budget, blaming his Republican predecessors for the current $2.9 billion gap. Like elected officials around the region, Mr. McGreevey is scrounging through obscure state funds in search of surpluses he can use to carry the state over to better economic times. Difficult as these steps are, they are certainly the easiest task he will face in the near future. 
 In a few weeks Mr. McGreevey must come up with a far more difficult budget plan for the next fiscal year, when New Jersey confronts a staggering $6 billion shortfall, "larger than any state in the union has ever faced," as he puts it. That next budget will require far more pain and political acuity from the state's new governor. 
 Shortly after his election last fall, Mr. McGreevey began accusing the Republicans who controlled the New Jersey State House of raiding the state's coffers. His harsh words were more than pre-budgetary spin. The Republican era in Trenton exulted in the good times, cutting tax rates and phasing in popular programs without saving enough for the lean times. And when lean times arrived, despite the increasingly grim economic forecasts, many Republican legislators went on a last-minute shopping spree before their dramatic loss of power.
Mr. McGreevey's desire to blame the Republicans for the bad news he must deliver to the voters is understandable. But he also needs Republican support for his next round in the budget process. The Assembly is dominated by his fellow Democrats, but the Senate legislates with a 20-to-20 split.
There are no good options for balancing the 2003 budget. Trying to cut $6 billion out of a $23 billion whole is virtually impossible. Additional debt could add to the state's burdens over the long run, but Mr. McGreevey has talked about borrowing against the tobacco money expected by the state. Like many of his fellow chief executives, he is likely to offer up a juggling act that will succeed only if the economy comes roaring back, and soon. 
New Jersey politicians have not dared even to hint that they might raise taxes since Gov. Jim Florio's tax increase in 1990 turned voters against most Democrats for the next decade. Still, Governor McGreevey may have to consider rescheduling property tax rebates or hiking the gasoline tax, which is one of the lowest in the country. As he himself has duly noted, he governs in a time when there are few happy options.

HEADLINE: Educated, Experienced and Out of Unemployment Checks 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
They feel forgotten, frantic, financially drained. They are out-of-work New Yorkers whose unemployment insurance benefits are running out after six months of fruitless job hunting. And many of them belong to a surprising group: experienced, college-educated professionals who worked in Manhattan.
 They are people like Linda M. Bonanno, 31, who worked her way up to senior media buyer at a major Madison Avenue firm before she lost her job in July in the advertising slump. She has applied for every job she could find, even one selling handbags at a New Jersey mall, with no luck. 
 It took her a year to find a job back in 1992, when she got out of college during a recession. "I think it's worse this time around," Ms. Bonanno said. "There's nothing in any business." Her last unemployment check arrived two weeks ago.
She has a lot of company. The number of New York workers who used up all their unemployment benefits without finding jobs soared in the last three months of last year, rising to more than 73,000 statewide, and in the comparable stretch of 2000 there were fewer than 43,000, according to the United States Department of Labor.
Their predicament is the product of a complex confluence of events. One is the current Congressional stalemate over extending unemployment benefits beyond the standard 26-week cutoff. Another is the fact that New York City's economy turned abruptly bleak after Sept. 11, just when the job market usually picks up after the traditional summer lull.
For those like Ms. Bonanno, there is a third factor: a sharp shift in the kind of people who found themselves jobless and collecting unemployment benefits last year. "The biggest thing, as you look over the data, is very large gains in technical people and professional industries," said James P. Brown, a labor analyst for the State Department of Labor who specializes in New York City.
In 2000, jobs were plentiful, especially for the well educated, but last year, as the weakness in the national economy began to affect New York City, white-collar workers were hit hard.
The number of professional and technical workers collecting unemployment insurance more than doubled, according to the department's analysis, which looks at average monthly data. So while the number of workers in all occupational categories collecting benefits rose 56 percent, the number of professionals jumped 120 percent, making theirs the second-largest category of unemployed workers (in 2000, that position was held by clerical workers).
College-educated unemployed people accounted for almost 26 percent of the unemployed last year, but 20 percent in 2000; their numbers more than doubled. The share of unemployed people who had been working in Manhattan jumped to almost 24 percent last year, pushing it past Queens to become the borough with the second largest population of unemployed people (Brooklyn remained at the top of the negative heap).
Blue-collar workers and those with high-school educations continued to dominate the rolls of those collecting unemployment insurance, and that pool does not include all the unemployed. Many of the poorest jobless workers cannot or do not apply for the insurance benefits, said Jonathan D. Rosen, director of the New York Unemployment Project, a new advocacy group focused on unemployment insurance.
Black workers also seem to be underrepresented. They accounted for about 27 percent of those collecting benefits, but the federal survey of the unemployed found that on average, they made up about 37 percent of the jobless in New York City. 
The characteristics of the expired-benefits category will probably change soon, because the economic fallout of Sept. 11 fell disproportionately on workers in low-wage industries like tourism, restaurants and retailing, said Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society of New York. "The mix will change," he said. "If we were going to be talking about this a year from now, it would be skewed toward the less educated." 
That is no comfort to those who are losing their unemployment benefits now, people like Lindsey M. Gray, 24, who lost her job in human resources at a dot-com in May. A temporary job soon ended, and her unemployment benefits just ran out.
Although she had been making $48,000 a year, she had been living paycheck to paycheck, Ms. Gray said. Half her salary went for rent, she said, and though her parents helped her out for a couple of months, she eventually had to move back to their house on Long Island.
Most of those receiving unemployment benefits were older and more experienced than Ms. Gray. While the largest increase in unemployment came among workers between the ages of 25 and 34, about a quarter of the jobless were between the ages of 45 and 60. "Too old to be what the market wants and too young to retire," is the way Lynn Myers described them.
Ms. Myers, who is in her early 50's, worked for a company that sold stock photos and historical film footage, a business that has moved almost entirely onto the Internet. She lost her job in March and has been getting by on savings and unemployment benefits, which are about to run out.
They lasted this long only because she took a short-term office job and then sold accessories at Saks over the Christmas holidays. "I found a lot of people like me there," she said. "We would all go sit and talk in the cafeteria, and I couldn't believe it. They were in the same situation, in their 50's, with job skills and experience, coming from industries that essentially imploded," especially the garment industry.
All the focus on workers displaced after Sept. 11 is understandable, Ms. Myers said, but it has made people in her situation feel overlooked. Meanwhile, they must compete with those displaced workers for jobs. One company told Ms. Myers, she said, that it turned off the fax machine after it received 400 resumes. 
Ms. Bonanno, the unemployed media buyer, has had similar experiences; in fact, she said, she feels lucky when she gets an acknowledgment that her resume has been received, even though those letters say there is no position for her now. She lives with her parents in Palisades Park, N.J., and can no longer afford to come into the city to meet her friends. "I don't want to be, 'Ma, can I have $50? I'm going out with the girls,' " she said.
It can be hard to keep her spirits up, she said: "After six months, it gets to you. There are days when I don't go out of the house." She takes long walks across the George Washington Bridge, looking at the island where she is determined to return.
"I don't want to relocate," she said. "I love the city. I'll come back."

HEADLINE: Welfare Chief Is Hoping to Promote Marriage 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Wade F. Horn, the Bush administration official who oversees the welfare program, says "it would be wholly inappropriate for the government to run a dating service."
 Nor, he says, does he want to push poor women into marriages with abusive boyfriends, as some feminists have asserted. 
 But Dr. Horn does want the federal government to promote and encourage marriage more aggressively among low-income people, and the administration is proposing to spend $100 million a year to do just that. 
The money is intended to finance experimental programs in the states -- like education campaigns on the importance of marriage and premarital counseling for people who decide to wed -- to find out what works. The question of marriage, and what the federal government should do to support it, is expected to be front and center in the welfare debate this year in Congress, as it reviews and reauthorizes the landmark 1996 welfare law. 
The law imposed sweeping new work requirements for recipients and saw substantial reductions in caseloads, but many policy makers agree that it has been much less successful in its other goals: to "reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies" and to "encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families."
Some poverty experts point to progress in recent years. Birth rates among teenagers have dropped substantially, for example, and some studies have shown a rise in the proportion of poor children living in two-parent households.
Wendell Primus, a former Clinton administration official and an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, said such progress should not be dismissed. "It's so hard to move social trends," Mr. Primus argued.
Still, many policy makers -- including Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of Health and Human Services -- say much more should be done. A third of births were to unmarried women in 2000, including 68.5 percent of the births among blacks, according to data released last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Children growing up in one-parent families are four times as likely to be poor as those growing up in two-parent households, said Isabel V. Sawhill, a welfare expert at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, and a former Clinton administration official. A majority of families who end up in the welfare system, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, are single-parent households, experts said. 
Dr. Horn, assistant secretary for children and families at the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an interview, "My central overriding concern is not marriage, it is the well-being of children."
He added that "the empirical literature is quite clear that, on average, kids who grow up in stable, healthy, married, two-parent households do better than kids who grow up in some other kind of arrangement."
Representative Wally Herger, the conservative California Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that will play a major role in reviewing the welfare law, said, of the marriage programs, "I can't think of a better use of money."
But some poverty experts question whether the government's promotion of marriage is the best way to deal with these problems. "Marriage is a good thing," Ms. Sawhill said, "and it would help kids a lot if more were born to married parents, but I'm not sure we know how to do it." 
The problem is not the lack of marriage, she said, "it's that people are having babies at an early age, before they're ready to have babies or get married."
The Bush administration wants to use the $100 million to figure out what works, in part by underwriting demonstration projects, Dr. Horn said. The money will be redirected from another program that granted bonuses to states where rates of out-of-wedlock births declined.
Dr. Horn suggested that the experiments would revolve around giving people the "skills and knowledge" to have a healthy marriage, like premarital counseling or marital enrichment classes. Mr. Thompson has said the administration would also propose a matching grant program "to strengthen families and reduce out-of-wedlock births." The details of the administration's welfare proposal are expected to be announced within the next month.
Some states, using existing funds, have already started marriage projects. Oklahoma, for example, is channeling part of its federal welfare block grant to finance a training course on marriage and relationship skills. The course is available to all state residents.
Some critics are dismayed at the notion of government entering such an intimate realm. "This is a crowd that says it wants to get government out of people's lives," said Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women, "And here they are pushing people they don't even know to get married."
Ms. Gandy said that if the administration wanted to improve the economic lot of women and children, it should provide them more assistance. "To say that the path to economic stability for poor women is marriage is an outrage," she said.
But Dr. Horn, a 47-year-old child psychologist who has been married 25 years, insists there would be no coercion, direct or indirect, in these efforts. "Here's the mission statement," he said. " 'We're going to support activities that help couples who choose marriage for themselves develop the skills and knowledge necessary to form and sustain a healthy marriage.' "
He added, "I just find it almost unfathomable why anyone would be against helping a low-income family who chooses marriage for themselves access the skills and knowledge to build a healthy marriage."
Robert Rector, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, scoffed at the idea that government should not teach marriage skills. 
"A class on parenting, that's fine, a class on breastfeeding, that's fine," Mr. Rector said, "but somehow this particular matter is something we don't want to touch."
Mr. Rector has advocated devoting much more federal welfare money for promoting marriage.
Referring to the rise in the percentage of children born to unmarried women, to 33.2 percent in 2000 from 5 percent in 1960, Mr. Rector said, "This is something that's really happened in the last 40 years."
He added, "It's not socially inevitable, and it can be reversed."
Still, Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser in the Clinton administration who played a major role in steering the 1996 law, said the best way to promote families was "to promote and require work."
"The theory behind the '96 law," Mr. Reed said, "was that by requiring work and ending welfare as a way of life we would get government out of the business of enabling a culture of single parenthood. It took us a long time to get into this mess. It's going to take a long time to get out of it."
Others maintain that simply easing the economic distress on low-income, two-parent families would do more to strengthen marriages than any class on relationship skills. Dr. Horn said the government should do both.
Dr. Horn is a longtime participant in the marriage and fatherhood debates. He served in the previous Bush administration, as commissioner for children, youth and families, and later headed the National Fatherhood Initiative, a private group intended to promote the importance of fathers.
Even before he joined the current Bush administration, he was a strong advocate of public policies to encourage marriage, arguing that too often the government was not neutral on marriage but actually created disincentives against it.
The nomination to his current job generated some controversy because in the mid-1990's he suggested that government encourage marriage by giving preference to married couples in programs like public housing. He has since repudiated the idea.
Dr. Horn said the moment is right for a new effort on marriage.
"Ninety percent of Americans either have been married, were married or will be married," he said. "It isn't like some product we have to sell. So how do we help people achieve the goal of a healthy marriage, which most people say they want?"
Low-income people, he said, were no different.

HEADLINE: Pataki's Closer Labor Ties Threaten a Democratic Stronghold 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Nowadays many union leaders talk about Gov. George E. Pataki as if he were Santa Claus.
 Last month, he pushed through legislation that provides $1.8 billion for raises for tens of thousands of workers belonging to the state's largest health care union. Two weeks ago, he signed a bill giving higher pensions to New York City police officers and firefighters who work beyond 30 years. And last fall, he made good on the top goal of the hotel employees' union, engineering legislation that would allow unionization at the Indian casinos planned for upstate. 
 After sprinkling favors on union after union, Mr. Pataki is on the verge of getting an unusually large number of labor endorsements for a Republican. As he revs up his campaign in a state where there are two million more registered Democrats than Republicans, these endorsements from labor -- one of the Democratic Party's core constituencies -- could go far to ensure Mr. Pataki's re-election. 
"Why is Pataki doing all this for unions?" asked Joshua Freeman, a labor historian at Queens College. "It's pretty straightforward. He wants to get re-elected. Wooing the labor movement is smart politics. It obviously undercuts the Democrats' base."
Officials in the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the Uniformed Firefighters Association and the Corrections Officers Benevolent Association all say their unions will soon endorse Mr. Pataki, and many building trades unions are expected to follow suit. These unions often back Republicans, but in years past they occasionally sat out races. 
A top Teamsters official said he was working behind the scenes to get every Teamster local in the state to back the governor. And many political experts predict that the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union and 1199, the giant health care union, with 215,000 members, will also support Mr. Pataki. 
"The governor has much more labor support than he had four or five years ago," said Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents more than two million union members in the state. "He's shown through his actions that he understands what we want and what our goals are."
The governor's aides say Mr. Pataki has not showered gifts on labor unions to secure their support. Rather, these aides say, he has worked closely with labor over the years, as he has with other constituencies, to address their concerns and build a more prosperous state.
Michael McKeon, the governor's spokesman, said Mr. Pataki worked with business and labor on a $1.75 billion environmental bond, on helping train more construction workers and on revamping the state's unemployment insurance program.
Responding to the concerns of the textile workers' union, Mr. Pataki has repeatedly pushed through laws to crack down on sweatshops. Two years ago, he agreed to cost-of-living adjustments for public employee retirees, delighting the Civil Service Employees Association, its 210,000 members and 55,000 pensioners.
He made the corrections officers happy two years ago by increasing their pensions and four years ago by giving them the same heart bill as the police and firefighters. Under the bill, when these uniformed workers develop a heart problem on the job, they get a three-quarter, tax-free disability pension. 
In recent years, the governor delighted New York City's police and firefighters by largely ending a two-tier pension system that gave worse pensions to those hired after 1973. And in 2000, he pleased 1199 by pushing through a $1 billion program to extend health coverage to one million uninsured New Yorkers, a move that helped protect the jobs of 1199's members.
But many political experts see a flood of recent gubernatorial moves to please labor. Even though Mr. Pataki faced an estimated $6 billion deficit, his new budget does not call for layoffs. Then there was not only the pension increase for veteran police officers and firefighters and the $1.8 billion for health care workers, but also a proposed $204 million package to finance raises for New York City's 80,000 public-school teachers. 
These moves prompted many editorial writers across the state to say that Mr. Pataki should not spend so much money to cozy up to unions when the state faced such a huge deficit.
"I think he's setting his political plate like every other governor has in the state, particularly in those even-number years that come every four years," said Daniel B. Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State, a statewide chamber of commerce.
Mr. Walsh said the governor was not being overgenerous to labor, asserting that Mr. Pataki has been just as helpful to business. 
In the last two years, Mr. Pataki has been especially attentive to 1199. That is no surprise, because 1199 is viewed as having the state's most effective political operation. With its phone banks, foot soldiers and sizable donations, it played a major role in electing Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate.
In Mr. Pataki's first two years in office, 1199 often warred against him, running television spots that denounced him for proposing to cut Medicaid. But they agreed to a truce, and now they are warm friends.
In December, Mr. Pataki attended 1199's Christmas party. Taking issue with President Bush, he joined Dennis Rivera, 1199's president and a native of Puerto Rico, at protests against military exercises in the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. This week, he will meet Mr. Rivera in Puerto Rico -- the governor is going to that island and to the Dominican Republic to support the families of passengers killed on American Airlines Flight 587 in November.
Mr. Rivera showered praise on Mr. Pataki, although he said it was too early to say whether his union would endorse the governor. "We feel incredibly grateful about his role in helping the union," Mr. Rivera said.
The governor has so endeared himself to labor that he was the only Republican invited to speak by satellite to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s convention in Las Vegas in December. Many labor leaders hailed Mr. Pataki for signing legislation that would let workers at planned Indian casinos join unions by a quick process of signing cards, rather than through a prolonged election process.
"He's been right on the issues," said Carl Haynes, president of Teamsters Local 237, a Manhattan-based local with 25,000 members. "I don't remember any governor that's been as good as he's been, not even Governor Rockefeller."
To be sure, some unions are opposed to Mr. Pataki, while others are torn between him and the Democratic candidates, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary. Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said it was too early to decide among the candidates. But if that usually Democratic union remains neutral, it will be good news for Mr. Pataki. 
Hank Sheinkopf, a strategist for Mr. McCall, said the governor had made a push for labor backing to offset the trend among suburbanites to vote increasingly Democratic. "Labor leaders can do what they want, but there is no guarantee the membership will follow them," Mr. Sheinkopf said.
He pointed to Liz Krueger's victory last week in the race for a State Senate seat from Manhattan's East Side. Union leaders had overwhelmingly endorsed her Republican opponent, John Ravitz. 
Thus far, the Communications Workers of America is the only major union to endorse Mr. Cuomo. 
"We have a problem with a Republican governor who started his administration with tax cuts for the wealthy," said Bob Master, the union's political director. "And he has really failed to deliver on some issues of critical importance to workers, like raising the state's minimum wage and improving the workers' comp system."
Union leaders rarely direct such sharp words at Mr. Pataki. Far more common is the sentiment voiced by Michael Carter, legislative chairman for the Uniformed Firefighters Association: "We have an incumbent governor who has been a good friend, and you don't walk away from good friends at election time."

HEADLINE: Lesson in Hands-On Charity: Giving Away Cash Isn't Easy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARSTOW 

 BODY:
In the beginning, just after the attacks, the leaders of the National Association of Home Builders, an industry group with 205,000 members, wanted simply to write a big check. Better to let an established charity dispense their millions to the victims, they said. What did they know about disaster relief?
 But then came the stories about Red Cross foul-ups and United Way donations gathering dust. And so the home builders resolved to go it alone and distribute their millions directly to Sept. 11 victims through their own fund. They would use common sense, they told each other. Surely they could do it faster, with less red tape. 
 Alas, they had no idea how hard it would be to give away $10 million. 
Today, after all their heated debates and feuding over whom to help, how to define need and how to guard against freeloaders, very little has turned out as planned. Their deadlines for delivering aid have been blown, and most of their money remains unspent. Their method for distributing relief checks is a convoluted bureaucracy in which a widow from New Jersey, for example, is expected to apply for help through a builders' group in Staten Island.
Yet for all the missteps and amateurism, theirs is also a story of grit and perseverance, and in the end they brought a modest measure of financial relief to hundreds of families. If the home builders failed to coordinate their plans with other charities, they nonetheless agreed to direct much of their money toward a group of people -- laid-off hotel and restaurant workers -- who have been relatively overlooked. And if some money is going to those with no pressing financial needs, far more has made it to those facing foreclosure or fending off bill collectors.
The transformation of the home builders association from check-writers to social workers is hardly unique in the aftermath of Sept. 11. Dozens of charities have sprung from nowhere, raising and spending hundreds of millions of dollars.
In this way, the example of the home builders is also a window into the strengths and weaknesses of a sprawling relief effort that is still struggling to distribute nearly $2 billion in donations, often through charities that are rookies to disaster relief. It is a messy, uneven effort. And yet there is so much money, so much good will that, amazingly, few legitimate victims appear to have slipped through the cracks.
Today, the home builders acknowledge that they were unprepared emotionally and administratively for the outpouring of human misery unleashed by their efforts. Their fax machines were overwhelmed with applications. Secretaries struggled to keep track of the paperwork. Some members, whether they were tough-talking construction executives, landlords or industry lobbyists, found themselves weeping as they read applications that testified to tattered lives.
"Every one of us has these days when, 'I can't read another one,' " said Kelly Farrell, general counsel for a builders' lobbying group whose offices in Lower Manhattan have been transformed from a proud outpost of landlord advocacy into a bustling disaster relief agency.
And every single step seemed to take longer and cost more than anyone imagined. 
"We were shocked at how difficult it is to give away money responsibly," said Neil Devroy, an executive with Centex Homes who confesses new respect for the charity world.
"Fortunately," he said, "we didn't know."

An Early Morning Call
Meeting in Hawaii, Leaders Set a Goal
The telephone rang at 4 a.m. on Sept. 11 in Robert L. Mitchell's room at the Kauai Marriott Resort and Beach Club in Hawaii. Mr. Mitchell, a Maryland builder and past president of the National Association of Home Builders, was attending meetings there with other senior executives of the association.
"Something unbelievable is going on," Bruce C. Smith, the association's president at the time, told Mr. Mitchell, who spent the next several hours watching television in the dark. Mr. Mitchell recalled it as one of his life's most helpless moments.
But Mr. Mitchell also sensed an opportunity. He had long argued that builders needed to do more to highlight their good deeds because, as he put it, "the public perceives that home builders take from their communities but don't give in return."
What better way to demonstrate the association's solidarity with the victims than by creating the Home Builders Care Victims' Relief Fund? The association's top officers, all stranded in Hawaii, quickly agreed. They set a goal of raising $5 million in six weeks, and Mr. Mitchell was put in charge of the effort.
But what to do with the money? The early consensus was that a group of construction executives and industry lobbyists had no business engaging in disaster relief. Given their obvious lack of expertise, some worried that they were inviting scandal. "Why create what's already been created?" said Robert M. Pflieger, the association's senior vice president for public affairs.
One week after the attacks, it was announced that all of the money in the relief fund would be donated to the Red Cross and the United Way's Sept. 11 Fund. Members were assured that 100 percent of the money donated would go directly to victims.
But doubts grew with each allegation in the news media of inertia or disarray among the major charities scrambling to respond to Sept. 11. Particularly troubling were the revelations that the Red Cross planned to reserve hundreds of millions of dollars for victims of future terror attacks. Hadn't the home builders just promised their members that every penny of their donations would go to Sept. 11 victims?
The more the builders talked it over, the more convinced they became that the big charities could not be trusted. Naturally suspicious of any bureaucracy, Mr. Mitchell and the others on his committee imagined their big check being diverted, as one member said, "to snow victims in Buffalo."

Going It Alone
Who Deserves Help? A Lively Debate
It was Philip LaRocque, executive vice president of the New York State Builders Association, who pushed hardest for the do-it-yourself option. How hard can it be? he asked. Builders are used to coordinating contractors, making quick decisions, being flexible. The argument had strong appeal to the group's members.
"They're independent entrepreneurs," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the N.A.H.B. "They like making their own decisions."
Mr. Mitchell's committee ultimately asked the group's 850 state and local affiliates to submit proposals on how to distribute the money. The goal, the members of the committee said, was to distribute all donations by year's end. There was one problem, though. They had already sent a $300,000 check to the Red Cross. They had to ask for it back. "They could not have been nicer," Mr. Pflieger said.
If only that were the lone problem.
First came an arduous debate over which Sept. 11 victims were most deserving of help. Some members of the group wanted at least 25 percent of their money to go to the families of the uniformed rescuers who died. But others quickly pointed to news reports showing that those victims were already drawing a flood of donations. 
Some wanted to aid small downtown businesses. But executives from the largest home-building companies -- seven of which had pledged $1 million to the fund -- objected strongly. There were already plenty of programs for small businesses, they said. One executive was even upset by a decision to donate $80,000 to several volunteer fire departments that responded to the jetliner crash near Shanksville, Pa. These fire departments did not fit his definition of a victim, he said.
Meanwhile, fewer than a half-dozen local chapters had stepped forward with proposals to distribute aid in their communities. There were a few in New York, but none in New Jersey and Connecticut. "We consciously said, that's not our strength," said Patrick J. O'Keefe, chief executive of the New Jersey Builders Association. Fund-raising was lagging, too. By Nov. 6, their fund had only $1.35 million in hand.
Mr. Mitchell was particularly frustrated with the large home builders, who, according to his meeting minutes, were demanding to know "exactly" where the money was going before committing their $1 million. "It appears to me that this is a corporate stalling tactic that may eventually be an excuse for not meeting the $1 million pledges," he wrote.
Finally, just before Thanksgiving, a plan emerged. Money would be funneled from the national group to Mr. LaRocque in Albany, who would then distribute it to local chapters in the New York area. The local chapters would be responsible for finding needy victims and approving applications.
Of course, the plan assumed that local home building officials could find victims. True enough, their names could easily be found on the Internet. But where did they live? How could they be reached? No one knew the answers.
By mid-December, only 15 applications had come in.
Mr. LaRocque turned for help to the 9/11 United Services Group, an umbrella organization that is coordinating charities and assembling a central database of victims. Mr. LaRocque was turned away. "They just weren't ready," he said.
The biggest break came when Ms. Farrell, general counsel for Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, the Manhattan affiliate of the national group, noticed a newspaper article about restaurant, hotel and janitorial workers who had been laid off from jobs either in or near the World Trade Center. She called one union named in the article.
"I have money, and I'd like to give it away," she said.
Within 24 hours, applications began to come through the fax machines. Along with the applications came a stunning avalanche of foreclosure notices, overdue credit cards, past-due phone bills. "It turns out," Ms. Farrell said, "that the attack hits different people at different times. And these are the ripples, the aftershocks."

Managing the Load
A Flood of Need By Fax and Phone
On a recent Monday morning, Betty Jean Dixon, the membership director of Associated Builders and Owners, arrived at work to find almost 100 telephone messages inquiring about aid. Around the office lay piles of applications in various stages of completion.
The telephone kept ringing. "Were you a World Trade Center victim?" she asked one caller. "And your name? L as in life?"
A widow of a Cantor Fitzgerald employee called. She was in a meeting with 10 other widows. They wanted 11 applications sent by fax right away.
A young Hispanic woman came to the reception window. She did not speak English. A security guard translated. Her mother died in the attacks, and she needed help.
Then the day's mail arrived, bringing 49 new applications.
"Sometimes," Ms. Dixon said, "you just feel how lucky you are." Her daughter worked at the trade center until the middle of last year. Thirty-seven of her friends died.
The group's suite of offices at 55 John Street has become a focal point of disaster relief. The staff has created a database and color-coded files. But the struggle to manage the paperwork is obvious, and the builders and staff members say there have been days when they wondered whether they bit off too much. They find themselves fighting off the sense that nothing will be enough.
One recent application came from the wife of a worker for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She said that her husband had been helping to evacuate people. "He did not make it out," she wrote, adding, for no clear reason, that his body was found on Jan. 23. On another day, a woman said her husband was a pilot on the first plane. Could they help? On another, 20 people crowded into the small lobby, looking for applications.
Those involved in evaluating applications have learned, they said, to turn themselves off a little bit, like doctors in an emergency room. 
One afternoon, Ms. Farrell and Nicholas LaPorte Jr., executive director of Associated Builders and Owners, confronted a stack of 48 applications.
They looked at an application from a widow in Summit, N.J. She reported a mortgage payment of more than $6,200 a month. Her husband had made nearly $1 million a year. Another application was from a laid-off Marriott worker with a wife, two children and rent of $650.
The initial idea had been to give the highest priority to those with the lowest incomes. But in practice, the builders have found that calculating who deserves what is incredibly complex. Arguably, the Summit widow is facing greater economic distress. The Marriott worker could perhaps maintain his standard of living on government unemployment benefits. On the other hand, what if the Summit widow has substantial insurance or savings?
"Who's more needy?" Ms. Farrell asks. "How do you assess need? It's not so simple."
With so many applications to process, they did not linger on these questions. They decided to recommend giving the Summit widow one month's mortgage payment, and the Marriott worker $2,000, about three months' rent.
"We made a decision early on that it can't be perfect," said Jerome Belson, president of Associated Builders and Owners. "We do what we can."

Taking Stock
Efforts Win Praise From Giuliani
Almost five months after that 4 a.m. telephone call in Hawaii, Mr. Mitchell convened a status meeting in Atlanta during the home builders' annual convention. As it happened, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had delivered the convention's opening address that morning. "You should be very proud of what you have done," Mr. Giuliani said. 
In the afternoon, when Mr. Mitchell and the other key participants in the relief fund gathered, there was an air of pride. Mr. Mitchell reported that they had raised nearly $10 million. Mr. LaRocque reported that almost 500 families in the New York area had already received checks totaling almost $1.5 million. None of the money had been used for administrative expenses, he stressed.
"I surely don't think it's out of line for us to toot our horns," one committee member said.
But there were still problems to be addressed. The Long Island chapter, for example, had processed only one application. The Queens chapter had processed none. Mr. LaRocque also predicted that they would not be done distributing money until May.
But he was not complaining. Not a man given to misty sentimentality, Mr. LaRocque counts this endeavor as his greatest accomplishment. "You want to leave a mark," he said. "You want to feel like when you're gone from this place, you've made a mark that's improved it."

To the Editor:
 "Bush Plan Expected to Slow, Not Halt, Gas Emission Rise" (front page, Feb. 14) notes that the new Bush climate policy plan would "not require anything of anybody." Indeed, even the proposed emissions target -- an 18 percent drop over 10 years in carbon dioxide per dollar of gross domestic product -- probably represents no improvement over current trends. 
 According to the Energy Information Administration, during the last decade energy consumed per dollar dropped 1.6 percent annually and the carbon dioxide emitted per unit of energy dropped 0.1 percent annually. These changes, the result of energy efficency improvements, show that carbon dioxide emitted per dollar is already dropping at a rate comparable to that the Bush plan aims for. Achieving a target we are already on track for is a business-as-usual climate plan.

Australian Surprises: Gold Medal And Mom

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Jenny Camplin of Melbourne, Australia, spent four days in this small Utah resort town avoiding her daughter Alisa, an Olympic aerialist. It was not easy. Park City is not so big, plus Jenny was in the stands with Alisa's sister, Georgina, for Saturday's women's aerial semifinals.
 "Alisa would jump and turn to the crowd in the stands, and we would be ducking down behind the people seated in front of us," Georgina said. "We had a sign for Alisa, but we'd only raise it when she wasn't looking." 
 The ruse was necessary because Alisa Camplin forbade her family from attending the Salt Lake Olympics.
"She lives and trains 11 months a year in western Canada because in Australia we have so little snow," Jenny Camplin said. "Since we're never around when she competes, Alisa thought it might make her nervous if we were."
It was a matter of routine and economics, said Alisa, who had never won a major competition before capturing the gold medal today.
"My family can't ever be there, so I'm used to competing alone all the time," Alisa, 27, said. "If they came to the Olympics, I was afraid I'd feel extra pressure, or feel like I was letting them down, because it costs a lot of money to get to Utah from Australia."
But when Alisa finished her second jump today, posted the highest score and won the gold, she felt she had made a terrible mistake. She felt alone and did not like it.
"I felt bad," Alisa said. "I thought: 'What have I done? This is so wonderful and my family's not here.' "
A few moments later, she saw her mother and her 25-year-old sister waving their homemade sign -- "Aussie, Aussie, Alisa."
"It might have been a better present than the gold medal," Alisa said, then added with a laugh, "Well, obviously, I got both."
Veronica Brenner of Canada won the silver and her teammate Deidra Dionne won the bronze.
Australia was expected to win its first gold medal of any Winter Olympics in this event -- in fact, it won its first on Saturday, more or less by accident, in short-track speedskating -- because for years the Australian Olympians have been led by Jacqui Cooper, currently the second-ranked aerialist in the world. But Cooper broke her leg in training a week ago.
Nicknamed Little Buddy, the 5-foot-2, 106-pound Camplin had lived in Cooper's shadow for years. She acknowledged the expectations for a medal had been transferred to her, but she did not feel the weight of a sporting nation on her shoulders. "I wanted to win it, but come on, I had never won anything," Camplin said.
But she had trained as a teenager with Cooper in the same leech-infested pond during Australia's spring. All aerialists practice their off-season moves by doing their flips, twists and somersaults skiing off a ramp and landing in water.
So Camplin had put in the training and weathered the injuries: 10 concussions, broken collarbones, separated shoulders, a broken hand, a torn Achilles' tendon and knee injuries, including a mild tear of her medial collateral ligament just last month. And still, Camplin kept getting better, with several recent top-10 finishes.
At Saturday's semifinals, with her family surreptitiously looking on, she had placed second.
Today, Camplin was third after her first jump. She was one of a series of competitors to execute a back-full (one twist in the air)/double-full (two twists) on her second jump, but her marks were higher because she got more air, performed her twists cleaner with straighter skis and made a perfect landing.
Olga Koroleva of Russia was atop the standing after her first jump, and she had a last jump after Camplin with a chance to steal the gold medal. But Koroleva chose to do a less technically challenging maneuver -- degrees of difficulty for maneuvers are assigned in advance of the event -- and her scores placed her fourth.
In a twist on the Canadian-Russian figure skating controversy, Koroleva complained that she was not judged properly, and the Russian Olympic Committee said it would file a protest with the International Ski Federation.
"We are now preparing an official protest with the FIS, but we are prepared to go all the way to the executive board of the International Olympic Committee to seek justice," Gennady Shvets, a spokesman for the Russian committee, told Reuters.
Koroleva said, "I did a good jump and earned third place." She pointed out that the degree of difficulty of her two jumps was roughly the same as that of the two Canadians, but the Canadians had saved their toughest jumps for last. Koroleva had chosen to do the easier maneuver -- a back-full-full. The conservative route did not prove successful.
Koroleva's teammate, Natalia Orekhova, who finished seventh, was even more critical of the judges. "I believe the judges are biased," she said. "My scores are lower than what I deserve."
The marks for Camplin, meanwhile, were far superior to anyone. Her winning score was 193.47, compared with 190.02 for Brenner and 189.26 for Dionne. Koroleva's score was 188.37.
It was just two weeks ago that Georgina Camplin convinced her mother to call about the cost of airline tickets to Utah. "Wouldn't it be awful if Alisa won a medal and we're not there?" Georgina said.
"That won me over," Jenny Camplin said today.
When Alisa's performance had earned her the gold medal, Jenny and Georgina sat back in their grandstand seats at the Deer Valley Resort and cried.
"We just sat there so amazed," Jenny said. "Then I said, 'Give me that sign, we've got to wave it now.' "

Olympic Boom Leaves Visitors Feeling Busted

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Parking lots have increased daily rates fourfold, to $20. A Snickers candy bar costs $3.50. Hotel rooms that normally rent for $79 a night are $300 to $400. How about a banana for $1.50?
 In some quarters of downtown Salt Lake City, price gouging has become an Olympic sport. 
 Scalpers were recently selling tickets to a medals plaza ceremony featuring the Dave Matthews Band for $60. A local supermarket chain had first distributed them free. The daily rent for a full-size car from Hertz is $110, up from about $40. A Japanese restaurant downtown is selling sushi for as much as $7.75 a piece.
Susanne and Heather McDonald, sisters from the northwest Wyoming town of Moose, said a friend was having sushi at a restaurant in Park City, where skiing events are held, and the waiter was adding $3 for every side dish until the man identified himself as a local resident.
"Then he got them for free," Susanne McDonald said.
Utah has enjoyed an economic boom from the Winter Games, which will end their 17-day run Sunday. Planning for the Games has pumped $4 billion into the state economy through highway construction, a light-rail extension, expanded capacity at ski resorts, a large increase in the number of local hotel rooms and new housing at the University of Utah.
But persistent reports of inflated prices around Olympic sites are threatening to undermine Utah's goal of using the Games to raise the state's profile as a vacation destination.
"It is in the best interest of our community for Utah firms to maintain something close to customary prices," said R. Thayne Robson, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Utah. "If they don't, in the short term, it could come back to bite them."
Robson said that none of his economic studies of the financial impact of the Olympics on Utah took into account higher retail prices. If anything, he said, the higher prices could reduce short-term benefits by forcing people to leave earlier and could hurt the state in the long term by sending people away with bad feelings.
In some ways, Robson said, the concept was not unlike envisioning a gambler who planned to stay a week in Las Vegas but lost all his money the first day and had to go home.
"It's old-fashioned American capitalism, charging what the market will bear," Robson said. "Some people will get burned if they throw a lot of money away. But there is always a difference between a rational consumer and an irrational consumer."
Lars Lefgren, a professor of economics at Brigham Young University in Provo, said business owners planning for an Olympic bonanza by raising prices were being shortsighted and selfish, at the state's expense.
He cited the example of a nachos vendor who had been charging $7 during the Olympics but a lot less in normal times.
"It's kind of like a car wreck," Lefgren said. "Every driver wants to look at it, but every driver doesn't take into account what that does to traffic. At the end of the day, one nacho vendor is not going to make any difference, but collectively they all do."
Mayor Ross C. Anderson of Salt Lake City said some business had raised prices but most had not. Visitors who explore beyond downtown, Anderson said, will find bars, restaurants and shops with reasonable prices and many free cultural exhibits.
"Some people feel like they haven't been treated fairly," he said. "In terms of restaurants, most of them, including some of our finest, haven't raised their prices."
Economists and local business leaders say determining the full financial effect of staging the Olympics will take months, perhaps years. But it is clear that not everyone is benefiting.
Newspaper reports here and elsewhere calling attention to higher-than-usual prices, traffic congestion and the inconvenience of visiting downtown are hurting business at many Salt Lake City restaurants, said Melva Sine, president of the Utah Restaurant Association.
Sine also said some patrons were put off by some downtown restaurants that were adding a gratuity of 18 percent or more to the check. That is done, she said, to accommodate visitors from countries where the gratuity is routinely added to the check.
"People in Utah are not accustomed to that," she said. "To them, it looks like they're being charged more."
Sine said the extra expenses of accommodating the Olympic crowds, the loss of local customers who are avoiding the crowds and the slowing economy were likely to result in a 10 percent decline in the restaurant business this year around the state. That would mean the state tourism budget would not receive a $200,000 bonus that the Utah Legislature adds in any year restaurant business increases 4 percent over the previous year.
Many business owners justified their prices as necessary to cover higher costs during the Olympics, like having to buy more supplies and hire extra help. A major international event, they said, also creates its own economy of limited supply and heavy demand. In economic theory, that means higher prices.
Nearly all the hotels in the metropolitan area are full, said Ann Gambrino, executive director of the Utah Hotel and Lodging Association, and most are charging far more than they would in an ordinary February.
Many restaurants and bars have been packed every night of the Olympics, despite the high prices, a sign that many visitors have resigned themselves to paying more.
"I've been pleasantly surprised that the prices are what they are," D. Zachary Wiseman, a lawyer from Salt Lake City, said. "You know you're going to pay more at an event like this. It's common sense, the American way. We're being ripped off, but reasonably."
