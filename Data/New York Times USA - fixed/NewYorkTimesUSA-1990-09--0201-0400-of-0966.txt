HEADLINE: New York's Jobless Rate Falls

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
''And those who didn't get jobs left the labor market.''
Mr. Ehrenhalt also discounted an increase of 16,000 in the number of people employed in New York City in August, saying the gain was too small to be significant, given the limited size of the survey sample. The employment figures are based on a survey of 2,200 households in the city.
''I don't see any signs of particular strength, looking through the array of labor market indicators for the city,'' he added.
But in a statement released at City Hall, Mayor David N. Dinkins expressed optimism about the drop in the unemployment rate, saying that it suggested ''that the decline in our economy that began nearly three years ago may be nearing bottom.''
Informed of Mr. Ehrenhalt's comments, a spokesman for the Mayor, Leland T. Jones, said the city still regarded the drop as ''cause for optimism,'' especially when compared to the rise in the national unemployment rate.
''It appears as though we did not have quite as troubled a month as the rest of the economy did,'' he said.
The New York State unemployment rate also dropped, to 5.0 percent in August from 5.3 percent in July. A year ago, it was 5.1 percent.
Unemployment in New Jersey was 4.8 percent in August, the same rate as in the three prior months. It was 4.4 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: Split on How to Save Spotted Owl Is Reported in Bush's Study Group

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Sept. 7

 BODY:

 
No Announcement of Consensus
The Federal study group was to have delivered its recommendation by Sept. 1, but Federal officials said today that the panel had not reached a consensus and that nothing was expected until next week at the earliest.
Jim Mosely, the Agriculture Department's assistant secretary for natural resources and the environment, today called reports that a decision had been reached ''inaccurate and misleading.'' He said the study group, which includes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, and the heads of the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Council of Economic Advisors, have yet to reach an agreement. 
White House officials and congressional aides say the panel is torn between two positions.
One side, led by the Interior Secretary, Manuel Lujan Jr., wants to continue the Government's logging program at a relatively high level; if that causes legal problems by further threatening the owl, then changes to the Endangered Species Act should be considered. Mr. Lujan offered an indication of his thinking during a tour of Oregon two weeks ago when he was quoted as saying ''environmentalists are not going to like'' the panel's proposal.
The other side, dominated by people from the Forest Service, which is a branch of the Agriculture Department, favors adopting most of the recommendations of a Government scientific panel, which said the owl could only be saved by reducing the volume of logging by 50 percent or more.
No matter what the task force ultimately recommends, Congress is moving ahead on its own plan to reduce logging in the Northwest. In August, the House subcommittee that oversees the Forest Service voted on a plan to reduce the Northwest timber harvest by about 25 percent for next year, a proposal that would protect major forest areas where the owls live and follow the main guidelines of the Government scientific panel.
To allow more cutting than the House has proposed - as Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican of Washington, has advocated - could bring on more of the kind of lawsuits that have held up the timber sale program on Forest Service lands for the last three years, say some members of Congress.
In the late 1980's, nearly 5 billion board feet of timber was cut annually from Federal lands in the Northwest.
While environmentalists want to see the cut reduced by 50 percent, Congress is moving toward a level of 3.1 billion.
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the task force would likely reach a consensus on a recommendation to cut between 3 billion and 3.5 billion board feet.

HEADLINE: Deputy Defies Dukakis on Budget Plan

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
But Edward L. Lashman, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, struck a conciliatory note, calling Ms. Murphy's plan ''a very serious effort,'' even if it fell short of making the necessary budget reductions.
 
Intrigue at the Top
Ms. Murphy's plan, announced in a packed news conference at the gold-domed Statehouse, was the latest twist in a palace intrigue that began earlier this week when Mr. Dukakis learned she intended to take advantage of his absence while he was on a trade mission to Europe to issue what his aides termed a ''secret plan'' to revise the state's finances. Under Massachusetts law, the Lieutenant Governor assumes the Governor's powers when the chief executive is out of the state.
Mr. Dukakis, the Democratic Presidential nominee who was defeated by George Bush two years ago, had postponed his departure and derided her actions as a pathetic effort to achieve ''personal political gain.'' 
Ms. Murphy is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor, and polls show her trailing badly in the three-way race. The primary will be held on Sept. 18.
The Governor, who is not seeking re-election, finally left for Berlin on Thursday evening, although he warned that he would cut short his trip if she acted ''irresponsibly.''
With Mr. Dukakis gone Ms. Murphy proclaimed today, ''I won't be a do-nothing Lieutenant Governor.'' But she insisted at the news conference that her plan was ''nothing radical, nothing irresponsible.'' She did not move to dismiss any Dukakis cabinet member, as some of the Governor's aides had predicted.
 
Some Cuts and Changes
Instead, Ms. Murphy, who holds a doctorate in economics, announced a package of budget cuts and accounting changes. Among these were orders that 1,000 of the state's 4,000 department managers be laid off, that the state's 64,000 employees be reduced by 10 percent, that funds for all overtime pay be frozen and that the salaries of all officials earning more than $40,000 a year be temporarly cut. That would include her and Governor Dukakis.
Ms. Murphy estimated that her proposals would save the state $150 million this year. Coincidentally or not, that is about the same amount as the cuts Mr. Dukakis ordered on Tuesday, when he learned that tax revenue in August had again fallen short of projections despite the passage in July of the biggest tax increase in the state's history.
Massachusetts has been running a deficit since the Presidential campaign year of 1988, when the state's economy began to slow and revenue plummeted. Although Mr. Dukakakis has raised taxes and cut nearly $1 billion from the $13 billion budget over the last two years, the deficit has continued as the economy has continued to slow.
At the news conference Ms. Murphy said, ''This is a different way to achieve the same thing'' as the Governor's plan. But she added that her plan was superior because Mr. Dukakis had ordered across-the-board cuts that would have a severe impact on services like health care and education.
''We must not make across-the-board cuts that treat schoolchildren and political appointees as equals simply because we refuse to set priorities,'' she said.
 
Amount of Savings Disputed
But she was immediately disputed by Mr. Lashman, the state finance official, who said her proposals would only save about $15 million, not $150 million.
Philip Johnston, the Secretary of Human Services, said he did not intend to put Ms. Murphy's plan into effect, noting that it would force him to make deep cuts in programs for the mentally ill, the blind and abused children.
Steven Crawford, Mr. Dukakis's press secretary, said that the Governor had already cut the number of state employees by 8,500 since 1988 and that the current total of 64,000 employees was down to the 1983 level. Finding further cuts is not simple, he added.
Mr. Crawford also said the Lieutenant Governor's executive order did not involve a time frame, and therefore Mr. Dukakis's officials could easily stall until his return next week.
Ms. Murphy said another important change was her plan to make each department of the state government open its books, publish a montly report of its spending and balance its books each month.
She denied that her action was a ploy to get coverage in the press to help her in the Democratic contest for governor, where she is opposed by Francis X. Bellotti, a former State Attorney General, and John R. Silber, the president of Boston University.
Ms. Murphy insisted that her reason for acting after Mr. Dukakis left was simply that she was concerned by the state's continued fiscal troubles, especially after she learned that tax revenue had fallen again last month.
Mr. Bellotti said today that her actions were ''sad'' and the uproar she caused had further hurt the Democratic Party here, which has already been heavily criticized by the public for the fiscal crisis.
Mr. Silber discounted Ms. Murphy's budget plan as ''stupid,'' and said, ''She's not doing anything but having a little coffeehouse coup d'etat.''

HEADLINE: Budget Negotiators Go Into Seclusion

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, who is heading the Democratic delegation at the talks, agreed with Mr. Bush that the events of August did not make a budget compromise less necessary.
''If we needed a budget agreement five weeks ago,'' he said at a news conference today, ''we need one more today in terms of the ability of our economy to grow, to avoid a recession and in order to support economic progress. And now with the military challenge we have in the Middle East, I think it's even more important.''
 
Plans for $50 Billion Cut
At the outset today, both sides maintained that they had plans to cut the deficit by at least $50 billion in the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, and by $500 billion cumulatively over the next five years. 
With no changes in spending or taxes, the deficit in the $1.2 trillion Federal budget is expected to be more than $170 billion in the new fiscal year, not counting the savings and loan bailout, and about $250 billion counting the bailout money.
Reporters are not allowed near the officers' club at Andrews where the talks are taking place, and only sketchy information slipped out about what was discussed.
Mr. Bush stayed for only 25 minutes this morning and left the session in the hands of Richard G. Darman, his budget director, and about two dozen lawmakers from both parties.
 
Negotiators Are Far Apart
The two sides' opening offers were said to be sharply at odds.
The Administration's plan would limit the amount of state and local tax payments that taxpayers could deduct on their Federal income tax returns. It would also lower the capital gains tax, raise taxes on alcoholic beverages and cut spending sharply on many domestic programs, including Medicare and pension benefits for retired Federal employees and military personnel.
The Democratic plan includes higher income taxes on the wealthy, a new tax on gasoline and other fuel to encourage oil conservation and large cuts in Pentagon spending.
 
Neither Side Moves
''Big differences remain,'' Mr. Bush said before returning to the capital. ''It's going to take compromise.'' But despite the stated willingness of both sides to try to reach agreement, neither seemed willing to budge.
For example, two Republican negotiators, Senator Gramm and Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, said they would not ''tolerate'' an income tax increase. Central to the Democratic plan is an increase to 35 percent from 28 percent in the tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans.
Democrats also favor higher taxes to encourage fuel conservation, while Republicans support tax breaks to stimulate domestic oil production.
The Democrats would impose a 2 percent tax on all forms of energy, with the rate rising to 4 percent in 1992, and would also impose a tax on oil that would take effect if the price of crude oil dropped below $20 a barrel. The price closed today at $30.04.
Whatever else they do this weekend, two steps seem inescapable.
First, the annual deficit ceilings set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law will have to be raised. The limit for the next fiscal year is now $64 billion, and both sides agree that the economy would collapse under tax increases or spending cuts large enough to meet that figure. They also agree that the across-the-board spending reductions that would be required if the original target is missed would be more than the economy could stand.
Second, money for the savings and loan rescue operation will have to be excluded from the budget law's targets. Most negotiators believe this makes sense, since much of the money spent next year will be repaid in subsequent fiscal years when assets of the failed savings institutions are sold.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
India Insists on Gulf Refugee Aid While Supporting Embargo

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Mr. Seth accused the West of insensitivity to the desperate condition of scores of thousands of third world refugees trapped in Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait.
''Our people cannot afford to stay in five-star hotels,'' he said. ''We cannot afford to charter flights to get that number of people out.'' 
''Western Governments were quick to impose sanctions but not quick enough to deal with the consequences,'' he said, referring to the exodus from Iraq and Kuwait and the unsanitiary conditions and lack of food and water at the refugee camps in Jordan and elsewhere.
 
Air-and-Sea Evacuation Plan
Mr. Seth also said that India wanted to send several ships to Dubai and if possible to Kuwait to evacuate more than 100,000 Indians still trapped in the region. One plan is to fly refugees who have reached Jordan to Dubai, and then take them home by ship. India also hopes to augment refugee flights from Amman to New Delhi with direct flights to Baghdad, Indian television reported tonight.
Indian officials have suggested in the last few days that the Iraqi Government is saying that any Indian vessels would be allowed to go to Kuwait only if they take food and medicine.
Mr. Seth would not confirm that that was the situation but hinted that it was. He said ships enforcing the embargo against Iraq might also block Indian ships.
India cites Article 661 of the United Nations Charter, which allows humanitarian assistance to people suffering the effects of a blockade. It has instructed its representatives at the United Nations to lobby for such aid to be made available to people of all nationalities in Iraq and Kuwait.
Mr. Seth said that food and medicines should be distributed under the supervision of the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society of Iraq.
 
Economy Also Suffers
Mr. Seth said that India was getting support from other underdeveloped nations on another issue, the harsh economic jolt that their economies are suffering as a result of the sanctions.
''For every dollar increase in the price of oil, our foreign exchange outgo is 222 million dollars,'' he said.
He said that India and other third world countries were pressing the United Nations Security Council to consider ways to ease the burden of the blockade on poor nations. ''The Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan - all of us are in the same boat,'' he said.
About 170,000 Indians were in Kuwait and another 9,000 in Iraq when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. An Indian airlift has brought about 20,000 people back while another 30,000 have fled Kuwait and are in Iraq, Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Opponents to U.S. Move Have Poverty in Common

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
As they have historically in similar foreign crises, virtually every poll shows overwhelming initial support for the Administration's movement of troops into Saudi Arabia. The New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,422 Americans conducted by telephone Aug. 16 to 19 found that 77 percent supported the action.
But who are those who oppose the policy? According to political scientists and polling experts, opposition in this crisis closely follows classic public opinion patterns in conflicts in Korea, Vietnam and even the unsuccessful invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.
 
'It's a Class Thing'
''Quite simply, it's a class thing,'' said George C. Edwards, professor of political science at Texas A&M University and author of ''The Public Presidency: The Pursuit of Popular Support'' (St. Martin's Press). ''And what determines your economic class is your education.'' 
Of those in the Times/CBS News Poll who did not graduate from high school, 22 percent opposed the troop deployment; 12 percent of college graduates opposed it. Of those earning less than $15,000, 27 percent were opposed; of those earning more than $50,000, 8 percent were opposed. The trends reflected in the Times/CBS News Poll continue to be picked up in polls by other organizations, including a Gallup Poll over the weekend.
To some degree, a division along class lines also means a division along racial lines: 35 percent of blacks in the Times/CBS News Poll oppose the sending of United States troops to Saudi Arabia, as against 15 percent of whites.
Professor Edwards and others did not rule out the lingering influence of social alienation among blacks, who made up a large portion of military draftees and casualties in Vietnam and whose leaders, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., blamed that war for draining resources from domestic social programs.
The experts also noted that blacks tend to be Democrats and are thus predisposed to opposing Republican military policy.
Although the polling data indicate that poor, uneducated blacks oppose the military deployment in greater proportion than do poor, uneducated whites, the experts nonetheless said the split was really one along class lines.
 
Following News Was Key
Because blacks are disproportionately represented among the less educated and the less affluent, a larger percentage appears to oppose such military moves.
Samuel Kernell, professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, said, ''The uneducated, who by and large do not follow current events closely, are simply not responsive to the same positive stimuli as the better-educated and more affluent, who do tend to follow the news.''
He added: ''At the moment, Republican and Democratic leaders, the nation's cue-givers, are in agreement and supportive. And informed citizens have no independent flow of contradictory information.''
John E. Mueller, a political scientist at the University of Rochester and author of ''War, Presidents and Public Opinion'' (Wiley & Sons), said: ''This is a new incident, but an old phenomenon. It's the follower phenomenon. The well-educated support the President at first, whatever he's doing. When President Johnson stopped bombing North Vietnam, his support went up. When he started bombing again, his support went up. The decline tends to come later.''
Professor Kernell said he expected support to dip by Thanksgiving as political leaders began dividing along party lines and individuals accumulated their own evidence. ''Gas prices may hit them hard,'' he said. ''A relative or friend may be killed or wounded. They'll see the costs, but not the benefits. The erosion will set in.''
Those new opponents will swell the existing minority, who do not seem susceptible to persuasion, in part, because they are not listening. The 63-year-old Miss Birdsong, for example, estimates that she watches 10 hours of television a day in her Troy, Ohio, apartment. But like many opponents in the Times/ CBS News Poll in follow-up interviews, she will not watch the news. ''When that Iraq news comes on, I switch, unless it's interrupting a soap opera,'' she said.
The poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, found that of those following the news closely, 85 percent supported the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia, while among those who did not follow the news closely, 59 percent supported it.
Eugene Patrick, a 52-year-old school bus mechanic in Florence, Miss., who has a sixth-grade education and who does not read, said that he voted for Mr. Bush and that he still believed Mr. Bush was a good president. ''That Iraq guy doesn't need to be there,'' said Mr. Patrick. ''But we have no business there either.''
Mr. Patrick, who is black, was unaware of the involvement in the Iraq crisis of prominent blacks, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who helped arrange the release of some hostages from Iraq, or Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But he said he thought there was a racial motive to American military involvement.
''I believe a lot of people are worried the blacks are going to take over, and sending them is some slick way of thinning the blacks out,'' he said.
According to the Department of Defense, as of June 30, the United States military, excluding the Coast Guard, had 421,211 blacks (20.6 percent) among its 2,040,676 troops.
Kenneth Garnsey of Denison, Tex., a 51-year-old unemployed handyman who did not attend high school, sees the Iraqi confrontation as ridiculous for another reason. ''We're going to blow them up,'' said Mr. Garnsey, who is white. ''And then we're going to pay to rebuild them. That's what we always do. We should just bomb Iraq a little bit, like we did with Libya a few years ago. You don't hear any more about them making trouble.''
Sandra Robertson, a Florence, Colo., housewife, agrees with Miss Birdsong's opposition. ''We're always more interested in helping people in other countries when we have poor and homeless here at home,'' she said.
Professor Edwards sees the confrontation's duration as the key factor in any opinion shift this fall. ''The U.S. position may be the right one,'' he said. ''But it's difficult to defend over time. A war for cheap gasoline? The reasons must resonate with the American public. Americans do not have a history of making military sacrifices for economic gain. To fight, it has always been a question of 'morality.' A Soviet attack on Western Europe? Yes. An invasion of Cambodia? No. An invasion of Kuwait? I don't know.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
EUROPEAN NATIONS PROPOSE GULF AID

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Mr. De Michelis, who was chairman of the meeting today because Italy holds the rotating presidency of the community, said the 12 would share the costs of the crisis and, in that way, would relieve the United States.
''The money we give to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey is money that the United States will not have to give,'' he said. [A spokesman for the State Department in Washington had no comment on the community's decision.] 'Ready to Tighten Embargo' 
A decision on the exact size of the community's contribution to the planned aid package was postponed until Sept. 17, pending talks with Saudi Arabia and some gulf states. Community officials said it would probably total around $2 billion for 1990 and 1991.
The Community foreign ministers also stressed the need to close all loopholes in the trade embargo against Iraq, noting that sanctions should be effective in blocking the movement of goods by land and air as well as by sea. ''We are ready to tighten the embargo,'' Mr. De Michelis said.
Although the foreign ministers made no reference to the meeting in Helsinki on Sunday planned by President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, officials said they were eager to show a united community position in anticipation of the meeting.
Further, they accepted a Soviet proposal for a joint Soviet-European Community statement on the gulf crisis to be issued at the United Nations on Sept. 27. A senior British official said it was not clear why Moscow wanted the statement, but he added: ''Why not do it, if Moscow wants it?''
 
Three Communiques Issued
The foreign ministers issued three formal communiques today, one urging the United Nations Secretary-General to send a mission to reach Western diplomats trapped in Kuwait, a second reiterating the community's desire for close ties with the Arab world and the third dealing with the aid package.
They noted that, along with the so-called front-linestates of Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, efforts should be made to help other Middle East nations as well as the countries of Eastern Europe, whose efforts to build market-oriented economies have been complicated by the rise in world oil prices.
The European Commission, which is the community's executive branch, has estimated that Egypt, Jordan and Turkey alone stand to lose $2.8 billion this year and $6.5 billion next year from lost trade and higher oil prices. It has proposed that the community cover 15 percent of that cost, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 65 percent and Japan and South Korea the remaining 20 percent.
 
Donations but No Control
Community officials said the members were eager to be seen by Washington as taking part in the ''burden sharing'' effort, with Britain and France stressing the considerable costs involved in their own military buildups in the gulf region. Britain, Italy and Portugal have also offered aircraft and ships to transport American troops and equipment.
But it is also apparent that President Bush's call for donations to help pay for the American military presence has caused discomfort in several European capitals, not least because such contributions would not give community governments any control over the use of United States forces.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Insists Individual Nations Can't Break Blockade of Iraq

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
''That is the work of the Sanctions Committee of the Security Council,'' he said.
The committee, made up of all Security Council members, will resume hearing arguments on what constitutes humanitarian aid when it continues the debate adjourned on Thursday.
 
A Conflict of Views
On Thursday, China and Iran indicated that they might ignore the sanctions and send food and medicine to Iraq. Tunisia, Yugoslavia, Romania and India said they wanted to send emergency supplies to their citizens trapped in Kuwait. They said they believed that the shipments would be permitted as humanitarian aid under the United Nations sanctions. 
The American officials noted that Iraq itself has stated that it has many months of food in reserve. They said, too, that in the event a need on humanitarian grounds is determined, the United States would like to see food shipped and distributed through humanitarian agencies, not commercial or government sources. They insisted that it was important to insure that such supplies not become a way to breach the sanctions or divert food.
Here at the United Nations, the Military Staff Committee, which has figured prominently in recent Security Council over the crisis in the Persian Gulf, held its regular semimonthly meeting Thursday. Created by the United Nations Charter, it is charged with advising the Security Council on military matters, including the long-abandoned proposal for a standing United Nations military force. For more than 40 years, it has had virtually nothing to do.
Originally at the insistence of the Soviet Union and more recently of the United States as well, the Security Council has been re-examining the role of the committee with an eye to giving it a more powerful role in coordinating the activities of the multinational forces currently in the Persian Gulf under United Nations auspices.
At first, the committee was comprised of the chiefs of staff of the five permanent memebers of the Security Council, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
As time went on, the chiefs of staff delegated committee duties to junior officers, usually the military attaches of the permanent five members' missions. Chairmanship of the meetings rotates on a monthly basis, and a more senior officer often appears when his country had the chair, according to a diplomat familiar with the committee.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher But Falls Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar firmed slightly in reaction to a Government report showing that the nation's jobless rate rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.5 percent the month before, traders said.
''I think people were anticipating a far worse figure,'' said Harlan Matusow, an assistant vice president in currency trading at the New York office of Bank Julius Baer & Company. Analysts said a bad unemployment report could have persuaded the Federal Reserve to ease credit. Lower interest rates tend to weaken the dollar. 
Much of the dollar's advance the rest of the day appeared to stem from investors covering short positions by buying dollars, he said.
Traders who had anticipated a worse unemployment report and had been selling dollars decided to cover their positions, he said.
In addition, since the start of the Iraqi crisis, investors have been afraid to hold short positions over weekends for fear the dollar's value could be adversely affected by events before the market reopens Monday, he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 140.25 Japanese yen from 141.65 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it fell to 140.15 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 140.05 yen at late afternoon, down from 140.65 late Thursday.
The dollar rose against the British pound. The pound cost $1.8933 in London, cheaper than $1.9075 late Thursday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8930 at late afternoon, down from $1.9125 late Thursday.
The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, said sterling will not join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System during a weekend meeting of European finance officials. Rumors that the pound would join the mechanism have recently suppported the currency.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.5680 German marks, up from 1.5560; 1.3055 Swiss francs, up from 1.2975; 5.2530 French francs, up from 5.2135; 1,170.50 Italian lire, up from 1,161.50, and 1.1634 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1563.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $386.75 an ounce, from $389.50 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $387.00 an ounce, from $388.80 late Thursday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 64 cents to close at $388.23 an ounce.
Silver bullion closed at $4.800 an ounce on the Comex, up from $4.770 late Thursday. Silver was unchanged in London at a late bid of $4.80 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Fed Did Not Act on Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
''This does not mean that we are out of the intervention business,'' said Sam Cross, executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and manager of the Fed's foreign operations.
Asked during a news briefing whether the Fed had failed to intervene because it was satisfied with the direction of the dollar or because it felt intervention would be futile, Mr. Cross responded, ''It doesn't necessarily mean either one of those things.'' 
He said conditions did not call for intervention.
During the three months that ended July 31, the dollar declined 8 percent against the Japanese yen, 12 percent against the British pound and 5.5 percent against the German mark. The dollar sank further in August, reaching an all-time low of 1.5375 marks.
Mr. Cross said decisions to intervene were not made purely on the basis of the value of the dollar, but also took into account fundamental economic positions of the United States and other countries.
While the Fed did not intervene to increase the value of the dollar, it did sell marks and buy dollars in open market transactions and directly from another bank, which was not identified.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 23.26 Points; Week's Rise Is 5.19

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.26, to 2,619.55. But with oil prices rising most of the week, the Dow gained just 5.19 for the week. In another slow day, volume slumped to 123.8 million shares, from 125.6 million on Thursday. But 922 stocks rose and 10 hit new highs, while 560 fell and 62 reached new lows. 
''The market's not focusing on developing evidence of a recession,'' said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, ''but on the potentially positive aspect of the Bush and Gorbachev meeting.''
Traders here said unfounded rumors from ''somewhere in Asia'' that President Saddam Hussein had fled Iraq caused traders to take profits on crude oil, and prices fell abroad. Crude prices in the United States opened lower and remained lower, ending at $30.04, down $1.39.
Traders said the drop in oil prices touched off buying of S.& P. 500-stock index futures in Chicago, which caused heavy program trading in New York, with program traders working on the thin price differences between the futures and the stocks.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said the effect of five buying waves and one selling wave was to tack 34 points on the Dow. Since the Dow rose only 23.26 points, the implication was that program buying was the main source of the rise.
 
Rumors Lift UAL by 8
UAL rose 8, to 100 1/4, on rumors that a union buyout group had obtained financing and on speculation that Marvin Davis, the oilman who had bid before, might bid again.
Toys ''R'' Us led the Big Board active list, falling 5/8, to 23 1/8, after Robert J. Schweich of Wertheim Schroder cut his earnings estimate. I.B.M. rose 3 1/8, to 105 1/2, after favorable comments by Shearson; Merrill Lynch; Smith Barney; Morgan Stanley and Sanford C. Bernstein.
Oracle, the software maker, headed the Nasdaq active list, falling 1 3/4 to close at 8 1/8, after hitting a new low of 6 3/4. It said it would report a loss, its first, in the quarter ended Aug. 31.
With crude oil down, the Dow transportation index rose 16.08, to 908.28. UAL accounted for most of that, but Delta Air Lines rose 3/4, to 55; CSX was up 7/8, to 30 3/8, and Conrail rose 7/8, to 38 3/4.

HEADLINE: Ford Chief's Views on Oil

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 7 (Reuter)

 BODY:
The auto industry is better prepared now to withstand the effects of an oil crisis and meet consumer demand for fuel-efficient vehicles than it was during the Middle East oil crisis of the 1970's, Harold Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said today.
 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2 has led to concerns about oil supplies and is ''the most immediate challenge confronting us,'' Mr. Poling said in a speech at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.
''The industry is much better prepared today than in the 1970's to maneuver through an oil crisis, and the same is true of the U.S. economy as a whole,'' he said.
Mr. Poling said American industry was ''honing its competitive abilities - renewing its factories, accelerating productivity, focusing on quality and making employee involvement a way of life - improvements that pave the way for an enhanced competitive position in the years ahead.''

HEADLINE: Aid to Airbus Called Unfair In U.S. Study

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
The report, which was prepared by a private consulting firm, Gellman Research Associates of suburban Philadelphia, found that the government backers of the consortium -France, West Germany, Britain and Spain - had already committed or disbursed $13.5 billion into Airbus Industrie programs since the late 1960's. With the addition of commercial interest rates, the total value of the aid was put at $25.9 billion.
Yet none of the programs are commercially viable, or are likely to be, the study said. Instead, the report added, Airbus sold aircraft below cost to increase market share, a process that deprived American makers of revenues to invest in new aircraft. 
The subsidies ''provide an unfair advantage over United States manufacturers and could injure the industry's future competitiveness,'' said J. Michael Farren, Under Secretary of Commerce for international trade. Against an overall trade deficit last year topping $100 billion, he noted, this industry generated a $12 billion surplus.
Europeans respond that the United States Government distorts free and fair trade in aerospace at least as much as the Europeans through Pentagon and National Aeronautics and Space Administration contracts and ''Buy American'' policies. According to Henri Martre, chairman of Aerospatiale, a French aerospace organization, the American industry receives at least three times as much overall support as the European.
Europeans also say that the American industry is now being helped by the low dollar exchange rate, which makes American planes more competitive. Bonn has just agreed to provide Daimler-Benz guarantees of more than $2 billion to cover the currency exchange risk from Airbus programs until 1999.
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial corporation, recently acquired Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm, the German partner in the Airbus consortium. The other partners are Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain.
 
Program Strongly Criticized
Washington has strongly criticized the currency guaranty program and threatened to file charges against Bonn under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter. Exchange loss reimbursement undermines free trade by forestalling a normal redressment of deficits, American officials argue.
The Administration has warned that it will be forced to take legal action against the consortium if the issue is not resolved by Oct. 1.
A European Community spokesman, Peter Doyle, said that the publication of the report came in the middle of the negotiations and was therefore ''untimely and unhelpful.'' He added that the release was ''even more surprising'' in that it came a day after ministers from the Airbus countries had met with a member of the community's Executive Commission, Frans Andriessen, in London and concluded that there was common ground for the continuation of talks with the United States.
 
Report 'Was Ready'
Asked why the report was issued at this time, Commerce Under Secretary Farren said only that ''it was ready.'' He added that he did not expect it to affect the negotiations.
The United States for at least the last five years has been highly critical of Airbus subsidies for the reasons cited in the report. But officials said this was the first time a detailed objective analysis of the subsidies had been placed within a single complete package. Entitled ''An Economic and Financial Review of Airbus Industrie,'' the report is expected to figure prominently in internal Administration discussions about what action to take on Oct. 1.
The Commerce Department paid Gellman Associates $50,000 for the study. The same firm did a similar paper for the department in 1986, but it was never published. The earler work cost the department $150,000.
Asked whether the Europeans provided any data for the report, Aaron J. Gellman, the president of the consulting firm, said: ''We sought assistance from them. We were promised much and virtually nothing was delivered.''

HEADLINE: Anxiety Under That Fabled Cypress

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Sept. 7

 BODY:
The Pebble Beach Company has been sold to Ben Hogan Properties, a Fort Worth company controlled by Minoru Isutani, who owns an empire of golf clubs and sporting goods manufacturers in Japan and abroad. Most of his companies do business under the name Cosmo World Corporation.
The price, which was not announced, is believed to have been in the range of $800 million to $1 billion.
The property was sold by a partnership, Miller, Klutznick Davis & Gray, whose most widely known partner is Marvin Davis, the Denver oilman. Mr. Davis acquired the Pebble Beach Company as part of his $800 million purchase of 20th Century Fox, the film company, in 1981. The partnership bought Pebble Beach in two stages, in 1983 and 1985, for an undisclosed price, from Fox, which had paid $70 million for it in 1978. 
Real estate executives said there had been other bidders and that the Davis partnership had made a sizable profit on the sale. Some press reports said, however, that the Davis partnership had been losing money on its operations because of heavy debt payments.
The most famous part of the property is the Pebble Beach Golf Links, where the annual Bing Crosby National Pro-Am, now the A.T.&T. Pro-Am, seems to attract as many movie stars as professional golfers and where the 1992 United States Open Championship is to be held. But the property also includes three other golf courses, two hotels, hundreds of acres of real estate and the scenic 17-Mile Drive, where tourists pay $5.75 to wend their way past ocean cliffs, lush Spanish-style estates nestled in deep woods and a lone cypress tree on a craggy cliff made famous by the photographs of Ansel Adams and Edward Weston. Now the company claims trademark protection for the tree and is trying to bar photographers from making commercial use of it.
 
'A Piece of Americana'
Seeking to allay fears, the Pebble Beach Company's president, Tom Oliver, said at a news conference Thursday that the new management would continue to run things the same way. Mr. Oliver, however, was not available for an interview today.
Others involved in the transaction also maintained their silence. Several calls to Cosmo's American headquarters in Los Angeles were answered by someone saying that anyone who could talk was busy or out of the office.
Pebble Beach is only the latest prime American property bought by Japanese interests and ranks in size with Mitsubishi Estate Comapany's 1989 purchase of a controlling stake in Rockefeller Center for $846 million.
''When you're buying Pebble Beach it's like you're buying Yellowstone Park,'' said Daniel S. Levitan, director of real estate consulting in the Los Angeles office of Price Waterhouse. ''It's a piece of Americana.'' But Mr. Levitan said that the Pebble Beach purchase might be one of the last of its kind, given the decline of the Japanese stock market and uncertainties about the health of the American real estate market.
Mr. Levitan said, however, that if the estimates of the price were right, it indicated that ''this was not an economic decision to buy this in my opinion,'' adding, ''It was an ego purchase.''
It is also part of a broadening of Japanese interest from buying primarily downtown office buildings to buying resorts and golf clubs. Other Japanese companies have purchased the La Costa resort near San Diego and the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles.
Part of this interest stems from the booming popularity of golf in Japan, a tiny nation without the land to build many golf courses. On any given weekend, the courses at Pebble Beach and elsewhere in California are filled with Japanese golfers. In can be far less expensive to fly here from Japan for a week of golf than to pay the dues in a Japanese golf club, where memberships can cost more than $1 million. And Japanese owners can deliver customers to their American golf courses, allowing them to pay more for a course than an American company, real estate analysts say.
Mr. Isutani, who controls Cosmo World, has attracted his share of controversy. In Japan, some members of his golf clubs have accused his company of selling far more memberships than had been agreed, making it difficult to get reservations, The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this week. His name has also been in the Japanese media for his relationship with Hisashi Shinto, the former chairman of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company who is being tried for his involvement in the political bribery scandal involving the Recruit Company, the newspaper added.
In July, The Las Vegas Sun reported that the Nevada gaming authorities were planning to reject Mr. Isutani's application to run a casino there. The newspaper cited Mr. Isutani's possible involvement in the Recruit scandal, though such a link has never been proved.
Cosmo World is developing a huge hotel and resort complex near Las Vegas and has signed up Caesars World Inc. to manage the non-casino hotel. The company is developing the Los Angeles International Golf Club and is co-developing a resort in Hawaii. It purchased the Ben Hogan Company, a maker of golf clubs and sportswear, in 1988.
Despite Pebble Beach's prominence and the questions about Mr. Isutani, many people here seem to accept the purchase as a fact of life.
To some extent, the controversy was blunted because reports of the sale began to circulate in June, giving people time to adjust. However, the initial reports were that Cosmo was going to buy only 49 percent of the property.
It is not clear why it changed to a full buyout, although some real estate specialists say that when the property was originally put on the market, a 100 percent stake was offered for sale. The minority investment might have been floated to diffuse controversy.
''The 49 percent was one way to try to keep a lot of people happy in the area,'' said Brad Blackman of Blackman, Flynn & Company, a San Francisco real easte firm. ''Everybody's been attempting to try to keep transactions less controversial,'' he said. However, after it appeared that controversy was not developing, he said, the deal was changed to a complete purchase.
 
Varied Reactions by Golfers
Golfers here expressed a range of reactions.
''I think it's part of our heritage,'' said Charles Kirby of Fort Myers, Fla., who is vacationing here. ''I hate to see it go into the hands of foreigners.''
But Dennis Schwary, a Southern California financial consultant, said he was not worried. ''Until they find a way to unbolt it and take it home, it will still be in America.''
Some expressed hope that as in their purchases of failing American factories and companies, the Japanese would infuse new capital in the operation. Despite its reputation and stiff greens fees, the course has a problem with weeds, and the greens are brown in patches from the continuing California drought.
''All I want them to do is put some water on it,'' said Tom Testman, from Orange County, who golfs here two or three times a year.

HEADLINE: A Symphony in Search of a Home (or Cash)

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
No symphony orchestra has ever picked up and moved to another city, and the 82 members of the Buffalo Philharmonic, who passed the hat to pay for the $360 classified ad, regarded it as highly unlikely that some prosperous town looking for culture would make them an offer.
But, as hoped, the ad quickly drew the attention of news organizations, and spokesmen for Buffalo's Local 92 of the American Federation of Musicians, which represents the orchestra members, were ready with tongue-in-cheek comments.
''We're going to entertain any offers that come as a result of the ad,'' said Frances Morgante, a violinist and union representative. ''But, obviously, to move around the country is not what we would like to do. We want management to keep what they have here. We will go to any extent to maintain our status as a major symphony orchestra.'' 
''Who knows?'' Susie Myers, an English horn player, said in another telephone interview. ''We might get a good offer. We might be the Green Bay Packerettes.''
But there was a serious side to the attention-getting gesture as well, said Richard Myers, the orchestra's principal trombonist and a spokesman for the union. He said that every member of the orchestra had received a letter of dismissal from the management last month in an apparent move to scrap and renegotiate a three-year contract signed a year ago.
Mr. Myers said the orchestra's management had demanded a wage freeze to cancel wage increases of 5 percent scheduled for the second and third years of the contract. He said the orchestra also wanted to cut seven weeks from its 46-week schedule, due to start Sept. 22, and to permanently eliminate five vacant musicians' chairs.
He said the orchestra musicians, whose minimum wage is $32,016 a year, would lose $10,000 to $12,000 if salaries were frozen and the season cut to 39 weeks. The musicians would lose seven weeks' pay as well as the increases scheduled in the contract that the management wants to scrap, he said. He also said the orchestra was already understaffed by nearly 20 members.
 
'The Minor Leagues'
''If we take the cuts they're demanding, we'll be reduced from a major American orchestra to the minor leagues,'' Mr. Myers said. ''It's tragic that this orchestra, with a history of distinguished conductors, great soloists and major tours, has arrived at a point where musicians are constantly being asked to subsidize their own existence.''
In a review for The New York Times in 1986, Tim Page said of a concert by the Buffalo Philarhonic in Carnegie Hall: ''The Buffalo sound is full, rich and well-blended; the playing disciplined but never mechanical, with only an occasional muddy passage or tentative attack.''
Steve Paschang, a spokesman for the orchestra, acknowledged that the management was seeking a wage freeze, a shortened season and a smaller orchestra. He said the measures would ''come close to'' making up the $2.2 million deficit in a 1990-91 budget that he estimated at $6.5 million.
Mr. Paschang noted that the orchestra had signed a three-year contract last September in the expectation of substantial subsidies from state, county and city governments. He could not say how much the orchestra had sought, and obtained, from government sources.
 
'Support Should Be There'
''Yes, we got some help, but not as much as we wanted,'' he said. ''The Philharmonic is in trouble. The city is coming back. This is a world-class orchestra - many music critics say it's one of the seven or eight best in the country - and the support should be there. We don't know why it isn't.''
Asked about the musicians' advertisement offering to move en masse to another city, Mr. Paschang said: ''It's an attention-getter. We take it about as seriously as they do.''
The musicians' union attributed the budget problems to ''mismanagement and fiscal irresponsibility'' by the orchestra and its board, Mr. Myers said. ''The members of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra are facing the most serious threat to the survival of their organization since the beginning of its troubled history.''
 
Distinguished Conductors
Since its inception in the 1930's as a Works Progress Administration orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic has had distinguished conductors, including William Steinberg, Josef Krips, Lukas Foss, Michael Tilson Thomas, Julius Rudel and Semyon Bychkov. The present musical director is Max Imiano Valdes.
Several orchestra members said they did not want to leave Buffalo, but warned that a move was not out of the question.
''We're serious,'' said Ms. Myers, whose husband is a spokesman for the union. ''We want them to know we want to remain a major symphony orchestra, and we're willing to relocate. We're a superb orchestra, and everybody admits that, but we constantly have to justify our existence, and we're tired of it.''
The tactic of threatening a move to another city is commonly used by sports teams, like the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres, who recently warned of a move if the city did not build a new arena in five years. Buffalo is considering the arena and a new football stadium for the Bills. With the biggest attendance in the minors for its Bisons (a Pittsburgh Pirates farm club), Buffalo wants a major league baseball franchise, too.
As for offers to move the Philharmonic, Mr. Myers said, ''We're not holding our breath.''

HEADLINE: About New York;
Making Struggle More Bearable For AIDS Cases

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
There were also a couple of dozen people, mainly minorities and poor, who have chosen to give their time to those struggling with AIDS. Along with about 60 others, they are members of the Bronx AIDS Volunteer Organization, known as Project Bravo. Bravo is a joint effort of four Bronx hospitals and is financed by the United Hospital Fund and the city and Federal governments. Some volunteers are middle class, but many teeter on the economic edge.
''These are people who have been kicked around by the system,'' said the coordinator, Bridget Lee Poust, who says most are so poor they could not participate if Bravo didn't pay for transportation. 
The mission of Bravo, which was begun in 1986 by clients of Montefiore's methadone clinic, is to help those with AIDS in the city's poorest borough. It hopes to provide some measure of the magnificent support that the Gay Men's Health Crisis has given people with AIDS, mainly in Manhattan. As the cruel scourge falls ever harder on the poor, minorities and drug users, Bravo is on the front line.
The stakes - and the outlook - are disheartening. A study postulates that one in five men in the Bronx now carry the virus that causes AIDS.
''It could destroy this borough,'' Ms. Poust said softly. ''You could look around one day and say, 'Where did everybody go?' ''
Why does anyone volunteer for unpaid work with a guaranteed sad ending?
Some do it as a memorial to someone who has died of AIDS, perhaps a child. Some have the AIDS virus themselves. Some are moved by the plight of homeless people with AIDS. Some believe in an afterlife and the certainty of perfect peace. Some couldn't put any of it in words.
 
Ms. Poust said poor
Bronxites are often distrustful at first, even of this clearly humanitarian effort, reflecting lifetimes of being disappointed by those in authority.
Some, she said, believe the C.I.A. started AIDS. Some even think white doctors devised it to eliminate blacks.
Volunteers do a little of everything. They go with a frantic mother to pick up a welfare check. They intercede with a landlord trying to evict someone in the hospital. When that fails, they will scour the Bronx for another apartment. They'll play checkers for hours, take people out for Chinese food, buy Christmas gifts with their own money. One found herself wheeling a man with the disease to another ward for dates with his sick wife.
The newest Bravo initiative is called the Legacy Project. It involves people with AIDS making videos in which they discuss things like their childhood, what it is like to have AIDS and what they think about whatever. The idea, Ms. Poust says, is to combat ''this feeling that nobody will ever know I was here.''
A philosopher once wrote that if nothingness awaits us, let us not live in a way that makes this an act of justice.
Lizabeth Kahn is an unemployed hairdresser whose brother and a couple of good friends died of AIDS. She herself carries the virus that causes the disease. She told of convincing one patient to go to the dentist. ''You'll look at yourself in the mirror and smile, and at least you've got your teeth,'' she said.
Clydette Niles, a former addict, told of teaching arts and crafts, things like making ashtrays and key chains. ''But some of them don't want to do nothing,'' she said. ''The ones that don't want to do nothing, I'll just stay and talk to.''
William Ramos said he volunteered because he has AIDS himself. His message: ''It's not as bad as you think it is.'' So why has he twice tried to commit suicide?
Edna Honeyghan, a retired nurse, attributes her devotion to the AIDS work to maternal instinct. She lost her only child in a miscarriage. ''I don't expect to get anything out of it,'' she said.
Mary Leonard, a Roman Catholic nun, comes to listen for an inner peace that descends when people finally lie back and rest in God's arms. Never ever does she mention the word AIDS.
Bravo.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bush and Gorbachev, in Helsinki, Face the Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Sept. 8

 BODY:
''Here in Helsinki, President Gorbachev and I meet, hopefully to strengthen our common approach to this unjustifiable act of aggression,'' he said after alighting from his new Presidential jumbo jet at the Helsinki Airport this morning, The two leaders were meeting for the third time as heads of state; they met in Malta in December and in Washington at the end of May.
''If the nations of the world, acting together, continue as they have been to isolate Iraq and deny Saddam the fruits of aggression, we will set in place the cornerstone of an international order more stable and secure than any we have known,'' Mr. Bush said.
 
Personal Contact 'Essential'
Mr. Gorbachev, flying into Helsinki about seven hours later, said:
''I hope this will be an important meeting. We have things to discuss, although we are constantly exchanging views, maintaining contact by telephone and letter and through our representatives. But at such a time personal contact is essential. 
''I think we will discuss the acute crisis in the Persian Gulf and many other questions, current questions of world politics.''
President Bush told reporters on the way to Helsinki that he had no plans to ask Moscow to send ground troops to the multinational force assembled in Saudi Arabia - a proposal that Mr. Gorbachev would almost certainly reject because of strong popular opposition at home.
The Soviets fear a military conflict a few hundred miles from their southern border would arouse the painful memories of their war in Afghanistan and might also increase tensions between Russians and the country's large Islamic minority.
 
A Sensitive Issue
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview with CNN today that the President ''sensed a sensitivity on that issue by the Soviets, and felt it was an inappropriate request to make at that time.''
But Mr. Bush said he would propose ''a wide array'' of cooperative measures against Iraq.
Soviet journalists said that Mr. Gorbachev might be willing to integrate Soviet warships into an international armada policing the economic embargo against Iraq if Mr. Bush would agree to put the force under the authority of the United Nations.
Although the United States has resisted subjecting its armed forces to United Nations control, a senior American official said it was ''not excluded'' that some United Nations role could be found that would elicit a measure of Soviet military cooperation.
Soviet analysts also predicted that Mr. Gorbachev would agree to American requests that Moscow withdraw its military trainers and technicians from Iraq, although the Soviet leader may seek to do this without fanfare.
The Soviets have said they were reluctant to remove the 193 military personnel and other, civilian weapon specialists for fear that this would precipitate the taking of Soviet hostages.
 
'Impossible to Justify'
But Moscow seems more willing to withdraw its military specialists now that Soviet women and children have been evacuated from the region.
''Many Soviet analysts feel that we've got to get them out of Iraq because morally it is impossible to justify their presence,'' said Stanislav N. Kondrashev, the well-connected political commentator for the Government daily Izvestia.
Mr. Gorbachev was almost certain to make a strong appeal for expanded American help in rescuing his economy. The Soviet leader arrives in Helsinki at a time when his popularity at home is at the lowest ebb since he came to power five years ago, and he would welcome any new American commitment of assistance.
President Bush also seemed sympathetic to Mr. Gorbachev's needs, telling reporters that he was ''all for'' expanding technical aid in areas like the development of Soviet oilfields.
One serious rift between the two superpowers has emerged over Moscow's call for a peace conference that would consider the gulf crisis and then move on to discuss the Israeli occupation of Arab lands and the conflict in Lebanon.
 
Idea of Meeting Revived
The United States has never been enthusiastic about Moscow's longstanding notion of an international conference that might try to impose a settlement on Israel.
Western diplomats were startled early this week when the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, revived the idea and suggested adding Iraq to the agenda.
In a statement issued before he left for the summit meeting in Helsinki, Mr. Shevardnadze again raised the idea of a conference, suggesting that it would deal with the Iraq crisis in a first phase and then move on to deal with issues of Israeli-occupied Arab lands and the conflict in Lebanon in later phases.
Mr. Shevardnadze also offered to travel to Iraq and ''to work with Israel at the ministerial level'' in an attempt to organize such a gathering.
He acknowledged that the United States ''has not yet shown great enthusiasm for this plan.''
''But I believe we should not be frightened by this idea,'' he said.
 
Issue Linked, Arab Says
The Soviets and some Arabs contend the promise of such a conference could strengthen the resolve of Arab nations in facing down Iraq and give President Hussein a face-saving way to retreat.
''I don't think the Soviets mean to postpone the resolution of this most urgent problem until we can solve the problems of the Palestinians and Lebanon,'' said an Arab diplomat in Moscow. ''Clearly you do not want linkage in the sense of a concession to Saddam Hussein. But the issues are linked in that these problems are all symptoms of the same larger cancer in the Middle East.''
Western diplomats said there was great unease among the allies that the Soviet push for a diplomatic initiative would seem to give ground before Mr. Hussein has indicated any willingness to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
''Bush cannot afford to send any signal that encourages Saddam to think we are offering a deal,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Saddam has to make the first move. Until he does, we are not in the business of looking for face-savers. If you make an offer, Saddam will just pocket it and think you are losing your resolve.''
 
A Division of Labor
At the same time, Mr. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, seemed to hint that Mr. Bush would welcome a more active Soviet diplomatic role.
In his interview with CNN, Mr. Sununu said that ''because of past relationships, the Soviet Union may have some capacity to influence Saddam Hussein, and maybe the President will be encouraging them to at least discuss the situation with them.''
A Western diplomat in Moscow said, ''I'm sure that when they compare notes, the two Presidents will agree there can be a useful division of diplomatic labor here.''
In their discussion of the Soviet economy, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to outline his plans for phasing out central state controls on the economy and to seek some commitment that as the Soviet Union moves toward free markets the United States will step in with aid and investment.
White House officials said the United States was eager to bolster Mr. Gorbachev's domestic position, especially given his cooperation during the gulf crisis. But American investors have increasingly shied away from the Soviet Union because of the uncertainty over the Kremlin's control of its economy and disputes over major issues like the ownership of natural resources.
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher is scheduled to arrive in Moscow next week with a group of high-powered corporate executives to investigate the prospects for increased American investment.
But Mr. Sununu noted today that ''there is still some uncertainty on the part of U.S. investors, U.S. businesses.''
''For example,'' he said, ''they don't know whether they should sign a contract with the central Government, or the republic or the municipality, or some new entity.
''For the Soviet Union's own sake in being able to attract that investment, they really ought to clear the ambiguity so that private investors in the United States and around the world can feel comfortable about the kind of relationships that have been established.''

HEADLINE: Larger Costs of the Crisis

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:

 
Some Less-Obvious Costs
The indirect costs to Americans are harder to pin down because they depend in large part on the way businesses, consumers and the Federal Reserve respond to the surge in oil prices. But by almost every reckoning these costs will far exceed the extra spending on energy and military firepower.
Edward Gramlich, an economist at the University of Michigan, points out that the initial effect of higher oil prices is much like that of a tax increase. An extra $10 a barrel adds about $5 billion a month to oil bills. And because consumers have less to spend, demand falls for everything from houses to hamburgers. As sales decline, businesses cut back investments in new equipment and reduce their inventories, spreading the decline through the economy.
But even as the demand contracts, the prices of goods and services are likely to rise. Higher costs for energy and for ubiquitous petroleum-based chemicals are passed through to consumers. And the inflationary impact is magnified as workers try to offset their reduced spending power by pressing for higher wages. Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, estimates that if oil settles at $25 a barrel, pushed down by additional production from Saudi Arabia and other countries to offset the loss of output from Iraq and Kuwait, the general price level would rise within a year by about an extra 1 percent. 
 
Choices Are Few
How might Washington respond? Changes in taxes and spending, once the fastest-working and most accurate weapons in the Government's policy arsenal, have been rendered inoperative by chronic budget deficits. While budget negotiators may yet manage to fashion a deficit-reduction package, no one is suggesting that the Government will again be in a position to use fiscal policy to deal with inflation and recession. That leaves the Federal Reserve, the agency that controls the supply of money and credit.
Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard, notes that before the gulf crisis the Federal Reserve presided over an economy experiencing wobbly annual growth of 1 percent, but ominously strong inflation of 5 percent. Rather than risk adding to inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve had been holding firm to the credit tiller.
The tax-like oil shock has almost certainly further weakened demand and induced businesses to postpone investments. Fred Bergsten, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, says, ''It's hard to find anybody outside the Government who doesn't think we're already in a recession.'' But at the same time, the inflation rate is almost certainly up: Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley estimates that the Consumer Price Index will rise by 6.6 percent for 1990.
''That puts the Fed in a box,'' Mr. Friedman says. If the Federal Reserve loosens credit to offset the contractionary effect of higher oil prices, it risks embedding the new, higher inflation rate in the expectations of businesses and workers. And once the new inflation has taken hold, the Harvard economist warns, it would be extremely costly to root out.
Extrapolating from the experience of the 1970's, he estimates that Americans would have to sacrifice 6 percent of their income for one year - more than $300 billion - to rid the economy of a one percentage point increase in the ''core'' inflation rate. On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve does not ease credit to accommodate higher oil prices, it risks a longer, deeper recession.
 
Differences in Timing
Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, points out, moreover, that the problem of offsetting the oil shock is further complicated by lags in the impact of monetary changes. Higher oil prices hit business and consumers overnight. But monetary policy works by changing the costs of borrowing money, and the effects take at least six months to ricochet through the economy.
Richard Cooper, an economist at Harvard, says the Federal Reserve's least risky option is to buffer the oil shock, expanding credit by enough to offset the fall in demand. Mr. Gramlich of the University of Michigan agrees, contending that the prospects of avoiding a rise in core inflation are now much better than in the 1970's. Both businesses and workers, he says, are savvy enough to treat the impact of an oil price increase as a one-time event rather than a self-fulfilling prophecy of inflation to come.
But relatively few economists share their confidence. ''I get nervous with more than 5 percent inflation,'' concedes Robert Z. Lawrence at the Brookings Institution. And in any case, it is hard to find an analyst who predicts that the Federal Reserve will go out on an expansionary limb by fully accommodating the oil shock.
Robert Hall, a fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, guesses that the Federal Reserve will compromise. Judging from its past behavior, he thinks the central bank will aim at influencing the growth rate of G.N.P. in dollar terms, rather than focusing on the growth of output or the rate of inflation. Thus, if the oil shock increases the overall price level by 1 percent, Mr. Hall expects the Federal Reserve will not try to offset a 1 percent fall in output.
 
Figuring the Damage
A 1 percent cut for one year would mean that about $55 billion in output would be lost. If the Federal Reeserve were to take a hard line on prices, attempting to smash any change in the expected rate of inflation in the first few months of the crisis, the damage could be much greater. Robert Gordon points out that in the early 1980's the Federal Reserve was willing to accept a cumulative $1.3 trillion loss in output as the price of reducing the inflation rate by six percentage points.
If Iraq fails in its bid to dominate the Persian Gulf and oil producers restore exports to their previous levels, oil prices will presumably slip back to the pre-crisis level of about $21 a barrel. If prices remain high, however, the Congressional Budget Office believes the economy will suffer chronic losses from lagging productivity. And while their estimates, derived from computer simulations, are just educated guesses, they do suggest that the long-term impact could be staggering.
 
Effect on Productivity
A permanent increase in the price of oil would induce businesses to choose production methods that use more capital and labor, and less energy. It would also reduce the profitability of investments outside the oil industry, slowing purchases of new plants and equipment. Thus if the oil price were to remain $10 a barrel higher than before the invasion, the budget office estimates that the United States would experience a once-and-for-all drop in productivity of 2 percent.
The resulting 2 percent loss of gross national product would run to about $120 billion a year by the mid-90's, when the drag on productivity would be fully absorbed. A calculation of the cumulative damage is not possible without making assumptions about the rate of growth of the economy and the ''discount rate'' used to equate the value of current income with income in the future. But Warwick McKibbin, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a creator of the computer simulation model used by the budget office, points out that even a very conservative set of assumptions would lead to estimates of more than $2 trillion.

HEADLINE: As One Grocery Boycott Ends, One Drags On

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Mayor Dinkins said at the rally that his office was continuing to work toward a settlement in Flatbush, but added that details of that boycott, and of the negotiations, were ''too complicated'' to discuss. ''We're confident we will achieve a resolution,'' he said.
 
Accused of Stealing Cherries
The Brownsville boycott arose from an incident on Aug. 4 in which two sisters, Doretha and April Whitt, charged that the owners of the store had accused them of stealing cherries and insulted their mother, Dorothy. The owners at the time, Heejin Lee, and his wife, Inga, told the police that when Mrs. Lee confronted the two women about eating cherries from the bin, they pushed her down to the ground. 
Blacks and Korean-Americans in New York City's poorer neighborhoods have shared a testy relationship for some time. Some blacks resent the relative economic success of Korean-Americans and feel they do not have the same opportunities.
The main reason the boycott ended so quickly in the Brownsville section was that the store changed ownership, and officials were able to convince the protesters that the new owners, Brian Ju, was unrelated to the Lees. Yesterday, Doretha Whitt joined the Mayor on the speaker's platform, hugging him and thanking him.
Mr. Ju, a bit overwhelmed by the swarm of television cameras and supporters at his bountiful market, at the corner of Watkins Street, said he would earn the respect of the community simply by selling ''best quality produce at the best prices.'' He also has agreed with city officials to hire black and Hispanic workers.
 
Resident 'Glad It's Over'
Residents seemed relieved that the boycott had ended. Marjerie Pittman, a 40-year-old receptionist for the New York State Health Department, said the boycott had hurt the already deflated reputation of Brownsville, a poor neighborhood often in the news because of drug use and crime there.
''We do not need this,'' Mrs. Pittman said. ''Why should we keep on bickering and nagging when it's over? These people have a business, and I'm going to shop in their store because it's the closest one to my home. The majority of the community is glad it's over.''
The swift resolution of the Brownsville boycott represented a victory for Mayor Dinkins, who took office last fall at a time of pitched racial and ethnic tension. Despite his frequent and impassioned calls for conciliation and respect, those tensions have not abated. In recent weeks, the Mayor has come under fire for not taking a tougher stand against violent crime.
 
Dinkins Approach Disputed
Yesterday, the Mayor said that the two families, the Whitts and the Jus, and the two communities ''demonstrated that we can work together, that we can share it together, and most importantly that we can build communities - together. ''
Earlier in the day, however, the owner of Family Red Apple store in Flatbush, Bong Jaejang, called the Mayor's scheduled appearance in Brownsville ''phony'' and said Mr. Dinkins had only ''paid lip service'' to his own situation. ''He's done nothing for us,'' he said. ''He has said the boycott is wrong, but he hasn't come to the store to buy food.'' Mr. Jaejang said his electric bills were being paid by private supporters.
Michael Kharsen, the director of the Mayor's community assistance unit, said that the Mayor's aides had been to the Flatbush store but that the Mayor himself believed a personal visit would not be fruitful during the negotiations. Mr. Dinkins has said he does not believe the Flatbush boycott is primarily a racial one.

HEADLINE: Academy of Engineers Says U.S. Should Welcome Foreign Investors

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The report comes at a time of uncertainty about what the Bush Administration will do to help American companies compete. Officials have said they want to avoid having the Government set industrial policy, through measures like incentives to encourage production of certain products. But President Bush recently suggested that he would offer Federal support for work on ''generic technologies'' that industries may use in their own way. The report calls for much stronger Federal action. 
 
Expert Testimony
The panel, which studied the issue over the last year and a half, comprises 14 prominent academic and industrial officials, who took testimony and written comments from more than 150 industrial and academic experts.
Dr. Thomas H. Lee of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who headed the panel, said that if a company moved design and manufacturing plants to the United States, the money it would contribute to the economy would be more than 10 times the amount taken to its home country in profits.
''Is ownership the most important thing, or is the corporation's activities in our country the more important criterion?'' he asked. ''We believe the most important thing to do is create an environment that is attractive for people to come in and do research, and do development, and do production. Instead of looking at protection measures to protect our corporations' interests, a better way to address the problem is to ask ourselves: How can we make this country an attractive place for all countries to work?''
 
Benefits for Suppliers
For example, he said, if an electronics company carries on research and engineering here, the employees will be American and will ''carry the ideas in their heads'' as they participate in the advances. In addition, many suppliers will be American.
Dr. Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of Engineering, which is affiliated with the National Academy of Sciences, said two arguments against keeping the country open to foreign companies are that companies will take their profits home and that American politics may be affected through political contributions by foreign owners. But the report said these considerations are outweighed by the need to participate in the growth of transnational industries.
The report also recommends that the Government help reduce barriers to the spread of technology and invest significant amounts of money for research in generic technologies like semiconductors. ''Current Federal science and technology policies are targeted primarily on basic research and 'mission-oriented' technology related to national defense,'' it said.
John Howard, director of international finance at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber agreed that the country should remain open to foreign investment. But the chamber has not formed its policy on what the Government should do to strengthen American companies. ''We are grappling with that right now,'' he said.

Compromise, and Seats, At Budget Negotiations

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md., Sept. 8

 BODY:
Under the hard-won compromise, the tables are now arranged in a long rectangle, with top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders at one end, Administration officials at the other.
 
 A Varied Cuisine
 The talks are being held in a large, carpeted room that normally serves as the officers club bar and doubles as the site for special buffets featuring ethnic cuisine. The budget negotiators missed Thursday's Taco Party, but if negotiations drag on, they may have a chance to enjoy next week's Mongolian Bar B'Q.
Elaborate security arrangements have been made to keep reporters and lobbyists away from the talks, although much of the secrecy appears to have been designed to make sure that Republicans and Democrats do not get wind of each other's bargaining positions before proposals are laid on the table. 
The officers club and its adjacent buildings have been transformed into a sort of mini-Capitol, guarded by Capitol police officers and complete with Democratic and Republican cloakrooms, staff caucus areas, computers, facsimile machines and telephone banks. The ever-efficient Air Force staff has supplied each caucus room with care packages of Alka-Seltzer, Tums, Tylenol and Halls cough drops.
Congressional and Administration aides here to advise their bosses have been issued special credentials (embossed with the United States seal and bearing identification numbers) that are required for entering the restricted area. While the initial plan had called for color-coded identification tags - yellow for Democrats, green for Republicans and red for the Administration - organizers decided at the last moment that neutral peach-colored tags for all staff members would better foster a sense of harmony.
 
A Budget Slumber Party
 Some lawmakers brought their pajamas and toothbrushes in anticipation of what had promised to be round-the-clock negotiating sessions. But most have declined the no-frills sleeping accommodations provided at the Andrews ''distinguished visitors quarters'' and chosen instead to return home each night.
As the lawmakers arrived this morning, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, was overheard discussing the merits of the budget slumber party approach with Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee.
''Why don't you stay?'' Mr. Rostenkowski suggested. ''If I got to know you better, maybe I'd get to like you.''
 
Top Democrats Absent
 Democrats have their own worries about the wisdom of making deals with Mr. Darman that may not pass muster at the White House. Although the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, are attending the sessions, the two top Democratic leaders in Congress are not.
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, have decided they will be present only when President Bush attends. Aides see this as a tactical advantage, intended to insure that the Democratic leadership has the same opportunity as the President to exercise veto power over any compromise the negotiators may produce.
Mr. Bush, who is meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Helsinki, is expected to drop in on the budget negotiators when his plane lands at Andrews late Sunday night.
 
Bargaining Moves Slowly
 Bargaining on the deficit package is moving slowly, each side now having rejected the first two offers presented by the other. But there was said to be some decision on how to divide spending cuts between military and domestic programs. They have been invited to the White House at 10 A.M. on Monday and this may provide the deadline they need to reach a final agreement.
Democrats would achieve their $50 billion in deficit cuts for 1991 largely through higher taxes, including a new 2 percent energy tax, and reductions in military spending. Republicans, also aiming for $50 billion, would limit the Federal deduction for state and local income taxes, but would cut the capital gains tax rate and make deep reductions in spending for benefits programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Federal retirement.
Both parties are recommending higher taxes on alcoholic beverages, with beer and wine bearing the biggest burden since Federal taxes on those beverages have not been raised since 1951. Republicans have been especially scornful of a Democratic proposal to find $2.5 billion in new revenue by improving collection of debts owed the Federal Government.
Such estimates are among the legendary devices that Republicans and Democrats employ each year to reach deficit-reduction goals. Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who serves on the Senate Budget Committee, suggested to his colleagues this morning that the only way to insure that the Government really got the $2.5 billion would be to hire unemployed K.G.B. agents to do the collecting.
The talks broke up this evening at about 10 P.M. when a fire alarm interrupted a sharp argument and forced the negotiators to evacuate the officers club.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Neutral States of Europe Start Shedding Their Postwar Shell

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland

 BODY:
Asked if he could foresee any circumstances that might lead Finland to abandon its military neutrality and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Mr. Suominen shook his head, laughed and said, ''We certainly wouldn't want to be an adversary if the Soviet Union joined NATO.''
 
Edging Toward Involvement
The neutral states in the new, post-cold war Europe are edging cautiously toward greater involvement in collective security arrangements that they have shunned for decades.
Officials from all of them say they have been encouraged by the recent revival of the Western European Union, a political and military council established after World War II as the basis of a European Defense Community that never came to pass because of objections from France. It was the Western European Union, not NATO, that the allies used as the European forum to approve military enforcement of the United Nations sanctions against Iraq early last month. 
A declaration made in Helsinki this week by conservative European political parties, including some from neutral countries, reflected some of the changing thinking about military involvements. All parties, including the neutral states, said they supported the military actions taken by the United States in the Persian Gulf and urged countries that had not yet done so either to send forces there or to ''give financial support for their operation or assistance to those states suffering as a result of the sanctions.''
 
'Far More Room to Move'
The Social Democratic-led Government in Stockholm under Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson has been under pressure from the conservative opposition to take a more active role in the Persian Gulf crisis, Swedish politicians and journalists say. Asked here if he wanted the Government to send more weapons, the Swedish conservative leader Carl Bildt, chairman of the Moderate Coalition Party, said, 'We have no forces to send - no oceangoing ships - and our aircraft don't use the same kind of fuel as American, Saudi or British planes.''
So far, the new neutrality is long on words and short on deeds, a fact criticized by Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in a speech here Thursday. She seemed to fear that the attitude could become general, even in countries that belong to NATO, unless she brought them up short.
Who infects whom remains to be seen, but the greatest change seems to be taking place among the neutrals.
Mr. Suominen said in an interview, ''If there is more cooperation than confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, we have far more room to move than we did when confrontation was at its height.''
 
Expanding Trade Markets
Economic and political change in the Soviet Union is also having an effect on trade and business patterns in neutral Finland, which before 1985 conducted 20 to 25 percent of its foreign trade with Moscow, Mr. Suominen said.
Now, it conducts 65 percent of its trade with the European Community and other free-market European countries. In the first half of this year, only about 10 percent was with the Soviet Union.
Finnish imports from its Communist neighbors - $4 billion last year -could rise sharply in the rest of 1990 because Finland obtains almost all its oil from the Soviet Union. But because it pays for imports under barter arrangements, Finnish exports to Moscow will rise, too.
Mr. Suominen, Finland's Trade Minister, said that would probably change soon. ''We will be going into normal hard-currency trade with the Soviets, and that may reduce the volume of trade further,'' he said.
Teuvo Tikkanen of the industry-supported Finnfacts Institute said that with the country's unemployment now down to about 3.5 percent, inflation was expected to rise to 6 percent this year as the economy overheated. ''I think that in the changing Europe, we can't be the last ones to join the E.C.,'' he said.
The Community, based in Brussels, has said that it would not consider applications until after the completion of its 340 million-member single European market by the end of 1992.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
In Europe, Faint Support Seen for a Military Strike

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Mrs. Thatcher has given vigorous support to President Bush during the crisis and has sent a 2,000-strong force of British ships and planes and ground support personnel to Saudi Arabia and neighboring Gulf states. Now she may send up to 4,000 more, according to British officials, possibly including two British armored infantry brigades with tanks and artillery. ''We'll send whatever the people in Washington tell us they'd most like to have,'' one of her advisers said Friday.
The next step, according to British officials, might be to tighten the embargo by extending it to the airways, to keep Iraq's allies in the crisis - particularly Libya - from running the blockade with aircraft. It is unclear, however, whether the United Nations or public opinion here would tolerate shooting down Libyan or Yemeni cargo planes to keep them from bringing military supplies or food into Iraq. 
 
Force Remains an Option
Few here, inside or outside the government, foresee large-scale offensive military operations against Iraq by the United States or the forces allied with it before the end of this year, unless President Hussein provokes them. The expectation that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will reaffirm Soviet support for the embargo in his talks with President Bush in Helsinki on Sunday strengthens British hopes that the embargo will lead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis after all.
But Mrs. Thatcher, like Mr. Bush, is keeping the option of force open, and her aides say the government would not hesitate to use it if it became necessary.
''There could be a severe retaliatory strike if Saddam went for the Saudi oil fields, or moved forces into Jordan, or sent a gunboat out to confront the blockade, or started shooting hostages,'' said David Bolton, a former Royal Air Force officer with extensive service in the Middle East who is now director of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies. ''Otherwise I see no possibility of severe military action this year,'' he said.
A two-day emergency debate in the House of Commons produced a 437-to-35 majority Friday, reflecting a broad consensus of all major parties in support of Mrs. Thatcher's steps in the crisis so far.
Military offensive options - whether a full scale frontal assault on Iraqi forces in and around Kuwait or something more limited, like commando raids in support of Kuwaiti resistance forces inside the annexed country -would be costly and produce human suffering and horror on a scale few in Europe have much stomach for, either in Britain or France.
 
Defensive Posture
''The success of the embargo will produce a settlement of this matter without a war,'' President Francois Mitterrand said in Paris on Friday.
What to do if it fails is a question that has not yet been fully faced, according to British officials. ''The whole posture of the military forces in the gulf is still a defensive one,'' one aide to Mrs. Thatcher said. ''We're a long way from seriously considering a large-scale military operation.''
When they do think about it, many politicians in Europe fear the United States could drag them unwillingly into a war by launching a solo attack against President Hussein's forces in Kuwait or Iraq from aircraft carriers and amphibious attack ships in the gulf. The French Minister of Defense, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, said earlier this week that a war would leave 100,000 dead on both sides.
British officials say the most likely scenario until the full complement of American equipment arrives in and around Saudi Arabia in mid-October is a progressive tightening of the embargo, giving Iraqis not terrorized by President Hussein time to think about whether they would be better off without him.
''I believe an air blockade will be the next step,'' Mr. Bolton said. ''Nations in the area will be strengthened in their right to refuse overflight rights to aircraft running the blockade into Iraq, and then the possibility of international agreement on forcing down or shooting down violators can be considered.''
 
Effects of Human Suffering
But if the blockade is so effective that Iraqi and Kuwaiti civilians or foreign hostages begin to suffer starvation, even some normally hawkish people here wonder how long public support for the embargo would continue.
''I think the United States has handled this extremely well,'' said Dr. John Gilbert, a Labor Party Member of Parliament who has served in high Ministry of Defense posts. But in the House of Commons on Friday he said, ''I am not sure public opinion is going to endorse a situation in which we in the West were trying to starve innocent people.''
Others wonder how long a huge, fully equipped, highly trained military force can remain idle. Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute on International Relations, said: ''I don't see a continuation of the embargo without some resort to military force. The result would be a Pyrrhic victory for us, which means we would win, but at what cost?''
An undertone in the House of Commons debate was the idea that the danger of conflict will lead the Americans and everybody else to see the necessity of negotiations with President Hussein, though Mrs. Thatcher rejected any suggestion of compromise on the fundamental issues of Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and restoration of the government there.
 
Two Islands and an Oil Field
''The West really cannot afford to let Saddam Hussein go smiling home with two islands and an oil field in his pocket,'' the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Friday, referring to suggested inducements to get him to withdraw short of war.
But whether the world can tolerate President Hussein in power in Baghdad, in control of chemical weapons he has already used and potentially in possession of nuclear weapons as well, is not a question that is eagerly tackled in Europe.
In the best scenario, if Iraq goes home and President Hussein disappears from the political scene, many wonder whether even that would mean American and British forces would simply go home.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Hussein's Summit Message: Gulf Crisis Is an Arab Issue

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Instead, he demanded that the Persian Gulf crisis be settled along lines he put forward on Aug. 12.
In essence, that proposal would have allowed Iraq to retain Kuwait and its oil fields while the crisis was left to the Arab nations to resolve, and it would also have tied the withdrawal of Iraqi troop from Kuwait to Israel's withdrawal from occupied Arab lands.
''Both of you will not be able to produce the right answer to an Arab issue,'' Mr. Hussein said.
But the message appeared to have been crafted as much with the intention of goading Mr. Gorbachev into rejecting the American hope for a still tougher Soviet stand against Iraq. 
The 53-year-old Mr. Hussein, whose Government signed a friendship treaty with the Kremlin in the 1970's and whose army fights mainly with Soviet weapons, said the Helsinki meeting would demonstrate to the world whether Moscow was finished as a superpower, or was prepared now to make a show of strength and stop playing second fiddle to the United States.
 
Raising Doubts About Moscow
''He who represents the Soviet Union should remember that doubts about the place of the Soviet Union as a superpower have gotten into the mind of every politician in the world for some time now, especially as the U.S. began to assume to be the sole power in the world and when it became arrogant with no one in sight to show it a more balanced course.''
Mr. Hussein added, ''Those concerned should choose this crucial time, through this decisive issue, to restore to the Soviet Union its role by adopting a stand that is in harmony with justice and fairness.'' He defined this as meaning that Moscow should break with the United States and other Western powers, and with the United Nations Security Council, in their demands for an immediate and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
As for President Bush, Mr. Hussein, who has previously called Mr. Bush ''a liar'' and compared him to Hitler, adopted a somewhat softer line and said that the American leader should abandon his effort to force Iraq from Kuwait for the sake of his own prestige and that of the United States.
While offering no hint that he was prepared to bow before the pressures mounting against him, Mr. Hussein acknowledged in the message that the outcome of the Helsinki meeting could be portentous - for Iraq and the world. The close attention that Baghdad is giving the summit meeting was underscored by the newscast precceding Mr. Hussein's message, which included interviews with Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait. Several of the soldiers denounced the idea of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev joining to impose a settlement in the gulf crisis.
After opening the message with the standard Muslim greeting to the two leaders, ''peace be upon you,'' Mr. Hussein said that they were ''in a position to decide whatever relates to the future of good or evil for humanity.''
He also spoke of the responsibility of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev ''to save our region the evil of war, and the ensuing evils,'' and appealed to God to infuse ''the light of faith into your hard hearts so that they will see the paths of righteousness.''
In this, and in many other passages of the message, the Iraqi leader presented himself as a faithful believer and, in his confrontation with the West, as the champion of the world's Muslims. The posture contrasts with Baghdad's harsh suppression of Muslim leaders earlier during Mr. Hussein's 12-year tenure as the ruler of Iraq.
The message also included hints of the shrewd, mocking figure who rose from a motorcycle-borne gunman in the streets of Baghdad to become one of the most powerful and feared leaders in the modern Arab history.
At one point, he referred to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev as ''masters of the White House and the Kremlin,'' a blunt, even crude break with normal diplomatic usage for communications between heads of state.
 
'Backward and Corrupt Rulers'
The message also spoke of ''the backward and corrupt rulers'' of oil-producing Kuwait and accused them of having ''conspired'' against Iraq, apparently by refusing economic and territorial demands from Baghdad in the period before the invasion.
But as much as anything, the message appeared to be a fresh effort by Mr. Hussein to foment trouble for the majority of Arab leaders who have aligned themselves with the United States and other nations in condemning Iraq. Again, he accused the United States of defiling Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia by sending troops.
He spoke of those who would ''try to trespass in God's house and in the prophet Mohammed's tomb,'' declaring, ''Whatever cover those trespassers may come under, whatever their justifications are, God will not forgive them.''
Before the message was broadcast, Baghdad television announced a new decree by Mr. Hussein intended to increase Iraq's food production in the face of the United Nations economic sanctions.

HEADLINE: SOUND;
New Audio Equipment In Time for Autumn Nights

BYLINE: By Hans Fantel

 BODY:
To what extent DAT will supplant the immensely popular analog audio cassettes, currently in universal use, won't, of course, be known for years. Immediate prospects for the new medium seem limited by its initial cost and the short supply of equipment.
Even so, this fall's introduction of DAT marks a turning point in home audio. By bringing digital technology to home recording, DAT is bound to delight serious audiophiles, who can now match the sonic quality of CD's with their own homemade tapes. 
The first DAT recorder specifically designed for amateur use to arrive in the United States is Sony's DTC-700, tagged at $900. This price, like the cost of top-rank cassette recorders of the ordinary type, confines its appeal to affluent audiophiles, eager to be the first on the block with the very latest thing. However, as other companies enter the field, prices may drop under competitive pressure, perhaps even before the year's end. As is often the case with new sound equipment, delivery delays may be encountered, and a plentiful supply of DAT recorders may not be available for a few months.
Apropos of dropping prices, the current slump in the economy has prompted the audio industry to pay more attention to budget models. This fall, in an effort to offer good value in low-priced equipment, the industry is putting emphasis on what is known as compact systems.
These are prepackaged, single-brand stereo rigs - usually small enough to fit on a shelf or sideboard - that include everything: a CD player, a tape deck, radio tuner, amplifier and speakers. Nothing further needs be added. Just plug it in and play.
Nobody pretends that these prepackaged mini-components sound like full-size systems. But the best of them come surprisingly close to the performance of their larger counterparts and are well suited for rooms of modest size.
A fine example is Denon's new Cellena System, Model G-05. It combines a CD player, a dual cassette deck (for convenient copying), an AM/FM tuner, a frequency equalizer, two compact speakers with special bass reinforcement devices, and an amplifier rated at 28 watts per channel with no more than 0.005 percent distortion. The Cellena takes up less than 2 cubic feet of space and costs $800.
Similar in concept and general configuration is Yamaha's new Unity System (Model YST-C10), selling for $799. It features a patented circuit that bolsters the bass projection of its bantam speakers.
By far the most elaborate and versatile among the prepackaged mini-systems being introduced is Optonica's CD-U10, priced at $1,300. In addition to all the usual facilities (CD player, radio tuner, tape deck, amplifier and speakers) this system has a built-in ambience synthesizer that can create the impression of large acoustic spaces even in small rooms.
With a single touch, the listener can choose among seven different simulated acoustical environments. Depending on the type of music to be played, these settings can suggest a large hall, a medium-sized hall, an intimate stage, such as might be encountered in a small theater or nightclub, a cathedral, or a front-row seat in a small auditorium.
Trend watchers in audio have noticed that among this fall's new entries the proportion of separate tuners and amplifiers is on the rise. The shift is slight and does not seriously challenge the predominance of receivers, which are a combination of both tuner and amplifier. Such receivers are still the preferred choice in budget systems, mainly because it is cheaper to combine a tuner and an amplifier in a single unit.
Yet for all its economy, the receiver has certain drawbacks. The more powerful it is, the bulkier it becomes. Moreover, at higher power levels, stray electric or magnetic fields from the amplifier may interfere with the function of the tuner. That is why in high-performance systems it is advisable to have tuner and amplifier in separate components.
Now that digital disks place greater demands on the amplifier than was the norm in the LP era, these considerations, relating to higher power levels in amplifiers, are coming to the fore and may explain the gradual trend toward separate amplifiers and tuners.
Among the latest entries of this kind, Proton's 400 system is a clear standout. These distinctively styled components offer advanced technology formerly available only in more expensive models. For example, Proton's proprietary way of supplying reserve power for loudness peaks in the music - such as a sudden fortissimo - permits the AM-455 ($250) amplifier to exceed its nominal 50-watt rating and deliver up to 72 watts per channel.
The matching AT-470 AM/FM tuner ($220) features patented circuitry designed by the renowned radio engineer Larry Schotz. This permits the tuner to perform equally well in rural fringe locations remote from the FM station and in urban environments where signals bouncing off tall buildings often prevent clear reception.
Other interesting newcomers in this group include Onkyo's Integra A-8500, rated at 80 watts and priced at $420. Its matching T-4700 tuner ($450) automatically analyzes the incoming signal. Depending on the strength of a particular station, this tuner then automatically adjusts several internal variables to optimize reception.
Harman-Kardon's exclusive Active Tracking Circuitry will be available this fall in a new digital tuner, the Model TU-9600, priced at $449. This particular circuit helps a listener separate stations that interfere with each other on the FM dial. In the past, this could be done only by compromising a tuner's sensitivity and its sound quality. The Active Tracking Circuitry overcomes these problems.
A whole passel of new loudspeakers are sounding off this fall, but hardly any of them embody basic innovations. A possible exception is MB Quart's new design with its patented new air vent for the woofer enclosure, which helps to keep the motion of the woofer cone under tight control. In this way, speakers achieve uncommon clarity and accuracy of timbre in the lower range. Among the first models of this type to arrive this fall will be MB Quart's 490 MCS, priced at $799 a pair.
It is hard to imagine customers lining up for loudspeakers costing $3,500 a pair. But KEF's new Model 105/3, making its debut this season, is being eagerly awaited. This is because this speaker is the not-so-little brother of KEF's renowned Model 107, which is even more expensive ($4,800 a pair) but has been widely hailed as one of the best speakers ever made. There is a close family resemblance between the two, which makes the new Model 105/3 seem something of a bargain to prosperous perfectionists.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
Canada's Dance Packs Its Cultural Luggage

BYLINE: By WILLIAM LITTLER; William Littler is dance and music critic of The Toronto Star.

 BODY:
Dance Theater Workshop will also be playing host, beginning Friday, to the phenomenon of ''talking dance'' through ''Affamee,'' by Jo Lechay and Eugene Lion, and in the new year, return visits to New York are in the works for Edouard Lock's La La La Human Steps and the Desrosiers Dance Theater. What has long been called the Unguarded Border is becoming, for Canadian dance, the welcome opportunity.
The opportunity comes at a moment when some doubt attaches to the very future of Canada as a nation. Recent political events, surrounding attempts to respond to the demand of the Province of Quebec for recognition as a ''distinct society,'' have exacerbated regional tensions.
But is it accidental that at the very time these tensions are heightened, Canadian dance appears to be moving into a brigher spotlight? Not, perhaps, if Northrop Frye's description of the regionality of culture is correct and we stop thinking of Canadian dance in national terms. 
In a speech some years ago, Stuart Keate, then publisher of The Vancouver Sun, described Canada as ''the vichyssoise of nations - cold, half-French and difficult to stir.'' It is that, but it is also a nation paradoxically united by its sense of separateness. Canadians have, and like to have, space between them. As sparse inhabitants of the third largest country on earth, they cluster in a few population centers, divided in some cases by distances greater than those associated with the dimensions of other countries.
While this condition has weakened their sense of togetherness, it has strengthened their sense of rootedness to the place in which they live, and no more so than in the Province of Quebec and its cultural metropolis, Montreal. The title the Brooklyn Academy of Music has given its Canadian program is more than geographically correct, it bespeaks spiritual self-sufficiency. When Eduoard Lock was once asked why he, a native Moroccan with artistic debts to American post-modernism and German Expressionism, thought of himself as a representative of the extraordinary kinetic vitality of 1980's and 90's Montreal, he responded simply that he lives and works there. ''There'' matters critically, as a filter through which all imported ideas somehow change in passing.
One of his colleagues, Paul-Andre Fortier, goes even further in attributing the special excitement current in Montreal dance to the limited availability of imported ideas, especially ideas from the English-speaking nation to the south, during the formative years of many of the choreographers now associated with the excitement. With a language barrier to cross, the New York studios of Martha Graham or Merce Cunningham represented elusive destinations for some of these choreographers. And with a limited exposure to techniques from elsewhere, developing their own became the natural thing to do.
Besides, as Mr. Fortier points out, some of the most important of these movers and shakers to be came to dance as adults, too late in their physical development to master some of the established techniques. He himself came from literature (''I finished my literary studies before I did my first plie''), Mr. Lock came from film and Ginette Laurin of O Vertigo Danse from gymnastics. And virtually all of them came spiritually from Quebec.
''Our identity as Quebeckers is a subtext,'' says Mr. Fortier. ''It is the same in film, in theater, in all the arts. The necessity of expressing ourselves as a French group of people gave us wings to create. It is something you can't escape from.'' Not everyone subscribes to the hermetic theory of Quebec creativity. Iro Tembeck, a historian who teaches at the University of Quebec at Montreal and is the author of a forthcoming book on Quebec dance, points to the close contacts that influential teachers of the present generation had with Paris and New York. But even Miss Tembeck acknowledges the current preference for work that is driven by original ideas rather than established techniques; Quebec's choreographers have become shoppers in the supermarket of movement options.
Which is not to say that their work is easy to perform. Indeed, much of it cultivates physical risk. As Dena Davida, artistic director of the Montreal dance space Tangente: Danse Actuelle, puts it: ''These are dangerous times, and the physical risk-taking becomes an emblem in the work of someone like Edouard Lock.''
Miss Davida, in common with other observers of the local scene, sees Mr. Lock and his choreographic contemporaries as essentially apolitical despite their tapping the Zeitgeist. Their inspiration tends to be personal and emotional, ''electrified emotion'' as she describes it.
The emotion is nonetheless fueled by the Zeitgeist in Quebec, which Miss Tembeck believes is an inheritance of a 1948 protest manifesto and the rule-breaking spirit it proclaimed among artists opposed to a society dominated by the Catholic Church.
While Quebec society has become much more open in the intervening years, the rule-breaking spirit, the contempt for tradition and the desire to shock have remained characteristic features of its leading dance artists.
How different this attitude is, save in the work of a Robert Desrosiers, from those shared by leading dance artists in much of the rest of Canada. But then, Mr. Desrosiers, a transplanted Quebecker based in Toronto, represents something of a special case: His imagery confronts viewers with the shock of eccentricity, the product of a bizarre personal imagination rather than a reaction to a societal condition.
Toronto itself has yielded to Montreal the distinction of being ''where the action is.'' As Canada's largest, richest city, it continues to play host to a greater number of performers, but the creative edge cuts deeper in Montreal.
Is it that Toronto's commercial-mindedness has inclined artists there to play safer? Or is it that such Toronto-based choreographers as David Earle (of the Graham-inspired Toronto Dance Theater) and Danny Grossman (formerly of the Paul Taylor Dance Company) address themselves to more traditionally humanistic issues, to content, rather than to the pursuit of stylistic innovation characteristic of Montrealers?
Whatever the case, Toronto, like Montreal, is a center of dance activity rather than the center. There is no counterpart in Canada to New York and the benign tyranny it has imposed on American dance. The energies that activate the movement arts in Montreal differ considerably from those operating in Toronto, which are different again from those in Winnipeg or Vancouver.
When Karen Jamieson of Vancouver turned up at this summer's Canada Dance Festival in Ottawa with a work commissioned to celebrate the National Gallery's landmark exhibition of the paintings and sketches of the British Columbia artist Emily Carr, she did so with a piece of choreography that took possession of the building and entered into dialogue with it, speaking a language of mystery, softness and contemplation, imaginatively as well as geographically thousands of miles distant from the high-impact dance coming out of Montreal.
Traveling so far east represented a relatively rare experience for Ms. Jamieson. The high cost of moving between Canada's major urban centers has only reinforced their particularity. Economics and geography have thus conspired to deprive Canadians of real ownership of their dance heritage. Most of what they see is locally produced.
Northrop Frye might not call this a bad thing. Roots that are local have a chance to grow deep. But this situation does lead to a certain amount of reinventing of the wheel. When critics pointed out a debt to Alwin Nikolais in the design-conscious work of Anna Wyman of Vancouver, for example, she had to point out that at the time she had choreographed the work in question she had yet to see anything by Mr. Nikolais.
Relative isolation is becoming less of a factor in Canadian dance, even in Quebec, with its proudly permanent language barrier. But if geographical distances are shrinking, psychological distance remains. For this reason, as much as for reasons of the country's increasing political Balkanization, the notion of a national dance identity - or a national cultural identity, for that matter - has to be dismissed as so much wishful waving of the Maple Leaf.
This development may come as bad news to cultural institutions such as the Canada Council, which helps support about 30 of the country's 50 or so professional dance companies and tends to view the country as a whole. To the artists themselves, it is a simple fact of life that each, in his or her own way, is a separatist.
''Separatism is not something you can put words to,'' says Paul-Andre Fortier. ''It is not something you think of before doing a work. It is there in the air we breathe.''
Mr. Fortier has recently been breathing the air of Mexico, and, to his surprise, he found people in his audiences understanding some aspects of his work at a deeper level than at home. Audiences, he concludes, are where you find them: ''I'm jumping off a building and either the audience catches you or they don't.''
Canadian choreographers are jumping off many buildings these days. They just aren't waving a flag about it.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Why Mozart Has Become an Icon for Today

BYLINE: By RICHARD TARUSKIN; Richard Taruskin is a professor of music at the University of California at Berkeley.

 BODY:
Mozart is so familiar that some performers have been going out of their way to defamiliarize him, whether by updating him or by embalming him in ''historical'' timbres. Those supremely provocative opera productions of Peter Sellars try to have it both ways. The works are updated on the stage, embalmed in the pit - a perfect paradigm of post-modernism, perhaps, and yet another unmasking of the pseudohistoricism of ''Early Music.''
But that sort of approach will probably not be much in evidence in the orgy of veneration at Lincoln Center. Sentimental adoration has been the order of the day for Mozart since time immemorial. Dissenting voices have now and then been raised. ''There are ways to hate Mozart,'' John Cage amiably announced one day (though, disappointingly, he failed to list them). Frederick Delius grumbled, ''If a man tells me he likes Mozart, I know in advance he's a bad musician.'' But such talk is probably just talk, revealing a greater distaste for the cult than for its object. 
For Mozart is our foundation stone, our icon and our pedigree. Celebrating him means celebrating ourselves. In him we see our species transcendent, effortlessly bringing forth what Bernard Shaw called ''the only music yet written that would not sound out of place in the mouth of God.'' From there to actual deification is just a step. ''I love Mozart as the musical Christ,'' wrote Tchaikovsky. ''I do not think this comparison is blasphemous. Mozart was as pure as an angel, and his music is full of divine beauty . . . the culminating point of all beauty in the sphere of music.''
The sheer harmonious perfection of Mozart has given us our notion of musical Eden, sometimes called the ''Classical'' period, an 18th-century fairyland invented by the tortured and hard-working artists of the 19th century, who looked upon Mozart's mythically prodigal powers of spontaneous invention (a myth that has been somewhat debunked by recent scholarship) with a reverence bordering on terror. They invented ''Salieri'' to punish the careless god-child for shaming them but aspired, withal, to his exalted station. The dying Mahler's last word, according to his widow - uttered when he was past hearing surrounding voices, and possibly enjoying the heavenly reception many accounts of borderline death-experience relate - was ''Mozart!''
Until recently, when interest in Mozart suddenly exploded as a result of commercial theatrical and cinematic exploitation, a taste for Mozart was a connoisseur's taste - ''a mark of caste,'' to quote Shaw again. For many, Mozart was and is problematic. Within his lifetime, Mozart's music was thought brash, overspiced and too complicated for the average listener. (''Too many notes, my dear Mozart,'' said the Emperor.) In the 19th century, a cult of Mozart sprang up among the literary - not, for the most part, among musicians - that emphasized his violence, his sensuality and his power to subvert.
 
Deeper Meanings:
Disintegration And Malaise?
In his celebrated book ''The Classical Style,'' Charles Rosen has revived this strain of Romantic Mozart worship, insisting eloquently that Mozart's music ''cannot be fully appreciated . . . without re-creating in our own minds the conditions in which it could still seem dangerous.'' Some readers may also recall Virgil Thomson's once famous piece ''Mozart's Leftism,'' in which Mozart's true liberalism (understated, between-the-lines, to be discerned by the discerning) was contrasted with the overtly proclaimed populism of Beethoven, ''an old fraud who just talked about human rights and dignity but who was really an irascible, intolerant, and scheming careerist.''
More recently, radical critics like Rose Rosengard Subotnik and Susan McClary have suggested that some of Mozart's later music carries the seeds of disintegration - stylistic, psychological, even social. This shocking message can be found, they argue, not just in the operas that inspired Romantic thinkers like E. T. A. Hoffmann or Soren Kierkegaard with their idea of Mozart's ''demon,'' but in instrumental works as well. And what shocked Mozart's more sensitive contemporaries may shock us, too, if we're still sensitive.
In the last three symphonies, Ms. Subotnik discerns (for the first time in music) evidence of a ''critical world view,'' meaning a sense of reality that is no longer fully supported by social norms, but must be personally constructed and defended. The high level of unsettling chromaticism in these works (traditionally symbolic of the irrational), their tendency to unify movements by means of shared forms or melodic motives (deliberately shoring up coherence in a way that implies a threat to it) and the calculated disruptions in the musical continuity, she argues, add up to an unprecedented portrayal of a mind under stress. Mozart, for her, is the first composer who suffers as we do from the malaise of modernity.
Ms. McClary, concentrating on the concertos, finds evidence of social alienation in the relationship between the soloist and the accompanying group. In a close technical reading of the slow movement of the G-major Piano Concerto (K. 453), she finds the orchestra to be no simple accompanist but an antagonist that dominates and ultimately crushes the individual (soloist), whose personal needs are ''blatantly sacrificed to the overpowering requirements of social convention.'' She finds a special bitterness in the movement's ''harmonious closure,'' for the harmony masks repression.
To continue to uphold Mozart as the embodiment of ''pure order,'' Ms. McClary concludes, is really to uphold ''an icon of the old cultural order for purposes of warding off - or at least institutionally marginalizing - the increasingly successful encroachments of new, previously disenfranchised producers (ethnic minorities, members of the working class, women) and forms of culture.'' Ms. McClary invites us to identify with Mozart as their representative.
There can be no denying the relevance of such a view to the sorry life Mozart ended up leading in the real world. (The life he was privileged to lead in his creative imagination is of course a closed book to us, though we sometimes like to pretend his manuscripts and sketches give us access to it.) Ms. McClary's characterization of her pianist-protagonist - self-dramatizing, exhibitionistic, maladjusted - chimes with, and may well be influenced by, the unvarnished (or devarnished) Mozart portrait that has emerged of late from revisionist biographies like that of Wolfgang Hildesheimer, now a dozen years old. (Since Hildesheimer, demystification has progressed apace; medical historians now confidently pronounce the idyllic god-child to have been an obsessional, anal-fixated, paranoiac personality - in a word, infantile, meaning anything but childlike.) It is always a question how far we are justified in reading an artist's work in terms of his life; and Ms. McClary's work carries the further burden, insofar as the musical and academic establishments are concerned, of an explicit political agenda. Still, her voice, and Ms. Subotnik's, have been heard.
Neal Zaslaw, adviser and scholar-in-residence to Lincoln Center's bicentennial festivities, and nobody's idea of a scholarly maverick, ends his just-published, grandly conceived and executed survey, ''Mozart's Symphonies: Context, Performance Practice, Reception'' (Oxford University Press), with a searching consideration along similar lines of the ''Jupiter'' Symphony finale, concluding that it ''perhaps gives us a glimpse of Mozart's dreaming of escaping his oppressive past and giving utterance to his fondest hopes and highest aspirations of the future'' - by which we are to understand everyone's past and everyone's future. There seems to be an increasing awareness - though it is definitely a minority awareness - that at its highest and best, Mozart's music embodies not only beautiful sounds but profound and sometimes terrible meanings.
 
Music for Use: Contexts Lost And Changed
 So maybe it was not just out of laziness or incomprehension that audiences used to have a very selective relationship with Mozart's vast output. Maybe they had a notion of what was highest and best in it, and what kind of messages they wished to derive from it. Three operas, a half-dozen symphonies, a few concertos and a handful of chamber and keyboard works - with greatly disproportionate emphasis on the works in minor keys, of which Mozart actually wrote very few: these used to constitute the active Mozart repertory, with the rest relegated to secondary categories of ''historical interest,'' if not oblivion.
As early as 1799, a reviewer, after acknowledging Mozart's supreme genius, remarked of a quartet of early Mozart symphonies, just published for the first time, ''it does not follow that everything of the sort that Mozart wrote is worth preserving, nor does it follow that after his death people should without exception collect and publish everything he wrote, especially in his younger years.''
Wrong, says Mr. Zaslaw, who in his recent book is quick to turn around (inconsistently, it could seem, in light of his remarks on the ''Jupiter'' finale) and warn that such strictures are founded on a fundamental error. The reviewer, he alleges, was guilty of ''confusing the general change in symphonic style between c. 1774 and 1799 with Mozart's personal development as a composer.'' It's not Mozart's fault, in other words, if his earlier works seem superficial to listeners who know his later ones - and it's not fair of us to entertain a preference.
Moreover, Mr. Zaslaw argues, modern notions of what art is all about are anachronistic to most of Mozart's work, and irrelevant to its evaluation. The ''fundamental thesis'' of his book is that ''Mozart's symphonies, far from being 'art for art's sake,' were Gebrauchsmusik - music for use, functional music - which, when divorced from its original setting, loses some of its meaning.'' His mission, carried out with gusto and erudition, has been to restore a sense of the original context to Mozart's work, thereby to recover the lost meaning - and thereby, too, willy-nilly to inhibit contemporary judgment.
Laudable as it is from the standpoint of ''disinterested'' scholarship, the enterprise is open to question as criticism. It rests on the implicit assumption, still regnant in the musical academy, that the meaning of an artwork is complete at the time of creation, and that the passage of time entails nothing but loss of meaning. Tradition, in this view, is only noise and distortion, a cosmic game of ''telephone.''
Another view is possible. Contexts, it may be argued, are not simply lost but changed. The venues and social milieus in which Mozart symphonies are now ''used'' - the concert hall, the stereo-equipped home or automobile - are inescapably different from those the works inhabited when new (theaters, churches, aristocratic soirees). Change of context adds as much meaning as it may take away.
This applies to apprehension as well as to consumption. For us today, ''Don Giovanni,'' say, is not just the opera Mozart and da Ponte knew, bearing only the meanings it had for them and for the audience that greeted it in Prague two centuries ago. ''Don Giovanni'' is also something E. T. A. Hoffmann has known and construed, and Kierkegaard, and Charles Rosen, and Peter Sellars. Its meaning for us is mediated by all that has been thought and said about it since opening night, and is therefore incomparably richer than it was in 1787. Reconstruction of the original meaning, assuming it could be recaptured pure, should add its valuable mite to the pile, but cannot replace it. For that, were it possible, would be an impoverishment.
Such a position, alas, is not fashionable in our age of Authenticity. Judge Bork, rejected by the United States Senate, seems to have found a haven in the musical-intellectual community. Approach things for what they are (that is, were), we are enjoined, and judge them not. Enjoy. Uncritical acceptance of the past (coupled - it could scarcely be by coincidence - with an ultracritical reception of the present) is now the rule.
We tend to despise those who have been picky in the face of Mozart's cornucopia. It is with no little self-congratulation that some critics have celebrated the indiscriminateness of what is now considered enlightened taste, and in particular the abandonment of any ethical dimension to artistic judgment. (See what happens now if you voice any principled objection to the cruel and cynical ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'') Yet respect it or not, the Romantics, who - mindlessly, we are told - valued in Mozart only their own reflection, definitely had a criterion. Do we? Intransigence, which (when coupled with passion) is what lends all authority to criticism, is on the wane. The recent revised edition of Joseph Kerman's classically crusty ''Opera as Drama'' now makes room for Mozart's ''Idomeneo.'' Not that there is anything wrong with ''Idomeneo'' (that is, with its inspired music), but including it considerably softens the book's curmudgeonly old thesis (advanced pointedly against a ''flabby relativism'' that holds everything to be ''all right on its own terms'') that opera lost its dramatic way after Purcell and did not recover it till Mozart met up with da Ponte. Now we read, ''most of us would rather have notes by Mozart than drama by any one else,'' and ''what gives 'Idomeneo' a certain haunting power as drama,'' despite its problems, ''is its basic subject matter.''
So, flabby or firm, relativism is on the rise, and musicology, always a great omnivore, has been its accomplice.
 
The 80's Ideal: Attention K. Mart Shoppers
 But there is something else, too, behind our plan to put the Kochel catalogue on parade, something 80's-ish and ugly. The demystification of Mozart, which began in earnest, and in honest if somewhat reckless fashion with Mr. Hildesheimer's biography, turned dishonest and trivializing and vastly remystifying with ''Amadoose'' (which is how you must pronounce it at the video store). The careless god-child of Romantic legend has become the braying ass of ours, glorified in the popular imagination as a boorish bumpkin who was ''good at what he does,'' a cynical Gladstone Gander, gifted and successful far beyond his moral deserts - and to be loved for it. That, it gives pain to acknowledge, is our current Mozartean self-reflection. Our musical Christ has turned yuppie. Accordingly, it is as the object - the symbol, even - of conspicuous musical consumption that he has at last become popular in the decade now ending. There is something dismally authentic about this, to be sure. The ideal (if that is the word) of conspicuous consumption was what motivated 18th-century aristocratic patronage of the arts. Some economic historians, for whom it symbolizes decadence, call it ''quantitative luxury,'' and it is to be thanked or blamed for all the reams of faceless ''Gebrauchsmusik'' that have come down to us from Mozart's time.
Mozart consumption today, far more than at any time past including his own, is undeniably a matter of quantitative luxury, and his masterworks have indeed begun to recede into the faceless mass (or haven't you tuned in lately to FM?). More records of Mozart are now issued and bought than of any other composer, as a glance at the bimonthly listings in Fanfare magazine will quickly confirm. Philips Records, like Lincoln Center, has announced a complete Mozart for sale. Record clubs now offer him as their primary (if still relatively infinitesimal) ''classical'' inducement. As little as 10 years ago, it was not so.
This last bit of intelligence comes from an editorial in the latest issue of 19th-Century Music, the toniest of all academic music journals. The editors go on to ruminate that Mozart is ''the 1980's' not-so-secret code word - as in 'Mostly Mozart' - for user-friendly classical music, their paradigm of Old-Age-New-Age music if not their very metonymy for nonthreatening sound tout court.'' Take that, Mr. Rosen, Ms. Subotnik.
But it's hard to disagree with the diagnosis. And in that light, it's hard not to see in Lincoln Center's bicentennial gourmandizing a musical Trump Tower, less a Mozart-fest than a K. Mart (as in Kochel, the numbers man). Somehow it doesn't seem much of a celebration anymore.
 
The Prognosis: Greater Fluency, Less Commitment?
 On the brighter side, there have lately been some solid strides in Mozartean performance practice. Admirable research continues, the latest notable contributions being those of Mr. Zaslaw on matters of orchestral execution, William Malloch on minuets (play them faster!), Jean-Pierre Marty on tempos (standardize them!), Hugh Macdonald on repeats (observe them!), Will Crutchfield on appoggiaturas (add them!), David Grayson on instrumental embellishment (go to town!).
Predictably, ''historical'' performers have been quickest to adopt the recommendations that entail the least creativity (Mr. Crutchfield and Mr. Grayson in particular have been getting a lot of backtalk), though the pianist Robert Levin's astonishing yeoman work in the concertos (yes, he improvises his cadenzas) will no doubt inspire rivalry ere long, much to everyone's benefit.
On the more ordinary level of scrupulous text-rendition, Mozart performance on period instruments becomes more mellifluent and convincing year by year. The viability of the fortepiano is no longer at issue, thanks to the work of Malcolm Bilson, Melvyn Tan, Steven Lubin, Penelope Crawford and others. Mr. Lubin's chamber group, the Mozartean Players, is setting a high standard in the very difficult medium of keyboard plus strings.
And then there are the period orchestras, permanently established by now in Boston, New York, Washington, San Francisco, Ann Arbor, Toronto and other North American cities (if we may parochially ignore England and the European continent for the moment). Because of all this specialist activity, everyone, it seems, is playing Mozart with a new fluency these days, whatever the make or model of their instruments.
But (to end this jeremiad with a proper caveat) if we no longer care what we play, does it matter how we play it? Is the coolness that is so essential a part of our enlightened ''historical'' performance style a true reflection of history, or is it, like the wholesale consumption of the Kochel catalogue, a mark of lessened commitment?
Laurence Dreyfus, a Bach scholar and viola da gambist who is at the forefront of historical performance today, is troubled by the latter possibility. Why, he asked aloud at the recent Berkeley Festival and Exhibition ''Music in History,'' must one ''continue to turn to the remastered recordings from 60 years ago in order to experience the passionate rapture that accompanies a musician engaged wholly with the artwork?'' What is missing, he contends, ''is the insight that the giants of our pantheon are great to the extent that they learn to represent the depths of melancholy, and melancholy, as Kant recognized, was a kind of secret key to the sublime.''
This comes very close to the Subotnik-McClary position on what made Mozart Kant's greatest musical contemporary. It's not something we are likely to recapture by turning him back into a purveyor of ''functional music.''

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Can Invaders Be Stopped but Civil Liberties Upheld?

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
For example, is a company vulnerable to legal action, or the seizure of its computer equipment and data, if a single employee is accused of using a home computer to capture or store unauthorized data? Do private messages sent on an electronic mail system have the same protection as messages sent through the Postal Service? Is the concept of property valid in a world where data can be copied and replicated without limits and without disturbing the original data?
To stimulate discussion of such questions, a group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been formed by several prominent computer industry figures, including Mitchell D. Kapor, the founder of the Lotus Development Corporation and On Technology Inc., and Stephen Wozniak, a founder of Apple Computer Inc. It plans to lobby for laws that clarify computer and telecommunications issues and to help pay the legal costs of some computer users caught up in the crackdown.
Mr. Wozniak, Mr. Kapor and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who preferred to remain anonymous also recently gave a $275,000 grant to another organization, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif. Gary Chapman, the group's executive director, said the money would be used to expand its public advocacy efforts on behalf of civil liberties in the world of computing. 
One of first places the Electronic Frontier Foundation decided to help out was the case of Steve Jackson Games of Austin, Tex., a company that designs and publishes role-playing games. It is not a computer or software company; its games are published in book form and are played by rolling dice.
On March 1, Secret Service agents armed with a search warrant raided the company's offices and confiscated three computer systems, two laser printers, miscellaneous hardware and papers. They took the data in the computers, including backup disks.
Steve Jackson, the founder of the company, said the agents refused to say why they were there, what they were looking for or when the seized equipment and data might be returned. No charges have been filed in the case, and no official explanations have been offered. William J. Cook, an assistant United States attorney who coordinated the search, said in response to a journalist's question last month, ''There is no indication that Steve Jackson Games is a target of the operation,'' but he and the Secret Service declined to say what officials were searching for.
Yet, for months, Steve Jackson Games could not ship new products and had to lay off 8 of its 17 employees, Mr. Jackson said. The company, which had annual revenues of about $1.4 million, nearly failed, he said. Most of the hardware has been returned, Mr. Jackson said, although some of it was damaged beyond repair. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has hired a lawyer for him to seek the return of the rest of the equipment and documents, as well as an explanation for the seizure.
Hours before the raid on the company, Secret Service agents visited the home office of Loyd Blankenship, a 25-year-old writer who works for Steve Jackson Games, and confiscated computer hardware, software and data. Mr. Blankenship has not been charged with a crime, but his equipment and data have not been returned. Mr. Blankenship did not respond to a request for an interview for this article.
Mr. Jackson said Mr. Blankenship had been using his computer as a word processor to write a role-playing game called ''Gurps Cyberpunk.'' In the game, players can adopt hundreds of identities, including those of hackers. As part of the manual for players, Mr. Blankenship gave a brief but realistic description of computer networks and security systems. ''Adventurers may want to break into a computer system,'' Mr. Blankenship wrote, ''usually to steal, alter or destroy information, although they will occasionally just want to have a look around (or to prove they can do it in the first place).''
Mr. Jackson acknowledged that he knew Mr. Blankenship was a skilled computer user who had been in touch with a group of hackers called ''the Legion of Doom.'' Other members of the legion have been targets of Secret Service raids coordinated under the name ''Operation Sun Devil.'' Federal officials said the raid on Steve Jackson Games was not part of Operation Sun Devil.
''Any employer who heard this tale will think hard before he hires a computer cracker,'' said John Perry Barlow, another principal in the Electronic Frontier Foundation, ''which may be, of course, among the effects the Secret Service desires.''
Operation Sun Devil, conducted by Federal agents in more than a dozen cities, has resulted in the seizures of at least 40 computers and immeasurable amounts of data. Some suspects said their doors were broken down with sledgehammers, their wives and children held at gunpoint. Officials involved in the operations have declined to comment on such accusations other than to say the investigations are continuing.
Operation Sun Devil is ''seriously misdirected,'' said Mr. Chapman of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. ''Most computer crime is carried out by insiders within large companies. White-collar crime accounts for most of the economic loss, not teen-agers with personal computers. And yet society has developed such an intense fear of new technologies beyond its understanding that it is willing to suspend the rights of any computer user who might be caught up in a wholesale sweep.''
Mr. Cook also brought an indictment against Craig Neidorf, a 20-year-old college student who published an electronic newsletter. It included a document, from a contributor, that had been stolen from a Bellsouth Corporation computer. It described the 911 emergency phone system in Bellsouth's region. Bellsouth said the eight-page document was valued at $79,449. Mr. Neidorf, who said he did not know it was stolen, was charged with wire fraud and transporting stolen documents over state lines.
The charges were subsequently dismissed when it was pointed out that Bellsouth included the same document in a booklet that was sold to the public for $13.

 BODY:
''Golden West is one of the best financial firms in the country, period,'' said Peter Treadway, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
There has not been much good news from the savings and loan industry for the past five years. Hundreds of institutions have collapsed and hundreds more are in danger of failure, victims of regional economic downturns, poor management and outright fraud. The cost to taxpayers will reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Industry executives are widely viewed as incompetent or criminal, and all too often the stereotype is true.
But a significant portion of the industry has always remained profitable and honest. The Sandlers, for example, are conservative, methodical, penny-pinching and risk-averse in the extreme - and they have spent nearly three decades shaping Golden West, now the nation's sixth-largest savings and loan, in their image. The antithesis of the high-rollers attracted to the industry by deregulation, they remain downright boring - and proudly so. 
 
An Appetite for Calm
 ''Perhaps we can best characterize Golden West's attitude toward lending by simply saying that your management likes to sleep undisturbed by worries and nightmares,'' the Sandlers wrote in a letter to shareholders in their most recent annual report.
The Sandlers use all the techniques of modern financial management, paying especially close attention to cost control. But the core of their business is decidedly - some might say refreshingly - old-fashioned: The company lends out Federally insured deposits almost exclusively in the form of home mortgage loans, forgoing potentially more lucrative but far riskier loans and direct investments in shopping centers, office buildings and other commercial real estate. Of the 27,436 loans it made last year, 93 percent went to single-family homes and virtually all of the rest to multi-unit residential housing.
It does this through a network that seems almost anachronistic in this age of one-stop financial shopping. It has 205 branches in California and five other states and operates 65 loan offices in 16 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
For the most part, the branches accept only savings deposits, eschewing the business of offering checking and other ''transaction'' accounts that might attract more customers but are far more expensive to maintain. To keep costs low, the company does not even have automated teller machines, almost certainly making it the largest financial institution in the nation not to offer that service. Most of its customers are old-fashioned savers, who patiently deposit their funds in return for competitive interest rates. ''They've identified their customer and the services the customer wants, and they don't provide anything else,'' Mr. Treadway said. ''They have tremendous control of expenses.'' As archaic as the strategy might seem, it has worked. Golden West's earnings have been consistently strong at a time when the industry as a whole has been running up huge losses. The company's shares are worth 10 times what they were at the beginning of the 1980's. It has almost no bad loans.
Even as most other institutions scramble to raise more capital to meet the Government's tougher new standards for financial strength, Golden West is in the enviable position of having far more capital than regulations require. Unlike most savings and loans, Golden West has also been able to raise new capital in the financial markets in recent months, completing two subordinated debt offerings totaling $215 million.
As a result, it is one of the few institutions with the capability of expanding, either by acquisition or internal growth. In May, for example, the company acquired from the Government the $725 million in deposits held by a failed savings institution in Colorado, already its second-largest market after California. And just last week, the company completed the acquisition of Community Federal Savings and Loan in Ramsey, N.J. Community Federal, with six branches and assets of $460 million, gives Golden West its first deposit-taking offices in the Northeast.
 
The Partnership
 The Sandlers have been running Golden West together since acquiring it for $4.1 million in 1963, when it had $34 million in assets. They took it public in 1968, and today, assets have grown to $20 billion.
Mr. Sandler, 58 years old, is a former New York lawyer who serves as chairman and co-chief executive and, in his three-piece suit, looks very much the old-fashioned banker. Mrs. Sandler, 59, learned about the industry as a securities analyst on Wall Street. She holds the titles of co-chief executive and president. The two finish each others' sentences, prompt each other to tell favorite stories and appear to have long since worked out whatever problems might have cropped up in the marriage of their personal and business lives.
''You know that old saying about it being lonely at the top?'' asked Mr. Sandler. ''Well, it's not here.''
Moreover, they are clearly enjoying the vindication of their cautious approach after having been roundly criticized by Wall Street for not being aggressive enough and disparaged by competitors for running something of a dinosaur. ''Over 20 years, running the institution in our fashion, through all the turmoil that's taken place, our compound annual rate of growth and earnings is 20 percent,'' said Mr. Sandler, ticking off the kind of statistic that has turned Golden West into a current favorite among stock analysts. ''To my knowledge, no bank or thrift has done that.''
Yet the Sandlers still face questions about whether their approach can continue to work in an age of full-service banking. Most of Golden West's major competitors - including its two biggest rivals, H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles and the Great Western Financial Company of Beverly Hills - are positioning themselves to compete directly with commercial banks.
Believing that the distinctions between banks and savings and loans will continue to disappear in coming years, both Ahmanson and Great Western are pushing to get more transaction accounts from customers. Great Western offers consumer loans and other services that were once the exclusive province of banks.
''Golden West is very strong for what it attempts to do, but that's not the only route to success as the banking and thrift worlds come together,'' said Bert Ely, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''The thing I worry about is that while their strategy certainly works today, it may not work five years from now.''
 
Looking at Change
 The Sandlers say they have nothing against change. After Congress and the state legislatures deregulated the industry during the early 1980's, ''We researched discount brokerage,'' said Mr. Sandler. ''We just couldn't figure out how to make money in it. Everyone else got into it, and a few years later they were all getting out.''
Now, Mr. Sandler said, the company is studying the possibility of offering traditional checking and other transaction accounts. ''We're going to analyze it, and if there's a role for it, we'll go ahead with it,'' he said.
Still, the Sandlers freely admit that they see no advantage to plunging into new businesses just to be trendy or to match the competition.
Golden West's most clearly visible advantage is its low operating costs. The company's general and administrative expenses last year - the cost of running the company - were $181.8 million, or 0.97 percent of total assets, down from 1.14 percent the year before. That compares to 1.57 percent of assets on average last year for the 10 other largest savings and loan companies in California.
If the company's expense ratio had been the same as that of its competitors, its earnings last year would have been $86.5 million, or $1.37 a share, instead of its actual profits of $157.9 million, or $2.51 a share. In this year's second quarter, Golden West earned $49 million, or 78 cents a share, a 22 percent increase over the same period in 1989.
The greater profit margin gives the company more flexibility in deciding how many new loans to make - and therefore it may say no to riskier loans that other institutions might consider as they try to generate higher earnings.
''Because we're such a profitable company, we can operate well with a lower volume,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''We don't have a high-fixed-overhead loan machine that we have to feed continually.''
The company's cost advantage comes from many things, large and small. It does not have the expense of installing and maintaining automated teller machines nor the costs involved in traditional checking accounts, which require expensive check-processing equipment, data bases and manpower. Cost-consciousness is so ingrained that branch managers charge executives visiting from headquarters for the phone calls they make from the branch.
The company also studies the work load in its branches and has an hour-by-hour and day-by-day model for each staffing requirement. Of the 1,050 employees who work in its branches, more than 500 are on permanent part-time status, keeping payroll costs low. The company has something of a reputation for stinginess and has never invested much in the appearance of its branches.
 
A Modest Look
''Their branches are - I wouldn't call them low rent, because that would be unfair,'' said Eric I. Hemel, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation. ''They're streamlined. They're smaller and more Spartan. They're a visual metaphor for the entire company.'' Just as important to Golden West's success as cost-cutting is the high quality of its loan portfolio, a result, to some extent, of its almost total concentration on home mortgage lending. Borrowers, after all, are less likely to default on their mortgages than on any other type of loan.
And even within the field of mortgage lending, Golden West stands out. Last year, an impressive 93 percent of its residential loans were made with downpayments of 20 percent or more, considerably higher than the industry average. The result has been to keep the number of bad loans to a minuscule five-tenths of 1 percent of total loans last year.
 
Just Say No
 How do they do this? The Sandlers point to a deeply ingrained corporate culture, which holds that there is no shame for a loan officer to say no. Indeed, when in two periods in the last decade economic conditions or intense competition suggested that they would have to lower credit standards to attract borrowers, they instead virtually swore off making new loans, even at the cost of not growing for a year or two.
''We were damned by Wall Street,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''When you have zero loan growth for two years, you really feel the heat.''
But by retaining earnings at a time when it was not growing in asset size, Golden West improved its underlying financial strength.
The strategy paid off when Congress, in legislation passed last year to bail out and reform the industry, substantially increased capital requirements.
Today, as one of the few institutions whose capital levels greatly exceed all three of the Government's new minimum tests for financial strength, Golden West has options closed to most institutions. Chief among them is the ability to grow.
Many analysts think the company's next big move will be in Florida, where it holds an option to acquire Beach Federal Savings, a failed institution in Boynton Beach owned by the Government.
But whatever Golden West does - and however it chooses to adapt to growing competition from banks and to the always changing regulatory climate - as long as the Sandlers stay in charge, it is certain to remain conservative, even dull. ''We have a jewel of a company,'' Mrs. Sandler said, ''and we're not about to do anything to jeopardize it.''
 
THE SANDLERS, SIDE BY SIDE
OAKLAND, Calif.
It is not always easy for Herb and Marion Sandler to be husband and wife as well as co-chief executives. They will occasionally be at a dinner party or business gathering when the men and women drift into separate groups. ''The wives gather here and the gentlemen gather there, and I want to be over there where Herb is talking about business,'' Mrs. Sandler said. ''It can be a little awkward.''
But aside from that type of situation, the Sandlers say they have almost no problems working alongside each other. ''If we came at things differently all the time, it would be impossible, but that's true for any executives working closely together, not just husbands and wives,'' Mrs. Sandler said. After graduating from City College of New York and Columbia University Law School, Mr. Sandler became a lawyer and represented a number of savings institutions. Mrs. Sandler, after graduating from Harvard and New York University's business school, worked as a securities analyst, following the stocks of savings and loan companies. After their marriage, in 1961, they talked constantly about how they were unimpressed by the quality of the management running most savings institutions. Finally, deciding to see if they could do better, they moved to the West Coast from New York to scout small savings institutions that might be takeover candidates. In 1963, they made a deal for Golden West.
Today, they work in adjacent offices and are in and out of meetings together all day. And although it's clear that they run the company, they stress repeatedly how much they rely on the two other members of their office of the chairman - James T. Judd, 51 years old, and Russell W. Kettell, 46, both senior executive vice presidents. ''This isn't the Herb and Marion show,'' Mr. Sandler said. Although they are not planning on retiring any time soon, the Sandlers have a succession plan in place, in case of the unexpected. Mr. Judd and Mr. Kettell are at the top of the list. ''We call it the Mack Truck question,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''We all have backups ready to go in case something happens. The idea of somebody being indispensable is anathema to corporate governance.''
 
THE SEATTLE STAR
When listing the nation's best-managed savings institutions, analysts usually mention a handful of other large California-based companies in addition to Golden West, including the Great Western Financial Corporation of Beverly Hills and H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles.
But there are also small, little-known institutions like the Washington Federal Savings and Loan Association of Seattle - ''arguably the stellar performer - pound for pound, inch for inch - of the nation's savings institution industry,'' according to Eric I. Hemel, an analyst at the First Boston Corporation.
Washington Federal has $2.6 billion in assets and 65 branches in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. It is perhaps the strongest company in the industry as measured by its capital reserves.
Unlike most other institutions, Washington Federal continues to make mostly fixed-rate instead of adjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-rate mortgages can be riskier than adjustables for savings institutions because they become less profitable if interest rates rise.
Elliot Knutson, Washington Federal's chairman, said he has never been worried. ''We've been profitable every month for 30 years,'' he said. ''If you keep your costs low enough and your people are good enough and your capitalization is strong enough, you can keep the risks low.''

HEADLINE: Trading Safety for Better Car Mileage

 BODY:
He didn't even mention the adverse effects of such standards on automobile safety. The fact is, tougher Federal fuel economy standards mean trading lives for oil. 
Given present technology, auto manufacturers would have to make smaller cars to meet tougher fuel standards. Why? Because most other approaches to saving energy - front-wheel drive, using lighter materials - have been taken; so downsizing is one of the few options left. The problem is that smaller cars mean more occupant deaths and injuries. For every 10,000 registered cars one to three years old in 1989, 3.0 deaths occurred in the smallest cars on the road compared with 1.3 in the largest.
This is not to say we should ignore America's dangerous dependence on foreign oil. It's not to say we don't need fuel economy standards, either. But instead of enacting laws that encourage smaller cars, why not think about auto safety and oil conservation together and work toward safety-compatible fuel economy alternatives? For example, why not limit cars' top speeds? Because of engine improvements, newer cars achieve much more power per unit of engine displacement. But this advancement isn't being used entirely for improving fuel economy. A large part is being used for improving acceleration and, in some cases, for increasing top speeds. Current technology does allow for electronic speed controls without any adverse effect on acceleration at slower speeds.

HEADLINE: Austria's Clandestine Workers

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER

DATELINE: VIENNA

 BODY:
The street-corner black market for workers here is another sign of the economic upheaval in Eastern Europe and its spillover effects on the region's Western neighbors. Tens of thousands of East Europeans have streamed into Austria recently to work illegally, according to police statistics, Government officials and economists. Most are temporary employees, who work in Austria for a few months for the comparatively high wages and then return home, much as illegal Mexican workers in the United States do. At home, even low-paying jobs are dwindling as Eastern nations making the rocky transition to market-driven systems experience higher unemployment and more business failures.
In Austria, the so-called clandestine workers from Eastern Europe have been both welcomed and shunned. For companies in industries like construction and tourism, the illegal workers have been a low-cost source of badly needed labor. 
Yet the growing number of Eastern Europeans who work and live in Austria illegally is a source of mounting political concern and social conflict in a small nation that borders the East and whose unemployment rate, though low at 5.2 percent, is rising. Estimates of the number of clandestine workers in Austria are necessarily imprecise, ranging from 40,000 to 140,000. But in a country with a population of seven-and-a-half million and a labor force of only three million, the strain is starting to show. Spurred by reports of rising crime and worries about foreigners taking jobs from Austrians, the Socialist-led Government imposed last week a visa requirement for Poles, who it says make up the majority of new illegal workers. At the same time it decided to send soldiers to patrol part of the border with Hungary, across which as many as 200 Eastern Europeans - mostly Romanians - have been crossing illegally each day.
The strict measures brought cries of outrage from some in Austria who said the country was trying to reconstruct the Iron Curtain. But what worries officials and politicians, who face elections next month, are recent statistics. While the number of people employed in August was 2.3 percent higher than in August 1989, unemployment has nevertheless increased slightly, to 5.2 percent, considered high in Austria. This may be a sign that employers are passing over native workers for the cheaper foreign labor, said Jan Stankowsky, an economist at the Austrian Institute for Economic Research.
Ingrid Nowotny, head of the foreign labor department at the Ministry for Social Affairs and Labor, observed, ''Compared to other countries, the problem of clandestine labor hardly existed here two years ago.''
Austria, to be sure, is not the only country absorbing a wave of Eastern Europeans eager for work in the West. Hungarians, Romanians and Poles are also pouring into Berlin in anticipation of German reunification, said Guy Standing, coordinator of labor market research at the International Labor Organization in Geneva. Officials from Norway told Mr. Standing that as many as 35,000 Poles entered their country - most illegally - this summer to work.
But tiny Austria, which has borders with Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, is an easy first stop for many East Europeans whose home economies are getting worse. Czechs, Slovaks, Yugoslavs, Hungarians and, until last week, Poles, may enter Austria without visas. Once in the country, many easily find work.
''If you're here, then you're going to get work,'' said Anna Stefaniak, a Pole who has worked illegally in a variety of positions since arriving in Austria six months ago.
They do have to put up with long hours and pay which, while many times higher than in the former socialist countries, is poor by Austrian standards. Miss Stefaniak, who comes from eastern Poland, said most people earn from $4.50 to $7.25 an hour, a fortune compared with Polish wages. With such incomes, many Poles work for a few months in Austria and then return home.
''Austria's system encourages the use of migrational workers since these sorts of workers are likely to receive low wages and no official benefits, and in Austria the benefits are a big percentage of labor costs,'' Mr. Standing said.
Some officials here said recent policies that restricted the number of work permits given to foreign workers in a time of fairly robust economic growth only made the problem of clandestine workers worse.
''So many firms were pressed into illegality because they couldn't get official permits for the employment of foreigners,'' said Martin Mayr, director of the social policy department at the federal Chamber of Commerce.
Still, according to Gudrun Biffl, a labor expert at the Austrian Institute for Economic Research, there are now signs that the increase in the number of foreign workers - both legal and illegal - is starting to have an effect on the weakest members of Austria's labor force: the elderly and single women with children.
''How can you rationalize letting in foreign workers to the extent that your own people are getting sacked?'' she asked.
Though employment of foreigners who don't have a work permit is illegal, it has been tolerated.
''For an employer to be found out and punished? The probability is probably one in a million,'' said Karl Dirschmied, head of the department for labor market affairs at the Chamber of Workers and Employees in Vienna.
In an attempt to bring some of those working illegally here into the legitimate work force, Austria passed a law this summer granting a work permit to all those foreigners who were registered in Austria before April 1. Before the new statute, foreigners could declare their presence in Austria, but still work illegally. Previously it was the employers who applied for permits to hire foreign workers, who weren't allowed to be in the country during the application process.
Yet, so far, only a few thousand people have applied for the amnesty, which lasts until Oct. 1. While the law is good for workers because it brings them under Austria's social security umbrella, there is little incentive for the employer to keep the worker since costs will be higher, especially if the supply of clandestine workers is still available, economists and officials here note. To try to prod illegal workers to join the amnesty program, the Austrian Government will authorize labor officials to enter businesses to check for illegal workers, starting in October.
How these measures and the imposition of the visa requirement for Poles will affect the clandestine labor market is uncertain. What is sure is that the number of unemployed in Eastern Europe can only increase as the socialist economies switch over to a capitalist system.

Another Landmark Is Sold
 
The Pebble Beach Golf Links - lone cypress and all - has been bought by a Japanese company. The Cosmo World Corporation of Tokyo paid an estimated $1 billion to a partnership that included Marvin Davis. So much for the Japanese Government's efforts to keep companies from snapping up American landmarks. Maybe the new owners will quit trying to scare off professional photographers who want to take pictures of the famous tree.
 
A Taste for Crude Oil
 
For the latest on whether Western nations will have to shiver through the winter with severe energy shortages, call the petroleum connoisseurs. Much of the extra oil pumped by Saudia Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries is too heavy and sour (or high in sulfur) for Western tastes, some experts say. And with Kuwait's refineries under an embargo, the United States and its allies are short on the capacity to cook this product into something their cars, jets and boilers can readily consume. ''Heavy crude produces a much lower volume of finished products,'' said Alfred O. Munk, a consultant who was manager of foreign affairs at the Amoco Corporation. Analysts said that the failure so far of diplomacy in the Middle East and prospect of rising energy demand in winter pushed oil prices up $2.72 last week to $30.04 a barrel. 
 
Mexico's Revival
 
Mexico has regained admission into the global credit markets. State-owned enterprises have floated about $1 billion in bond issues, the first in nearly a decade. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's austerity and privatization drive appear to be paying off, giving the Government enough money to pay debts old and new. More borrowing does raise the prospect that Mexico will once again fall behind on its payments, but officials promise a much more conservative, project-by-project approach.
 
The Mainframe Market Fills Up
 
The International Business Machines Corporation is finding the mainframe computer market more crowded. A day before I.B.M. announced its first new generation of mainframes in five years, Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan introduced its own new line. Fujitsu became the world's second-largest computer company last month with its acquisition of Britain's ICL P.L.C. Whose computers are faster, or the better value, depends on which company you ask. Japanese performance figures might not reflect the real speeds most users can expect, said Joseph Payne, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. He says Fujitsu's new machines, with a proprietary operating sytem, will challenge I.B.M.'s only in Japan. Mr. Payne said I.B.M. has gained the advantage of ''a stunning roll-out.''
 
COMPANIES
 
Confessions of a Best Seller
 
Did Alan Neuharth help propel his autobiography, ''Confessions of an S.O.B.,'' onto the best-seller lists by having the Gannett Foundation spend about $40,000 to buy 2,000 copies? Or is Benjamin C. Bradlee, The Washington Post's executive editor, taking revenge for some nasty comments in Mr. Neuharth's book, where he called The Post the ''Palace of Malice,'' and ''the most overrated newspaper in the country''? Mr. Neuharth, the former chief executive of the Gannett Company, is chairman of the foundation, which supports journalism education. The Post reported that a foundation executive asked editors at several Gannett newspapers to buy stacks of Mr. Neuharth's books at local bookstores, paying full retail instead of the bulk discount available to the author. Why? The best-seller lists only count retail sales. Mr. Neuharth says he had no such motive, and dismissed the story as a Bradlee vendetta.
 
ABC's Unfair Advantage
 
The Federal Trade Commission has charged Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and the College Football Association with an illegal formation. Their exclusive five-year, $300 million contract is altogether too effective in fending off competitors who might like to broadcast other college games, the F.T.C. says.
 
USX Without Steel?
 
All the USX Corporation needed to put its steel business up for sale was for Carl C. Icahn, the corporate raider, to let the company get up off the wrestling mat. Three months ago, USX was beating back a proxy proposal by Mr. Icahn to have the company spin off its steel operations. Charles A. Corry, the USX chairman, has concentrated on enhancing the USX energy business. Hard to imagine the company formerly known as United States Steel being without an I-beam to stand on? Yes, but a few years ago, the Greyhound Corporation sold off its buses.
 
It's All in Mack's Name
 
In some industries, the best-known brand doesn't count for much. Mack Trucks Inc. agreed last week to be purchased by Renault, the French auto and truck maker, for only $103 million. Mack, which lost $185 million last year, has slipped to fifth-largest among the nation's manufacturers of heavy trucks.
 
Turning Chefs Into Celebrities
 
Quick quiz: Name three French chefs. Now, name three active French politicians. If the first answer was easier, thank Yanou Collart's avid promotion of French chefs in the United States. Last week, for Craig Claiborne's 70th birthday, she arranged for more than 60 chefs and restaurateurs to celebrate in Monte Carlo.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Fear of Recession
 
Manufacturers are becoming so cautious in preparation for a recession that they might make it inevitable. August unemployment rose one-tenth of 1 percent to 5.6 percent, the highest figure in two years. Manufacturers cut 45,000 jobs, for a total of 455,000 since January 1989. Stephen S. Roach, the senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said the cutbacks, which usually follow a decline in output, come as industrial production is still expanding. ''The business community is scared to death,'' he said. ''By cutting costs with a vengeance, they may be sowing the seeds of their own demise.''
 
In Brief
 
The Manville Corporation agreed on Friday to add as much as $520 million over seven years to a fund for asbestos victims.
 
A Federal judge ordered Government regulators on Wednesday to return the $9 billion Franklin Savings Association, seized in February, to its owners. The action was temporarily delayed by a higher court.
 
About 80 percent of television and radio stations illegally charge more for political than for commercial advertising, the Federal Communications Commission reported on Friday.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Politics and the Gulf

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
On his recent campaign swing, Mr. Bush sensibly and properly refrained from openly seeking Republican votes as a reward for his military response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That, nonetheless, was the net effect of his remarks.
Similarly, the President made no mention of votes at a news conference this week, when he reported ''clear signs of progress'' in his Administration's effort to curb drug abuse. The evidence for such progress is skimpy, but the President's reminder that he was conducting a ''war on drugs'' was a political plus. 
His Helsinki conference with Mikhail Gorbachev is all but certain to reinforce his poll standing. The Soviet Union is no longer a superpower; but ever since Winston Churchill coined the phrase, meetings ''at the summit'' have provided plenty of photo ops and political pizazz for home consumption.
Not that opposing international aggression, protecting energy supplies, dealing with the drug menace and negotiating with foreign leaders are merely exercises in domestic politics. It's a fact that out-parties have to live with, however, that Presidents reap political hay from such legitimate activities.
In fact, U.S. troops in the gulf may be making the strongest bid for support for Mr. Bush and his party in the November elections. The rally-round-the-flag effect and public approval of the troop deployment probably can be maintained at least until then, with significant effect at the polls.
The Republicans may well need such help. Before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and Mr. Bush responded so strongly, 1990 was beginning to look like something of a Democratic year - for one reason, of course, because the President's party more often than not has lost support in mid-term elections.
This year, in addition, the public has shown itself greatly concerned with the threat of recession, which a growing number of economists think is real, and which residents of the Northeast know to be not just a threat. Rising oil prices could make recession a reality across the country, while at the same time boosting inflation - the worst possible political news for Mr. Bush and the Republicans.
The President already is under fire within his own party for abandoning his pledge not to raise taxes. He and the Democrats who control Congress have yet to agree on a budget package, which reflects on both parties. If they finally settle on a tax increase to reduce the Federal deficit, Mr. Bush could suffer two ways: from agreeing to an unpopular step he had pledged to oppose and because rising taxes would make recession all the more likely.
To an unsettled economy the horrendous savings and loan scandal must be added as a Republican liability. It's true that Congressional Democrats bear much responsibility, and that some of them are likely to go down in flames on the S.& L. issue. But the larger facts are that the S.& L. collapse started during the Reagan-Bush Administration, and the cleanup under the Bush Administration looks more and more like a mismanaged mess.
It doesn't help, either, that the involvement of the President's son, Neil Bush, as a director of the failed Silverado S.& L. symbolizes the scandal for many Americans. The President himself was the beneficiary of $300,000 raised for his campaign in November 1987 at a dinner organized by Michael Wise, then the chairman of Silverado.
The emotional abortion issue also seems to work against the Republicans, who are more closely identified with anti-abortion efforts than are the Democrats. Since the Supreme Court made it possible for states to restrict a woman's right to abortion, the Republican position seems to threaten that right, alienating even some who personally oppose abortion.
So it's no wonder Mr. Bush wants to talk about standing tall in the desert. Despite the risk, that's his best political bet.

HEADLINE: The Region;
What Real Estate Developers Make of New York's Future

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Because this market is such an accurate barometer of the whole regional economy, the views of these hardened veterans may be as good a crystal ball as one could expect in turbulent times.
''We've been through this before,'' said Andrew J. Singer, a mortgage broker who is president of Ackman Brothers and Singer.
After nearly a decade of unsurpassed and largely unexpected growth, the real estate market has gone into a decline. The value of apartments and houses has fallen. There is a glut of new office space. Many new luxury apartments are empty or renting at lower rates than had been projected. Some of the city's pre-eminent developers are attempting to renegotiate the debt on buildings. 
In the face of all this, developers have been tirelessly retelling the saga of Olympia & York, the Canadian real estate company that came to New York at the height of the fiscal crisis of 1970's and bought up so much property - at bargain prices - that it became the city's largest commercial landlord within a decade.
Few economists anticipated the economic resurgence of the 1980's, and few New Yorkers demonstrated Olympia & York's confidence in the city. But the story underscores for many developers the value of persevering during difficult times.
''I think the real professionals in our business are not doing as well as four or five years ago, but they are holding their own,'' said Lewis Rudin, president of Rudin Management, a large owner of commercial and residential buildings. ''It's a very competitive business and you have to be able to stay the course.''
Many developers and economists base their optimism on both the strength of the rebound from the economic crisis of the 1970's and the belief that the current malaise seems mild compared to the problems of two decades ago. Between 1969 and 1976 New York lost more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs, and the city had to obtain Federal loans to stave off bankruptcy.
Developers and economists argue that the current slump, in comparison, is fueled largely by the loss of about 25,000 jobs in one area, Wall Street. They see future prosperity in the city's high proportion of jobs in finance, information and law, industries that are considered likely to grow.
''Even though I know the shorter term is bleak, I'm certainly a believer in the city and its long-term economic health,'' said Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of Boston Properties. ''I don't think this is a fundamental change. I think this is a cycle. The basic ingredients that make this city so attractive are still here, the particular energy and talent of the people of New York.''
A substantial financial commitment backs up Mr. Zuckerman's sentiments. Boston Properties plans to redevelop the site of the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle with a cluster of towers containing offices, apartments and stores. Mr. Zuckerman has agreed to pay $337 million for the site, now owned jointly by the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Other developers are also investing in New York's future, although it is unclear whether many foreign investers are joining in. A number of significant development plans, including two huge housing complexes proposed in Queens, were approved by city officials last month.
Some real estate executives question whether the developers will be able to obtain financing for such large projects - 7,500 apartments in the Arverne section of the Rockaways and 6,000 in Long Island City - when the sale and rental of new market-rate housing is soft. But many people, including city and state officials, believe the projects will eventually be built.
City planners say that several big new projects are coming up for review soon. Included are high-rise apartments proposed by Donald J. Trump for his property along the Hudson River on Manhattan's Upper West Side and a plan for a large complex in the Melrose section of the Bronx, to be developed by the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that promotes middle-income dwellings.
Some developers contend that their industry is inherently self-correcting and that any decline in new construction will allow the market time to absorb recently completed buildings. But the corrections can be extremely painful. Even some of the most experienced developers, like the Milstein and LeFrak families, have run into trouble on individual properties.
In July the Milsteins defaulted on the mortgage of the Normandie Court, an apartment complex on East 96th Street. Federal regulators say they are keeping a close watch on the mortgage of the LeFraks' four large rental apartment buildings at the Newport complex in Jersey City.
These real-estate empires, however, are not endangered, and developers say that other new commercial and residential buildings are prospering. Many repeat an old adage: the market is never as good as it looks in an upswing, nor as bad as it feels in decline.
Mr. Rudin has been reminding people about Olympia & York's foresight in the 1970's, when, he said, ''New Yorkers could not see beyond their noses.''
He suggested that today's pessimists may be guilty of a similar myopia. ''Foreigners will come in again, you'll see, and they will see things that some of us cannot,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The World;
Increasingly Isolated, North Korea Starts Talking

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: SEOUL

 BODY:
A significant opening occurred last week when, after a year of sputtering delays, Prime Minister Yon Hyung Muk of North Korea led the highest-level delegation to South Korea since the end of World War II. The two sides failed to narrow their differences but agreed to continue efforts to reduce tensions, meeting next in North Korea. More important was the fact that a dialogue had begun. Clearly part of what compelled the North to visit the South was the changing global environment brought about by the collapse of the cold war. But there were also signs of extraordinary internal and external pressures on the ossified regime of the 78-year-old self-proclaimed Great Leader, Mr. Kim.
Decades ago, North Korea impressed many in the West as a Socialist dynamo, investing in heavy industry and making gains that outstripped its war-ravaged southern neighbor. Today the country is limping along at an official annual growth rate of 3 percent, while South Korean growth has been about 9 percent a year. While the North shunned trade as an engine for economic growth, choosing instead to be completely self reliant, South Korea surged ahead by investing in industries that could export automobiles, machinery and consumer goods to the West. There are signs that North Korea suffers from mounting debts, a huge military burden and declines in production, exports and currency exchange. 
This year, moreover, the Soviet Union, North Korea's most important ally and benefactor, served notice that it would soon demand hard currency for its oil and high technology. Former allies in Eastern Europe are no longer available as partners, and China has too many problems of its own to bail out North Korea. Pyongyang is reportedly encouraging a few joint business ventures with foreigners and copying a few of China's capitalist-style economic incentives, but there is no evidence they are having a major impact.
By most accounts, North Korean officials watched with mounting alarm and jealousy while South Korea transformed its economic miracle into political clout, holding the Olympics two years ago and forging new ties with Moscow and Beijing. Pyongyang seems to have been stunned when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev abruptly met with President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea in San Francisco last June on his way home from a chat at the White House.
As recently as last weekend, when Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze stopped off in Pyongyang on his way to Tokyo, Soviet officials have been effectively advising North Korea to clean up its act. So there is hope that heavy-handed examples of terrorism against South Korea, like the 1983 bombing in Burma that killed seven high-ranking South Korean officials, or the 1987 explosion on a South Korean airliner in which 115 people died, are a thing of the past. North Korea has even acknowledged the existence of two nuclear reactors and promised to open them eventually to international safeguards.
Another sign of change is North Korea's contacts with Tokyo and the United States. American officials have held about a dozen meetings with North Korean diplomats in Beijing. The United States has also opened its door to visiting scholars, athletes and performers. A payoff came last May, when North Korea returned the remains of five soldiers missing in action since the Korean War.
The major question mark relates to what happens after the death of Mr. Kim. Diplomats view the elder dictator's son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Il - the Dear Leader, as he is known - as corrupt, erratic and unlikely to hold power for long. More probably, many say, the army will turn against him and try to take control in conjunction with a new generation of technocrats seen as increasingly moving into positions of power.
The army and technocrats, these specialists believe, would moderate North Korea's political positions and eliminate the personality cult that has stunted the country for two generations.
North Korea remains one of the most closed societies in the world, with an eerily immaculate capital reminiscent of a movie set. But there are signs of dissatisfaction underneath the tranquil surface. Chay Pyung Gil, a political scientist at Yonsei University and author of several books about North Korea, has spent years tracking down North Korean diplomats, students, athletes, businessmen and technicians stationed abroad in Communist countries - and he has found considerable grumbling. ''Even Kim Il Sung has had to pay attention to dissident groups,'' said Mr. Chay.
But it would be naive to expect Communism to vanish overnight as it has in Eastern Europe. After all, Mr. Kim came to power after World War II as a homegrown revolutionary patriot admired in many parts of the Korean peninsula for throwing off decades of colonial Japanese rule and founding an army, national bureaucracy and other major institutions. North Korea is considered more likely to adjust his legacy than abandon it, which means that no matter what happens, the road to rapprochement with South Korea and indeed the West may be long and hard.

HEADLINE: Hostage Situations Demand Forthright Action;
Democracy in Jordan

 BODY:
United States aid has been meager: about $50 million a year. This is a pittance for the friendship, patience and loyalty King Hussein has shown over the years. Since 1973, he has maintained de facto peace and tacit cooperation with Israel, and issued a number of peace proposals.
More important, he has implemented political reforms at home, making Jordan the most democratic of the Arab states. ''Jordan: Human Rights Protection After the State of Emergency,'' an Amnesty International report of last June, documents the brutal political repression that once characterized life in Jordan. Recent changes, while not revolutionary, are unprecedented.
Scores of political prisoners and detainees have been released, instruments of repression reined in, and freedom of expression restored. Last November, the country elected its first free parliament in 22 years. In the coming months, if security is not threatened by external conflict, martial law will be completely abolished and political parties legalized.
Israel's supporters often say it is the only democracy in the Middle East and chastise the Arab states for human rights abuses. President Bush has also made help for ''emerging democracies'' a priority. If both place such importance on democratic development, then increased foreign aid should be immediate.
This is especially true if the United States insists on making its blockade of Iraq absolute. It is unlikely that President Bush will grant Jordan even partial exemption, despite its economic situation and highly politicized Palestinian population. At the least, Jordan should be compensated for losses; otherwise, its nascent democratic experiment and King will flounder.

HEADLINE: Energy Tax: Still on the Table

BYLINE: By LEON PANETTA; Leon Panetta, Democrat of California, is the chairman of the House Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Middle East crisis has made our already worrisome economic and fiscal problems worse. But perhaps the threat of war, stagflation and the prospect of $300 billion budget deficits will shock us into action, as political business as usual during the late 1980's did not.
The new demonstration of our energy vulnerability, after a decade of wasted opportunity, at least makes clear the direction in which policy should move. The American people are economic hostages to Middle East dictators, who produce oil shocks, and to Government budget deficits, which produce high interest rates. 
We desperately need both a fiscal policy of assured long-term deficit reduction and an energy policy of assured incentives for conservation. A phased-in energy tax should be the centerpiece of a five-year deficit reduction plan, which would also include other savings and revenues.
The tax should begin at low levels, and increase over several years. In anticipation of increased energy prices, businesses and families will begin to conserve energy now. Similarly, the certainty of lower future deficits will lead to lower long-term interest rates now, reducing the likelihood or severity of recession and stimulating investment, economic growth and job creation.
A phased-in energy tax also fits our fiscal dilemma. The weakness of the economy means that deficit reduction may have to be ''back-loaded'' - adjusted from the contemplated $50 billion in fiscal year 1991, but increased enough in later years to keep a five-year total of at least $500 billion.
We should not play Russian roulette with the economy in an attempt to reach an arbitrary figure for 1991. It is just as obvious, however, that we must not back away from our responsibility to reduce deficits now. Nothing could be more damaging to our Government's credibility, and more likely to raise interest rates and destabilize financial markets, than a collapse of U.S. economic policy at a time of crisis.
Obviously, an energy tax alone will not solve the budget crisis. The Middle East confrontation has not resurrected the cold war, so we should still pursue long-term defense reductions, particularly in European-based forces and in defense weaponry dedicated to a Soviet threat that has largely disappeared - while enhancing our capacity to deal with the Saddam Husseins of the world.
We must also pursue restraint in the growth of entitlement programs and low-priority discretionary spending, while recognizing that new funding is required in a number of areas, such as education, health and research, for an efficient economy and just society.
And we must adjust any fiscal package to make sure it is equitable - a problem that energy taxes bring sharply into focus. If we enact an energy tax, it must be accompanied by tax and other measures to ease the impact on those least able to pay. We should avoid the kinds of policies that led in the 1980's to a shift of income from lower- and middle-income families to the wealthy.
The President has set the right guideposts. His biggest problem has been not with Democrats but with some Republicans, who have consistently undermined him by criticizing his decisions, leaking his budget proposals to the press and threatening to oppose a final budget agreement.
At this time of crisis, the nation cannot afford delay or partisanship. And it cannot afford avoidance of responsibility by our political leaders. In the long run, the deficit and our dependence on oil pose a greater threat to our economy than Saddam Hussein. They, too, must be confronted head on.

HEADLINE: The Golden Door, Re-opened

 BODY:
Yet their splendid work is not quite finished. For there is another part of the island, south of the main building and separated by a ferry slip, that the restorers haven't touched. It contains two dozen contagious disease wards, a morgue and many dark and forbidding rooms. 
Only a small percentage of the 12 million immigrants went there, and, because the buildings are collapsing in a tangle of rust and vines, no visitors will be allowed. But this Ellis Island deserves better; it, too, is wondrously evocative.
The average immigrant spent three to five hours on the island. In far shorter time, visitors will be able to follow the path through the heart of the building the immigrants originally took: from the ferry slip to the vaulted registry room, where they were examined and interrogated by an army of doctors and inspectors. On any given day, 5,000 people would move through this room. Most received a joyous stamp of approval; a few - 2 percent of all cases - a crushing ''no.'' The sick and lame wound up in the hospital and the wards at the south end of the island. It was this part of the island that caused the one nasty dispute during the restoration process.
Lee Iacocca, who was largely responsible for raising $345 million to refurbish the Statue of Liberty and reclaim Ellis Island, wanted to build an immigration theme park that critics promptly labeled an ''ethnic Disneyland.'' Tne National Park Service, which manages the island, decided instead to lease the buildings to a developer who would raze some of them and turn the hospital into a plush international conference center.
But while the developer continues to seek financing in an uncertain economic climate, the old buildings, and the history they contain, rot away. Dust swirls in the morgue, which holds a tiny amphitheater for autopsies, with eight holes in the wall where corpses were refrigerated. Weeds sprout through the concrete floor of a room containing a half-dozen autoclaves - huge containers where mattresses and bed linen were sterilized by superheated steam. One building holds a giant coal-fired boiler; another has a massive Dickensian contraption for pressing sheets.
A Park Service guide recently told a visitor that these abandoned structures held special meaning. ''The Museum recaptures history,'' he said. ''These buildings are history.'' He said he hoped enough public and private money could be found to ''stabilize'' them by preventing further rot until a permanent plan can be devised.
That's a modest idea and a good one. These poor, huddled structures speak of anxiety and hope - and tug us forcibly into the past.

 BODY:
But Ron Bitting, president of the National Association of Cruise-Only Agencies, believes cruise operators brought market troubles on themselves. Last year the Bermuda Government limited the number of cruise lines authorized to call there to four, a move that many thought would bolster prices. Instead, said Mr. Bitting, the high prices that resulted scared price-conscious customers away. ''We've been approaching it from the perspective that customers would have to pay full price,'' he said. ''But in times of economic stress you can't sell value. You have to sell price.''
 
On Vacation In a Windmill
Travelers looking for somewhere different to stay in England, Wales or France might find their needs met by an outfit called Distinctly Different. Its rental offerings include converted windmills, water mills, chapels and schools, narrow boats, oast houses and a former train station.
A 14th-century forge in Totnes, Devon, preserves its links with the past as a smithy goes about his work. The converted stone building set in a walled garden comprises four double bedrooms and four family rooms. Prices range from $27 to $40 a person a night. 
One of the windmills is Cley Mill at Cley-next-the Sea, Norfolk. Dating from 1713, the mill has a five-story brick tower with timber gallery, fantail and sails and two bedrooms. Other accommodations, next to the mill, are a family bedroom (a double room with beds for more than two people) and a single room. Prices: $30 to $35 a person a night. In Wales, a tiny Quaker chapel that overlooks the mountains of the Radnor Forest at Llandrindod Wells, Powys, has one family bedroom, one double and one single room from $20. The rates for properties in England include breakfast; breakfast is not included in France.
Among properties in France, Distinctly Different offers Le Moulin des Chezeaux, an 18th-century water mill on the edge of the village of Rivarennes near St.-Gaultier in the valley of the Creuse River in central France; its three double bedrooms all have private bath. Room rates are about $56 a day.
Brochures covering the properties, none of which have cooking facilities, are available for $2 from Distinctly Different, Masons Lane, Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire BA15 1QN, England; phone: 2216 6842.
 
California Taxing Tourist Import
Beginning Oct. 1, the California State Board of Equalization will begin a new program to enforce a little-known tax law requiring state residents to pay a use tax on items purchased abroad. The law, which was enacted in 1935, is aimed at protecting California businesses from tax-free competition.
California residents returning from trips abroad with merchandise purchased in foreign countries for their own use or as gifts used within the state will be assessed a tax equivalent to state and county sales taxes, which range from 6.25 to 7.25 percent.
The tax board, in cooperation with the Customs Service, plans to send out about 30,000 tax bills this year based on the value of goods listed on customs declaration forms filled out when travelers return to this country. Officials estimate that the program will boost revenue by $6.3 million annually.
According to a spokeswoman for the board, all but four states have a use tax law and until now have relied on voluntary compliance. Other states are keeping close watch on California's program with the idea of adopting it.
Not every traveler will receive a tax bill under the new program. The board has established a threshold dollar amount, which officials decline to reveal, below which the process would not be cost effective. Travelers returning with only a few bottles of perfume or a tweed cap are expected to comply voluntarily with the law by contacting the tax board's office in their county. A tax form will then be mailed to them, which they are to fill out and return with a check for the tax.
A bill pending before the State Legislature would exempt from the tax the first $400 of merchandise purchased abroad and hand carried into the state, making the tax law conform to Federal regulations allowing travelers to bring in that amount of goods duty free.
 
Nudists Protest Florida Rules
A recent ban on skimpy swimwear in Florida's 120 state parks has angered nudists and puzzled some vacationers. The restrictions, state officials say, are targeted at such barely-there styles as the thong (G-string) bikini, but nudists complain of a violation of First Amendment rights. They also say the ban will hurt Florida's tourism industry, which relies in part on vacationers from overseas, many of whom are used to sunbathing topless.
Raphael Marcucci of the Florida Department of Commerce said that of the 38.7 million tourists who visited the state last year, fewer than 5 million were foreigners.
Although a ban on indecent exposure in state parks has existed for several years, the new restrictions, a result of revisions of the Florida Administrative Code, are more specific as to which parts of the body must be covered.
Randy Lewis of the Florida Department of Natural Resources said that if the wearer of a close-to-nude swimsuit in a park refused to cover up or leave he or she could be cited and given an administrative - not criminal - fine of about $35. Park rangers are responsible for enforcing the stricter code.
 
Faster Service To Greek Isles
Twin-hulled Hovercraft ferries cruising at 50 miles an hour have sharply reduced the time it takes to get from Piraeus, Greece, to three outlying islands.
Introduced this summer, the 330-passenger Golden Olympic Supercat makes the trip from Piraeus to Mykonos in two hours and 15 minutes compared with about six and a half hours for the regular ferry. The Golden Olympic leaves the Flisvos Marina at 9 A.M. and 4 P.M. daily except Tuesday; the one-way fare is about $40. The price of the regular ferry is $16.75. For reservations in Greece call 360-9911 or 360-3960. Another Supercat ferry leaves at 8 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. for Poros and Spetses. The craft takes just under an hour to reach Poros and about two and a half hours to get to Spetses. The fare is $10 to Poros and about $14 to Spetses. The regular ferry takes three hours and 40 minutes to Poros and costs $5.25. The trip to Spetses takes five hours and 35 minutes and costs $5.75.
The Supercats Marine Company, which operates the Hovercraft, also offers one-day tours to Poros and Spetses. The price, including lunch, is $32 for Poros and about $43 for Spetses.
For reservations in Greece, call 325-3640.
 
Future Shock For Air Travel
Asked what they would like in airlines, participants in a recent survey had some glorious fantasies: ''Get rid of the peanuts,'' ''individual VCR's instead of crummy movies'' and ''no-frills middle-of-the-night flights'' were a few responses. But other suggestions showed that frequent travel causes riders to yearn for some basics - faster check-in procedures, cheaper fares and better service.
The question on improving air travel was included with the Zagat hotel survey for 1990. The Zagats, Tim and Nina, began publishing their surveys on restaurants and in 1988 added hotels and resorts. This spring their second hotel survey, which was filled out by 5,400 unpaid participants who were on the road at least 47 days a year, included brief sections on airlines and car rentals. The airline section was returned by 4,400 participants of whom 61 percent were men and 39 percent women. Here are some airline ideas, realistic and otherwise: Contour head rests; telescopes for window viewing; quiet zones - no movies, seat-belted study; limo-taxi pickup at the plane for passengers with no luggage; a good sandwich instead of mush, a la carte dining, vegetarian meals available without prior notice; discounts for frequent fliers, no bogus trips; automatic discounts for frequent-flier miles if planes are late; showers in first class.
The survey will be published in December.
 
MYSTIC SEAPORT BY LANTERN LIGHT
Lantern-light tours of Mystic Seaport are scheduled for Dec. 5 to 21, from 5 to 9 nightly except Tuesday. Tickets go on sale Oct. 1.
In these one-hour tours, costumed guides lead groups of 16 people through the reconstructed 19th-century museum village in eastern Connecticut, visiting shops and vessels. Unlike the daylight Christmastime tours, curators and interpreters on the evening tours take 19th-century roles, enacting scenes showing the evolution of Christmas observances from the Puritan days of the early 19th century to the Victorian period when the Christmas tree became well established. Twenty tours go out each evening, and 150 people are used in the presentations. Mystic Seaport, on Exit 90 off Interstate 95, is also reachable by Amtrak.
Tickets for the evening tours are $12, $6.50 for children 2 to 12; it is not necessary to pay museum admission. Reservations are acepted by phone only, and tickets are mailed on receipt of a check or money order. The seaport number is 203-572-0711.

HEADLINE: Cruising by Moonlight Along the Tiber

BYLINE: By Frances D'Emilio; Frances D'Emilio, who lives in Rome, is the author of a guidebook about the city to be published next year by Hippocrene.

 BODY:
The Tiber's abandonment over the last few decades is a relatively recent event in Rome's nearly 3,000-year existence. As legend tells it, the twins Romulus and Remus founded the settlement that would grow into Rome on the spot on the left bank where they were rescued from their drifting in a basket down the Tiber. In reality, the hills of what was to become Rome probably attracted various tribes because nearby Tiber Island made it easy to cross the river.
Up to about about a century ago, Romans washed their clothes and themselves in the Tiber. Until the pollution of the postwar industrial boom, Romans escaped the broiling summer sun with a dip in the river, and private bathing clubs on pilings made the river banks look like a kind of Coney Island boardwalk.
But although the Tiber was the city's lifeline, it also brought destruction. Houses were built right down to the banks, with nothing to stop the flood waters, which rolled through Rome every couple of hundred years. After the city was seized from the Pope in 1870 and became the capital of newly united Italy, the Government made one of its first tasks the taming of the Tiber. Among those offering solutions was Giuseppe Garibaldi, the unification hero. Riverside dwellings were demolished and sidewalks and roads moved up to bridge-deck level. 
If walling off the river put the Tiber out of sight, so to speak, the ''miracle'' economic boom of the 1950's and 1960's put it out of mind. Sewage dumping was finally banned in 1976, but it was only in the last few years that the purification plants mandated by law began seriously reducing river pollution. Now, the return of many kinds of fish is an optimistic indicator, though industrial discharge beyond city limits remains a problem. Still, a swimmer today runs a high risk of contracting hepatitis, and it's possible to see the occasional river rat.
Until the launching of the Acquabus, exploring the Tiber required some daring and maybe even foolhardiness. Many stretches along the cemented-over banks are calf-high in weeds, and some of the less-visited stretches are littered with broken bottles and syringes discarded by addicts. Step aboard a river boat and you sidestep the problems and plunge into a world that's practically bucolic in places, and, on hot, breezeless nights, one of the coolest stretches in Rome. Only a few yards away from the frenzy of relentless traffic, the Tiber is a silent retreat from the noise pollution.
The service began in 1987 with one uncovered boat to test tourist interest. This year, four canopied boats each carry 35 to 45 passengers up and down from Tiber Island to Duca d'Aosta Bridge, near Olympic Stadium. On nights when World Cup soccer matches were played, fans from Europe and Latin America filled the boats with cheers and songs. They and Romans discovered the boats beat a sea of cars and buses caught in traffic on Lungotevere, the roadway that flanks both banks of the snaking Tiber.
The river trip takes 40 or 50 minutes each way, depending on current, and passengers can board along the right bank (the Vatican and Trastevere side), opposite the island or at Duca d'Aosta Bridge, or on the left bank, just past Cavour Bridge. For cost-conscious visitors, the ride is also something of a bargain; one-way tickets cost just under $1.
If you start near the stadium, take a few minutes before boarding to view Ponte Milvio, the first bridge just beyond the course of the boats. For a good vantage point, walk along the newly made, asphalted bicycle path that runs for about nine miles on the right bank (to your left as you face the dock and near the 55-foot-tall obelisk inscribed Mussolini Dux). Censor M. Aemilius Scaurus, who built the bridge - of bricks in 109 B.C. - gave it its name. Garibaldi had the bridge sabotaged in 1849 to stop the advance of French troops. It was ordered rebuilt by Pope Pius IX. Emperor Maxentius was thrown into the river from the bridge after his defeat by co-emperor Constantine in A.D. 312. It was at Ponte Milvio that Constantine is said to have seen a flaming cross in the sky and was moved to adopt Christianity.
Winding downriver, Acquabus glides by several private clubs with riverside pools and tennis courts as well as rowing clubs, one of them dating to 1872. Despite the high bacterial count of the river, early evening finds bare-chested men rowing or paddling canoes in this stretch and upriver. After two more bridges, the boat passes a fire station and, in the evening, the candlelit tables of diners at Isola del Sole, one of the restaurants on the Tiber. Nearby on the left bank is a particularly green stretch rented from the city by the World Wildlife Fund in an effort to keep the area from being cemented over. Willows and poplars lean out over the murky green water, making the bank look as if it should line Mark Twain's Mississippi.
By getting off and on the boat you can incorporate the river tour with other sightseeing. By disembarking at Ponte Cavour, for example, and climbing the stairs to street level, you can take in Ara Pacis, a glass-enclosed, reconstructed monumental marble altar dedicated to the victories of Augustus in Spain and Gaul.
Try to time a boat ride from Ponte Cavour downriver for just before sunset. The Acquabus veers west as it navigates a bend, and in front of you will be a silhouetted dome of St. Peter's, likely breaking a pinkish or orange sky if it's a typically scorching Rome summer day.
Take the same stretch after dark and ahead will lie the fortress Castel Sant'Angelo, bathed in the golden glow of artificial lighting. A little luck and a swollen, yellow moon will be hanging over the 12 marble angel statues spaced across the bridge to the castle.
To explore the castle, you'll have to come in morning, when the monument is open. (Don't be too distracted by the fake designer sunglasses and bags laid out on the bridge by ''vu' cumpra'' - North African peddlers. Gangs of dirty-faced, ragged kids periodically swoop through and relieve people of wallet, handbag or jewelry, designer or not.) The bridge was built by Hadrian as a majestic approach to his mausoleum, which he began constructing in A.D. 130 along the right bank. Archeologists believe the tomb was covered with earth, which in turn was studded with cypresses and statues. In the Middle Ages, the mausoleum was surrounded by ramparts and the citadel became a key defense point. Legend has it that St. Gregory the Great, while crossing the bridge, saw an angel on top of the fortress, and the vision was taken as a sign of an imminent end to a plague ravaging Rome.
On the right bank, just beyond the triple-arched Fascist-era Ponte Savoia, is a travertine block a few yards in from the river's edge and at the base of two symmetrical stone staircases. The slab is believed to have served as a marker in ancient times to show where public land ended and private property began. The barely decipherable inscription recalls one Tiberius Giulius Ferocious (A.D. 101-103), ''curator of the riverbed and banks of the Tiber and of the sewers of the city of Rome.''
The Acquabus is forced to stop by the rapids near Isola Tiberina, as the island is known in Italian. After stretching your sea legs - the boat-shaped island, of volcanic origin, can be covered on foot in about 10 minutes - contemplate another legend tied to the river.
When a deadly epidemic gripped the city in 293 B.C., the oracles were consulted and indicated that an emissary should go to the site of the cult of Asclepius, god of healing, and bring back a serpent. But the snake slithered away from the ship that was bringing it to Rome and ended up on Tiber Island, where a temple to the god was erected.
The temple is no more, but the island, with its hospital dating to 1548, still is dedicated to healing. Descend the steps and look for the block of travertine decorated with a serpent curled around a stick, like a single-snaked caduceus. (Hint: it's just above where the rubber police dinghy is parked.)
Set into the steps of the main altar of the island's St. Bartholomew's church is a medieval marble font carved out of an ancient column. The head of Rome's underwater archeology department, Claudio Mocchegiani Carpano, says the 40-foot-deep font probably marks the spot of the temple's sacred spring.
The island is a good place to look at Ponte Rotto (broken bridge), built 181-179 B.C. Only one arch remains.
To continue the archeological tour of the river, leave the island on the left bank side via Ponte Fabricio, better known as the ''bridge of four heads,'' after the four-headed sculptures decorating it. Keeping an eye out for gypsy gangs, which frequent the island, walk along Lungotevere until Ponte Sublicio, near Porta Portese, the gateway where Vittorio De Sica's suspected Bicycle Thief was spotted.
From there you can see the pride and joy of the archeologist's 12-year-old department, the excavation of a three-story storehouse, built in the first century A.D., for jars of wine, oil and fish sauce that were unloaded from barges at an ancient dock. In those days, it was strictly no deposit, no return, and the throwaway pottery grew into a 100-foot-high mountain of shards, which can be seen a 10-minute stroll away in Testaccio.
On the other side of Ponte Sublicio, Rome's shortest bridge, and on the right bank, once stood a lighthouse built by Pius VII in 1815. Barges towed by buffalo along the banks brought the heaviest cargo to be unloaded there. During the Middle Ages, pilgrims disembarked there for the final leg of their journey to see the tomb of St. Peter. If those medieval tourists had the convenience of the Acquabus, they might have been tempted to keep on going upriver for a little sightseeing.
 
CHARTING A COURSE FOR A RIVER TRIP IN ROME
 
River Boats
The Acquabus runs every day but Monday, May through September. Last year it also ran two weeks at Christmas time.
Schedules are posted near boarding points on the right and left banks of the river, but beware, runs depend on water conditions. This year, July and August saw morning trips canceled; the service began in mid to late afternoon, depending on when water was released upriver. The final runs end at midnight, except for the month of September, when service terminates at 8 P.M. During the summer the last two downriver trips from Ponte Duca d'Aosta end at Ponte Cavour, and not the island, to insure that the crew finishes at midnight. Boats leave about every 25 minutes. Fares are paid on board, so if the boat is about to leave, just hop on. City subsidy and commercial sponsorship make the fare a bargain: a one-way ticket (at 1,150 lire to the dollar) costs just under $1; a weekly ticket for unlimited rides is about $6 and monthly, about $22.
Acquabus officials say that they will decide in late September, based on water conditions, whether they will continue service through the Christmas holidays this year. But in any case service will be suspended for two weeks in October for cleaning and maintenance of the boat. For more information, telephone 686-9068.
The Tiber II is an excursion boat that normally makes one run daily except Monday, March through December, to the excavated city at Ostia Antica, the Tiber's ancient outlet to the sea; it departs from Ripa Grande (right bank) near Ponte Sublicio, in Trastevere. The trip takes about two and a half hours. Fare is about $36, round trip, and includes a one and a half hour tour of the ancient port city; an optional buffet lunch on board is about $21. This July and August, excursions were suspended for repairs to the boat. Because of the low level of the river, the boat's operators were uncertain at this writing when runs would resume this fall. For information: 446-3481.
 
Dining
Er Cucurucu, 10 Via Capoprati, near Ponte Duca d'Aosta, but not to be confused with the nondescript restaurant near the dock. Walk up the stairs from the boat and follow the bike path to your left. Dine on a terrace sheltered from sun and rain by a bower of vines and watch the Acquabus and rowers glide by. Service is excellent; so is the pasta, but it is a bit expensive. Lunch or dinner for two with house wine costs about $95 (a half-bottle is about $5, nearly twice the going rate). Closed Sunday in summer, Sunday evening and Monday in winter; reservations, 325-2571.
Isola del Sole, Lungotevere Arnaldo da Brescia, has a gangplank leading to a delightful patio filled with candlelit tables and sheltered from the elements by big white umbrellas. Strangely enough, fish is not served; but, a rarity in Rome, you can order light salads for lunch. A meal for two, with wine, is about $60 to $70.
Open for lunch and dinner daily except Monday, with indoor tables available in winter. The nearest Acquabus stop is Ponte Cavour. Parking is also available. To reserve a waterside table, 320-1400. Il Canto del Riso, Lungotevere Mellini, specializes in risotto. This restaurant on pilings in the river near Ponte Cavour features fish for a second course. A favorite dish is rice with shrimp. Dinner for two is about $80 to $100. Open for lunch and dinner daily except Monday. Patio space is limited, so call for reservations, 361-0430.
 
Other Diversions
Bicycles can be taken aboard the Acquabus, space permitting. The bicycle path passes right by the Ponte Duca d'Aosta landing. A convenient place to rent bikes is Piazza Sonnino, off Viale Trastevere, and near the Tiber Island departure point.
Although swimming in the Tiber is impossible, you can swim right near it at a riverside club. The pool at the Circolo dei Lavori Publici, 7-9 Lungotevere Thaon di Revel, 39-33-45, is open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. There are showers and dressing rooms, and you can buy lunch at a poolside snack bar. Admission is about $11 for the day, about $7 from 2 P.M. on. The club is opposite the boat dock at Duca d'Aosta Bridge.
 
Guides
Determined tourists can sometimes obtain a map, with descriptions in Italian, of the Tiber from Castel Sant'Angelo to Testaccio by visiting the city's department of underwater archeology in the Central Restoration Institute along Via di San Michele, near the Sublicio Bridge. A guidebook to the Tiber's archeology will be published in early 1991. Dividing the river into mapped sections, the 32-page book will cost about $9 and cover the Tiber from Ponte Milvio to Ostia Antica.
The book will be available from the Tiber II boat office or the Nicolaci bookstore, which specializes in archeology, 23 Via Palermo, 46-39-67. F. D'E.

HEADLINE: New York's Out-of-Town Reviews

BYLINE: By Claudia H. Deutsch; Claudia H. Deutsch is a reporter for the Business section of The Times.

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from what other cities' newspapers say about New York.
 
New Yorkers
''Try as they will - and some are very earnest contenders - New Yorkers just can't overtake Bostonians in the Three R's of driving: reckless, rude and rambunctious. Strange, in a city stacked with high achievers.'' And, in a cab: ''At 57th, a sudden field reversal worthy of Bo Jackson - or Jesse Helms joining the A.C.L.U. - took us from far right, abruptly, on a wondrous swing left to the squealing accompaniment of brakes, tires and perturbed folks who'd been cut off. 
'' 'Would you believe this is my first day driving in New York?' '' the driver asked. - The Boston Sunday Globe, ''A Love-Hate Relationship With Big Apple Travels,'' by Bud Collins, Jan. 28, 1990.
''Doing like the natives, I found it necessary to be hyperactive, to EXPRESS OPINIONS LOUDLY. . . .''
''More than ever, it seems, the rich and the poor rub against one another in New York in a way that rarely happens in the rest of America. Comfortable people cut big deals in tall buildings while legions of homeless people seek warmth in cardboard boxes on sidewalks below. . . . It is a tremendously jarring sight that can't help but force the visitor to question why this wealthy nation can allow these huddled masses to be cast out on the street.'' - The Detroit Free Press, ''Bites of the Apple,'' by Bill McGraw, March 25, 1990.
 
Neighborhoods
''As readers of Tom Wolfe's 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' are aware, in New York City there are neighborhoods and neighborhoods, and the wise resident and visitor know which is what and where. In some mid-city blocks, one can become deceased with relative ease; in others, spending large sums of money takes less effort than breathing.
''This part of town - Madison Avenue and the East 70's and 80's - definitely belongs in the latter category. But it's no mere crass enclave of glitz and glitter - it's got culture, too.'' - The San Francisco Examiner, ''Art Treasures of Upper East Side,'' by William A. Davis (reprinted from The Boston Globe), Aug. 6, 1989. ''To visit Harlem is to see tourists by the busloads, people of all races, pouring in by day, visiting the restaurants, museums and landmarks, and even taking Sunday-morning bus tours of the gospel churches.
''At night, the jazz and supper clubs draw them in, with swing and crooners and an atmosphere reminiscent of Harlem's great heyday during Prohibition . . . .'' - Des Moines Sunday Register, ''Harlem Beckons to Visitors With New Carefree Look,'' by Roy H. Campbell, March 20, 1988.
''. . . there are curious souls who have always wanted a peek at quaint Greenwich Village. Throughout the 20th century, the village has sustained its reputation as a separate, eccentric enclave for impassioned intellectuals and artists living in unfettered style. Blocks are short, streets are narrow enough to keep traffic to a reasonable pace. Three-story, 1820-ish Federal houses with eight-paneled doors and two-dormer windows on top establish a humane ambiance.'' - The Boston Sunday Globe, ''Greenwich Village, Still the City's Cultural and Artistic Pacesetter,'' by Leslie Gourse, March 25, 1990. ''Manhattanites are brilliant at inventing excuses for never leaving their gleaming, steel-and-glass canyons and overpriced roosts. For them, New York's four outer boroughs are largely terra incognita - not quite as reprehensible as 'Jersey,' but certainly unworthy of more than oblique consideration. It's not fair.'' - The Washington Post, ''New York, Boroughing Out: Reyond the Core of the Big Apple,'' by David Yeadon, April 22, 1990. ''In the past two decades, Queens has experienced an influx of immigrants from many South American countries. Unfortunately, the most prominent mention they get in the press is when drug dealers shoot at one another in the borough's streets. The fact is that they have brought some delicious cuisine to Anglos who aren't frightened by the grossly exaggerated reputation of Queens as Medellin North.
''Walking through areas of Elmhurst and Jackson Heights actually is fun for several reasons. It's almost like taking a mini-tour of Colombia, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador without having your passport stamped.'' - The Washington Post, ''Queens Cuisine: Ethnic Eateries Serving Up Sizzle, Spice and Soul,'' by Grace Lichtenstein, April 22, 1990.

From the Brooklyn Bridge: ''We stepped onto the bridge from the Brooklyn side - and it was a walk into a new world. I had been seeing the city up close - on subways, in cabs and down shadowed streets of midtown - but suddenly I had distance, perspective and light. Manhattan was unveiled, with skyscrapers so packing the island's southern tip that if the city were on a seesaw, Harlem would be high in the air.'' - The Washington Post, ''The City From Afar: Stepping Out on the Brooklyn Bridge,'' by John Donnelly, April 22, 1990.
From the water: ''Seeing Manhattan offshore is witnessing the town at its most theatrical. During daylight hours the dramatic skyline rises from the harbor like dragon's teeth. At dusk, when the buildings' lights blink on, the city offers its own fantastic light show, the greatest on Earth.'' - The Boston Sunday Globe, ''Down to the Sea in Ships - New York Style,'' by Thomas O'Neill, July 1, 1990.
 
Bargains
''Vintage clothes are a good buy in New York City, where top dealers offer a wide range of styles for a fraction of the cost of contemporary clothing.'' - Los Angeles Times, ''New York and Old Clothes Make for Bargains,'' by Jennifer Merin, Feb. 4, 1990. ''Rack rates for double rooms start at $245 at the Plaza, for instance, and $295 at the Pierre. Yet the city also has a number of good hotels - attractive, convenient and in safe neighborhoods - that are moderately priced. That is, their rates are half or less those charged by top-tier properties.''
Among the recommendations: the Wales, Algonquin, Iroquois, Mansfield, Wentworth, Remington, Washington Square Hotel, Vanderbilt Y.M.C.A. and Leo House. - The Seattle Times, ''Mid-Priced Hotel Rooms Getting Easier to Find,'' by William A. Davis (reprinted from The Boston Globe), Jan. 1, 1990. ''Campus Holidays USA is offering to arrange clean, safe, economical accommodations in the New York City area for young travelers in the residences at Stevens University. The campus is in the suburb of Hoboken, just two stops by metro from Greenwich Village. . . .'' - Los Angeles Times, ''Youth Beat: Summer Options for New York City,'' by Lucy Izon, April 1, 1990.

HEADLINE: Living on the Edge of Conflict

BYLINE: Laura R. Blumenfeld; Laura R. Blumenfeld is a graduate student at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.

 BODY:
''The Kuwaitis are thieves. Saddam is just claiming what is rightfully his.'' ''Saddam Hussein will save the Arabs as Mohammed and Saladdin did.'' ''Kuwaitis spent their money on jewels and cars instead of the Arab cause. They deserve it.''
''Why does the world yell? When Israel invaded Palestine, no one cared.''
Amman is abuzz with pejorative stories about Kuwaitis: In Kuwaiti emergency rooms, no other Arabs are treated until every splinter is removed from Kuwaiti fingers. Kuwaiti landlords expel Arab tenants for no reason. Kuwaiti men rape their maids. Kuwaitis are just like Jews. 
 
PUB-DATE: August 9, 1990
We got a call from the Prime Minister's office this morning, confirming that the Jordanian government would join United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq. None of the political officers were around, so I took the message, hand shaking. A lot of hands are shaking around here. At around noon air-raid sirens went off around the city. A friend who works next to civil defense headquarters told me that at the sound of the siren, crews pulled on white uniforms and started screeching down the driveway in ambulances. Then word got out - it was only a test. They rushed back into the building. An hour later sirens again rrrrrrrrr-ed through the air. Out tumbled the civil defense crews, yelling, ''Hurry, hurry! The Israelis are here!'' only to trudge back up the driveway a few minutes later.
There has been a rush of Americans registering with the embassy and phoning in to check on the security situation. One woman burst into tears when a consular officer told her she'd have to wait three days to pick up her renewed passport. ''By then,'' she sobbed, ''all the Americans will be evacuated and I'll be stranded!''
Arabs are coming to us for help, too. Jordanians with children born in the States are asking to be evacuated along with their ''Amcit'' (diplomatic jargon for American citizen) kids. Dispirited Kuwaitis are standing in our visa line and applying for refugee status. We had to call in a consular officer from Damascus to help us with the flood.
Among embassy staff, the theme is confusion. We'll have a meeting to discuss the crisis, and then another meeting to analyze the discussion of the crisis, and then yet one more meeting to review the analysis of the discussion of the meeting about the crisis. One diplomat, who had waited all night at the Iraq-Jordan border in case Amcits crossed over, said the poor crisis management was shocking. ''Everything's so disorganized and incoherent,'' the diplomat told me behind a closed door. ''When our time comes to evacuate, I'm going to run across the street to the Royal Jordanian airline office, book a flight, and go. I wouldn't depend on this embassy to get me out of here.''
The increased threat of a terrorist attack or a run on the compound has staff members altering their daily schedules. Some are leaving overnight bags in the embassy in case the building's surrounded. And our tightly coiled nerves are just being further jangled by the barrage of ''Oh my God Jordan was on TV are you still alive?'' calls from the States. Suddenly everyone back home is dialing Amman. My mom has been phoning for a daily ''voice check.'' Just to say hi, she says.
The other Columbia summer intern in Jordan - she was working for a nonprofit agency - decided to forget about her nonrefundable round-trip ticket and leave the country immediately, ''before something happens.'' All flights to New York are booked. So she flew out this morning to Germany and will improvise from there.
Some locals are leaving, too. A bunch of wealthier Palestinians and Jordanians I know are going to Europe to ''sit this one out.'' ''We can't stand it any more,'' one woman said. Today a young Lebanese woman who had moved to Amman after her brother was killed by a shell in Beirut said she was going back. She thinks, at this point, it's safer in Lebanon.
Jordanians who are staying put are preparing for war. People are buying flour, rice and sugar in bulk. They're filling jerrycans with water and kerosene. I met a young mother hauling a crate out of the local grocery. ''It is Pampers for my baby,'' the woman explained. ''One year's supply.'' At the curb, another shopper filled her entire trunk with eight-packs of toilet paper.
Mostly, people are doing a lot of sitting around and panicking. One woman tried to convey the mood to me, translating an Arabic saying. ''We are sitting in the palm of a monkey,'' she explained, holding out a cupped hand. ''We have no control,'' she said, flipping her hand over, spilling imaginary bodies onto the sidewalk.
My Arabic teacher has adopted a fatalistic attitude. ''What can we be doing?'' she said, stopping midsentence while translating a newspaper article. ''We don't have bombing shelters. And we only hold off the Israelis for 20 minutes anyway.'' She has gone from teaching me vocabulary words like ''peace process'' to those like ''warning'' and ''provoke.'' This past week we learned ''gas attack'' and ''total destruction.''
Meanwhile, from what I can gather, Israel is strangely calm. I don't know what's going on over there on a popular level, but Israel's TV news has virtually ignored the blowup. Two nights in a row, the 9 P.M. news spent most of the report covering the murder and funeral of two Israeli boys. Not that the deaths aren't important. But when at 9:22 they say, almost as an afterthought, ''And the U.S. deployed troops in Saudi Arabia today,'' you wonder, why the nonchalance?
O.K., to be fair: Tonight, finally, the anchorman did assure viewers that Iraqi rockets don't have enough power to lob chemical warheads into Israel. An Iraqi missile wouldn't reach far enough, the report said. That probably popped out a few eyeballs around this
 
PUB-DATE: August 10, 1990
1 P.M. I've been grounded. First I was supposed to go to Jerusalem this weekend, but that's off because the Allenby Bridge could be sealed off at any time and I'd be ''stranded'' in Israel. Then I was supposed to go to Wadi Rum, near Aqaba, where ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was filmed. But the embassy task force set up to handle the crisis said I shouldn't go. ''Because of the circumstances, we need to be able to reach you,'' I was told.
I'm worried about my friend Howard, who has been spending the summer as an intern in Baghdad. He was supposed to have arrived here already as part of an embassy drawdown; yesterday, a convoy of five U.S. embassy cars, with 10 ''nonessential staff and dependents,'' including Howard, among its passengers, plus five dogs and two cats, made its way to the Iraq-Jordan border. At the last minute, though, border officials refused to let the convoy pass. Late in the afternoon, one of our officers radioed the news in to the embassy from the border checkpoint. We all sat there in a stupor; I was picturing Howard, sitting in one of the convoy cars, driving again through the desert, seven relentless hours back to Baghdad.
Around Amman, groups are distributing leaflets calling for volunteers to fight America. For days, ads hailing Iraq, praising the King's support for Saddam and assailing America have dominated local papers. Most of them feature pictures of the King of Jordan and Saddam side by side. Sometimes a smiling Arafat or Qaddafi appears with them. But Egypt's president Mubarak is jerk of the week. ''Hang Mubarak,'' ''He is the worst traitor!'' and ''Mubarak is son of Sadat'' - people are saying these things on the street. A rumor that Mubarak had been assassinated brought Jordanians to their feet, cheering and applauding. Saudi Arabia is no favorite either. The latest local joke:
U.S.A. stands for United States of Arabia.
Tomorrow is a national holiday, celebrating the 38th anniversary of King Hussein's accession to the throne. Citizens are hoisting flags all over the city. Oddly, while the King is perceived here as vigorously pro-Iraqi, he has quietly announced that Jordan will join United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq. I keep wondering: What will happen when Jordanians realize the King is double-crossing Saddam?
 
7 P.M. A reporter friend just called and told me about an anti-U.S. demonstration at the university here. The Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian groups organized it. Ten thousand people screamed, ''We will drink American blood!'' and ''Saudi has sinned asking non-Muslims to defend the holy places!'' The crowd cheered, waving Iraqi, Palestinian and Jordanian flags. On top of a mosque, American, British and Israeli flags shriveled up in flames. Demonstrators swarmed around foreign correspondents, demanding to know if they were Americans. An Egyptian cameraman was beaten bloody. My friend said he kept yelling: ''I am Italian! Italian! Spaghetti! Fettuccine!'' Just two weeks ago I'd been trotting around campus looking for ''University of Jordan'' T-shirts. Everyone I spoke with said friendly things like ''American, yes? Ahhh! Welcome!''

Howard's free!
Sitting around the ambassador's pool, I overheard a political officer tell someone: This time the Iraqis let the embassy convoy cross.
I scrambled over to the Regency Palace Hotel, where the embassy had prepared to receive the original 10 Americans (and their pets), plus Penelope Nabokov. She is a 10-year-old girl who had been traveling alone when her plane was stranded in Kuwait. Having been moved to Baghdad, she was allowed by the Iraqis to join the American convoy at the last minute.
I flashed my embassy ID at the security men in the lobby and bounded out of the elevator on the 11th floor. ''Are they here yet?'' I gulped, tripping on a port-a-pooch box with a little white poodle inside. Suitcases littered the hallway.
The Baghdad bunch were in a meeting. There was disagreement about travel plans. Embassy staff explained to me that they had to get out of Jordan quickly, before terrorists or journalists got to them. (I'm not sure which the embassy considered worse.) But some were refusing to fly out tonight, because the carrier couldn't take all five dogs and two cats. Finally they emerged. Howard picked me up in the air and twirled me around. I kept poking him and saying: ''You're O.K.! You're here!''
Two hours later, they were gone to Paris. I rode, under heavy security, with Howard and the others on the bus to the airport. TV crews lighted paths for us on leaving the hotel and arriving at Queen Alia International Airport. Reporters called out, ''How do you feel?'' But no one said a word. The only one who reacted to the flashing cameras was Penelope. ''They called out my name!'' she said, skipping inside the airport terminal. ''How do those strange people know me?''
It hurt, saying goodbye to Howard. After 10 agitated days, praying to see his face, it was hard to watch it vanish again so soon. As the airport elevator doors closed on the Baghdad refugees, one called out to me, ''You should be going with us!''
I wish I were.
 
August 12
Anti-American protests are everywhere. So many different groups are sponsoring them, the embassy has put together a demonstrations-and-rallies schedule, like a TV Guide. Jordanians are ordinarily careful to distinguish between their hatred of American policy and their admiration for Americans themselves, the American life style. ''It's nothing personal,'' they've been telling me all summer.
Now, however, it feels personal. No acts of violence yet, but it's just a matter of time, people say. The anti-American rhetoric is growing more intense, graphic, bloody. In the market this morning, three veiled Arab women, usually the epitome of reserve, screamed at an American friend of mine, ''America bad, bad, bad!'' Yesterday, Tareq Masarweh, a respected columnist in the Arabic Ar-Rai paper, wrote: ''Let the U.S., Britain, France and the other looters mass their troops and fleets to kill the Iraqi people. At the first shot, we will kill you on every Arab street and we will turn the earth red.''
Today, in an interview with a foreign journalist, Masarweh said: ''If America attacks Iraq, I will personally go out into the streets and kill Americans. So will many others.''
The International Lions Club of Jordan has called for ''popular committees to extend support for Iraq and to alleviate effects of the siege; special popular committees for mobilization of masses to confront the imperialist-Zionist onslaught; striking at U.S. and British interests and the interests of any country who supports them.''
All this talk about striking at ''American interests'' has set our local hires on edge. The intifada ''collaborator syndrome,'' where fear of being hacked up by compatriots keeps Palestinians from cooperating with Israel, soon may surface in Jordan as well.
Even the international telephone operators are getting into the anti-West spirit. Usually when I attempt overseas calls, the male operators flirt. Typically, they respond to my ''Call the United States, please'' with: ''Ahh, collect from Loora? That a very beoooootiful name! You are very very pretty O.K.?''
Now though, when I start speaking English, the operators promptly hang up on me. Click. Finally, I've caught on and try to muddle through in Arabic. Last night the guy placed my call but demanded first, ''Are you a Muslim or a foreigner?'' No more chitchat with the American ladies. And tonight, when I tried to call my dad, the operator said in chilly tones, ''We know you working embassy America.''
Still, hatred toward the United States is not without its inconsistencies. A small anti-American, flag-waving demonstration materialized next to the embassy today. Police broke it up before it really got going. A friend of mine ran to see it, but the crowd had just scattered. ''What happened?'' he asked a Jordanian soldier guarding the embassy. The soldier pointed his machine gun over to a Jordanian standing on the visa line for the States. ''Ask him, over there,'' the guard said. ''He participated.''
A few, very few, Jordanians acknowledge the downside to Saddam's Gulf War II. First of all, people are afraid it will disrupt the flow of remittances that Palestinian and Jordanian migrant laborers send back home. ''When my brother used to come visit us from Kuwait, he'd carry 10 suitcases,'' said a Palestinian girl. ''All the brothers and sisters got presents - one suitcaseful each.'' Now she worries her brother will lose his job.
Palestinians and Jordanians fear that Saudi Arabia will punish them for supporting Iraq and bar them from employment. Also, if Jordan ends up getting dragged into a war, plenty of suffering will follow. ''My friends say they are happy to starve for the Arab cause,'' a Jordanian woman told me. ''But for how long?''
Only one Arab among the dozens I've spoken to actually criticized Saddam. The man, a policeman, described Iraq's leader as ''a not good.'' ''Then why does everyone love him so much?'' I asked. The policeman said nothing. He just stood there, watching traffic, shifting his weight back and forth - right leg, left; right leg, left. I thought he didn't understand my question. Just as I began to drift down the sidewalk he said, ''People love to be slaves.''
 
PUB-DATE: August 14, 1990
6 P.M. My last day of work at the embassy was so frenetic, no one had time to say goodbye. Only one officer wandered into my office. ''You know, I read about you in Thomas Friedman's book 'From Beirut to Jerusalem,' '' he said. Gulp. All summer people have been saying things like, ''Hey, I heard you were in the Friedman book.'' But no one actually remembers the pages about me, which is good, considering I talk about my yeshiva education and the time terrorists shot my father while he was on vacation in Jerusalem. ''So you're pretty Jewish then, huh?'' the officer said. ''Uhhhh,'' I said, thinking ''Trust the guy.'' He'd always struck me as one of the more tolerant people in the embassy when it comes to Jews. He said he was appalled by the anti-Semitic rhetoric he's heard from American diplomats, who talk about rich New York Jews controlling the government, the media and the banks.
Perhaps, since it was the last day of my internship, it was time to divulge closely guarded secrets. I didn't want anyone to overhear us, so I took a piece of paper and wrote in pencil: ''Well, you know how I always say I'm vegetarian? I love meat. But I keep kosher.'' He looked very surprised, but I think he understood. I took another piece of paper and wrote, ''And my father isn't really a professor.'' No? his eyebrows asked. ''He's a rabbi. We're eight generations of rabbis,'' I scribbled. What a brief flash of freedom, to finally tell someone in Jordan who I really am and where I really come from! When I got home from work, I soaked the penciled notes in a sinkful of water and flushed them.
 
1 A.M. A friend and I just got back from night swimming in the Dead Sea. The salty water popped my body up into the black air. What a relief to get away from Amman and the news and the cable traffic from Washington.
I asked a waiter at the beachfront hotel about the lights on the opposite shore. ''Jerusalem,'' the waiter said.
''Really?'' I asked. ''Right there? I heard Jerusalem was far from here.'' I looked down, drawing toe spirals in the sand.
''No, that's Jerusalem.'' He sounded sure. ''It's all Jerusalem. Everything they took - for us is Jerusalem,'' he said, staring off at the pinkish lights.
I had always wondered, all those times standing on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea, what people thought across the border. Now I guess I know. Driving back to Amman, we saw a tank mounted on a truck. It rumbled down the road toward the Jordan Valley, toward Israel. One tank, no big deal.
I had just finished reassuring myself when we pulled around a bend, and there, as far as we could see, stretched a convoy of trucks, all carrying tanks. None of the trucks had headlights on, just dim red beams. ''Quick, turn on the radio!'' I said. We hadn't heard the news in several hours. These days, whole countries are conquered in that time.
There was nothing new on the news. What would Iraq want in Jordan anyway? It's not like it has any precious natural resources like oil to covet. Fertilizer is one of Jordan's top exports, along with phosphates.
True, Iraqis may just be passing through on their way to Israel. Saddam could attack Israel and Saudi Arabia and in one swoop liberate all three holy cities captive to Western implants. Which reminds me: President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has just been added to the imperialist-Zionist list. Jordanian-Syrian relations have always been tenuous. So Assad's signaled willingness to cooperate with the West has triggered a chorus of ''We told you he was a traitor!'' around Jordan. I heard one Jordanian refer to him today as ''the bought one.'' He insisted the deposed Kuwaiti Emir bought Assad with ''hundreds of billions of millions of dollars.'' It was clear to us all along, the man said, that Syria's leader was a Zionist.
Even before the invasion, conspiracy theories raged. Everyone from my doorman to ministry directors has confided to me at some point: ''You know, so-and-so is really backed by blah-di-blah.'' The C.I.A. funds the Muslim Brotherhood; Yitzhak Shamir supports the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; King Hussein is an Iranian agent; Israel and the Palestinians are plotting to take over Saudi Arabia.
Today's conspiracy: The U.S. and Israel are secretly preparing to conquer Aqaba.
 
PUB-DATE: August 15, 1990
3 P.M. I'm on a Royal Jordanian flight to the States. No one at the embassy believed I'd actually make it. There's such a mad crush of people trying to fly out. At the airport, suitcases, travelers and security guards churned around like a storm. I had to use my rudest New Yorker's voice to get a seat. And I'm ashamed to say I even yelled at a nice Swedish man who ran over my toe with his luggage cart.
I'm choking in the last row of the smoking section, sitting in the middle of a Jordanian family of seven. The father says he is the royal dentist in Saudi Arabia for King Fahd's brother. The Saudi prince fled the country for England. So the dentist decided to leave too, for the States. ''I take a month vacation from Saudi Arabia,'' the dentist tells me, patting his screaming 2-year-old. ''And then what, you'll go back?'' I ask. ''If there is a back,'' he says with a strained smile.
A group of American students who studied Arabic at Yarmouk University in Jordan this summer are sitting in front of me. One just pulled out the Royal Jordanian flight route map. ''Hey guys, check it out, Kuwait's still on the map!'' he says, laughing. The students say they were treated great all summer. Jordanian students were superfriendly and constantly invited them home for weekends. ''But ever since this Iraq-Kuwait thing,'' one guy says unhappily, ''they really chilled out toward us.''
10 P.M. Eastern daylight time. My parents met me at the airport. As I walked out of customs into the surge of anxious families, I spotted my mother wearing a clown nose and a stars-and-stripes Uncle Sam hat. ''Now we can sleep at night,'' said my father. I'm home.

HEADLINE: The Underside of the Stones

BYLINE: By JON PARELES; Jon Pareles is the chief pop music critic of The New York Times.

 BODY:
The Jones murder scenario makes a slender foundation for a book with the vast pretensions of ''Blown Away.'' Mr. Hotchner, the author of the memoir ''Papa Hemingway'' and biographies of Doris Day and Sophia Loren, professes to map the course of the 1960's against the ascent of the Rolling Stones. Jones, the son of an aeronautical engineer from Cheltenham, England, put an ad in a musicians' magazine that brought together some working-class kids who loved rhythm-and-blues; he named the group the Rolling Stones, and it worked its way from the back rooms of pubs to arenas full of screaming fans. The arc ends, for the book's purposes, with Jones's drowning in July 1969 and the Altamont, Calif., concert that December, at which three people died and many more were beaten by Hell's Angels who had been hired as a security force. 
With such convenient and well-worn symbols, the author tries to wrap the latest addition to the genre of nasty biography - exemplified by Albert Goldman's wildly slanted ''Lives of John Lennon'' - in portents of significance. ''More than any other rock group,'' Mr. Hotchner writes, ''the Stones were a product of their times.'' Not that the author appears to have done much research into the sociology, history, politics, economics or demographics that might illuminate the 60's. Mr. Hotchner does try to rename the generation that came of age in that decade as the Jagger Generation. But for insights into the culture of the 60's, look elsewhere; ''Blown Away'' is about digging up dirt.
The method echoes books like ''Edie: An American Biography,'' edited by Jean Stein and George Plimpton, and ''I, Tina'' by Tina Turner and Kurt Loder. Long quotes, from sources whose credibility the reader must determine, are held together by driblets of narrative. Mr. Hotchner's book includes interviews with the Stones' friends and lovers and assorted, sometimes irrelevant contemporaries, like the fashion designer Mary Quant. ''Blown Away'' reads like it was word-processed rather than edited, with frequent repetition and clunky transitions. Try this one: ''Rock music was also destined to become another great leveler but the Stones were finding it difficult to emerge from the bleak obscurity of the back room at the Wetherby Arms.''
The dirt on the Rolling Stones has been sifted and resifted, with far more style, in books like Philip Norman's ''Life and Good Times of the Rolling Stones,'' Stanley Booth's ''Dance With the Devil'' and Chet Flippo's tour diary ''It's Only Rock and Roll.'' With the Stones' help, researchers have long since tabulated who snorted what when and who bedded whom how. Although the current band members did not give interviews to Mr. Hotchner, they have been candid with other journalists, from whom ''Blown Away'' borrows generously. By now, anyone who cares about the Stones knows that Mick Jagger is ambitious, that Keith Richards became a heroin addict and that Brian Jones had a drug problem and a violent, unpredictable temper, including a tendency to beat his girlfriends that is well documented by ''Blown Away.''
What's not documented is the music. ''Blown Away'' tells the story of some unkempt, amateurish rhythm-and-blues fans who grew up to be nasty, selfish rock stars; how they were capable of stirring thousands of people remains a mystery. Mr. Hotchner's interviewees go on about Mr. Jagger's pansexual appeal. But no one points out that the Jagger-Richards team came up with brilliant songs about the nexus of sex and power and desire - songs that, far from being bound by the 60's, have dated hardly at all. Some are still misconstrued; Mr. Hotchner, eager to blast the Stones as Satanic, hasn't figured out that ''Sympathy for the Devil'' might just be ironic.
One endlessly repeated motif in ''Blown Away'' is that Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards ousted Jones from the band in 1969 - something the author treats as a horrifying betrayal. According to ''Blown Away,'' Jones taught Mr. Jagger how to play harmonica and was the inspiration for the singer's dance moves. Again and again, the book insists that Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards were conspiring to remove Jones and that they had illegitimately wrested the leadership of the band from him. At first, Jones may have been the most skilled musician among the Stones' founders. But rock has less to do with technique than with originality. Jones's eclipse began when the band started playing its own material; Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards could write songs while Jones could not. As singer and lyricist, Mr. Jagger naturally became the focus of the band.
If Mr. Hotchner wants to indict the songwriters for their disloyalty, he almost inadvertently tells a different story. While he extols Jones's musicianship, his dirt-seeking leads him to reveal Jones as increasingly unstable and drug-addled, missing concerts and messing up recording sessions. In his most chilling chapter, ''The Persecution of the Stones,'' Mr. Hotchner details the repeated drug raids directed at the band members, raids that led an already paranoid Jones to have a nervous breakdown around the end of 1967. As the Stones became a world-class band with professional obligations, it seems amazing that they kept Jones in the band as long as they did; eventually, loyalty had to give way to the music. The last Stones album with Jones, ''Beggars Banquet,'' was one of their best, but so were three that followed it: ''Let It Bleed,'' ''Sticky Fingers'' and ''Exile on Main Street.''
Mr. Hotchner admits that the Stones became experts in the studio, but misunderstands what they did there: ''Their imaginative mastery of the very complicated process of taking a simple song once it was taped and enhancing it with all the electronic apparatus available in a high-tech studio has been the key to the success of their songs, although, of course, studio inventiveness is meaningless unless the song itself has strong ingredients.'' Actually, the Stones didn't save modest little ditties with studio sweetening; they made studio work inaudible, creating the sound of a lean, tough band playing together on an inspired night.
While Mr. Hotchner uses Jones's ouster to pillory the Stones, his heart seems to be elsewhere. ''Blown Away'' reveals an obsession with the class system. The author genuflects before titles; Prince Rupert Loewenstein, who became the Stones' accountant, ''is an authentic member of the House of Hapsburg'' who ''scintillates elegance from his Savile Row dark-blue suit to his custom-tailored shirt with his initials discreetly on the cuff.''
Despite the upheavals of the 60's, the class system wasn't overturned. And Mr. Hotchner is disgruntled. For him, the Stones' success was just a means to unseemly social climbing. Mr. Jagger, he writes, ''yearned for someone with class and good breeding who, by her association with him, could elevate him from the level of being a pop singer from a lower-middle-class family.'' But in the chapter called ''Requiem for the Jagger Generation'' - itemizing the ways the 60's didn't remake the world - his first item is ''The Class System,'' under which he writes, ''Rock stars are no longer referred to as 'new royalty.' '' Jones's death fulfills the author's obsession; it is the revenge of the brutish laboring classes on a proper middle-class lad.
It is, of course, absurd to blame the Stones for the death of the 60's; they never pretended to be anything but performers, and the band survived the decade much better than most of its contemporaries. The Stones made bad mistakes in public - like taking the advice of San Francisco bands, who should have known better, on whom to hire for the security force at the Altamont concert. But the Rolling Stones never pretended to be saints, and it seems that Mr. Hotchner's real complaint in ''Blown Away'' is that you can't always get what you want.

HEADLINE: Something's Gone Terribly Wrong in New York

BYLINE: By J. ANTHONY LUKAS; J. Anthony Lukas is the author of ''Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction in 1986.

 BODY:
With allowance for the hyperbole of a bedazzled visitor, this was the city of my youth, the enchanted island in which I grew up and to which I later returned on vacations from college, on furlough from the Army or simply because, in those heady years, it was the center of my universe.
It was the city of Fiorello La Guardia and Bill O'Dwyer, of Glenn Miller and Duke Ellington, of A. J. Liebling and Max Lerner, of King Kong Keller and Jackie Robinson, of Lionel Trilling and Mary McCarthy. It had its misery and its slums, its racial injustice and its social obtuseness, but somehow it had a rough and ready openness; a respect for excellence, whether in hitting high C or turning a double play; a willingness to give any kid on the playground his shot at the yawning basket of life.
This is the city that shadows Jim Sleeper's mournful and angry book. ''The Closest of Strangers'' is a moving elegy for that ''unique civic culture,'' a lost world whose ''irrepressible idea was that, even as each of us is raised in some ethnic, racial, or religious community, each of us can, as an American and especially as a New Yorker, decide to transcend anything in our pasts that has made us small and contribute to a unique urban experiment that E. B. White called 'cosmopolitan, mighty and unparalleled.' '' 
Now, in what he calls the ''depths of our civic night'' - in the wake of Bernhard Goetz, Howard Beach, Tawana Brawley, Bensonhurst and the Central Park jogger - Mr. Sleeper believes that this ethos has been pulverized by the collision of narrow self-interests, an insistence on viewing the world through the distorting lens of race, a refusal to accept basic standards of personal accountability and civil order.
And he asks with rising indignation, even despair, ''Who would want to remain in such a city?''
This cry may strike some as a trifle apocalyptic. After all, there have been other junctures in the city's history when there seemed ample grounds for despair. The draft riots of 1863, when rioters, most of them Irish, killed blacks by the score, and the Triangle Shirtwaist fire of 1911, when capitalist exploitation of immigrant labor aroused rage, are two that come to mind.
Nonetheless, the central thrust of Mr. Sleeper's question will resonate in many New Yorkers: that something has gone terribly wrong in our city - and, by extension, in many troubled communities across the land; that we have let our standards of civility and truth waste dangerously away; that we are awash in poisonous tides we seem powerless to beat back.
A savvy editorial writer for New York Newsday who in 1987 edited a splendid special issue of Dissent magazine on New York, Mr. Sleeper wishes to provoke us into a searching re-examination of our preconceptions on race and class. He calls his book a ''conversation with fellow New Yorkers.''
Unfortunately, it is frequently less a conversation than a shouting match. For, unlike his introduction to the Dissent issue, in which he evenhandedly distributed responsibility for the city's malaise, this book makes only passing reference to ''brutal, calculating'' real estate speculators and the ''self-absorbed'' middle class of the 1980's. Instead, he heaps a lion's share of the blame on certain ''black leaders and their left-liberal apologists.''
Page after page, we get numbing variations on this theme: ''activist lawyers and social engineers,'' ''left-leaning civil libertarians,'' ''militant black and Hispanic leaders,''
''black-nationalist educational reformers,'' ''white leftists and black militants,'' ''coldly hostile affirmative action elites.'' Or we get sentences like this: ''The confluence of radical spite, absurd legal extrapolations, and liberal disdain for white ethnics that led to forced busing, the bloating of welfare rolls, and the mau-mauing of white teachers broke the spine of New York's civic culture.''
It is not the ideological content of these phrases to which I object - for, appearances notwithstanding, Mr. Sleeper is by no means a neoconservative dogmatist - it is the empty clang of the language, the sheer banality of such labels, like graffiti scrawled on a brick wall.
In distinguishing himself from the neoconservatives, Mr. Sleeper shrewdly points out that ''they need to recall that the fallen have stories. Listening well to such stories is an acknowledgment of their bearers' dignity.'' But ''activist lawyers'' and ''social engineers'' have stories too. Their abstract positions grow from a rich humus of sentiment, perception and experience, which is sadly lacking in these pages.
This is too bad, because Jim Sleeper is usually a thoughtful man, who combines a streetwise feel for New York's neighborhoods with a solid grounding in political theory and a passion for the tough questions. Here he has boldly, if sometimes injudiciously, addressed the biggest issues in urban America. ''The Closest of Strangers'' offers a number of important insights that are not vitiated by the screech of his rhetoric.
In a searching critique of the legalistic bent of recent American liberalism, Mr. Sleeper argues that the great legal victories of recent years - Brown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade, to mention only two - have seduced liberals away from the mundane tasks of organizing, education and - yes - politics. As they grew ever more adept at addressing judges, they forgot how to persuade their fellow Americans. But liberals soon discovered ''the limits of the law's ability to untangle the pathologies of white racism in a capitalist economy.''
And here his argument about the limits of legalism joins with an even more important argument about the importance of class in American society. The reliance on the courts, he says, ''represents a fateful, typically American dodging of the reality of social class divisions, which are arguably more fundamental than racial divisions in perpetuating social injustice. . . . The law can address injustices based solely on race, but, because it protects private property and the freedom of capital to invest or disinvest as its owners see fit, the law cannot as easily address injustices rooted in economic class distinctions.''
In these pages, Mr. Sleeper sounds more like the social democrat or socialist I suspect he is than the crabbed Bourbon some of his less temperate language evokes. Yet there is a curious paradox in Mr. Sleeper's argument. In plumping - correctly, I think - for political action to address matters of class, he collides head-on with his elegiac pleas for a return to a civic culture rooted in ''old-fashioned notions of republican, even 'bourgeois,' virtue.''
Virtue - a word not heard much these days - is a time-honored notion rooted in Aristotelian and Platonic thought. Up through the centuries its emphasis on the commonality of citizens has been an antidote to interest-based politics, whether of class or race. In seeking to dissolve narrow racial thinking in a new civic virtue, therefore, Mr. Sleeper undercuts his plea for a politics that frankly confronts class, a divisive ''interest'' if ever there was one.
With all its failings, ''The Closest of Strangers'' is a valuable sifting of the shibboleths and pieties that often impede our most ambitious social programs. At a time when a White House official, after surveying the nation's antipoverty efforts, can conclude that the best option is to ''keep playing with the same toys. But let's paint them a little shinier,'' we need all the searching re-examinations we can get. But we can do without any more name-calling.

HEADLINE: The English Revolution in America

BYLINE: By FORREST McDONALD; Forrest McDonald's most recent book is ''Requiem: Variations on Eighteenth-Century Themes.''

 BODY:
The sketches and essays are diverse. Mr. Bailyn's approaches to the three Thomases of the American Revolutionary epoch - Jefferson, Hutchinson and Paine - are as different from one another as the subjects were, but they are held together by a common theme: the influence of ideas on the politics of the period. More specifically, each is directed toward expanding, correcting, elaborating and illustrating the thesis Mr. Bailyn first advanced in his extremely influential 1967 book, ''The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution.''
That thesis runs roughly as follows: 18th-century Americans viewed political activity through an ideological prism that for the most part had been shaped by English thinkers involved in the effort to deny the throne to Charles II's Roman Catholic brother, James, in 1679-81. The successful outcome of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 pushed the essential concepts of these thinkers to the peripheries of English debate, but through the writings of the opposition there - mainly John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon (writing as Cato), Viscount Bolingbroke and James Burgh - they were absorbed into the mainstream in America. The oppositionist litany included: a fear of standing armies; a rigid insistence that power must be restrained by a mixed form of government with checks and balances; an obsession with corruption, luxury and vice; a belief that speculation in the public debt and other ''paper'' wealth was the root of most evil; a nostalgia for a simpler, pristine agrarian past; and, above all, an almost paranoid fear of conspiracies of wicked and designing men to deprive the people of their liberties. When, in the 1760's, Parliament ended the period of salutary neglect toward the colonies and began trying to tax Americans and regulate their trade, Americans far and wide perceived the efforts as being part of a studied design to reduce them to slavery.
Mr. Bailyn's thesis, based as it was upon a sampling of the pamphlet literature of the Revolution, mainly in New England, might not have made a major splash but for its timing. The historical profession was bored with constitutional explanations, and the long-prevailing economic interpretation associated with Carl Becker and Charles A. Beard had just received a series of fatal blows. The time was ripe for something fresh, and Mr. Bailyn supplied it. His impact was tremendous: in the two decades that followed, ideological interpretation of the whole sweep of American history from the 1760's to the 1840's expanded into a veritable cottage industry.
Rarely has a single book stimulated such a burst of productive scholarship, though the new works often presented alternative formulations of the argument. Mr. Bailyn has little patience with revisionist positions, and while in the present essays he corrects and enlarges his original thesis, he essentially adheres to it.
He is most convincing in three essays, two of which abundantly illustrate the pervasiveness of the oppositionist turn of mind. One is a sketch of an obscure Connecticut minister named Stephen Johnson, who late in 1765 published six newspaper articles and a pamphlet (originally a sermon) that, as Mr. Bailyn shows, anticipated ''almost the entire range of arguments that would be debated in the coming decade.'' Johnson's language and examples are mostly biblical, but his arguments could have been lifted directly from the writings of Bolingbroke or Burgh. The other is a sketch of an even more obscure man with the improbable name of Harbottle Dorr. Dorr, a Boston shopkeeper, apparently sensed that momentous events were in the offing, and early in 1765 he began collecting and copiously annotating local newspapers. When he stopped, 12 years later, he had gathered, bound and indexed 3,280 pages of papers. His running comments, one man's opinions about the great imperial crisis, could likewise have been taken directly from the writings of the opposition: his thoughts were their thoughts.
Another especially persuasive piece is the last in the book, an essay that moves Mr. Bailyn's thesis forward in time to cover the writing and ratification of the Constitution. Anti-Federalists, Mr. Bailyn shows, used the same language against ratification that earlier Americans had used against parliamentary excesses. That is not particularly surprising. What is surprising is the extent to which Federalists, who rejected the oppositionist viewpoint, were nonetheless influenced by it because its widespread acceptance forced them to take it into account. I would have been happier had Mr. Bailyn brought other British thinkers into his pantheon of people who helped shape American political ideas - David Hume, Adam Smith and Sir William Blackstone, for openers. But he has made an unassailable case that the English opposition was central to the thinking of American Revolutionary leaders, anti-Federalists and Jeffersonians.

HEADLINE: In the Region: Connecticut and Westchester;
The Next Step in Developing Stamford?

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
The city's Planning Board unanimously opposed the zoning change at a meeting on Aug.1. ''Although we don't object to a floating zone, we feel Mr. Malkin's project is too intense,'' said James Serafino, the chairman, ''and we are concerned about creating a second downtown in the South End, which is primarily residential.''
The Zoning Board will consider the Transportation Center Design District zone tomorrow night. ''So far, the members favor some change in zoning for that area,'' said Joseph Frattarolli, the chairman. ''The question is the amount of change and the amount of activity. We would want a reduced project; how much reduction will be a long conversation.'' 
Among the most outspoken critics of Metro Center II is Robert Rich, president of the F. D. Rich Company, Stamford's designated urban-renewal developer for almost 30 years and the owner of most downtown buildings.
''This is not the time for Metro Center II,'' said Mr. Rich. ''There are too many voids in the city that ought to be filled first.''
The current industrial-residential zoning of the area was intended to prevent office construction there from competing with the city's central business district north of the road and rail corridor.
Mr. Malkin said the $50 million Stewart McKinney Transportation Center, the railroad station completed in 1986, should be the hub of Stamford's next wave of development.
''The future of business will depend on mass transit because the roads can't take it any more,'' he said. ''Every city on the Eastern Seaboard has improved rail traffic, making depots the most important location for new development. It's the one place that can be developed in Stamford without creating additional congestion.''
The Stamford station is a stop for buses, Amtrak and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. Automobile leasing is available, and south of the station is a 600-car municipal parking garage. The station is flanked by access ramps to Interstate 95. Last month the city announced plans to build food and service stores in the station.
But the area is dark and deserted off-hours and plagued by crime and vandalism, which Mayor Thom Serrani, a staunch supporter of Metro Center II, believes ''can be eliminated by having people working and living there.''
''It's a prime area that is not doing us any good as a wasteland,'' he said.
Current plans for Metro Center II are for 600,000 square feet of offices in two 250-foot-high towers, one at each end of the municipal garage; 400 units of housing in 400,000 square feet south of the garage; landscaped plazas, and 25,000 square feet of service shops such as a food market, a dry cleaner and a bank.
Should the zone be approved, the Chamber of Commerce fears future projects in which substantial retail activity could be introduced. ''It opens the way for more erosion of downtown businesses,'' said Terrance Walsh, the director of the chamber. The anxiety of small retail merchants overwhelmed by the Town Center mall has been sharpened by a recent increase in empty stores on Broad and Bedford Streets.
The Southwest Connecticut Area Commerce and Industry Association has favored development around railroad stations for five years, as does the Regional Plan Association in Manhattan. Both organizations view it as the next phase of development.
Station-area development is under way in White Plains, Newark, New Brunswick, N.J., and Norwalk, where a $100 million commercial-residential project at the South Norwalk station was approved last month. It is to be developed by the Starrett Housing Corporation of New York City.
Three of Rich's buildings in Stamford were recently acquired by Citicorp in an effort to resolve some of the developer's financial problems caused by overbuilding and vacancies.
''Developers, including ourselves,'' Mr. Rich said, ''mistakenly thought that this market had unlimited potential. We were wrong. The market is not that deep.'' He argues that the city's land-use boards allowed millions of square feet to be built in inappropriate places before steps were taken to stop sizable development outside the central business zone.
But there seems to be little interest in downtown Stamford among prospective tenants, who may prefer different locations, newer buildings and specific layouts and sizes.
''The feedback we get from companies interested in coming here is that the train station looks attractive,'' said Joseph Ercolano, vice president of the Southwest Connecticut Area Commerce and Industry Association.
Included in the Metro Center II plan is a commitment to subsidize 10 percent of its housing units for low-income tenants. In addition, Mr. Malkin, a founder of the Stamford Urban League, would donate up to $1.6 million to the South End Neighborhood Foundation as part of the zone change.
The foundation, a coalition of minority groups, intends to makes loans to bring local housing and businesses up to code and to pay for legal services in closing crack houses.
''The South End has been ignored for too many years,'' said Iona Thraen, a member of the foundation's board. ''We want to be part of the development picture.''
Stamford has frequently been chided as a city without an identity. There are those who remember the chaos of urban renewal and worry now about disturbing a completely rebuilt downtown.
''A lot of people who have lived here all their lives resent what's happened,'' said Mayor Serrani. ''But they are thinking of Stamford in a different time.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Offer Contrasts, but Have the Voters Noticed?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
With the state's economy slumping and the prospect of a huge state budget deficit waiting on the next governor's desk, both Democrats also argue that their talents are urgently needed.
Mr. Cibes, a six-term state legislator and the co-chairman of the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, says the state must adopt a sweeping overhaul of its tax system. He has proposed cutting the sales tax from to 5 percent from 8 percent, reducing the corporate-profits tax to 10 percent from 13.8 percent, eliminating entirely the separate tax on dividends, interest and capital gains and making up the difference with a graduated personal-income tax that would peak at 8 percent for those with income above $100,000.
Mr. Morrison, 45 years old, has represented the Third Congressional District since 1983. He said he rejects the idea of an income tax entirely, unless it is first approved by voters in a statewide referendum, and he argues that Connecticut's economy is too fragile to withstand any new taxes except as a last resort. 
As governor, Mr. Morrison said, he would impose an immediate hiring freeze and concentrate on ''squeezing the dollars harder.''
The Democratic candidates have also proposed differing plans to bolster environmental protection. Mr. Morrison would raise permit fees, for example, to companies that discharge waste and use the money to enhance enforcement. Mr. Cibes would use revenues from the new tax structure for the same end.
 
Rising Above the Primary
Both candidates have also pledged to maintain or increase education grants to local school systems, although Mr. Morrison has not been specific on where he would find money for spending increases in the face of next year's deficit.
For the all the urgency of their rhetoric, the candidates' strategies have worked indirectly to keep the voter turnout low. Mr. Morrison, for example, has sought to rise above the primary by appearing to take on Mr. Weicker and Mr. Rowland now. His television commercials for the primary do not even mention Mr. Cibes until last week.
By contrast, Mr. Cibes, a 47-year-old professor of government at Connecticut College, in New London, has gone in the opposite direction.Instead of concentrating on broad appeals that would increase his name recognition, his campaign has focused on winning over what Mr. Cibes calls ''activist'' Democrats - that minority of the party that would already have been likely to vote in the primary.
Because Mr. Morrison is far better known, almost everyone, including Mr. Cibes, admits that a large turnout would increase Mr. Morrison's chances for victory. But no one knows what the magic voter-turnout number may be for either man.
In the last statewide Democratic primary, the 1982 race for secretary of the state nomination, only 16.7 percent of the party members voted. In the last gubernatorial primary, in 1978, between Gov. Ella T. Grasso and Robert K. Killian, her Lieutenant Governor, 33 percent of the voters came out for a race that raised widespread interest and enthusiasm inside the party.
 
37 Other Nominations
What also remains unknown is the extent to which the low-key gubernatorial primary race could affect turnout for the other races to be decided on Tuesday.
Across the state, 37 other Democratic and Republican nominations are to be decided, ranging from the Democratic nomination for sheriff of Litchfield County to the Democratic registrar of voters in Griswold.
Two State Senate nominations are also to be settled as well as 21 nominations in the State House of Representatives.
There is also one Republican Congressional primary, for the Third District seat in the New Haven area being vacated by Mr. Morrison. In that race, State Senator Thomas Scott, the party-endorsed candidate, faces former State Representative Gerard B. Patton. The winner will face the Democratic nominee, Rosa L. DeLauro on Nov. 6.
 
Final-Day Decisions
Polls throughout the state will be open on Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Only registered voters who are enrolled Democrats can vote in the party's gubernatorial primary, but unaffiliated registered voters may take part in the Third District Republican Congressional primary.
Democratic Party leaders also said that whatever calculations the candidates have made through the campaign so far, much of what happens on Tuesday could still be determined in the campaign's final days.
''You can make all the arguments you want prior to Labor Day,'' said the Democratic Party state chairman, John F. Droney Jr. ''But it all peaks this week.''
 
THE CANDIDATES ON THE ISSUES
Here are the views of the two Democratic candidates for governor, United States Representative Bruce A. Morrison and State Representative William J. Cibes Jr., on selected issues. STATE TAXES AND SPENDING MORRISON: Favors cutting corporation taxes as soon as possible but opposes any new taxes until spending controls can be imposed. Rules out an income tax unless a statewide referendum shows that a majority of state residents are behind it. Favors a 25 percent business tax credit for expenses of employer retraining to help diversity the economy.
CIBES: Would create a graduated income tax on wages that would range up to 8 percent for incomes above $100,000. Corporation taxeswould then be cut to 10 percent, from an effective rate of 13.8 percent; the sales tax would be cut to 5 percent, from 8 percent. Income on dividends, interest and capital gains, now taxed separately, would be treated as ordinary income.
 
THE ENVIRONMENT
MORRISON: Favors stricter rules on consumer-product packaging. Would increase allocations for the Department of Environmental protection by increasing permit fees for the discharge of waste.
CIBES: would use part of the revenue generated by his tax-reform plan to pay for environmental protection. Favors requiring businesses to conduct regular environmental audits of their waste-discharge operations.
 
SCHOOL FINANCING AND DESEGREGATION
MORRISON: Would raise the state contribution toward meeting the costs of local school districts to 50 percent, from the current rate of about 43 percent, as soon as possible, but has given no timetable. Favors a magnet-school system that would encourage voluntary desegregation of schools.
CIBES: Would use mony from tax reform to finance the state's school aid formula fully. Would help local school boards cut costs on insurance and purchasing, perhaps through the creation of regional consortiums. Favors tighter restrictions on segregated housing as a way to combat segregation in schools.

HEADLINE: Families Pursue Communal Housing

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
The idea has had an impact on living patterns in Denmark, its adherents here say. And, they add, there has been an enthusiastic response in several states, with at least 50 co-housing groups formed. Five groups, including three in California, have purchased sites and are currently in the final design stage.
Tomorrow at 7:30 P.M., the Westchester Co-Housing Project, which Mrs. Elie helped form nearly a year ago in Yorktown, will be the host for a presentation by the authors of ''CoHousing: A Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves.'' The book, published in the fall of 1988, introduced the co-housing concept to this country. 
The authors are Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, a husband and wife from California. This will be their first presentation in the New York City area. The couple, a design and consulting team, have lived in different co-housing developments in Europe and will show slides of their experiences as well as discuss their book.
The meeting is being co-sponsored by Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit open-housing center and will be held at the Washington-Rochambeau Room at Mercy College, on Strang Boulevard in Yorktown Heights.
 
Change in Life Styles Cited
''The life of the average American has changed drastically in the last decades of this century, but housing hasn't caught up,'' Ms. McCamant said in a telephone interview. ''The large majority of women work outside the home but they are still supposed to provide all the accouterments for the single-family home. Women are being run ragged and it's kind of crazy.''
Co-housing, Ms. McCamant said, offers a focus for a new living pattern that many people have already been thinking about. ''The interest has been out there, but the builders haven't focused on it at all,'' she said. ''They keep building bigger homes with even more grandiose bathrooms, and who wants that?''
The co-housing concept, which clusters a number of living units on small plots, requires rezoning support from planning boards that often have been suspicious of clustered housing. But advocates said they believe the idea makes good environmental, economic and emotional sense.
 
'It's Up to Us'
''Its up to us to show there are ways for people to live closer together with more group space without being environmentally abusive,'' said Richard Mason, a leader of the Yonkers co-housing contingent, with which the one family from Hartsdale is linked.
Supporters said that the projects by their nature were particularly sensitive to the environment, with larger numbers of people sharing less space and more equipment, buying food cooperatively and recycling as a group.
Although co-housing projects differ, all share common characteristics. They are designed by the residents themselves after consulting with architects, and they are managed by their owners. Each project has a common area with a kitchen and other multi-purpose rooms, often including a tool shop, a music room for teen-agers and a laundry room. This area is surrounded by individual homes; although smaller than a typical condominium or co-op apartment, they have their own kitchens and living rooms.
The whole project is designed to encourage interaction, from the paths leading to cars parked on the periphery to the living units themselves, which are positioned so residents can see each other come and go.
 
Plans to Combine
In the audience tomorrow evening will be members of the two co-housing chapters that formed almost simultaneously last year in the northern and southern parts of the county. They are planning to combine in a new community in Westchester if they can find a site.
The Yorktown section has five families that have decided to co-house. The section was started last fall by Emily M. Sack, 46, an early-childhood specialist and homemaker who moved to Mahopac seven years ago with her husband, Robert Schloss, a research scientist at International Business Machines in Yorktown. Life in her pre-Revolutionary Colonial on two acres on East Lake Boulevard, she said, has not been her homeowner's dream.
There is no playground nearby for her 5-year-old son, Daniel, Ms. Sack said, no sidewalk to walk along and meet people, ''no downtown with little shops to visit.'' The suburbs, she said, ''are not great for kids,'' or for their parents.
''There's clean air here, maybe, but the suburbs separate everyone too much,'' she said. ''It's outrageous for me to make a zillion phone calls and then drive half an hour each way to make dates for my son.''
 
Sharing and Compromises
Ms. Sack began thinking about and even drawing pictures of what she called ''a way of living with more community feeling.'' It would be a place with common spaces, communal guest rooms and shared laundry, ''a compromise between everyone needing to have their own washing machine, their own lawn and their own playground equipment,'' she said.
Co-housing ''is a way to combat isolation,'' she said, and offers ''a place where you can take for granted that people care about each other.''
When her husband gave her the co-housing book for her birthday last October, Ms. Sack said, ''it was exactly what I had been saying, exactly what they have been doing in Denmark for the last 20 years.''
Her idea appealed to Mrs. Elie, 46, a school librarian at the Brookside Elementary School in Yorktown Heights, who has shared a house on Locust Avenue in Peekskill with two other women since her two children grew up.
 
A Different Daily Life
''In communities 100 years ago, there was a focal point where people walked to market and passed each other sitting on a porch,'' Mrs. Elie said. ''Now, you can order groceries by phone, go to an automatic bank teller and easily not have any contact with people at all.'' Co-housing, she said, can help re-establish that contact.
''The way you make friends is when you see them,'' Mrs. Elie said. ''Co-housing provides a rich social environment where if I have an idea or have read an interesting book, there will be other people around to share that with. I won't have to call a friend and say let's get together the fourth Tuesday of next month.''
The seven families in the co-housing group in Yonkers agree. ''For my particular life style, contact within the so-called nuclear family is not enough,'' said Mr. Mason, president of Varnett Robinson, a Manhattan-based wholesale jewelry concern. He lives in Yonkers with his wife, Wendy, and their two children.
''For most of us, so much time is spent earning a living, there's little time to pursue extra things like forming friendships,'' Mr. Mason said.
The members of the co-housing groups in the county may be considered pioneers, but Mr. Mason said: ''What we are advocating is not so radically different.
''We are simply changing the emphasis from individual acquisiton to community, while preserving those things which make the individual family important.''

HEADLINE: Reluctantly, an Obscure Agency Gets Its Day in the Sun

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
''When you strip away all the rhetoric, the debate over McCarran-Ferguson has to do with how the insurance industry designs its coverage points and arrives at its prices,'' said Fred R. Marcon, I.S.O.'s president. ''I.S.O. is central to that discussion.'' The measure would make it illegal for insurers to engage in most of the pursuits they have undertaken through I.S.O. over the years, all but shuttering an organization that insurers have come to depend upon.
I.S.O.'s practice of projecting future claims from data on historical insurance payouts would no longer be permitted. It's the projection more than the historical data that the lawmakers found objectionable.
Nor would I.S.O. be permitted to publish so-called advisory rates -premiums that an average insurer should charge to generate a certain level of profit. The net result is that I.S.O. would be limited to generating common policy language and to serving as a central data base for information on past claims. 
There is little dispute that some of the best-known insurers in America have depended heavily on I.S.O. data in setting premiums when their own customer base is too small for an informed decision to be made. For instance, though the Kemper National Insurance Company has more than $6.6 billion in assets, the Long Grove, Ill.-based company now has only two automobile policies outstanding in South Dakota, three in Nevada, five in Montana and fifty in Oklahoma.
That is not enough business on which Kemper can base sound premium judgments. ''So we need to go to a much larger data base, such as the I.S.O.,'' said Gerald L. Maatman, Kemper's president and chief executive. At the Travelers Insurance Company, Howard Hardy, an actuary, said, ''From a rate standpoint, we use I.S.O. premiums extensively as a starting point. They are very much a benchmark for us.''
I.S.O. loss data and advisory rates are used mostly in business -as opposed to individual - insurance. In ''personal lines,'' the largest insurers in America, including Allstate and State Farm, have customer bases that are so large and pools of customers who are so alike that the insurers do not need I.S.O. data because they have enough of their own.
But there are many more types of risks to insure in business: protecting a small manufacturer against interruption of his operations, a giant chemical company against liability from pollution or a candy store against the liability of someone falling in the store.
Typical of the data I.S.O. provides insurers of these types of policies is the information that for every $1,000 an Alabama beauty salon takes in, $2.23 is paid out in liability claims.
Therein lies the rub. Consumer groups argue that in forecasting losses and advising on premiums, I.S.O. has basically acted the way a cartel would, driving up insurance premiums artificially and allowing inefficient insurers to gouge the public. Consumer activists say the issue is straightforward: Keep I.S.O. out of the business of projecting claims expense and advising on premiums, and premium rates will fall. Estimates of the possible reductions range from 10 percent to 30 percent depending on the type of insurance involved.
''When price leadership is achieved formally through an institutionalized organization such as the I.S.O., it harms the consumer interest,'' said Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America in Washington. ''You end up with a price based on the costs of the most inefficient producer rather than the lowest-cost producer.''
Robert Hunter, president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, a watch-dog organization based in Alexandria, Va., that is leading the effort to repeal McCarran-Ferguson, said, ''There is ample evidence that breaking up systems like I.S.O. produces more competitive results.''
I.S.O. executives could not disagree more. They argue that premiums would actually go up and that insurance would become less available if McCarran-Ferguson were repealed and I.S.O. had to restrict its activities. Denied access to I.S.O. data, which is based on the experience of hundreds of insurance companies, many insurers, particularly smaller ones, would be forced to hire outside actuaries to duplicate the I.S.O.'s work at much greater expense, I.S.O. officials say. That would lead insurers to hike premiums, if not stop writing some types of insurance altogether.
Precisely what would happen, of course, no one knows. ''Would smaller insurers find life more difficult if they were not given expected-loss data?'' asked Victor Lincoln, an executive vice president of the New York Casualty Insurance Company of Watertown, N.Y. ''That's a given. But would they go out of business? That's an extreme position.''
Mavis A. Walters, an I.S.O. executive vice president, said, ''At a minimum, restricting our activities would mean much higher costs to the insurers and therefore to the consumers and businesses they serve.''
Although I.S.O. is only 19 years old, it was created from the merger of a number of similar organizations, called ''rate bureaus,'' in the early part of the century. Insurers had banded together and set up the bureaus, contending that they were needed to make certain that premiums charged were adequate. Because some of these state-supervised rate bureaus required their members to adhere strictly to the bureau's advisory premiums, they became known as legal cartels.
Today, I.S.O. retains some of the characteristics of its predecessors. Its 606 members are still insurers, including such well-known names as Kemper, Aetna and Travelers. I.S.O.'s 2,700 employees are still predominantly actuaries - professionals who compute premium rates based on past loss experiences.
But unlike in years past, rate bureau members are no longer required to subscribe to all of the bureau's services or to maintain its advisory rates. Smaller I.S.O. members pay less than $100 a year for maybe a report or two, while giants like Aetna and Traveler's pay millions of dollars a year for a broad range of services.
Sensing that consumer activists were becoming increasingly hostile, I.S.O. recently moved to appease critics. It placed three persons from outside the insurance industry on its 21-person board. It began excluding insurance company representatives from the process of generating reports on industrywide claims. And it no longer publishes advisory premiums for certain lines of insurance. Instead, it will publish information on historical data and expected losses, and insurers will be required to develop their own premium rates.
''Just about everyone connected with this industry - insurers, agents, regulators - view the move away from advisory rates as a fundamental change in the way property and casualty insurers arrive at prices,'' Mr. Marcon said.
But consumer groups have not been placated. They argue that it will still be possible for insurers to construct an I.S.O. rate from the information on projected claims that I.S.O. will continue to disseminate. Consumer groups argue that insurance premiums will be only slightly more competitive than they are now.
''The change is peanuts,'' said Mr. Hunter. ''It would take a monkey about 10 seconds to figure out an I.S.O. advisory rate based on information I.S.O. will now be giving you. It's literally one step of math.''
Mr. Hunter may be onto something. A number of years ago, I.S.O. phased out advisory rates in a number of states for personal lines of insurance such as homeowner's policies. The impact was basically nil.
''Companies kept on doing business pretty much at the level they had been,'' said Mr. Lincoln of New York Casualty.
The debate shows no signs of easing. Regardless of the outcome, one question is whether, if I.S.O.'s activities were curtailed, consumer activists would back off from their criticism of insurance. Mr. Marcon, I.S.O.'s president, is doubtful. ''Until we address the problem of rapidly rising insurers' costs, all the promises of consumer groups, governors and would-be governors about lower rates are just that - promises,'' Mr. Marcon said.
 
TAKING ON THE ACTUARIAL TABLES
Before Robert Hunter became president of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, the group challenging the insurance industry's exemption from antitrust laws, he worked for a rate bureau that helped set premium prices. Decades later he is one of the most outspoken critics against the practice.
The institution of the rate bureau is key to the problem, Mr. Hunter said - ''the focal point of the collusion.''
Mr. Hunter points out that the actuarial tables themselves, which are used to project how long people live or how many auto accidents a person will be in, are a necessary service. But the service should stop there.
''There is no question that insurers have to look at last year's data and speculate as to what will happen in the future,'' Mr. Hunter said. The problem occurs when a single group tells the entire industry what inflation will be, estimates future levels of unemployment and predicts whether there will be an oil embargo,'' he said.
''What we are saying is that historic data should be promulgated but it shouldn't be manipulated and projected into the future to produce the final price fixed rates,'' Mr. Hunter said.
According to Mr. Hunter, a government study two years ago showed that when a handful of states dispensed with rate bureaus to set workers' compensation premiums, the average rate fell by 30 percent. It would not be as dramatic with personal or auto insurance, but the rates would still fall, he said.
''I think if it goes to the floor it will pass by a significant margin,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''In part because it is an election year, no one wants to be on record as being against this.''
''We will paint it as a vote as to whether insurers will be able to fix prices,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''Because that's what it is.''

HEADLINE: American Broadens Its Deployments

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Last week United States officials acknowledged an increasingly apparent truth: in becoming involved in the defense of Saudi Arabia they were involving themselves in the entire Arab Middle East, with all its complexities.
Military officials made known the extent of their deployment, not just in Saudi Arabia and the waters nearby, but in air bases in four other states on the southern rim of the Persian Gulf. And Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met with a succession of Arab leaders; one accomplishment was a commitment from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to collectively pay much of the bill for the American troop concentration.
The Arab countries caught up in the Persian Gulf crisis have varied political systems, resources, populations and roles. There are monarchies and dictatorships, radicals and conservatives, rich and poor. 
For some years before the invasion of Kuwait, the pro-American countries of the Arabian peninsula were loath to align themselves too tightly with the United States. Since Aug. 2 all have become host to elements of the American military, now numbering 100,000 people. But foreign influence and presence in these countries has long been a touchy subject because all, to varying degrees, have been influenced by non-Arab powers, notably the old Turkish empire and afterward the long arms of Britain and France.
LEBANON Population 3.3 million; per capita national product $690 (1985). Established as a republic with a parliament in the 1940's but since the 1970's has been bled and sundered by civil strife. The Government, headed by President Elias Hrawi, is dominated by Syria. A rival Maronite Catholic regime led byGen. MichelAoun has received weaponry from Iraq. Lebanon was one of the Arab League member nations that voted last month to send non-Saudi Arab troops to Saudi Arabia to help confront Iraq. But analysts say Lebanon could become an important base for smugglers trying to breach the blockade of Iraq. Lebanon was formerly controlled by France.
JORDAN Population 3 million; per capita national product $1,780 (1986). Monarchy with a weak parliament. Situated precariously between Israel and Iraq, and with a large Palestinian population that the ruler, King Hussein, must worry about. He is the Arab leader who has been closest to Saddam Hussein throughout the crisis, seeking desperately to mediate between Mr. Hussein and the dictator's antagonists. Jordan is in an uneasy alliance with Iraq, but has asserted that it would implement the anti-Iraq embargo. Jordan has also asked for more foreign aid to offset economic woes - including a horde of refugees. The King is a descendent of theSharif of the Hejaz whose tribesmen fought, withBritish support, for freedom from Turkey inWorld War I. The Sharif was ousted from his Arabian fief by Ibn Saud, who became king of what is now Saudi Arabia.
EGYPT Population 55 million; per capita national product $490 (1987). Parliamentary republic with a flaccid political opposition and a pro-Government press, President Hosni Mubarak has led efforts to organize the multination Arab military contingent now deployed in Saudi Arabia. The capital, Cairo, has long been a power center in the Arab world and a perennial rival of Baghdad. Was one of Iraq's main backers during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Since making peace with Israel in 19798, Egypt has been the Arab nation with closest ties to the United States, and gets $2 billion a year in American aid. Formerly controlled by Britain; a short-lived monarchy ended in 1952 with the ouster of King Farouk by a military cabal.
BAHRAIN Population 500,000; per capita national product $7,550 (1987). Emirate with a hereditary ruler, Sheik Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa. Minor oil reserves. Firmly anti-Iraq in the present crisis, and member of Gulf Cooperation Council. Since long before the Iraqi invasion has been the site of an important United States naval base. Since Aug. 2, has allowed the United States and Britain to deploy combat aircraft, and Britain has sent naval vessels to the emirate. Formerly a British protectorate; independent for 19 years. YEMEN Population 7.4 million; per capita national product $690 in the north in 1987 and $480 in the south in 1986. State formed in May through merger of Northern Yemen, a republic with ties to the West, with Southern Yemen, a Marxist state whose territory was formerly controlled by Britain. Elections are tobe held under the aegis of a presidential council, now headed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Post-merger Yemen has oil reserves of 4 billion barrels and seems symphathetic toward Iraw. But under pressure Yemen has declared, under pressure, it will abide by the embargo against Iraq.
SAUDI ARABIA Population 16.1 million; per capita national product $5,480 (1988). Hereditary monarchy led by king Fahd; OPEC member with oil reserves of 255 billion barrels. Puritanical Islam prevails. In the past has played down links to the United States. Leader of Gulf Cooperation Council; is solidly against Iraq now but was a supporter in the Iran-Iraq war. Has permitted a vast deployment of United States forces on its terrain and pledged to pay for most of it. King Ibn Saud founder of modern Saudi state had British backing.
SYRIA Population 12 million; per capita national product $1,962 (1985). Dictatorship headed by Hafez al-Assad, who, like Mr. Hussein, is considered ruthless in his suppression of dissent. Has oil reserves of 2 billion barrles. Longtime rival of Iraq, each country has its own brand of secular, Arab-nationalist Baath Party politics. Despite decades of anti-Westernism, Syria received theBush Administration's thanks when it agreed to send a small military contingent to Saudi Arabia. Between the world wars, France was given a mandate over the area of modern Syria and Lebanon. In 1941 Syria was declared an independent republic.
IRAQ Population 18 million; per capita national product $1,950 (1988). Dictatorship whose leader, Saddam Hussein, is seen by many Arabs as a friend of the poor and a foe of oil-rich plutocrats; his political roots are in the secular Baath party but he has lately been affirming in the importance of Islam. OPEC member with reserves of 100 billion barrels. Has a vulnerable internal economy, now sapped by the embargo. Control of oil prices, dispute over an extensive oil field onthe border and more certain access to the sea appear to be major motives in overrunning Kuwait. Iraq claims it was formerly a part of Turkish provinces that became Iraq. British set up an Iraqi monarchy that was replaced by a military regime in a bloody 1958 coup.
KUWAIT Population 2 million, with a large Shiite Muslim minority; per capita national product $10,410 (1988). Emirate with mammoth oil reserves of 95 billion barrels and membership in OPEC. Supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Now in exile, the Government of the Emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, is passionately opposed to Iraq. The Emir's family, rulers since the mid-18th century, sought British protection from Turkish domination in the late 19th century; British protectorate ended in 1961.
QATAR Population 468,000; per capita national product $17,017 (1987). Hererditary emirate - the current Emir is Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani - with a puritanical variety of Islam, oil reserves of 5 billion barrels and OPEC membership. Firmly aligned against Iraq, has agreed to deployment of American warplanes. Formerly linked to Britain; has been independent for 19 years.
United Arab Emirates Population 2.1 million; estimated per capita national product $11,900 (1987). A collection of seven feudal city-states in a loose federation with a ruling council headed by a President, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan an-Nahiyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi. A member of OPEC. Strongly anti-Iraq in this crisis, the federation has accepted the deployment of United States warplanes.
OMAN Population 1.3 million (1989); estimated per capita national product $6,100 (1987). A hereditary sultanate formerly called Muscat and Oman, with oil reserves of 4 billion barrels. Staunchly anti-Iraq in the present crisis; has permitted deployment of American and British warplanes; Britain has also sent naval forces. Long influenced by Britain, which recognized its independence 29 years ago. The current Sultan, Qabus bin Said, deposed his father and predecessor in 1970; the dynasty was established int he 18th century.

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
A Crippled Apartment Developer's Offspring Thrive

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY J. TRAINOR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
 At least three Oxford subsidiaries were sold to former executives, and many other executives went on to head the multifamily interests of other developers and institutional investors.
"It is almost as if there is this entire fraternity of former Oxford people you run into all the time in this industry," said Jonathan Kemper, former general counsel at Oxford and now chairman of the National Housing Council, a trade association, based in Washington, of multifamily developers.
 One of those people is Thomas S. Bozzuto, a national partner in Oxford who headed its mid-Atlantic office, which was responsible for the area from New Hampshire to South Carolina. The region was consistently Oxford's most profitable from 1981 to 1987, when it built and managed more than 10,000 garden apartments and 500,000 square feet of office space valued at a total of $600 million. 
Mr. Bozzuto and three fellow Oxford executives, Richard Mostyn, the late Bernard Lubcher and John Slidell, bought the mid-Atlantic development group and formed Bozzuto and Associates. The partners of the privately held company have declined to disclose what they paid for it. It employs several other former Oxford staff members and has fared well in the Washington-Baltimore market by following an approach radically different from that of its predecessor.
Among the projects that Bozzuto contracted with Oxford to finish was the Heather Ridge development in Bowie, Md.
"Oxford's main business was to manufacture upscale garden apartments on a national basis," Mr. Bozzuto said. "We are concentrating on the Baltimore-Washington area. Part of the reason Oxford got into trouble was by expanding into markets that it didn't know anything about. We want to remain on top of our market right here."
Richard L. Boales, a former Oxford employee who manages projects for Bozzuto, noted other differences between the old and new companies.
 "Basically, we have a four-part approach to the business," he said. "To finance multifamily properties conservatively by acting under joint-venture agreements and avoiding syndication; to stay in a market we know; to build and own properties for the long term rather than be driven by short-term fee income, and to remain small and responsible to our market here.
"Basically we are still in the apartment business. We manage all our own properties but we have intentionally kept it a small hands-on operation."
Financing arrangements with such institutional lenders as Copley Real Estate Investment, an investment arm of the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company, have helped the company remain profitable in a volatile multifamily market, he said.
"Oxford was very good at what it did at that time and in that financing environment," Mr. Boales recalled. "But the financing markets have completely changed since then and they're changing today. The challenge for any developer is to adjust to the changes and operate in a way that will keep those financing channels open."
At its peak, Oxford's development partnerships turned out apartment complexes nationwide, operating under seven regional offices. The company, originally based in Indianapolis, became a multifamily housing giant under the direction of Leo E. Zickler, who joined the firm founded by his father-in-law, Leo A. Lippman, in 1961. In 1968, while president and owner, he took a leave to form Cambridge Builders, a Boston area development firm.
Mr. Zickler returned to Oxford in 1976, as president and owner, just before the national economy went into a steep recession. He immediately concentrated on developing federally subsidized housing and Oxford quickly gained a reputation in that field.
In 1983, Mr. Zickler moved the company to Bethesda, in part to be able to hire other experts in multifamily housing who were familiar with the complex rules of Government-assistance programs.
Throughout the 70's Oxford built an average of 2,000 apartments a year. That increased dramatically in the 1980's, peaking in 86, when the company began construction of 13,000 apartments. That year the National Housing Conference named Mr. Zickler "Man of the Year" for his work in developing low- and moderate-income housing.
But that year also proved disastrous for Oxford and many other large builders of multifamily dwellings who had embarked on ambitious expansion plans fueled by favorable tax treatment.
Despite intensive industry efforts, Congress eliminated Federal income tax deductions for investment losses in the development of multifamily housing, effectively wiping out the syndication business on which Oxford thrived. Investors could no longer invest in the limited ownership of an apartment project and deduct the losses they incurred during construction and lease-up.
Although Mr. Zickler and many in the industry foresaw the changes, they were not able to restructure the many development partnerships and reverse the company's overexpansion. With its major source of revenue cut off, Oxford soon faced large cash shortfalls, and investors and lenders began lining up to collect what they were owed.
Mr. Zickler and Oxford made several attempts to restructure and find other sources of funds, but each failed. In 1988, Mr. Zickler dismantled the company, selling off some assets and placing some Oxford-controlled partnerships under bankruptcy protection. It severed some ties to former consultants, made deep cuts in its development, construction and financing staffs and laid off hundreds of employees.
Now, its financial problems resolved, it is emerging with its assets and property-management operation intact. It is still among the country's top 10 apartment managers, overseeing 45,638 units for about 30,000 investors, and, according to Donald Boardman, executive vice president, is negotiating with several large developers to take over their property-management operations.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Companies Pool Effort on Irish Play

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
Its opening on Thursday at Stamford Theater Works signaled what the theater's artistic director, Steve Karp, and the executive director of the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan, Nye Heron, agree is the producing wave of the future.
The Stamford engagement is an example of cost sharing by two theaters - and the chance for local theatergoers to preview a play that is scheduled to move on Sept. 28, with cast and scenery intact, to the Irish Arts Center, an Off Broadway theater on West 51st Street. The Center's artistic head is Jim Sheridan, who directed the film ''My Left Foot.''
 
Love From Mourning
Mr. Karp recalled his discovery of the play: ''I went to see 'Away Alone,' a hit at the Irish Arts, last spring and was so taken with it, I asked to meet its director, Terence Lamude, who said, 'I have another play I've been wanting to do.' And this was the one. I read it and loved it a lot. It's about how love comes out of mourning - and the families can't take it, like the Capulets and the Montagues.'' 
At the same time, the play came to the attention of Mr. Heron who did not love it a lot when he read it but changed his mind when he attended a staged reading, in which Malachy McCourt had the part of the widower, the role he is playing in the Stamford and Off Broadway productions.
''So we had two theaters that wanted to do the same play - separately and simultaneously,'' Mr. Heron said. ''Doing it this way makes it easier to do the plays you want to do - and more economical. Off Broadway costs keep going up, and we're saving one-third, which includes the set and the rehearsal period.''
''But the Stamford run is not a tryout,'' Mr. Heron added. ''No changes are being made. This is the play.''
Mr. Karp said: ''For the first time, we're originating a production in Stamford that we know is moving to New York. And for the first time, we have rehearsals in New York. But then, because we're so new, everything we're doing is for the first time.''
 
Taking Risks
In its second full professional season, the Stamford company may be rapidly achieving the cachet of New York visibility. ''Rumors in the Palace,'' a comedy by Enid Rudd that had its premiere in Stamford in February, has been announced for an Off Broadway production this season.
''We want provocative and entertaining plays,'' Mr. Karp said, ''that speak to our audiences and that we can do in our modest circumstances. But we're also interested in taking risks.'' And ''Remembrance'' - the title refers to ''the name of the day reserved in Ireland for commemorating the war dead, like Memorial Day here,'' Mr. Lamude explained - may be provocative indeed.
''Except for the animosity between the Catholics and the Protestants,'' he said, ''you don't have to know the specifics of the troubles in Belfast, a city of hate in economic collapse, with strict boundaries, to get the play. It's about how prejudice can tear love apart, and it mirrors other situations with universal themes.''
Mr. Lamude continued: ''After directing 'Taming of the Shrew,' I love to stage love scenes between older people. They're pure and tender and wise. And they revert to the youngish awkwardness common to all who fall in love.''
The roles of the elderly lovers are being played by Mr. McCourt and Aideen O'Kelly. Mr. McCourt, who grew up in Limerick, had a thriving saloon business for 20 years in Manhattan. ''I had the first singles bar here in America,'' he said. He was also the irreverent host of a radio show in the 1970's and its short-lived television counterpart.
About the play, Mr. McCourt said, ''I can go babbling about violence and chaos and bigotry and the possibility of love's survival, but 'Remembrance' shows us the way people work and eat and drink and talk and get up and go out amidst all that - and how the young disbelieve that people in their 60's are capable of romantic and sexual love.''
Ms. O'Kelly, who was born in Dalkey, Ireland, and has appeared in numerous regional theater productions in Connecticut, added, ''And their families use the crutch of patriotism and idealism to cover up their own weaknesses and bolster their tender egos.''
Remaining performances of ''Remembrance'' today and next Sunday at 2 and at 7 P.M., Tuesday through Friday at 8, and Saturday at 4 and 8. 359-4414. Center for the Arts of Sacred Heart Academy, 200 Strawberry Hill Avenue, Stamford.

HEADLINE: Family Leave: Wide Effects Are Seen For Employers

BYLINE: By BARBARA STURKEN

 BODY:
The family leave law in New Jersey is separate from the state's liberal disability rules placing new mothers on paid disability if a doctor certifies they are physically unable to return to work. Family leave is separate from and does not affect disability benefits.
Some of New Jersey's largest employers have already felt the effects of the new law. At the Hackensack Medical Center, six people so far have taken leave in the four months since the hospital notified its 3,000 workers of the law's provisions. Andre Ferullo, the center's vice president for human resources, said that five of the requests were for maternity leave and one was for the care of a seriously ill parent.
''We're not troubled by this law,'' Mr. Ferullo said, adding that the hospital in each case handled the absences by juggling other staff members' shifts and bringing in temporary workers. 
The law was passed over the strenuous objections of most business organizations, including the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, which argued that government should not dictate corporate policies. Marvin Goldstein, a Roseland lawyer who is advising corporate clients on the implications of the act, said many companies, especially small to medium-size businesses, felt they were already inundated with costly regulations.
The law's supporters say that since the Government already sets minimum wage levels and other business practices, family leave laws are not burdensome, and indeed are common in most other industrialized nations.
''Family leave is not a radical idea; it is just plain common sense,'' said Representative Marge S. Roukema, Republican of Ridgewood, a sponsor of the Federal bill. ''The arguments against it do not hold water.''
Many of the business community's objections were taken into account when the state and Federal bills were being considered, she said, noting that small businesses with fewer than 50 employees are exempt and that employers can deny leave to key employees if their absence would disrupt the business.
Cathy Johnson, a Congressional aide, said the bill was needed because many companies were not adopting family leave policies on their own. She cited a Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics survey showing that just 37 percent of employees nationwide are covered by written maternity policies and that few companies have policies granting leave for other purposes, like caring for an ailing parent.
Those on both sides of the issue agree that the law could have a lasting impact on the workplace. Since May, the measure has been in effect at the 5,000 or so companies in New Jersey that employ 100 or more people.
 
Wider Coverage Ahead
Next year it will extend to businesses with a staff of 75 and by May 1993 will apply to any company with at least 50 employees, which covers about 61 percent of the state's 3.7 million workers, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor.
Meanwhile, employers in New Jersey are awaiting final guidelines from the State Division on Civil Rights. Hearings are expected to begin on Wednesday. Proposed regulations were recently circulated for comment and are expected to become final this fall, said Jeffrey Burstein, a deputy state attorney general.
Under the draft regulations, employees taking leave for a newborn or adopted child must provide 30 days' notice, if possible, and can take 12 weeks' consecutive leave within 12 months of the birth or adoption; reduced or intermittent leave can be taken only if the employer agrees.
An employee who takes time off to care for a seriously ill family member must give 15 days' notice and can take 12 weeks over one year for one serious health episode, or stretch the leave over 24 months if more than one health condition is involved.
 
Some Companies Develop Policies
Some of the state's largest employers were developing new policies even before the law was passed, in part because of the demographic changes that created the momentum for the legislation in the first place. Women now make up about half of the nation's work force, with 80 percent of them in their childbearing years.
Also, as the country's population is living longer, it becomes more likely that an employee will have to care for a parent or spouse. An employee should not have to be forced to choose between keeping a job and caring for a family member, say family leave supporters.
Janet Grace, a research associate at the state's Commission on Sex Discrimination in the Statutes, which drafted the bill, said that even though many large companies had worked out family leave benefits, either through negotiation or in union contracts, others offered none.
''We used to have calls every other day from people who were threatened with job loss, or lost benefits and seniority in a particular job when they requested a leave,'' she said.
The growing number of working couples and single parents employed outside the home was a consideration, Ms. Grace said. ''We had cases of families with seriously ill children who could not get time off to get their child to the hospital,'' she said. ''It seems unfair that at a time of emotional stress, you should have to worry about job loss.''
 
Schoolteacher Sought Leave
In one case, Harrison Kornbau, a schoolteacher who lives in Stratford, near Camden, was denied time off by his employer when his daughter was seriously ill with leukemia, he said. ''Their attitude was, 'Why can't your wife deal with it?' '' he said. His wife was exhausted by dividing her time between caring for the couple's other children while spending 12 hours a day in the hospital with their daughter, he said, but he was not able to take time off even in the month before his daughter's death.
Later, Mr. Kornbau spoke out on behalf of family leave bills at the state and Federal level. Yet even now he is not covered: his school is across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania, where a family leave bill is still pending.
For some businesses, the law's most troubling passage is a provision that allows a worker to take an intermittent leave to care for an ill relative and to spread the leave over a 24-month period. That could lead to employees' fashioning their own part-time schedules, creating staffing shortages, business leaders say.
Gerald Hall, a spokesman for the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said that the act could open the way for abuse by employees who simply want to take time off from work. Critics also say the legislation is unclear on the subject of just what constitutes a serious health condition, leading some to suggest that an employee could request leave if a child has a cold.
 
Economic Pressures a Factor
When leave is unpaid, economic pressures deter most people from taking prolonged leaves of absence, said Gail Ruderman, head of human resources at Revere Travel in Trenton. ''I don't know too many people who can afford to take that kind of time off,'' Ms. Ruderman said.
The travel agency employs 185 people, almost all of them women, and has a policy granting three months' unpaid maternity leave. Ms. Ruderman said the company did not think the new state law would be onerous, pointing out that many of her employees had not even taken the full three months to which they were entitled, because of economic factors.
She also said that granting leave had helped boost morale and thus improved productivity. In one recent case, Ms. Ruderman gave an indefinite leave to an employee whose father was critically ill. ''Giving employees this sort of flexibility will come back to us 100 times,'' she said.
Estimates vary on the number of employees who might take family leave under the new law. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which has had a leave policy for years, reports that about 1 to 2 percent of its workers take maternity leave annually.
The telecommunications giant, which employs 50,000 people in New Jersey, recently expanded its family leave program to allow up to 12 months off for the birth of a child, with six to eight weeks of that time at full salary, depending on the type of delivery. Last year the company adopted a separate family leave policy similar to the new state law's provisions on caring for ailing relatives.
 
Paternity Leave Included
A spokeswoman for A.T. & T., Lynn Newman, said women make up 47 percent of the company's total work force and 36 percent of its managerial staff. ''Many are caring for young children and older relatives,'' she said. Even though men are entitled to take paternity leave at A.T. & T., Ms. Newman said, she was unable to find a single example of one doing so.
Merck & Company, the Rahway-based pharmaceutical concern, has also developed a leave policy. Women now account for 40 percent of its staff, up from 28 percent 10 years ago.
The company allows employees to choose either a leave of up to six months, at the end of which they are guaranteed their old jobs, or a leave of as long as 18 months, after which they are given an equivalent position in terms of pay and seniority. Art Strohmer, the director of executive staffing, said that Merck had not adopted a specific policy addressing leave to care for an ailing relative but that the company supported the idea.
''We feel this kind of response is necessary because of the changing work force,'' Mr. Strohmer said. It is not too difficult for a company like Merck, with 5,500 workers, to absorb the cost of family leave policies, he said.
 
Attrition Rate Reduced
Indeed, with the pool of workers shrinking, many employers find that better benefits often attract more talented workers and reduce their attrition rate. For example, Johnson & Johnson has created a broad program called ''Balancing Work and Family'' that goes beyond the standards set in the new law. The health-care products company now allows one year of family care leave, which had been limited to care for a newborn, and has expanded the policy to cover family illnesses.
The company also set up a training program to help managers deal with employees' family needs, and recently opened a day-care center at its New Brunswick headquarters.
While it is too early to measure the economic impact of the law, employers in four states with similar laws - Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Rhode Island - have adapted well, concluded a study performed by the Families and Work Institute.
''We found that the law has had a neutral effect,'' said Michele Lord, senior research associate at the institute.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Remembrance': Love And Politics in Ireland

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
Its opening on Thursday at the Stamford Theater Works signaled what the theater's artistic director, Steve Karp, and the executive director of the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan, Nye Heron, said is the producing wave of the future.
The Stamford engagement is an example of cost sharing by two theaters - and the chance for local theatergoers to preview a play that is to move on Sept. 28, with cast and scenery intact, to the Irish Arts Center, an Off Broadway theater on West 51st Street. The center's artistic head is Jim Sheridan, who directed the film ''My Left Foot.''
Mr. Karp recalled his discovery of the play: ''I went to see 'Away Alone,' a hit at the Irish Arts Center, last spring and was so taken with it, I asked to meet its director, Terence Lamude, who said, 'I have another play I've been wanting to do.' And this was the one. I read it and loved it a lot. It's about how love comes out of mourning -and the families can't take it, like the Capulets and the Montagues.'' 
At the same time, the play came to the attention of Mr. Heron, who did not love it a lot when he read it but changed his mind when he attended a staged reading, in which Malachy McCourt had the part of the widower, the role he is playing in the Stamford and Off Broadway productions.
''So we had two theaters that wanted to do the same play - separately and simultaneously,'' Mr. Heron said. ''Doing it this way makes it easier to do the plays you want to do - and more economical. Off Broadway costs keep going up, and we're saving one-third, which includes the set and the rehearsal period.''

In its second full professional season, the Stamford company may be rapidly achieving the cachet of New York visibility. ''Rumors in the Palace,'' a comedy by Enid Rudd that had its premiere in Stamford in February, has been announced for an Off Broadway production this season.
''We want provocative and entertaining plays,'' Mr. Karp said, ''that speak to our audiences and that we can do in our modest circumstances. But we're also interested in taking risks.'' And ''Remembrance'' - the title refers to ''the name of the day reserved in Ireland for commemorating the war dead, like Memorial Day here,'' Mr. Lamude explained - may be provocative, indeed.
''Except for the animosity between the Catholics and the Protestants,'' he said, ''you don't have to know the specifics of the troubles in Belfast - a city of hate in economic collapse, with strict boundaries - to get the play. It's about how prejudice can tear love apart, and it mirrors other situations with universal themes.''
Mr. Lamude continued: ''After directing 'Taming of the Shrew,' I love to stage love scenes between older people. They're pure and tender and wise. And they revert to the youngish awkwardness common to all who fall in love.''

HEADLINE: Queens and Nassau Vie For New F.A.A. Base

BYLINE: By ELLEN MITCHELL

 BODY:
But once Queens politicians and business leaders learned that the F.A.A., which has 600 employees and an annual payroll of $30 million, was planning to move to Nassau in this time of lagging economy, the turf battle began in earnest.
The Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, let it be known that she would not sit by quietly and allow the agency to desert Queens.
''We have the airports and we feel we deserve their building if we are going to put up with the noise and pollution,'' she said.
Citing the proximity to Kennedy and La Guardia Airports and the availability of mass transit, the Borough President offered the agency free use of two city-owned parcels in Jamaica, Queens. Both sites - one at Parsons Boulevard and 160th Street, the other at Jamaica Avenue and 153d Street - are parking lots. 
Representatives Gary L. Ackerman, Democrat of Queens, and Susan Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, vowed to intercede in Washington to stop the exodus. Both are members of the Public Works Committee, which must decide on the relocation proposal.
 
'Roadblock' Has Been Set Up
''We've got the roadblock set up down the trail,'' said Representative Ackerman. ''I have an understanding with the chairman,'' [Douglas H. Boscoe, Democrat of California]. ''It will not pass. I suggest they redraw it now.
''This is no time to send a message that the Federal Government is abandoning the City of New York,'' Mr. Ackerman said. ''Losing 600 jobs doesn't mean the town is going to go bankrupt, but when you have the symbolism of flight, it picks up and then you're talking big numbers.
''We have 30,000 to 40,000 Federal employees in the New York area. If you're talking, let's move them to the suburbs, it becomes a real psychological game and a huge dollar drain.''
Michael A. LoGrande, former executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, led the charge to move the agency's headquarters to Nassau. He called it ''an economic air strike into Queens.''
Supporting the builders' group are the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and the Hempstead Presiding Supervisor, Joseph N. Mondello.
Mr. Gulotta calls Nassau ''the place to be.'' He suggested that Mitchel Field might be ideal. ''We're talking of several million dollars a year of business in the area surrounding a new F.A.A. facility,'' he said.
Mr. Mondello urged commercial realtors in Nassau County to pepper the General Services Administration for applications. ''The G.S.A. should take advantage of the ruthlessly competitive real-estate market on the Island,'' he said.
 
Runway Approaches Cited
Mr. LoGrande reminded Borough President Shulman that ''the most active runway approaches are in Nassau.''
Those lobbying for a Nassau relocation suggest that it would be safer to put the administrative offices close to Tracon, which handles the complex routing of much of the Northeast's commercial air traffic.
They suggest that such proximity would ease stress and tension for the employees, and bolster the well-being of passengers, even though the administrative offices are involved in the more-mundane pursuits of communication, weather monitoring and paperwork.
Echoing the sentiments of the Nassau contingent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said that the move should be based on ''the greatest safety for the people in the skies - not on political muscle.''
That and similar statements from Mr. D'Amato, who earlier indicated to Mrs. Shulman's office that he was making the interests of his Queens constituents known to Federal officials, would seem to put the Senator squarely on the border between the two counties.
Representative Ackerman called the public-safety argument ''a bald-faced lie.''
''In this day of modern communications,'' he said, ''there is no reason for the administrative offices to sit near the radar.''
 
Commuting a Problem
Mr. Ackerman said the reason the F.A.A. wanted to move to Nassau County was because its employees live there. ''They want to move the mountain to Mohammed, and they're involved with Mr. D'Amato, who also lives in the neighborhood,'' the Congressman said.
Martin Happes, union representative for the Professional Airway Systems Specialists, who works at Kennedy, conceded that the commute to work was one of the reasons his members want to move.
''Traffic congestion is a real problem,'' Mr. Happes said. ''My people would like anything east of the Cross Island Parkway.''
About 40 percent of the workers at Kennedy live in Nassau and Suffolk, 50 percent in New York City, most of them in Queens and the rest in New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester. The majority drive to work.
Mr. Happes called the worst stretch of the commute the Belt Parkway from the Cross Island Parkway to Kennedy, a four-mile stretch that can take a half-hour to drive.
Kathleen Bergen, regional manager of public affairs for the F.A.A., who also works at Kennedy, worries that adding a computer might overload the antiquated electrical system. ''We're already having blackouts,'' she said, adding: ''We've been in this building over 40 years. It's inadequate in terms of space and the power system. There's not enough heat or enough air-conditioning and it doesn't meet the city's fire and public-safety codes.''
 
Fair Bidding Process Urged
While the debate continues on the local front, the real decision is to be made in Washington. Representatives Ackerman and Molinari are ready for a showdown. Senator D'Amato said he would not stand for anything less than a fair and competitive bidding process to obtain the best site.
''Let the chips fall where they may,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''Otherwise, it's dangerous.''
Mr. LoGrande's group is pushing for an open bidding process. He said Nassau County would win in that case.
''If we allow Congressman Ackerman to hold the F.A.A. hostage to back-room deals and good-old-boy agreements, we will have a lot to answer for if the F.A.A. system begins to fray,'' Mr. LoGrande said.
The General Services Administration is waiting for further direction. William Matthews, regional director for the agency's real-estate division, said the sensitivities of everyone involved are somewhat unusual.
''Ninety-nine percent of the time there's no controversy,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''That only happens when you cross somebody's political jurisdiction.''
Mr. Happes said that if the administrative offices were not moved east, there would have to be negotiations with the unions, and the employees would have to be accommodated in some other way.
''Right now, it's a matter of how the politicians play their politics to help one another out,'' he said. ''It's one of those 'I wash your back, you wash mine' kind of things.
''We're in limbo here. We ask for new furniture, but they say its been appropriated for the new building.
''I say, 'Should I save my empty cartons to pack my desk?' They tell me to put them on the side someplace. Eventually, I'm going to need them.''

HEADLINE: THE VIEW FROM: BRIDGEPORT'S FOREIGN TRADE ZONE;
'The Perfect Incubator For Smaller Companies'

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
''I'm giving it a shot,'' Mr. Megna said. ''I'm not 100 percent convinced yet, but I'm willing to come in based on the idea. It's definitely the right idea.''
Another tenant, E&S Imports of Westport, will soon move its headquarters into the zone, which is between Barnum Avenue and Arctic Street. E&S sells fireplace mantels from England, handcarved from mahogany, oak and other fine woods.
''The advantage for us is we don't have to pay the duty until it's sold,'' said Ellen Sloan, managing director and a partner in E&S. 
She said the company paid almost $1,700 in tariffs on its first shipment of 152 mantels, a cost the fledgling company could ill afford. ''I'm doing everything on a shoestring at the moment,'' Ms. Sloan said. The city received notice in late August that the trade zone will be approved, and it is waiting only for an activation order to begin international trade at the zone. The Bridgeport foreign trade zone could become the first in the state later this month or in early October, said Paul V. Joslin, vice president for operations and a partner in the Bridgeport Foreign Trade Zone Development Corporation, the company hired by the city to manage the zone.
Another foreign trade zone in New Haven should begin about the same time, or shortly afterward, and a third zone is planned in Windsor Locks, at Bradley International Airport.
''The situation we're creating will be particularly attractive to smaller companies that are just starting to get into the import-export business,'' Mr. Joslin said. ''The big guys all know how to handle foreign trade, and don't need the kind of services offered by a foreign trade zone, but this will be the perfect incubator for smaller companies.''
''We have more people interested in the zone than we have space,'' said Edward R. Lavernoich, Bridgeport's economic development planner. ''As soon as we have approval to start, we've going to have to apply for an immediate expansion.''
Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, said a survey of their 1,400 members revealed between 20 and 25 percent involved in international trade in some way, so the trade zone will be important to existing businesses.
''But it will also serve as an enticement for other businesses to move into Bridgeport,'' Mr. Timpanelli said. ''It gives us a new lure to bring businesses in.''
Mr. Timpanelli said Bridgeport's only hope of overcoming its budget woes, including a $60 million deficit last year that was covered with state bonds, is to build its tax base.
''The foreign trade zone is going to be an asset to the city, and an integral part of our efforts to put together an economic development plan,'' Mr. Timpanelli said.
Mr. Lavernoich said the city won authorization for a foreign trade zone in March 1982, and it was going to be in a new $750,000 building in the west end of Bridgeport.
But demand was too low to justify the expense, and the idea languished. The proposed site was instead developed as a marina that has been very successful.
Then in 1986 the city started to get inquiries about the zone from companies involved in international trade, and in late 1987 it began looking for a new site.
Mr. Lavernoich said Bridgeport settled on the former Remington Arms factory, about 1 million square feet of industrial space that is largely vacant. The new owner of the site, Remgrit Realty, uses some of the space to manufacture saw blades, and agreed to lease the rest for the foreign trade zone.
Since then, he said, the city has been satisfying the requirements of the Customs Service, mostly documenting demand for the zone, and demonstrating that security is adequate to make sure duty-free goods are not smuggled into the country.
''This is going to mean investment in the city, the creation of jobs here,'' Mr. Lavernoich said.
There are also several benefits for manufacturers and importers. For instance, a company importing something that has a quota could still buy when the price is low, store it in the warehouses in the trade zone and bring it in when the next quota period opens.
A company could also combine foreign and domestic parts, and if most of the value of the product was from the domestic parts, there would be no duty.
If a company was importing something with a high defect rate, the product could be screened in the warehouse and the defective pieces destroyed before the duty was paid.
Or, if a company was exporting a product that has some foreign parts, the parts could be shipped to the warehouse, assembled, then exported without paying duty. ''A lot of companies will get a competitive advantage in some way through the foreign trade zone,'' Mr. Lavernoich said.
''We didn't have the expertise to do this ourselves, though,'' Mr. Lavernoich said. ''You need people who understand sophisticated accounting methods, as they pertain to Customs.'' That's where Mr. Joslin's firm came in. The company is a partnership between Mr. Joslin, who has experience in international trade financing and business development, William Hooton, the president of the company, whose experience is in warehousing and distribution, and who is in Turkey on a trade mission, and Remgrit, the owners of the building.
Mr. Joslin said that at first 50,000 square feet would be authorized by Customs, but most of that space will be quickly committed.
''We'll need an immediate expansion, probably to 200,000 square feet,'' Mr. Joslin said. ''Eventually, we'd like to get the entire one-million-square-foot facility designated as a foreign trade zone.''
Mr. Joslin said a trade zone is particularly suited for an aging industrial center like Bridgeport.
''We're not the prettiest place in the world, so we don't get the best press. When we're on the 6 o'clock news it's usually negative,'' Mr. Joslin said. ''But we do have a strong industrial base, access to a good labor force, and access to the highways.''
''The message we have to get across is that Bridgeport is a place where you can get the job done,'' Mr. Joslin said.
Mr. Megna, the trade zone's earliest tenant, said that while none of the companies there are likely to make a significant difference in Bridgeport's economy individually, collectively they will have an impact.
''We're not a big company, we're not going to hire 50 or 60 employees, but even the 10 we will be hiring is going to help,'' Mr. Megna said.
Mr. Megna said an example of the type of product where savings would be greatest is the company's canvas toy box. The toy box has a wood frame made in the Orient, but the canvas is manufactured in North Carolina, where he can obtain it for about the same price as in Taiwan because the shipping costs are lower and there are no duties.
By assembling the toy box in Bridgeport, he would avoid a 7.2 percent tariff on the canvas (which he previously bought in Asia), buy American-made goods, and create local jobs.
Mr. Megna said in addition to the toy box and the Aqua Lab, marketed under the company's ''Dr. Frank's'' label, he is investigating whether other products might benefit from using the trade zone.
For instance, he markets a porch and patio chair made of canvas with a metal-rod frame. The frame is less costly when made in Korea, but is more expensive than the canvas.
If the frame and canvas were shipped to Bridgeport for packaging, the cost of the canvas, box, and handling, however, might exceed the price of the frame, so he would avoid duty.
Another advantage, Mr. Megna said, is that assembling the product here with mostly American parts would enable him to label it, ''Made in the U.S.A.,'' and some catalogue sales operations now carry almost exclusively items with that label.
The trade zone could also enhance local economic development efforts by giving importing companies a foothold.
Ms. Sloan said she sees a market for English mantelpieces after touring a few upscale houses in the area. ''I don't know how to say this diplomatically, but the mantels you've got over here are just terrible,'' she said.
But the oak, pine and other wood that is carved in England is largely grown in the United States and Canada, Ms. Sloan pointed out, ''and if this takes off, I'd like to even manufacture them over here.''

HEADLINE: Hospitals Defending Increases in Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
''They're asking for too much,'' said Joseph C. Mike, an analyst of health-care costs hired by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. The group has been granted the right to participate in the budget process this year, because businesses typically pick up the bulk of health-care costs through employee benefit plans.
''It's imperative, if we're going to have an impact on the budgets, that we be involved in those hearings,'' Mr. Mike said. ''Otherwise, we're handcuffed when the budget request comes along, because you have to pay for the programs that have been approved.'' 
The volume of patients at the hospitals ''is not increasing that dramatically, and the complexity of cases is not changing that much,'' Mr. Mike said. ''We see no reason hospitals shouldn't be coming in with single-digit increases in their budget requests.''
The administrative officer for the cost commission, Marcia E. Schonberger, said hearings on the hospital budgets should be completed by Sept. 30. ''The applications are for the most part complete,'' she said.
 
Changes From Legislature
If the commission can stick to its schedule, this will be the first time in three years that a majority of hospitals in the state will begin their fiscal years with approved budgets. In previous years, legislative changes in the rate-setting formulas complicated and delayed the budget-review process, and some hospitals had to go halfway through the fiscal year operating on interim budgets, which were often inadequate.
But Ms. Schonberger said the commission has not begun any analysis of the budget requests to determine if the huge increases cited by the business association are accurate. Hospitals contend that some of the figures cited by the group are misleading.
At Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, in New London, the business association said, the requested gross-revenue increase from 1990 to 1991 is 23.4 percent. But the hospital's chief financial officer, Elwin Bresette, said the steep increase reflects a continuing rise in the number of patients. Also, he said, the hospital will complete its new outpatient-care building this year, and the project's costs will be phased into the budget next year.
''Our gross patient revenues are up, because our volume is up,'' Mr. Bresette said. ''But so are our expenses for caring for more patients.''
Mr. Mike said he foresees most of this year's conflict on hospital costs focusing on the hospitals' projections regarding Medicare and Medicaid.
Connecticut law allows hospital rates to make up the difference between the cost of serving Medicare and Medicaid patients and the reimbursement under the programs. Some hospitals have estimated the cost of providing service under the programs will rise by several million dollars, while their reimbursements will rise by less than $1 million.
''There is no justification for those kinds of projections,'' Mr. Mike said.
Hospitals and their critics agree that cost-containment pressures are likely to curb the number of services offered. Last month, for example, Danbury Hospital was denied permission to perform open-heart surgery. Such permission has been denied in the past by the commission because other hospitals in the state already offer the expensive surgery.
''The issue that's immediately on the horizon is not what new services will be offered but the possibility of having to discontinue existing services, and, a few steps down that road, the possibility of having to close a hospital,'' Mr. Pattis said. ''If the cost-containment pressures are screwed up to an unreasonable pitch, the time will come when hospitals will have to ask themselves whether they can afford to treat all classes of patients.''
Under a rate-setting process initiated last year, a hospital does not have to go through a full budget review if its requested increase is deemed reasonable, based on inflation. Last year, the increase determined to be reasonable for gross revenues was 13.5 percent; the ultimate increase granted the state's 35 hospitals was about 14 percent.
''Considering that the law deemed 13.5 percent to be reasonable, with 14 percent, we were very nearly on target,'' Mr. Pattis said. He said that this year, gross revenues will be negotiated individually, but the net revenue increase presumed reasonable by the cost commission is 7.5 percent, based on an inflation rate for the Northeast of 5.5 percent.
By the hospital group's reckoning, about half of the hospitals will meet that test and undergo a limited budget review, Mr. Pattis said. But Mr. Mike said most of the 35 hospitals will have to go through a time-consuming full budget review, so many could find themselves starting another fiscal year with an interim budget.
Mr. Mike said that if a 7.5 percent net revenue increase is considered reasonable, rises in gross revenues will probably be limited to about 11.5 percent, and only 10 hospitals meet that test. At least 23 hospitals have requested gross revenue increases larger than 11.5 percent, he said, including 8 that have sought increases larger than 20 percent. Two hospitals submitted their budgets too recently for analysis, he said.
James R. Rude, director of financial services at the Hospital of St. Raphael, in New Haven, said the statistics used by the business group are misleading. At his hospital, he said, while the requested increase in gross revenues for 1991 is 31.4 percent, the highest in the state, that figure includes increases in patient volume. The actual increase to the hospital's list of charges is only 24.3 percent, he said.
The figures also reflect a heavier Medicaid and Medicare case mix, Mr. Rude said. Those patients make up 49 percent of the volume in 1991's estimates, up from 45 percent this year, he said, and the case complexity is rising as well. The hospital's net revenue increase - after shortfalls in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are paid - amounts to 9.8 percent, Mr. Rude said.

HEADLINE: New South Has New Face for Black Tourists

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., Sept. 5

 BODY:

 
'Timing Is Just Right'
''Ten years ago you could not have done this; now the timing is just right,'' said Francis Smiley, the black heritage coordinator for the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel, whose 1983 brochure was Alabama's first statewide effort to market black history. ''It's an image builder, a recognition of the way the South has changed. And it reflects a new awareness that there's a black travel market that in the past has been totally overlooked. We're trying to say, 'Yes, we have Southern belles, but we're a lot more diverse than that.' ''
That brochure was aimed at luring back for visits the blacks who had left Alabama. It was such a hit that it is now in its third version with 180,000 copies in print and has grown into a slick 30-page booklet listing 163 attractions from the Freedom Quilting Bee organized by black women in Alberta to AfricaTown U.S.A. State Park northeast of Mobile.
Increasingly, other states and organizations in the South are trying to follow the same approach. John Horhn, a black man who is Mississippi's director of tourism, said the black travel market is worth $15 billion a year. Officials in his state are working to document the state's black history much as Alabama has done. Georgia and South Carolina already have put together listings of black historical sites, and Tennessee is planning one. 
 
'Blacks Are Half the History'
Civil rights memorials are being built and promoted by tourism officials in Birmingham, across the street from the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where four black children were killed in a 1963 church bombing, and in Memphis, at the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. King was killed in 1968.
And some private tourism groups are seeing the same opportunities. David A. Farrow, who runs a company that conducts walking tours of Charleston, S.C., said he is working to put together such a tour oriented toward black history.
''Blacks are half the history of the South,'' Mr. Farrow said, ''and often that part has not been recognized.''
The changes partly reflect the racial evolution in the South. ''Let's face it,'' said Lisa Shivers, director of the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel. ''It's good for Alabama's image to promote its black history.''
But the changes also reflect the economic importance of blacks to the region, which is home to half the nation's black population and where most blacks have roots.
Mississippi has the sort of civil rights history and black heritage that make it singularly well equipped to tap the black travel market, said Mr. Horhn, the state tourism official.
Thirty-six percent of Mississippi's population is black, the nation's highest, which provides a lucrative pool for intrastate travel. Moreover, ''we are part of the cradle of African-American society in this country, and so many blacks have roots in Mississippi, the potential market is there to attract those so-called expatriates,'' Mr. Horhn said.
 
Coming Back in Style
The sheer numbers, combined with the increasing popularity of black family reunions has produced a particularly lucrative market, he said.
''Often it's important for those former Mississippians who have gone up north to show their relatives who are still here that, yes, they have made it,'' Mr. Horhn said. ''So they come back in style. They rent the biggest town car they can find. They stay in the finest hotel in town. There's tremendous economic potential there.''
The new awareness is benefiting historical sites that were part of the civil rights movement and those that predate it. Thus, in 1985, the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site, with its landmarks and museum marking the contributions of Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver, had 60,207 visitors by the end of August, its officials said. This year, it has had 275,724 for the same period.
''There's more awareness that we're here and a lot more interest in black history than there used to be,'' said Christine L. Biggers, a ranger with the National Park Service at the historic site.
Similarly, the black churches that were central to the civil rights movement are now actively promoted as tourist sites by state and local officials.
The Rev. Christopher Hamlin, pastor of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, said most of the tour groups that come to the church are referred by the local convention bureau. In addition, city officials or the Mayor have been available to speak to tour groups or conventions on the history of the church and its role in the civil rights turmoil, he said.
 
Momentum Is Growing
At the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church in Montgomery, which became the focal point for blacks while Dr. King was helping organize the city bus boycott in 1955, the number of visitors has increased from 8,000 last year to what is likely to be more than 10,000 this year, said Addre Bryant Sr., presiding deacon.
''It looks like each year the momentum continues to grow,'' he said, ''especially because the state has sent this out on their stationary when they advertise sights in Alabama.''
At the Dexter Avenue church and most of the other black-oriented attractions, the majority of the visitors are black, many of them native Southerners who have left the region.
Ceaser Patterson lived in Montgomery in the civil rights era and has since moved to Seattle. But he said that for many blacks who have left the South there is enormous interest in seeing how much the region has changed and in showing family members what things were like in the days of segregation.
''If you forget history, then you will repeat it,'' said Mr. Patterson, who was showing the Dexter Avenue church to his wife, Vera, a native of the Pacific Northwest.
But many visitors are whites interested in seeing sites that are part of Southern history.
 
Commitment Is Incomplete
Still, much of that history is still painful to many people, and in some places the commitment to acknowledging it is incomplete.
For instance, the most popular stop for tourists here in Montgomery has become the civil rights memorial in front of the offices of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Yet officials with the center say they have been frustrated in getting the state to put up highway signs directing motorists to it.
State highway officials say Federal sign requirements make it impossible. But Morris Dees, director of the center, suggests that the problem is more political than bureaucratic, noting that there are signs for other attractions and that Gov. Guy Hunt, a conservative Republican, turned down an invitation to participate in the unveiling of the civil rights memorial.
''He doesn't want to do anything to alienate what he sees as his electorate,'' Mr. Dees said. ''Sometimes this sort of thing is easier to promote out of state than in state.''
Still, if there is ample evidence that the South, like the rest of the nation, has not solved all its racial problems, the degree to which states are acknowledging their black heritage is a potent sign of how far the region has come.
''People want to see history,'' Ms. Shivers said, ''and the civil rights movement is part of history, and it happened here. If you want to see the Edmund Pettus Bridge, you have to go to Selma, Ala., to see it.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf: Decoding the Signals;
The Superpowers Affirm Their Joint Aims But Iraq Could Focus on Their Differences

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Sept. 9

 BODY:
But at their joint news conference, when the two Presidents were left to speak spontaneously, it appeared that on many questions about how to deal with Iraq, including whether to link a settlement of the gulf crisis to a settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli dispute and whether Soviet military or naval units should also join the multinational forces in the gulf, there were significant differences.
Both leaders sought to play down those differences, insisting that they should not obscure the larger agreement. As Mr. Gorbachev remarked, there is now a ''solidarity'' for dealing with Iraqi aggression ''which has never been expressed before in the history of the world.''
But the long-term question is not how Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush put their agreements and differences into perspective, but rather how Mr. Hussein and the Arab world interpret them. 
Administration officials say the President wanted this meeting precisely in order to send the Iraqi leader an unambiguous message that Mr. Hussein cannot pose as the defender of the Arab nation against American ''imperialism.''
Rather, the message was to say, he faces a global coalition led by both his former patrons - the Soviets - and the Americans. This message, in turn, was meant both to embolden Arab nations like Egypt that have stood up to Iraq and to signal those who have wavered that they cannot count on an American-Soviet dispute to justify not choosing sides.
Will the Iraqi leader now be more impressed by the general agreement underlined by the communique, or will he find succor in the stated differences?
Will Arab leaders now fall more firmly in line against Baghdad, in light of today's message, or will they worry that the cracks apparent in the American-Soviet entente portend trouble, and so decide that they should be cautious in their commitments?
 
Unity on Isolating Baghdad
From the American and Soviet perspectives, the differences exhibited today between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were mostly hypothetical. They dealt with issues like whether military force should be used if sanctions fail, and whether a settlement in the gulf should be linked to an Arab-Israeli settlement.
None of these differences, though, diminishes Mr. Hussein's real and immediate problem: how to break out of the international boycott and isolation. The maintenance of those two pressures, on which there are no differences between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, is Mr. Hussein's biggest problem. In that sense, he cannot be wildly pleased with what he heard today.
This is especially true if one considers that Mr. Gorbachev, whatever his differences, has now committed his personal prestige to see that the United Nations sanctions produce an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. Not only should this make future cooperation between himself and Mr. Bush easier, but it will also send a message to the Europeans to stand firm.
 
Revolutionary Agreement
Considering that Middle Eastern wars have historically been triggers for American-Soviet confrontation, and considering that a decade ago the Soviet Union would almost certainly have supported the invasion by its ally, Iraq, and scuttled international efforts to reverse it, the Bush-Gorbachev agreement on the core issues of how to deal with the Iraqi invasion marks nothing less than a revolution.
Mr. Bush said, ''Differences still remain, but the common ground, in my view, surges ahead of these differences.''
Still, theoretical or not, it would be dangerous to underestimate those differences.
Saddam Hussein is not a person who history would suggest is going to be impressed with words alone, or even sanctions. Therefore, it is significant that the most apparent difference between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev was over the question of using military force to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. The final communique states that ''we are determined to see this aggression end, and if the current steps fail to end it, we are prepared to consider additional ones consistent with the U.N. charter.''
President Bush and Mr. Baker indicated that they considered this language a signal that military force was still an option, although they would prefer a diplomatic solution. But when Mr. Gorbachev was asked if military force might be necessary if the Iraqis do not pull out, he responded: ''I did not state that. I do not state that. And moreover, in my view, that would draw us into consequences which we can't at this stage forecast.''
 
Little Leeway on Military
Those are not words that suggest that the Administration has much leeway in using a military option.
Another troubling difference was over the question of paid Soviet military advisers in Iraq. Mr. Bush said that he had asked Mr. Gorbachev to remove the advisers, and Mr. Gorbachev said that he had refused, although he said the number was being reduced as the contracts expire.
Mr. Bush said that he did not ask Mr. Gorbachev to send troops to Saudi Arabia or contribute to the naval blockade, and when the Soviet leader was asked whether he would do either he answered curtly: ''I don't see the point of doing that now.''
To be sure, because of the Afghanistan experience, Mr. Gorbachev faces more domestic resistance to sending forces than Mr. Bush does. But that does not explain why the Soviet leader cannot bring his military advisers home or contribute even a minesweeper to the United Nations blockade.
Not only will that refusal encourage the Iraqis to believe that they can break the blockade, it will send a bad signal to the Arab states still contemplating sending forces and, most seriously, it could portend American-Soviet problems.
If there is a common denominator behind these differences, it is the fact that for all the talk of cooperation today between Moscow and the United States - and it is both real and significant - it cannot mask the fact that the two are still engaged in a global competition for economic and political influence. It is no longer the ideologically driven crusade of the Cold War, but competition it is.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BUSH AND GORBACHEV SAY IRAQIS MUST OBEY U.N. AND QUIT KUWAIT

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Sept. 9

 BODY:

 
Differences on Many Specifics
During an hourlong news conference, however, the two leaders often diverged on how to pursue the campaign against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. [The text of the joint statement and a transcript of the Bush-Gorbachev news conference are on pages A7 to A9.] Differences emerged over the possible use of military force, over Soviet participation in policing the embargo, over the linkage of Iraq's aggression with other Middle East conflicts, over the Arab role as possible brokers of a compromise, and over the presence of Soviet military experts in Iraq.
The meeting, the first the two leaders had held during a time of world crisis, seemed to underscore the new international situation created by the improved relations between Moscow and Washington.
 
Peril of 1967
Mr. Gorbachev alluded to this in an interview over Moscow television after the meeting had ended. He said that during the Middle East war in 1967, the United States and the Soviet Union ''were on the brink of war'' because they supported different sides in the conflict between Israel and the Arab nations of Egypt, Syria and Jordan. 
Mr. Bush, speaking to reporters on his flight back to Washington tonight, said he ''couldn't be more pleased'' by his talks with Mr. Gorbachev and the ''clear signal'' they sent to President Hussein.
Senior Administration officials insisted that Mr. Bush was satisfied that the meeting had served its main purpose - dispelling any doubts that Moscow and Washington are united in their resolve to force Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait.
They said this signal of active Soviet-American political cooperation, and not a list of concrete measures to be employed against Mr. Hussein, was the original purpose of the meeting.
In their joint statement, the two leaders agreed that the economic embargo against Iraq could be softened to allow the delivery of food under supervision of international aid organizations.
With several countries now proposing to ship such humanitarian aid to Iraq, Administration officials said they had sought the language to make sure that any food airlift was narrowly targeted and closely monitored.
 
No 'Wholesale Food Shipments'
''I hope that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq,'' Mr. Bush said tonight.
Bantering with reporters after the news conference, Mr. Bush reported that he had accepted Mr. Gorbachev's invitation to visit Moscow, possibly before the end of this year.
The gulf crisis dominated the one-day working meeting, consuming almost all three hours of a private meeting between the two Presidents in the morning and most of an afternoon session with an expanded group of advisers.
Although White House officials had said in advance that Mr. Bush would seek some measure of Soviet military participation in the international stand against Iraq, the two leaders said they did not discuss military options or the introduction of Soviet land forces into the region.
''I did not ask him to send troops in,'' Mr. Bush said. ''If the Soviets decided to do that at the invitation of the Saudis, that would be fine with us. But I did not ask him to do that.''
 
Terseness on Soviet Forces
Mr. Gorbachev, who would face strong popular resistance at home to deploying forces in the Persian Gulf, said the Soviet Union was not considering even a lesser role like helping to police the economic embargo.
''I don't see the point of doing that now,'' Mr. Gorbachev said.
''I'm not disappointed in that answer,'' Mr. Bush added.
A senior Administration official said later that the Soviets had made clear that even a minor role, such as integrating Soviet warships into the armada now enforcing sanctions, would be ''very difficult for them'' unless the operation were put under United Nations command. The United States has resisted submitting its own armed forces to the control of the United Nations.
While Mr. Bush has always deliberately left military force open as an explicit threat, Mr. Gorbachev has never endorsed force in the crisis.
 
Gorbachev Is Explicit
When a reporter suggested tonight that the joint statement opened the way to the use of force, Mr. Gorbachev quickly distanced himself from that option, saying: ''I did not say that if Iraq does not withdraw peacefully, we are going to have recourse to military methods. I did not state that. I do not state that. And moreover, in my view, that would draw us into consequences which we cannot at this stage forecast.''
Mr. Bush conceded later, ''We may have a difference on that.''
Pressed repeatedly during the news conference to identify steps that might be taken against Iraq if the embargo fails, the two leaders declined to speculate.
''We didn't agree to specific and concrete steps,'' Mr. Bush said.
A senior Administration official said later that the Soviets are ''not on board yet with the use of force.''
''But the mere fact that we have a joint statement that doesn't rule it out as an option and that says additional measures will be considered, I think, moves the position even of the Soviet Union forward,'' the official said.
 
Assurance of U.S. Departure
Mr. Bush said he had assured the Soviets that the American troops in Saudi Arabia would leave after the crisis is over.
''They will be present in the area until we are satisfied that the security needs of the area have been met and that these resolutions have been complied with,'' the President said of the troops. ''And the sooner they are out of there, as far as I'm concerned, the better.''
Mr. Gorbachev called this ''a very iimportant statement.''
Although the Soviet President had said he understood and accepted the dispatch of American forces to Saudi Arabia, the grouping of tens of thousands of American troops a few hundred miles from the Soviet border had prompted complaints from the Soviet military and some members of Parliament.
The clearest disagreement between the two men came over the value of holding an international conference to discuss the gulf crisis and then move on to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the civil war in Lebanon.
 
Division Over Mideast Linkage
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has promoted the idea in recent days as a way to make it easier for other Arab countries to remain united against Iraq, and as a possible cover for Mr. Hussein to withdraw his troops.
The United States argues that equating Iraq's invasion with the Palestinian issue would play into the hands of Mr. Hussein.
''The thing that I feel strongly about is that these issues are not linked,'' Mr. Bush said tonight. ''And any effort to link them is an effort to dilute the resolutions of the United Nations.''
But Mr. Gorbachev said later that he considered the gulf crisis and other disputes in the Middle East of ''equal concern.''
Mr. Gorbachev will apparently not take home any tangible commitment for American economic assistance. During their afternoon meeting, Mr. Gorbachev described his plans to move the Soviet Union toward a market-oriented economy, and Mr. Bush reiterated his willingness to give American technological help.
''I think this remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated by the Soviet Union at the United Nations gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation in ther economic field as possible,'' the American President said.
 
No Quid Pro Quo, Soviets Insist
Mr. Gorbachev, however, quickly interjected that Soviet cooperation in the gulf crisis was not tied to economic aid.
''It would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet Union could be bought for dollars,'' the Soviet leader said.
An Administration official said the two men talked briefly about the lagging pace of arms negotiations aimed at cutting nuclear arsenals and reducing conventionial forces in Europe.
Although Mr. Bush said he was ''still hopeful'' that both agreements could be signed by the end of the year, Mr. Shevardnadze told reporters later that prospects for a nuclear weapons treaty this year were slim.
''This year it will probably not come off,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK SCHOOLS OPEN, FACING TEST: DO MORE WITH LESS

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:

 
Full Test for Chancellor
The city's 120 high schools opened Thursday and Friday, but today is the first full day of school for the entire system. And with the new term, 82 of the city's 984 schools begin a dramatic experiment in power sharing among principals, teachers and parents. A new ''professional development'' program starts, with the aim of helping ineffective principals improve their leadership talents. Mr. Fernandez said three principals had enrolled voluntarily in the program and a dozen others were being scrutinized for enrollment.
The Board of Examiners, long criticized for impeding the recruitment of teachers, is being replaced in a few months by a new testing office directly under Mr. Fernandez's control. A new agency for investigating corruption among school officials independently of the Board of Education is about to be put in place. 
As a result of these seismic shifts, the year will present the first full test for Mr. Fernandez, who came to the city showered with praise for the job he had done leading the Miami area's school system and who is still grappling with gaining control over a far larger system, where power is divided between his office and 32 local boards.
The schools expect to welcome 945,000 students, about 6,500 more than last year. With little money to hire extra teachers, the fatter enrollment will likely mean more crowded classrooms.
And with New York City's economy at near-recession sluggishness, negotiators are far apart on a teachers' salary agreement. Both sides have expressed concern about what a low wage settlement would mean to the ability to attract qualified teachers.
Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, goes so far as to argue that the problems of the city today stem from school cuts in the 1970's.
''Look at the kids who are assailants in the subways,'' she said. ''These are kids from every ethnic group who are out there without any values, who will kill a tourist to go to Roseland. They were in our early childhood classes in 1975 when there were horrendous cuts in the schools. We lost a whole generation of kids as a result of that and we've just begun to build back.''
There is also concern about the current pupils themselves. More than 60 percent come from homes where there is a single parent. While many of those children are outstanding pupils, educators also worry that many are coming from shaky homes, where discipline may be lacking and where parents may not be paying enough attention to whether a child is attending school and striving there.
The Board of Education has learned from the city's Human Resources Administration that in 1989 there were 322,615 New York children between the age of 5 and 17 whose families were receiving welfare payments under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. That is a sharp increase from the 1988 figure of 279,939, and it suggests that one of every three children in school is on welfare. Roughly 4,200 pupils live in hotels or shelters.
 
Results of Crack Feared
Five years after crack became widely available on the city streets, the first group of children born to mothers who used the drug during pregnancy is entering kindergarten. Mr. Fernandez estimates that 5 percent of the 60,000 children in kindergarten may have been exposed to crack.
Doctors and psychologists who have worked with such children say they may display short attention spans, violent outbursts of temper, poor speech and hyperactivity.
The small special-education classes that could work with these children are already bursting at the seams, and there are long waits for evaluation and placement. The cost of educating a child in special education is $15,000, compared with $6,500 for a child in a mainstream class, officials in the Chancellor's office say.
Figures completed just last week indicate that 110,246 pupils who attended school last year have limited proficiency in English. Most are immigrants or children of immigrants.
The welter of statistics that profile this year's student body suggest that teachers and administrators will have to work with children who in general will require more guidance, smaller classes, more programs like bilingual education.
In an interview days after the killing of a Utah tourist in the subways by a gang of muggers, Mr. Fernandez said the schools also bore the ''most important responsibility'' for solving society's problems of violence, drugs and racial tensions.
''While poverty is the underlying problem in a lot of this,'' he said, ''unless we're attacking the drug problem through education, the AIDS problem through education, the violence problem through education, it's not going to resolve itself.''
But money, officials say, is lacking. After taking sharp cuts forced by the city's fiscal problems, the Board of Education ended up with a $6.4 billion budget that officials regard as threadbare; it is roughly the same as last year's, even though wages and the cost of supplies have risen.
 
State Aid Helps
A recent infusion of $22 million in state aid, the result of a 2 to 3 percentage point improvement in attendance last year, will help avert layoffs and permit the hiring of more new teachers, Mr. Fernandez said.
Community School District 1 on the Lower East Side, for example, faced the loss of 13 assistant principals until last week; now it may lose three or fewer, said Donald Singer, president of the principals' union, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators.
Still, as late as Thursday, Ms. Feldman was saying that between 200 and 300 teachers had lost jobs at the schools they worked in last year and were looking for openings at other schools.
The city also expects to hire 3,000 new teachers to take jobs vacated by 1,700 teachers who retired last year and to handle the extra classes created by higher enrollments.
Even these new recruits are not an unmixed blessing. Two-thirds, Ms. Feldman said, lack education and other courses necessary to meet requirements for state certification. In the system as a whole, 15,000 of the 65,000 teachers do not meet those requirements.
City officials, Ms. Feldman noted, have said the new budget contains money for raises of only 1.5 percent for all its workers. Teachers in nearby suburban communities, she said, have been receiving raises of 8 to 9 percent a year.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf: Reporter's Notebook;
The Two New Friends Come Smiling Through

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, Sept. 9

 BODY:
He relishes his growing partnership with Mr. Gorbachev, which he worked hard to nurture on a ship in Malta and at a horseshoe pit in Camp David, as his greatest triumph in personal diplomacy. He has proudly displayed pictures of himself and Mr. Gorbachev playing horseshoes at Camp David both on Air Force One and in the West Wing corridor.
When Mr. Gorbachev mentioned Malta and Camp David today as critical meetings that allowed the two leaders to develop trust in each other, Mr. Bush positively glowed with pride, nodding his head vigorously.
The Soviet leader said that the two would have found themselves in ''a very difficult situation'' with Eastern Europe and with Iraq if they had not moved to ''enrich our relationship.'' 
''If trust is engendered between the leaders of two such nations during meetings of this kind, that is for the good of all of us, whether we want it or not,'' Mr. Gorbachev said. ''History dictates that a lot is going to depend on whether the two countries can work together.''
Mr. Bush fervently agreed. ''Differences still remain,'' he said. ''But the common ground surges ahead of these differences.''
 
Like Old Buddies
They may have remained at odds on major issues in the Persian Gulf crisis and their meeting may have been little more than an elaborate and expensive photo opportunity intended to deter Saddam Hussein. But the personal chemistry between the superpower leaders was perceptably more affectionate and relaxed today.
When Mr. Bush's microphone failed at one point during his news conference with Mr. Gorbachev, he gave it a jab to jar it back to life.
''Hit it again,'' Mr. Gorbachev advised Mr. Bush, illustrating his Russian with a karate chop in the air.
When his own microphone faltered, the Soviet leader looked over slyly at the American President. ''Should I hit it again?'' he asked, as the two men grinned at each other in an uncommonly warm and fuzzy way.
 
A Touch of Pride . . .
The two leaders came to Helsinki with very different situations at home, and very different audiences for their summitry.
As Mr. Gorbachev sinks in the polls, Mr. Bush soars. The way Mr. Bush handles the Persian Gulf crisis will help define his Presidency and test his leadership skills.
For Mr. Gorbachev, the summit is merely a momentary distraction. There is no great domestic payoff for focusing on the crisis; the Soviet people are more interested in trying to buy bread and cigarettes than in punishing President Hussein.
If Mr. Bush was showing who he is as a leader, Mr. Gorbachev was trying to show what the Soviet Union is as a country. He was playing to an international audience, proving that he had cemented the new relationship with the United States and could be trusted by the West.
But while American officials were amazed that Mr. Gorbachev seemed more confident than ever today, given his problems, there were occasional signs that he bristles at the idea of playing a supporting player to Mr. Bush's starring role.
At one point, a pleased Mr. Bush noted that the Soviet Union's ''remarkable cooperation'' at the United Nations ''gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible.'' Mr. Gorbachev replied, with a flash of wounded superpower pride, that ''it would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet Union could be bought for dollars.''
 
. . . and a Bit of Humor
Mr. Gorbachev, who always seems buoyed by summitry no matter how abysmal his domestic problems, showed up this morning for his meeting with Mr. Bush with a humorous gift. It was a cartoon, about 11 inches by 14, intended to underscore the leaders' new relationship as partners, rather than adversaries.
The cartoon depicted Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev dressed as boxers, with a referee in the middle whose head was a globe. The referee was holding up each man's arm in the victory stance, and at their feet lay a melting and vanquished figure labeled ''Cold War'' in Russian. The caption for the cartoon, also in Russian, was ''Knockout.''
President Bush laughed when he saw the picture and exclaimed, ''That's wonderful!''
A Soviet official explained that the picture was meant to signify that ''both Presidents win - nobody loses.''
 
Cozy Together
The First Ladies acted as cozy together today as the First Husbands did.
When Mrs. Bush was the wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Gorbachev preferred her company to that of Nancy Reagan, and often requested her presence at events.
The two women grew closer during the Washington summit meeting last spring. On the helicopter ride to Camp David in the Maryland mountains, the Gorbachevs professed fascination with suburbia as they flew over the wealthy Washington suburb of Montgomery County and saw the lavish homes and swimming pools and fancy cars. Mrs. Bush patiently explained to Mrs. Gorbachev how mortgages work.
On a visit to the library at the University of Helsinki today, the two were all smiles and solicitation. Mrs. Gorbachev pointed out a rare 19th-century map of Moscow to Mrs. Bush and urged her: ''Look at this. You'll be coming to Moscow.''
The two agreed, in response to reporters' questions, that there should be a peaceful solution to the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
''People of our countries have found the language of mutual understanding,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said. Mrs. Bush looked taken aback for a moment when the Soviet First Lady's translator slipped and said, ''the language of misunderstanding,'' but he quickly corrected himself.
Mrs. Bush was asked if she and the President ever discussed the possibility that the United States may go to war in the Middle East.
''No,'' she said, adding: ''Of course, we worry about the men and women who are over there. And we worry about the children.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Consensus Behind Oratory of Iraq's Arab Foes: Crush Hussein With Military Strike

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Sept. 9

 BODY:

 
War of '3 or 4 Days'
A high-ranking Egyptian official, known to be close to President Hosni Mubarak's thinking, spoke in private of a war that ''wouldn't last three or four days.''
''They can't leave him there,'' the official said of President Hussein. ''He's a madman and a megalomaniac.'' 
On Saturday, Mr. Mubarak himself touched on the threat that Iraq's military power could pose to regional peace even if Mr. Hussein decided to pull out of Kuwait.
''You know, we are against chemical weapons, against the presence of missiles, because this is a very destructive means,'' the Egyptian President said at a news conference after meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. ''I think peace will never go with the presence of all these forms of weapons in the area.''
Mr. Mubarak also said he was dispatching additional Egyptian troops to Saudi Arabia. But he hastened to add that time should be allowed to see if peaceful means would produce results. He seemed to be speaking of a period of months.
''We shouldn't go through war solutions unless it is a hopeless case,'' Mr. Mubarak said.
 
Iraqi Overthrow Quietly Favored
Saudi Arabia has insisted in public that the American troops are in the kingdom for defense. A top-ranking Saudi commander, Lieut. Gen. Khalid ibn Sultan, told reporters recently that any decision to use American troops offensively would have to be preceded by consultations between King Fahd and President Bush.
But privately, said diplomats and Arab officials, the Saudis and other Persian Gulf rulers want the Americans to knock out Mr. Hussein. They are worried about saying so publicly, largely for fear of causing instability in the Arab world and playing into the hands of Mr. Hussein's political tactics. In one of his latest denunciations, he called for a jihad, or holy war, against both King Fahd and President Mubarak, whom he described as pawns of the Americans. ''We are in a period of tactical deception,'' said an Arab official.
A well-connected Western diplomat, when asked about the possibility of a swift military strike to eliminate Mr. Hussein, said, ''Of course this is what they want in the gulf.''
A major worry of moderate Arab leaders is that Mr. Hussein might be able to sway ''the street,'' the Arab public dominated by frustration and resentment against both Israel and the West.
Sa'ad Eddein Ibrahim, a prominent specialist in Arab affairs, said the Iraqi leader was ''invoking the three issues that have been the key to all popular movements in the Arab world - nationalism or pan-Arabism, Islam and social justice.''
 
Sheikdom No Longer Silent
Even some of the normally reclusive oil sheikdoms are beginning to speak out.
The Foreign Minister of Bahrain, Sheik Mohammed Mubarak al-Khalifa, told a recent news conference that Mr. Hussein must go.
''Nobody wants to go to war,'' said Sheik al-Khalifa, whose tiny, rich island country had maintained the fiction of a ''secret'' American air base for years. ''But if some people don't want to listen and they don't want to withdraw, there must be some action.''

 BODY:
In addition, the event took up the opening 13 minutes of the main national television news program, ''Vremya.'' The coverage was uncritical and sressed the panoply of the summit meeting as well as the hope that ''the planet might be changed'' by the two men meeting for a day. 
The ''Vremya'' coverage featured two news conference excerpts. President Gorbachev stressed that the Soviet Union was not setting its Middle East policy on the basis of its hopes for eventual economic aid from Washington. Mr. Bush was shown emphasizing the White House's intention to give first priority to settling the crisis by peaceful diplomacy.
The wives of the Presidents were shown at length visiting a library, and Raisa Gorbachev's stopping to chat with pedestrians received feature coverage, as did the ceremonial exchange of gifts.

Transcript of Bush-Gorbachev News Conference at Summit

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
PRESIDENT GORBACHEV: In replying to your question, I should like to say that the whole of our seven hours of meeting today were devoted to the quest for a political resolution of that conflict. And I believe that we're on the right road.
 
Chances of War With Iraq
Q. Mr. President - if I may follow up with you, President Bush. You are indicating that hostilities could break out if this is not resolved peacefully?
BUSH: The question is what?
Q. I said, you are indicating that there could be hostilities? 
BUSH: The United - United States is determined to see these resolutions enforced, and I like to feel that they will be enforced and that that will result in a peaceful resolution.
 
Palestinian Issue's Fate
Q. My question to Mr. President - my name is Panyi. Do you think, Mr. President, that the conflict of the - do you think, Mr. President, that the conflict of the gulf gives the opportunity to solve the Palestinian problem through an international peace conference for the Middle East? And my second question is if this problem was discussed today with Mr. Gorbachev?
BUSH: Well, let me say that I see the implementation of the United Nations resolutions separate and apart from the need to solve the other question. That question has been on the agenda of many countries for many years, and it is very important that that question be resolved.
The Secretary of State said the other day, and I strongly support that, that under certain circumstances the consideration of a conference of that nature would be acceptable - indeed, it's been a part of our policy from time to time. But the thing that I feel strongly about is that these issues are not linked. And any effort to link them is an effort to dilute the resolutions of the United Nations.
 
Tenure of U.S. Troops
Q. A question to President Bush from Soviet radio and television. How long will United States be - troops be present in the Persian Gulf area?
BUSH: They will be present in the - in the area until we are satisfied that the security needs of the area have been met, and that these resolutions have been complied with. And the sooner they are out of there, as far as I am concerned, the better. I made very clear to President Gorbachev, as I think he will confirm, that we have no intention keeping them a day longer than is required. And so, I'd leave it right there.
Q. Tom Raum with the Associated Press -
GORBACHEV: I'd like to add something, and to confirm what President - the President of the United States has just said to me in our conversation, that the United States of America do not intend to leave their forces in the zone.
And in connection with the change or the normalization of the situation, the United States Administration, and personally the President, will do everything possible to insure that the forces are withdrawn from the region - from the zone. And that's a very important statement.
 
U.S.-Soviet Friction
MARLIN FITZWATER: Tom, please go ahead.
Q. I have a question for both Presidents. The unity that you're expressing today doesn't ignore the fact that there are still some irritants between the two countries. President Bush, are you more sympathetic now to suggestions of Western economic aid to the Soviet Union? And President Gorbachev, would you be willing to withdraw Soviet military advisers from Iraq?
BUSH: For my part, I am very much interested in assisting to be sure that perestroika is successful. We indeed have a mission of high-level businessmen on their way to the Soviet Union right now. They happen to be in Helsinki.
This is but one manifestation of the fact that we are trying to encourage economic cooperation in as many ways as possible. And we had a good, long discussion in our expanded meeting this afternoon about that. And I - I am given the - the common stand that the Soviet Union and the United States have taken at the United Nations. It seems to me that we should be as forthcoming as we possibly can in terms of economics, and I plan to do that.
There are certain constraints, as you say, there are certain nuances of difference. There are certain differences, real differences. But on the other hand, I have said before and I'll repeat it here in front of all this - journalists from all around the world -we, of course, want perestroika to succeed.
It is an internal matter of the - of the Soviet Union, but I think this remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated by the Soviet Union at the United Nations gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible, and I will be saying this to the Congress when I get back.
We still have problems. Look, we've got some big problems ourselves in our economy, and we are not in the position, operating at the enormous deficits, to write out large checks. Having said that, there are many ways that we can endeavor to be of assistance to the - to the emerging economy in the Soviet Union.
GORBACHEV: And there was a question also addressed to me. I would like, nevertheless, on the question which did appear also to be addressed to me - the Western assistance to the Soviet - I would like to continue.
The conversation with President Bush is continuing on the Western assistance to the Soviet Union. I see that there is an attempt being made to link - to establish a link between this and disagreements or the lack of disagreements. And in response to that, I would say the following.
We began our conversation today together by reviewing the situation and realizing that the whole of world society and our two great states are undergoing a trial. This is a test of the durability of the new approach to resolving world problems. And as we enter upon a new peaceful period and as we emerge from the cold war, we see that no less [inaudible] are necessary in order to find ways and means in this period of peace to meet the new situation and to tackle all problems that may arise.
I think if it hadn't been for Malta, it would have been very difficult for us to act in the very difficult situation which arose in Eastern Europe - in Europe, and in the situation connected with the unification of Germany. I think that if, following that, there hadn't been Washington and Camp David and the other meetings on this level with other partners in international relations, we would now be in a difficult situation facing the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
And the fact that today we have taken a common approach to such difficult problems, problems which may well have tragic consequences for the whole world, not just for the peoples of that region, demonstrates that we still are moving forward in the right direction and that we are capable of resolving the most difficult and the most acute problems and to find appropriate responses to the challenges of our time. And the greater part of our conversation together was devoted to this.
And I believe that this is the most important point to bear in mind. Differences, nuances in the differences of view, arguments - these can be - these are natural. It's natural that those should arise. But what we have seen today is that we have confirmed the most important progress of recent time. Now I should like to say something about the Iraqi question, but in fact, I haven't quite finished on the first subject.
I wouldn't want President Bush's reply to give rise to the opinion that the Soviet Union is going to align a certain sum with a certain behavior. We are acting in a difficult situation. We are finding a solution - we shall find a solution which will be satisfactory and, above all, which will remove the danger of an explosion. And this is becoming a normal element of the new kind of cooperation in trade, in technology and human exchange. All of these elements characterize the new peaceful period upon which we are just now embarked and which we have to get used to.
It would be very oversimplified and very superficial to judge that the Soviet Union could be bought for dollars, because although we do look forward to cooperation in this very serious time of far-reaching changes in our economy, and that's normal, let's remember the reforms of recent years.
In a number of states, they always, in addition to the principal efforts made by the peoples concerned themselves, they always involved also the participation of the world community in one form of another. So if anybody wants to try to impose a different view, that's unacceptable to us. It's unacceptable to the United States. It's unacceptable to the Soviet Union, and it would be unacceptable to any other state.
Now, to move on to the second part of your question concerning our experts in Iraq. They are not so much advisers as specialists or experts who are working under contract, and their number is being reduced.
Whereas at the beginning of the conflict, I think there were still 196 of them, there are now some 150 of them. And the Iraqi leadership looks upon the matter thus, that if they haven't completed their work - their normal work under contract, even though it may be a matter of weapons, then they are, nevertheless, leaving Iraq and the process is going forward. So I don't really think there's a problem.
 
Military Options
Q. Izvestia. Question to both Presidents. Did you discuss any possible military options for curbing Iraqi aggression? And what would be the conditions, and what would be the point where you would consider that the political options were exhausted and it was time to go to the Security Council and talk about - through the Security Council demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait?
BUSH: The answer to your question is no. We did not discuss military options. And your question is too hypothetical. And I would like to see this matter peacefully resolved.
GORBACHEV: I would like to support what was said by President Bush, and I stress once more that the whole of our time together was spent on talking about this conflict in a mutual search for a political solution. And I think we can look with optimism in the final analysis on the efforts being taken by the international community working together within the Security Council at the U.N.
 
Moscow's Military Role
Q. Mikhail Sergeyevich, you were just saying that if Iraq doesn't withdraw its forces peacefully, then it will be necessary to take military steps. What kind of Soviet contribution will there be to those military steps? And what will happen then to the Soviet citizens who are in Iraq now? And what will the Arab factor be?
GORBACHEV: Firstly, I did not say that if Iraq does not withdraw peacefully, we're going to have recourse to military methods. I did not state that. I do not state that. And moreover, in my view, that would draw us into consequences which we can't at this stage forecast and therefore, our country and the United Nations as a whole has a whole range of possibilities of finding a political solution to this problem. Therefore, I would limit ourselves to that and therefore the second part of your question is irrelevant.
 
Direct Pressure on Hussein
Q. If I could ask President Gorbachev, specifically, Iraq had been your ally. What directly have you done in contact with Saddam Hussein to reverse the situation there? And President Bush, what specifically have you asked Mr. Gorbachev to do directly? Have you asked him to make a direct contact with Saddam Hussein?
GORBACHEV: I should say that from the start of the crisis, we've been actively exchanging views and carrying forth dialogue not only within the Security Council, not only with the Administration of the U.S.A. These types of contact have great importance to us, but we are also holding active dialogue with leadership of China, of India, of all the other European states, especially those which are members of the Security Council. And in my view, it's this dialogue which has helped us toward the Security Council resolution which was passed.
On top of that, we are also actively cooperating with the Arab states, the countries of the Arab world. And here our dialogue is no less intensive than with our partners in the countries I previously mentioned, including dialogue with President Hussein.
And I can state that what we have announced publicly is also being said to President Hussein in our dialogue with him, which all means that the President and the leadership of Iraq are expected to show a reasonable approach, to stop and to understand what is implied by the position taken by the Security Council on this issue.
This is the dialogue which we have undertaken with him. And we are trying to make sure that our arguments are convincing. We discussed various options for ending the situation with him and we are also attempting, as I already said, to make it quite clear to Saddam Hussein that if Iraq were to provoke military action, then the result would be a tragedy first and foremost for the Iraqi people themselves, for the whole of the region and for the whole of the world.
You know, this is, of course, a dialogue in a very difficult situation. But we consider it a very useful dialogue, and we don't exclude the possibility of establishing new contacts, of having new meetings at various levels. And the type of communication which we have had up until now with the Iraqis gives us hope that those links we have with them can be used positively for the sake of all of us, for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to this problem, and especially of preventing the situation turning into aggression, in this situation.
BUSH: My [inaudible] would simply be that there is no need to ask Mr. Gorbachev to contact Saddam Hussein. Clearly, from his answer you can see that they have been in contact --
INTERPRETER: The President cannot be heard. The microphone seems to be off.
BUSH: Not working?
INTERPRETER: The President could not be heard for a few seconds there. The microphone was off.
BUSH: Is that better? Well --
GORBACHEV: It's a little better, but hit it again.
BUSH: President Gorbachev answered the question about the contact with Saddam Hussein. And clearly your question to me is, have I asked him to contact Saddam Hussein? The answer is no. But the Soviet Union is in contact.
He himself received the Foreign Minister, Aziz. But I would just simply sum it up by saying the best answer to Saddam Hussein, or the best contact is the contact that took place at the United Nations when there was worldwide condemnation of the aggression.
And I happen to feel that this statement showing the Soviet Union and the United States in essential agreement here is another good statement for Saddam Hussein. And hopefully he will see that he is not going to divide us and divide other countries, and that he will do what he should have done some time ago, and that is, comply with the United Nations sanctions.
So - but I did not ask him to do that, because they're way ahead of us on that. They are having contacts and trying to be helpful in that regard.
 
Strategic-Arms Limits
Q. Pravda. I have a question to Mr. Bush. Mr. President, what is your position on the question of signing a treaty limiting strategic offensive weapons? And when do you think that such a treaty will in fact be signed?
BUSH: We still remain committed to a strategic-arms treaty. We vowed that we would encourage our negotiators to move forward more rapidly on both the strategic-arms treaty and the conventional-force agreement. And I'm still hopeful that by the end of the year we will have such an agreement.
INTERPRETER: Microphone please for Mr. Gorbachev.
GORBACHEV: Should I hit it again? I think it's working. I'd like to confirm what President Bush has just said, that we really have agreed to make fresh efforts to give further instructions, because we see that there is a possibility successfully to complete the negotiating process in those two fora and to come up with positive results in the course of this year.
 
U.N.'s Palestinian Rulings
Q. O.K., my question is - good evening, Doris Akatarian from Palestine News Agency, WAFA. My question is for President Bush, and I would also like to hear President Gorbachev's comments on that.
INTERPRETER: The question is to President Bush, and also wants to hear President Gorbachev's comment.
Q. President Bush mentioned that you failed to see the link between the Palestinian question and the present situation. I would like to know how come it is so important to implement U.N. resolutions in this particular instance when other standing ones have -have been frozen and overlooked and disregarded for so long? So, I'd like to know how come this aggression is so different from other ones? And I would also like to add that I personally feel that the Palestinian dilemma and question need the attention of the superpowers more than ever. Thank you very much.
BUSH: I agree that it needs it, and we are very much interested in implementing resolution 242 of the United Nations. We've been zealously trying to do that, as have many other powers for many years.
But the fact that that resolution hasn't been fulfilled when it calls for withdrawal to secure and recognized boundaries, and it should be, and hopefully we can be catalytic in seeing that happen, does not mean that you sit idly by in the face of a naked aggression against Kuwait.
And the United Nations has moved, and the United Nations' resolutions should be implemented on their face without trying to tie it into some other undissolved - unresolved dispute. But I couldn't agree more that it is important, it is very important that that question eventually, and hopefully sooner than later, be resolved.
Q. I have a question for both Presidents -Oh, excuse me, sir.
INTERPRETER: Microphone, please, for Mr. Gorbachev.
GORBACHEV: I think that everything that is taking place in the Middle East is a matter of concern to us, of equal concern. And even more than in the case of the Persian Gulf, we need to act more energetically in order to resolve the complex of problems in the Middle East, and to come up with decisions and to devise a system, to devise guarantees that would insure the interests of all peoples and of the whole world community, because it's a matter which is of vital concern to all of us.
And it seems to me that there is a link here because the failure to find a solution in the Middle East at large also has a bearing on the acuteness of the particular conflict we've been talking about here.
 
Enforcing U.N. Sanctions
Q. A question for both Presidents, please. In your statement, you pledged to work individually and in concert to insure full compliance with the U.N. sanctions against Iraq. May I inquire what, if any, specific and concrete steps you have agreed to take in furtherance of that?
BUSH: We didn't agree to specific and concrete steps. I think President Gorbachev in the contacts he's had with Saddam Hussein, and if - I mean, with the Iraqis - and if they continue, will be a step in that direction. Clearly, this message itself will be a step in that direction. But we did not sit at this meeting and try to assign each other or ask each other to undertake specific measures in keeping with that particular - particular paragraph.
Q. If I may follow up, President Bush, the statement also says that you are prepared to offer additional [inaudible]
GORBACHEV: I'd like to add to that that the emphasis here is on the significance of the political fact that we feel necessary to reflect in this statement, which testifies to our political will to act jointly, or in parallel - independently really - in search of these new steps toward a peaceful resolution of the problem.
I think that for the meeting and the document on - that we've just adopted is more important than our enumerating various steps that might have been taken here. That forms the basis for the further active quest for solutions.
 
State of U.S.-Soviet Ties
Q. Tass - Soviet Tass agency. I also have a question to the Presidents of both countries. Mr. President - Mr. Gorbachev first of all. Since the last meeting, it seems to be that you've had a good mutual understanding. Have you succeeded in deepening that mutual understanding in the course of today's meeting and how, in general, what bearing in general is that factor having on the results of your negotiations?
BUSH: Well, I think clearly there has been a developed - a developing mutual understanding over the years. I like to feel, and I think President Gorbachev agrees, that our meeting in Malta had something to do with furthering that understanding.
I'm convinced that our meeting in the United States at Camp David particularly furthered that understanding. But I'm not -I think the world sees clearly that if this had occurred 20 years ago, there wouldn't have been this cooperative feeling at the United Nations. And I think it's very important.
So I don't know how one quantifies mutual understanding, but I feel we're moving on the right track. Neither of us when we talk try to hide our differences. Neither of us try to indicate that we look at exactly every problem exactly the same way. But the very fact we can talk with that degree of frankness, without rancor, I think, enhances mutual understanding.
And then when we see us on a question of this nature, standing shoulder to shoulder with many other countries at the United Nations, I think it is obvious manifestation of this developing mutual understanding. It's a very broad philosophical question, but differences still remain. But the common ground, in my view, at least, surges ahead of these differences. And we will continue to cooperate with President Gorbachev.
GORBACHEV: I don't know if I would be allowed to tell you a secret here. I haven't asked President Bush if he'll let me. But I must admit that I'm dying to take the risk and tell you, but it's too important to give you an answer to this particular question.
But that last sentence does really give me the hope that we'll get by. In our talks, the President said: ''You know, there was a long time when our view was that the Soviet Union had nothing to do in the Middle East. There was - had no business being there.'' This was something that we had to talk through during this meeting here in Helsinki, and what was said here is that it's very important for us to cooperate in the Middle East, just as it is on other issues of world politics. So that is an answer to your question.
It is very important that at each meeting we move forward. We enrich our relationship, and I think I should say that we increase our trust. If trust is engendered between the leaders of two such nations during meetings of this kind, then I'm sure you'll agree with me that that is to the good of all of us.
Whether we want it or not, history dictates that a lot is going to depend on whether the two countries can work together. That's not our ambition, it's just the way that history has gone.
So far from excluding such a possibility, we intend to cooperate with all sorts of other countries as well, more and more. That's how we see our role in the world developing.
And my last comment is also very important. It seems to me that the way the world is, the way the world is changing, in today's world, no single country, however powerful, will be able to provide the leadership which individual countries formerly tried to provide, including some countries which are represented here.
We can only succeed if we work together and solve our problems together. That is what is emerging from these negotiations, and that we consider the most important aspect.
 
Soviet-Iraqi Friendship
Q. Mikhail Sergeyevich, from French television - I'm going to speak French if I may. Could I ask Mr. Gorbachev whether the Soviet Union is still Iraq's friend, as Minister Tariq Aziz declared in Moscow last week? Are you still the friend of Saddam Hussein? And another question, also directed to Mr. Gorbachev. President Saddam Hussein stated yesterday that the Soviet Union would demonstrate that it is a great power by resisting George Bush's pressure and by supporting the Baghdad regime. Could you indicate to me, if you would, what your reply would be to Saddam Hussein?
GORBACHEV: I will reply to you, and so I don't have to repeat it also to Saddam Hussein, the same reply that I've given to previous questions. My position is unchanged.
We see our role and our responsibility, and within the framework of that responsibility we shall act in cooperation with the other members of the Security Council. And in this instance, I can once again say, since we are sitting here, two Presidents together, I shall interact and cooperate with the President of the United States.
I'd very much like to express the hope that President Saddam Hussein will - will display - I really hope that he will - will display sobriety, will look carefully at the whole situation and will respond to the appeals and the demands of the world community and that he will take steps that are suitable to the situation, that are carefully weighed in their worldwide implications and in their implications for the Arab world too.
No one has any intention of trying to exclude Iraq from the community of nations, but what the present Iraqi leadership is doing is - is driving into a dead end, and I hope that President Saddam Hussein will heed this appeal to him.
 
Role of Soviet Troops
Q. I'm sorry it's always time - other kind of - as a neighboring country of the conflict - we're from Turkey --
Q. I think I'm next. Thank you very much.
Q. But I didn't have any chance - microphone - people are trying to grab it from me.
Q. Let me just press on here, if I may. I have a - ladies first, right? Oh, okay, okay. I'd like to ask Mr. Gorbachev if you have ruled out the possibility of a Soviet military participation in this effort in any sense, either as part of the naval blockade or as part of some future peacekeeping force in the region? And I would follow up with a question to Mr. Bush. To what degree that would be a disappointment to you if - if that's Mr. Gorbachev's position?
GORBACHEV: I don't see the point of doing that now, and we shall continue to act in cooperation within the Security Council and in strict compliance with all of its decisions.
BUSH: I'm not disappointed in that answer.
 
Next Moves in Gulf
Q. You said you're determined to see this aggression end, and you're - and current steps are being considered. What does this mean? What comes next?
BUSH: It's too hypothetical. We want to see this - we want to see the message get through to Saddam Hussein. We want to see him do what the United Nations calls on him to do. And that statement can be interpreted any way you want to interpret it, but it's out there and I would simply not go into any hypothetical questions that would lead me beyond what that statement says.
GORBACHEV: Could I add a couple of words?
INTERPRETER: Mr. Gorbachev wishes to add a couple of words.
GORBACHEV: Please, if you'd - if you would - excuse me, I'll add a couple of words - just to what Mr. Bush has already said.
You know, in my view, I have the impression that both the press and public opinion in some countries is in some ways saying that there's a lack of decision on somebody's part, that we're withdrawing in the face of those who are trampling on international law.
I cannot agree with that view. In fact, it's a view which causes a certain amount of embarrassment to the leadership of nations which are acting through the Security Council in this respect.
What has been done up till now in answer to Iraqi aggression is very important because action has been taken not only within the framework of the Security Council, but there has been unanimous world opinion - a kind of solidarity which has never been expressed before in the history of the world. And we have prevented the aggression going any further.
We have preserved the functioning of the structures which are of economic importance, which would affect so many other countries as well. And finally, the resolution has been taken on an embargo, which is a very stiff measure, in reaction to the aggression.
In my view, this is a strategic way of tackling the question, which has been tackled successfully at the first stages. And we are convinced that the next stage of a political solution, achieved politically, to put an end to this acute international crisis and make sure that a political settlement should be possible, that in this situation decisiveness, willpower and responsibility and political faith in the possibility of a political solution to this very difficult issue shows that the political leaders of the world are being responsible to their own nations and to the world. And we do not want to get caught up in arguments about prestige and so on.
 
Food and Medicine for Iraq
Q. From the Finnish Television. Concerning the humanitarian aid, does your joint statement mean in practice that you consider that food should be now allowed to Iraq?
GORBACHEV: The Presidents feel it necessary to reflect in our joint declaration that we see the need to uphold what was decided by the Security Council on this subject and the Security Council was prepared to admit for humanitarian purposes the supply of medicines and of foodstuffs required first and foremost for children.
We've actually stated this quite plainly in our statement. And so we've taken a very clear-cut position on that. But we've also made it clear this must take place within the framework of certain international organizations and being monitored by them at stages in the operation. So I think that this has been stated in the correct terms.
BUSH: [inaudible] President Gorbachev on that point, and that the language is very good because it does express the concern that both countries feel in the event there actually are children and others who are suffering because of lack of food.
I hope that nobody around the world interprets this as our view that now there should be wholesale food shipments to Iraq because I can speak only here for the - for the United States when I would call attention to the fact that we need some kind of international agencies to see that there is this humanitarian concern as expressed, this exception in the United Nations embargo for humanitarian purposes, and not only is it required for this humanitarian circumstance, but that the food gets where it is supposed to go.
So this should not be from the U.S. standpoint interpreted as a wholesale big - big hole in this embargo. It is not the - it was not our intention and I think the language is very clear on that point.
 
Stances on Military Action
FITZWATER: John Cochran, please.
Q. A few things if you could clear up for us. First of all, you seem to disagree on the military option. And when you talk about further steps being taken to implement the - the U.N. sanctions, President Bush, you seem to be saying the military option is still out there. President Gorbachev seems to disagree. Do you disagree on that? Did you ask President Gorbachev to pull his experts out of Iraq and did you ask him to send troops into the gulf region?
BUSH: I did not ask him to send troops in. If the Soviets decided to do that at the invitation of the Saudis, that would be fine with us. But I did not ask him to do that. I believe there - with the 23 countries that are participating on the ground or - 23 countries that are participating on the ground and at sea that the security of Saudi Arabia is close to safeguarded. What were the other two points?
Q. Did you ask him to pull the experts out of Iraq and do you disagree on the use of military force? You seem to say it's still an option. He seems to say it's not an option, ever.
BUSH: We may have a difference on that. I'm just - as I think I've answered over and over again at home - I'm not going to discuss what I will or won't do. And President Gorbachev made an eloquent appeal, with which I agree, that a peaceful solution is the best. So I've left it open. He can comment on the other. But I - and again, John, I'm sorry - the second point?
 
Moscow's Advisers in Iraq
Q. The experts, pulling the experts out?
BUSH: Well, I think it would facilitate things, but on the other hand, he's given his answer here. And that is not a major irritant. You've said that he's already - I think he said that he is reducing the numbers there, but I think I tried to make clear that this was a question that was widely being raised in the United States, and it would facilitate things if they were out of there in terms of total understanding.
But I heard his answer, listened to it very, very carefully, and I must say that I would let it stand at that. If I was just saying, ''Would I like to see them all out of there?'' I think I'd say absolutely. But I'd let him add to that.
GORBACHEV: In answer to all these questions which you gave us such a clear list of, I've already given answers. I really don't have anything to add to the answers I've already given.
 
Security in the Gulf
Q. Al Ahram newspaper of Cairo, Egypt. Question to the two Presidents, please. You mentioned something about the security arrangement. Is the Soviet Union going to participate in any kind of security arrangement, and what is the role of the region and the countries of that region of the Middle East?
GORBACHEV: On the first question, as we began, we intend to continue to cooperate closely and actively in the framework of the Security Council and on the basis of the decisions that have been adopted, we shall act accordingly. That's the first point.
Secondly, as concerns the role of the countries of the region, yes, I think that generally speaking I would stress the importance of the Arab factor, not yet, really hadn't been brought to bear in efforts to help resolve this crisis situation.
I don't want to offer you our analysis right now as to why that's the case, but nevertheless I am convinced that there is an obvious activization of the quest on the part of Arab states to find the response to the urgent situation which faces us - faces us all here.
We cooperate with all the Arab countries, and I might say not unusefully. The outlines of possible steps are beginning to emerge but it is too soon to be specific. We are continuing our cooperation with Arab countries and at a certain stage, when the situation has changed and has been somewhat - when the tension has been reduced, then perhaps we might carry this further.
But we shall continue in the Security Council - the permanent members of the Security Council - to guarantee security. I have no doubt that we shall succeed in resolving the problem by political means.
FITZWATER: [inaudible] the hour. Thank you very much.
BUSH: May I comment on that one, please? I am very glad that the Arab states, at the Arab League and in other ways, have stated their condemnation of Saddam Hussein. He is trying to make this a contest between the Arab world and the United States. And it is no such thing if you will look at how the United Nations has overwhelmingly condemned him.
So the Arab states have a very key role in this. Many Arab states have responded in the defense of Saudi Arabia - Syria, Morocco, Egypt, to say nothing of the G.C.C. countries.
So it is not Saddam Hussein and the Arab world against the United States. It is Saddam Hussein against the United Nations and against a majority of the Arab League. And that is a very important point that I will continue - continue to make because the Arab League itself has stood up to him and urged his compliance with the sanctions and condemned his aggression.
So in this case I see the Arab states as having a very important role to play in the resolution of this question, and they have not been taken in by his attempt to make this the -the Arab world versus the United States of America, when it is nothing of the kind.
FITZWATER: Thank you very much.
GORBACHEV: I wanted the President and myself to express - to conclude - this press conference by expressing our deep sympathies and feelings for the people of Finland, for the hospitality extended to us on this soil, and to appreciate highly the contribution made by the President of this country and his wife to have made these excellent arrangements for this meeting.
BUSH: May I simply add that President Koivisto and Mrs. Koivisto have been most hospitable and I agree with this. We owe them a great debt of gratitude and the people of Finland. Thank you.

HEADLINE: Democrats in Michigan Select a New No. 2

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Sept. 9

 BODY:
Mrs. Griffiths was removed from the ticket after two terms by Gov. James Blanchard, 48 years old, who said he feared that she would be unable to step in as governor if needed.
She skipped the convention today after asking that a tribute to her be called off because she did not want to listen to hypocrites. Delegates nevertheless stood and applauded when Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said Mrs. Griffiths would be a tough act to follow. 
''Our party and our country owe a great debt to Martha Griffiths for her many decades of extraordinary leadership and accomplishment,'' Mr. Riegle said. ''I don't believe that a single other national leader has done more to advance the cause of women's rights in this country and every man and every woman and every child in this country owes much to her.''
Mrs. Griffiths was instrumental in adding provisions barring sex discrimination to state civil rights laws.
Her successor, Ms. Maynard, 54, has been director of the state Office of Services to the Aging since 1983.
''Libby Maynard is a person who meets Jim Blanchard's primary test of being someone who can assume the office of governor,'' said the Macomb County Prosecutor, Carl Marlinga. ''Her career is a model of competence and caring.''
Earlier, Mrs. Griffiths had suggested that Ms. Maynard's qualifications were weak, saying she had never served in elective office and had no experience in government except running the office on aging, which has a budget of $63 million and a staff of 55. Mrs. Griffiths later said she meant Ms. Maynard had no parliamentary experience and she praised her abilities.
Mr. Blanchard declined to comment on Mrs. Griffiths's remarks about Ms. Maynard at a news conference today. ''That's all behind us,'' he said. In her acceptance speech, Ms. Maynard challenged the Republican candidate for governor, John Engler, warning that a change of leadership could return the state to the economic problems of the early 1980's.

HEADLINE: Shoulder to Shoulder Against Iraq

 BODY:
Some may be tempted to make too much of the differences that remain between Washington and Moscow. But they pale in significance against the remarkable common ground the two leaders have now reached. Not since 1945 have the United States and Soviet Union stood so close in a regional dispute. And not since the early days of the cold war has a U.S. President indicated readiness to provide economic aid to the Soviet Union. 
Patience and cooperation were the Helsinki watchwords. Time will be needed for the economic embargo to take effect. Time, too, will be needed to ready U.S. forces for military action, if it becomes necessary, and to bring the allies and others along politically. So Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were right to stress hopes for a peaceful resolution. But they were also right not to deny themselves the possibility of military action under the U.N. Charter.
Meanwhile, they moved smartly to tighten the loophole in a U.N. resolution that permits the shipment of food and medicine to Iraq for ''humanitarian'' reasons. Such shipments would not be left to the initiative of individual nations; they must be authorized by the U.N. and ''strictly monitored.'' States that violate sanctions can themselves be subject to sanctions.
The two leaders took appropriate care to sidestep differences - on Moscow's wish for Arab-Israeli negotiations now to accompany Persian Gulf talks; and on Washington's desire for the swift withdrawal of the 150 Soviet military advisers left in Iraq. No matter what Mr. Gorbachev's contractual obligations are, the advisers send the wrong signal. But it is easy to sympathize with his reluctance to send forces to the gulf, which would risk an outbreak of ''Afghanistan syndrome'' at home.
Mr. Bush, in turn, was prepared to reassure the Soviets, and Americans, that U.S. troops would not remain in the region ''a day longer than is required.'' But both men sensibly left open the possibility of a U.N. presence, once the crisis is resolved.
Unfortunately but understandably, the two leaders didn't announce any new measures against Iraq. But more important, they left no doubt about their joint resolve.

HEADLINE: Reports of Hartford's Death Are Exaggerated

 BODY:
There is no question that Hartford, like most of urban America, faces serious problems. These are exacerbated by economic downturn in the nation and New England in particular. Long-term trends are at work, such as the suburban mall phenomenon, but also near-term cyclical forces and revivifying dynamics help us. For example, although six downtown restaurants closed in the last year, eight new restaurants opened. And Hartford's renowned cultural life, ranging from jazz to art and theater, is as inviting as ever.
What we need to do - and are doing - is to rise to the challenge, enlist the resources of leadership in the city and the greater Hartford region, plan realistically for the short and long-term, and work together. A regional economic planning committee, composed of leading figures from the public, private and academic sectors, is already hard at work.
Some key elements of recovery are also being addressed, including parking availability, public safety and expanded downtown activities. The recently completed renovation of downtown's Pratt Street into a shoppers' mall and the commitment of many retailers to Hartford bode well.
In the next few years Hartford can also look forward to reclaimed access to one of its great assets, the Connecticut River, as a focal point for leisure activity, as well as highway improvements offering easy access to city amenities. In addition, we are hopeful of building a new convention center and hotel complex.
There is still a lot of life and vitality in Hartford and the promise of much more. Hartford might indeed say, as one of Hartford's most noted citizens, Mark Twain, once declared, ''The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.''

HEADLINE: Coal-Plant Proposal Upsets New York's Neighbors

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

DATELINE: HALFMOON, N.Y., Sept. 8

 BODY:

 
'Have to Practice What We Preach'
But officials in neighboring states disagree, and are accusing New York of exporting its air pollution in much the same manner as the Midwestern states they have all condemned.
''We in the Northeast have to practice what we preach,'' Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont said. ''This is not the right time to launch a project that's going to hurt our environment.''
The plant, proposed by a company called Inter-Power of New York, Inc. has become a campaign issue in Massachusetts, where all five candidates in this month's gubernatorial primary have come out against it. In the Berkshire region, where the impact of the plant would be the greatest, opposition to Inter-Power has become practically a prerequisite for running for office. 
In New York, too, the plant has been protested by dozens of politicians and civic groups, including, in a surprising twist, the local industrial development agency.
But Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has remained silent, saying the matter is best left to state regulators to decide. Through a spokesman, Mr. Cuomo has said that he was sure that the regulators would be ''scrupulous'' in insuring that the plant qualified as ''clean technology.''
The far-flung opposition to the plant has become a potential embarrassment to Mr. Cuomo, whose re-election campaign stresses his commitment to a clean environment. Critics of the plant charge that the Governor, so forceful when it comes to Midwestern polluters, has failed to show the same firmness closer to home. Reject or Embrace Coal? ''You can't set a dual standard: one for the rest of the world and one for your state,'' said Ken Dufty, president of the Concerned Citizens for the Environment, a New York-based group formed to fight Inter-Power. ''I think the Governor needs to be made accountable for that.''
The winds that blow pollution from the coal-fired power plants of the Midwest toward the Northeast would also scatter Inter-Power's emissions over a broad swath of the area, and the issues that the proposed plant raises are the same ones that have long troubled relations between the regions.
Should the nation turn away from coal, as many Northeast officials have argued, because it produces large quantities of pollutants like sulfur dioxide, which are the precursors of acid rain? Or is coal, one of the nation's most abundant energy sources, an integral part of the country's future, as officials in the Midwest - and now in New York - have said?
The disputed 220-megawatt power plant is proposed for a desolate industrial stretch of the Hudson River's west bank, beside a General Electric Company plant that has been fined for spilling solvents and other toxins into the river. The plant would sell some power to General Electric, and, under Federal law, the local utility company, Niagara Mohawk, would have to buy the rest. While the plant is of moderate size for a power station, it is unusually large for a co-generating plant.
Whether the plant is needed is a matter of contention. Niagara Mohawk executives have testified that the company will not need new power until 1999, and plant opponents argue that conservation and other forms of power could easily meet the utility's needs by then.
But state officials argue that the power is needed sooner, and the plant has received favorable reviews from state agencies including the Department of Environmental Conservation. The final say rests with the state's Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment, whose members have been appointed by Governor Cuomo. The board will decide whether the power is needed and whether it will be generated without adverse environmental impact.
 
'We're So Darn Clean'
Like Midwestern officials before them, New York's environmental officials argue that their regulations are strict enough to insure that the Inter-Power plant does not harm the air quality. In addition, state officials note, the plant follows the state's new energy plan, which calls for several coal-fired plants to be built using pollution controls similar to Inter-Power's.
Inter-Power officials say that the plant's image has been unfairly tarnished by the older and dirtier coal-fired plants. ''You want to get facilities like ours on line because we're so darn clean,'' John D'Alessandro, a spokesman for the company, said.
But opponents like Mr. Dufty of Inter-Power argue that building new coal-fired plants, even with sophisticated pollution controls, is folly at a time of deep concern over acid rain.
By changing the chemical composition of the water, acid rain can transform thriving lakes into the aquatic equivalent of deserts. Foes of the Inter-Power plant note that just this week, a Federal study confirmed that emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, many of them at coal-fired power plants in the Midwest, are major contributors to the acid rain that has been damaging Northeastern lakes.
These opponents insist that the so-called clean coal technology that the Inter-Power plant would use does not live up to its name.
''Clean coal just means cleaner than it was five years ago, which isn't saying much,'' said John Seakwood, who founded the Berkshire Mountain Acid Rain Coalition to fight the plant.
According to Inter-Power's estimates, the proposed plant would each year emit 2,337 tons of sulfur dioxide, a major ingredient of acid rain. Some older coal-burning plants emit twice as much sulfur dioxide. A plant burning natural gas, which many opponents of Inter-Power have advocated, would produce less than one-sixth of the amount of the Inter-Power plant.
Inter-Power officials say that foes of the plant are being unrealistic in arguing it should be converted to natural gas, because no pipeline exists. ''People have to look at this project within the realm of the real,'' said Mr. D'Alessandro, the company spokesman.
Events in the Mideast, Mr. D'Alessandro added, underscore coal's importance. ''Coal is a domestic resource,'' he said. ''This is an opportunity to put us on the right path not just environmentally, but economically.''
Inter-Power officials charge out-of-state officials with using the plant as a convenient enemy in an election year. But officials in Massachusetts and Vermont insist that they are only demanding consistency.
''All we're asking of New York is that they do the same that they and other Northeastern states asked of the Midwest,'' said Sherwood Guernsey, a Massachusetts state representative. ''Don't dump on us. Be good neighbors.''

HEADLINE: Tax Issue Takes Center Stage in Connecticut's Primary

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Last week, however, when the two men met for their only debate of the campaign, taxes absorbed the hour, especially the income-tax issue. Over the next few days, Mr. Morrison also released his first direct television attack on Mr. Cibes, characterizing him as the candidate who would bring an income tax to Connecticut. Mr. Morrison, taking what has been the traditional Democratic party approach, vowed to veto any income-tax plan, although he said his mind could be changed if a majority of voters in a statewide referendum approved the tax. At the heart of the issue is the huge budget shortfall, which state budget officials say may reach $800 million next spring, in a budget of just over $7 billion. Mr. Cibes argues that the state will have no choice except to change its tax system. Mr. Morrison believes there is still room to maneuver.
Some observers question whether Connecticut's current taxes - especially its sales and corporate taxes, which are among the highest in the country - have been stretched to their limit. At the same time, there is uncertainty over what effect an income tax could have on the state's economy and its very identity. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that has no tax on wages, although it does tax income on dividends, interest and capital gains. 
''The state has a certain uniqueness now,'' said William A. McEachern, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut. ''It would lose that.'' Professor McEachern's thoughts on the tax exemplify the hesitancy that many people express about abandoning Connecticut's current road for the untrodden one suggested by Mr. Cibes, a professor of government and the co-chairman of the General Assembly's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.
As an economist, Professor McEachern said, he favors the type of progressive income tax proposed by Mr. Cibes, since it would tax more heavily the people most able to pay. The rate would begin at 4 percent of adjusted gross incomes over $25,000 and peak at 8 percent for incomes over $100,000. The sales tax rate would then be cut from 8 percent to 5 percent, and corporate taxes would be cut from an effective rate of 13.8 percent to 10 percent.
As a resident, however, Professor McEachern said he is concerned about how other aspects of life in the state might be affected by the proposals -for example, whether some of the wealth that has been drawn to the state might begin to look elsewhere.
''I think it would change the state in ways we haven't thought about yet,'' he said.
 
Measuring the Tax Bite
What complicates the issue further is the fact that Connecticut's current taxes are both very high and very low, depending on how economists or voters look at them.
Last month, for example, The State Tax Review, a weekly journal that montitors tax trends, examined total tax collections in states around the country and concluded that with tax payments of $2,281 per person in 1987-1988, Connecticut had the fourth-highest taxes in the country. Only Alaska, the District of Columbia, and New York were higher.
Another research group, however, the Tax Foundation, came to a completely different conclusion in a report also issued last month. By measuring what economists call the ''tax bite'' -the percentage of a person's income consumed by taxes - the group found that because incomes in Connecticut are generally high, taxes as a percentage of income were quite low. By that measure, only seven states had a smaller tax bite.
According to figures from the Tax Foundation, Connecticut has the highest statewide sales tax rate in the nation, at 8 percent; the highest corporate taxes in the nation, at an effective rate of 13.8 percent; and the highest taxes in the nation on income from stock dividends and interest, which peak at 14 percent.
 
Higher Taxes for Affluent
Mr. Cibes said that under his plan, the income tax would generate $2.5 billion in new revenue. But because of the cuts in the other taxes, overall tax collections would rise only $598 million, and he contends that residents would get $300 million or more of that back from the Federal Government in larger tax refunds, because state income taxes, unlike sales taxes, are deductible.
Using a combination of tax tables and assumptions from the Internal Revenue Service about how many people itemize their taxes, Mr. Cibes said that a family earning $35,000 would see no change in their net taxes under his plan, while those earning less would see their taxes fall and those earning more would see taxes go up.
Mr. Cibes said that a family earning $100,000 a year would pay about $600 less a year in sales taxes on average, assuming they bought a car every three years. The same family would save $657 on lowered interest and dividend taxes, and $94 on lowered capital gains taxes, and would be able to deduct another $1,400 off their income on their Federal tax return. Their income tax would be $4,200, for a net tax increase of about $1,400.
The additional revenues, Mr. Cibes said, would be used for property-tax relief and other programs like environmental protection. Mr. Morrison, who has said the Cibes plan reveals a ''tax-first mentality,'' said the changes would continue the spiral of budget growth that began in Connecticut in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: 1,000 With One Goal: Instant Fame

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Under leaden skies outside the American Theatre of Actors yesterday at 314 West 54th Street, they dreamed of a ''wonderful opportunity,'' a chance ''to get a shot at stardom,'' as the open casting call promised.
 
A Chance to Pick a Role
''I want to be Dawn, the 16-year-old Irish-American, pretty, sensual and sexy,'' said Delilah Cotto, a 19-year-old actress who played a prostitute in the movie ''Lean on Me,'' about a New Jersey high school principal.
''I want to be Tommy Daily,'' said Denis May, 22, who has done commercials for several products, including Coca-Cola. 
The long line of young men and women were waiting to audition for roles in ''Gladiators,'' a new film directed by John G. Avildsen, who also directed ''Rocky'' and ''The Karate Kid.''
The film is about Tommy Daily, a 17-year-old Irish-American fighter who is, according to the promotional sheet, ''the type of guy who might be found on the waterfront in New Jersey and Hoboken.'' Auditions were also being held for Lincoln, ''a tough, powerfully built African-American gang leader; Romano, ''a little tough guy,'' and two women's parts.
''A lot of kids don't have agents, and when they go to acting school, they will lose their street accents,'' said Mr. Avildsen, who chose 80 percent of the cast of his movie ''Lean on Me'' from an open call in New York two years ago.
 
Audition Pros and Novices
Some of those in line yesterday, many with newspapers over their heads to protect them from pigeon droppings, audition several times a week. But for many it was their first audition, a fact often betrayed in the nervous inflections in their voice.
''I like the excitement, the big tall buildings,'' said Laura Rodriguez, 20, who arrived in New York two weeks ago from Brownsville, Tex. ''This is a drastic change from the flatlands of Brownsville, but my parents are rooting for me.''
Louis DeCarolis, 50, a boxing promoter, stood by wearing a black nylon jacket and a black cowboy hat. He worked an unlighted Tiparillo cigar with a mangled plastic holder from one side of his mouth to the other.
''I brought nine of my fighters down here,'' he said. ''They cast five of them and want them to come back.''
A group of young women gathered in the street around Joyce Fetherolf, who does production and development for the movie's director. They were assuring her that they looked much younger with their make-up off.
''The more baby-faced the better,'' she said, after telling one 20-year-old she looked too old for the women's parts.
 
'The Amazing Allure'
Inside the theater young men and women pored over small passages, known as ''sides,'' in the script in preparation for their auditions.
''It's the amazing allure of the movies,'' said Steven Roth, the film's producer, as he looked over several dozen young men and women who were intently going over their ''sides'' before being called into one of the two audition rooms.
''Should I play this'' tough or sexy, Jeannie Pearl Bennett asked the director before her audition.
''Both,'' he said.

HEADLINE: County vs. State on Bankruptcy Issue

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OROVILLE, Calif., Sept. 7

 BODY:
More than a decade of citizens' tax revolt has left county governments in California starved for property and other tax revenues at the same time that social service programs mandated by the state have grown rapidly.
Butte is one of a number of California's 58 counties hurt by the financial squeeze that originated with Proposition 13, which imposed tight restrictions on property tax increases. The problem has become most acute in rural counties, because their low costs of housing have made them what one official called a ''poverty magnet,'' pulling in the chronically unemployed or low-paid unskilled workers, welfare recipients and retirees on fixed incomes.
In Butte County, one in six residents receives some form of public assistance, and welfare programs alone account for 57 percent of the county budget. The county of 185,000 people has met the crisis by gutting services like the Sheriff's Department and the libraries to pay for increases in welfare programs that range from 300 percent to 2,000 percent. 
''We have closed our libraries and fired librarians to pay social workers,'' said William H. Randolph, the county's chief administrative officer. ''But we cannot continue the process of eating our hands and feet - of cannibalizing the whole system. County government as we have known it, is going to die.''
 
Threats to Larger Counties
A report published last month by the County Supervisors Associations of California found that some large urban counties including San Diego and Alameda are also threatened by the soaring costs of the areas of public health and criminal justice, largely due to the war on drugs, driving up the need for everything from emergency hospital services to larger jails.
And Thomas Goodman, a spokesman for the National Association of Counties in Washington, said some county governments in Kentucky, Oklahoma and West Virginia are on the brink of bankruptcy because the downturn in their economies has forced down property values and thus county tax revenues.
Richard P. Simpson, director of research for the County Supervisors Association report, said there are a dozen counties in California in ''acute fiscal stress,'' with at least six ''really in terrible shape.''
Even if Butte County is bailed out with an infusion of state money this year, he said, ''we are going to face further Butte Counties. There is no question about it.''
 
Bankruptcy Is a Mystery
Since no county has ever gone bankrupt, it is not clear just what will happen if Butte does. Chapter 9 of the Federal Bankruptcy Law protects county and city governments from actions by their creditors, and the county would stop paying its bills until it could work out a payment plan with creditors from the telephone company to the state itself. Paychecks to county employees would not stop, but the state might have to take over paying the workers if the county could not do so. The county does not expect any disruption in local services.
For the past three years, it has been a tossup as to which of the rural counties would go under first. Like its neighbors, Butte County has kept going by closing libraries or having some branches open a few hours per week staffed by volunteers. County employees have not had a cost-of-living raise in four years, and the staff at the Sheriff's Department has been slashed so that only 24 deputies are available to patrol more than 1,600 square miles.
The County Supervisors Association report concluded that Butte had financed state-mandated programs ''on the backs of county employees and by deferral of essential maintenance of the county's infrastructure.'' Had it not done so, the report said, the county would have encountered bankruptcy three years ago.
Several other counties are in a similar position. Shasta County to the north staved off bankruptcy by closing the county hospital, laying off more than 200 employees in the process. Others have sought creative solutions, like Kern County, which is trying to impose a fee on cities for every prisoner arrested and booked into the county jail.
 
Refusal to Raise Taxes
But taxpayers firmly refuse to raise taxes until the overall issue of how state-mandated programs will be financed is addressed on a statewide level. Voters here and in other counties have rejected local ballot measures seeking special assessments to finance libraries, jails and other services.
''Even with a state bailout this year, we won't have money for more police or fire protection services,'' said Nell Lind, president of the 5,000-member Butte County Taxpayers Association. ''The state has stolen our tax money to pay for all these social welfare programs and their bureaucracy. Bankruptcy is the only solution because there has to be structural change on a state level.''
Like other rural counties in California, Butte has cities that are incorporated and can rely on their own revenue from sales taxes. Chico, a city that has a campus of California State University, is financially sound and has even used its own money to keep open a branch of the Butte County Library, A Call for Change Larry E. Naake, the executive director of the County Supervisors Association of California, said the tax revolt is alive and well in this state and will continue to resist tax increases as the solution to problems. ''There is a somewhat stingy group of Californians who continue to think you can freeze or reduce taxes and still have the same or a higher level of services,'' he said.
Mr. Naake has proposed changes, including forcing the state to pay the entire cost of welfare programs and guarantee counties a stable source of revenue for other mandated programs like courts and the public defender's office.
Ed McLaughlin, an almond farmer who is chairman of the Butte County Board of Supervisors, agrees that any restructuring of the traditional division of duties between the state and the counties must leave some duties to the counties.
''County government here is so accessible,'' he said. ''People feel frustrated if they have to call Sacramento when they can catch a member of their Board of Supervisors at a lunch counter.''

'Stay Intense but Not Overdo It'

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.

 BODY:
But as the Giants-Eagles game began, even Lawrence Taylor was wondering if he could escape the usual curse of a long pro football holdout: vulnerability to certain injuries, notably a pulled hamstring muscle, in trying to do too much too soon. And others were wondering why George Young, the Giants' general manager, has developed a dangerous tradition of letting contract disputes linger, often to the detriment of the players involved. Two years ago, Carl Banks, the Giants' other outside linebacker, finally signed the Wednesday before the opener.
''I had one injury after another that season,'' Banks recalled. ''Once you get in, you're expected to play.'' Two years ago, Sean Landeta, their All-Pro punter, finally signed early in the week of the last exhibition game. 
''As soon as I came in, I got a herniated disk in a workout,'' Landeta recalled. ''The reason I got hurt, I punted 22 times from the back of my end zone under a full rush. Complete stupidity. I tried to punt with it for two games, but I couldn't.''
That same season Mark Bavaro never attained his previous All-Pro form after having reported late because of a contract dispute.
And now Taylor and Leonard Marshall, the defensive end who signed a week ago Friday, are this season's late arrivals.
Taylor, like Banks, Landeta and Bavaro two years ago, reported Wednesday in good physical condition. Good enough, that is, for playing golf. Good enough for sitting around his sports bar on nearby Route 17. Good enough for checking with his agent, Joe Courrege, on the progress of his negotiations. Good enough even for pumping iron in his weight room at his Upper Saddle River, N.J., home.
But when L. T. reported, even his muscular physique was not properly prepared for National Football League combat. And it might be two or three weeks before his body is properly prepared to absorb the collisions it must endure.
With that in mind, why do the Giants allow so many contract negotiations to drag on so long? Why do the Giants jeopardize the value of the team and the players they acknowledge to be worth millions of dollars over multiyear contracts?
''That's the nature of many of the agents now,'' George Young said. ''The magnet of technique. Stay high, high, high in their salary demands and make everybody come up. It's a technique that's orchestrated. It's not an accident. Ever since the players' union has given out salary information, each player wants to make more than the other guy. But if you tell that player he's not as good as the other guy, you're insulting him. As for those players who have a bad year after a long holdout, I think it's not so much physical as mental. The whole idea of the union is to make players complain.''
While other N.F.L. general managers quietly tolerate agents as a necessary evil, Young loudly draws a harder line.
''The whole climate has been created by the union and the agents,'' the Giants' general manager said. ''The agents are recruiting next year's clients with this year's contracts.'' Taylor has acknowledged having been attracted to Courrege by the agent's work with other N.F.L. players.
''That's the only reason I hired Courrege,'' L. T. said shortly before the Giants' training camp opened. ''The contracts he got for Ray Childress and Gary Hogeboom. I've seen their contracts and the money they make is unreal.''
Childress is the Houston Oilers' best defensive end. Hogeboom, a quarterback once with the Dallas Cowboys and the Indianapolis Colts, was recently cut by the Phoenix Cardinals.
''One reason for the delay in negotiating Lawrence's contract this year,'' Courrege explained, ''was the collateralization of the $1 million loan to Lawrence in his previous contract. That was a critical issue that had to be cleared up. George Young is a savvy professional negotiator. He knew where he was going at all times. He knew he had to take some crossroads to get where he wanted to go.''
As the general manager, Young is the keeper of the keys to the Giants' treasury. Through the years, the Mara co-owners, Wellington and Tim, have developed a reputation as ''cheap'' co-owners. Not true. Careful, yes, as businessmen should be. But not cheap. There's a difference. In the N.F.L. economy, cheap owners don't endure. And the Mara family now has the longest-running N.F.L. family name.
But the question remains: Despite Young's dislike for agents and despite some agents' machinations, why can't the Giants' general manager get his expensive players signed and into training camp on time?
Around the Giants, some players shrug and talk about ''the Giants' way'' of negotiating expensive contracts. Delay, delay, delay until it's time for training camp. Let the player stew. And when the player finally relents and reports, risk his doing too much too soon.
If that's the Giants' way, it's the wrong way. As Carl Banks, Sean Landeta and Mark Bavaro discovered two years ago. And as Lawrence Taylor and Leonard Marshall could still learn this season.

HEADLINE: Ornette Coleman's Original Quartet Goes Home

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 9

 BODY:
''He is a man of great conviction, a pioneer always moving forward down the path he has chosen, a can opener who opens all of us up as musicians,'' said the pianist Herbie Hancock, master of ceremonies for the show, which drew a liberal sprinkling of prominent jazz and pop musicians as well as American, Japanese and European jazz fans. ''I could not play what I play had it not been for Ornette Coleman.''
 
A Sound Once Scorned
For Mr. Coleman, who is 60 years old, the performance and the warm public response it engendered may also have been something of a belated vindication. When he arrived here in the early 1950's from Texas, he immediately became a controversial figure - scorned and ridiculed by some musicians because of his penchant for playing outside normal chord structures, resisted by others, but an inspiration to players whose ears and minds were open to new sounds and new approaches to music.
''I was at a club in Hollywood called The Hague, there just as a listener, when this guy with a plastic horn came up and asked to sit in,'' Mr. Haden said before the concert, recalling his first meeting with the man who would become his greatest musical influence. ''As soon as he started to play, the whole room, and my whole life, lit up with a sound so brilliant, beautiful and free. That was Ornette.'' 
But, Mr. Haden continued, ''As soon as he started to play, they asked him to stop, and by the time I got around to the back door, he was gone.'' Through a friend, Mr. Haden eventually tracked Mr. Coleman down, and they immediately ''went over to his little apartment, which was one room covered with original compositions of his. I took out my bass and started to play with him, feeling that at last I could really play. It was like being born.''
Mr. Haden's opinion, however, was not widely shared then. ''There were jams down at Town Hall every weekend, and a lot of times they wouldn't let Ornette get on,'' recalled the saxophonist Buddy Collette, already a fixture on the Los Angeles jazz scene when Mr. Coleman arrived here. ''He wouldn't play the chords of 'Body and Soul' or 'Over the Rainbow.' He was playing his own stuff, his own chords, and he never played the songs the way you expected.''
That kind of response at first discouraged Mr. Coleman. ''I was so hurt,'' he said this weekend when asked to reflect on those early days. ''I thought that if I played with these high-caliber guys, I could really stretch out. Instead, they made it seem like I was the one from another planet.''
 
New Tools for Expression
For three years, Mr. Coleman recalled, he operated a freight elevator in a downtown Los Angeles department store, just a block away from where he played Friday night, because the opportunities to perform publicly or to jam with other musicians were so scarce. ''I would stop the elevator between floors and just hang up there and write on the music paper I had with me,'' he said.
Over the years, Mr. Coleman has developed his unwillingness to improvise over conventional chord structures into a system he calls ''harmelodics'' and describes ''as a tool invented for people to enhance their fertility of expression, in both tempered and non-tempered music.''
''In this age of information, melody gives off a different kind of information than just the way the rhythm and notes are going, and harmelodics is a way to move toward pure music,'' he said.
Finding kindred spirits in the mid-1950's like Mr. Haden, a recent arrival from Missouri who then introduced him to Mr. Cherry and Mr. Higgins, or Eric Dolphy, an innovative reed player in his own right, who was one of the few musicians here who actually sought out Mr. Coleman for jam sessions, helped Mr. Coleman maintain the conviction that he was on the right track. But even within that narrow circle, Mr. Coleman stood out.
''Eric Dolphy was a kid you could understand, who'd say, 'Can I come over and play duets?,' but Ornette was always more mysterious, and always knew where he was going,'' Mr. Collette said. ''Ornette was almost like from another land. He wasn't walking to the same beat as the others were.''
 
A Time to Experiment
In retrospect, though, it was probably for the better that the quartet was able to rehearse and develop its own style in Los Angeles, rather than in the hothouse atmosphere of New York jazz. ''They were kids at first, experimenting, with a lot of creativity and willingness to try things,'' Mr. Collette said. ''Ornette was great, but because he was trying new things, he didn't have it all together. There's no telling what would have happened in New York.''
Eventually they were invited to play at the Five Spot Cafe, a club in Manhattan. After a period of initial praise in New York and the release of such acclaimed albums as ''Free Jazz'' and ''The Shape of Jazz to Come,'' the group did indeed fall apart, largely, Mr. Coleman said, because of ''economics and the image around us, pro and con.'' At that point, Mr. Coleman said, he was simply tired of the controversy.
''I figured that if this created that kind of problem, I'd rather just write music,'' he added.
After the quartet dissolved in the mid-1960's, Mr. Haden and Mr. Higgins went on to become respected session players and occasional leaders of groups of their own. Mr. Cherry became itinerant, wandering through Asia, Africa and Latin America and becoming one of the earliest advocates of what in the 1980's blossomed into the popular style known as ''world music.''
As for Mr. Coleman, after he was mugged in New York in the early 80's, which resulted in a collapsed lung, he slowed down for a while. But in recent years, he has recorded and played not only with Prime Time, an electrified ensemble that includes his son Denardo on drums, but also with such admiring younger mainstream guitarists as Pat Metheny and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.
 
Now, Coleman the Composer
A growing number of commissions have also come Mr. Coleman's way. One was the chamber piece for 17 musicians called ''The Country That Gave the Freedom Symbol to America,'' commissioned by the French Government and performed for the bicentennial of the French Revolution. At the moment, La Scala in Milan is attempting to persuade Mr. Coleman to write an opera for it, though the libretto is still under discussion.
''I've always wanted to be a composer, and in the last 20 years I have written a lot of music that, because it doesn't require me to play, comes under the category of classical music,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''When I first got a record date, it was because I had sold some compositions to Contemporary Records and they came to me saying they couldn't get anyone to play them, so could I please play them. My feeling is that I always preferred to write music.''
On the rare occasions when he chooses to appear publicly, however, Mr. Coleman has no shortage of volunteers willing to perform with and learn from him. ''No matter who I play with or where I play,'' Mr. Haden said, ''one thing is going through my head all the time: How do I play with Ornette again?''

Mauritius Thrives as Textiles Boom

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRIOLET, Mauritius

 BODY:
The economic growth has been built on an export-processing zone established by the Government in the 1970's. Industrialists can set up enterprises in the zone at reduced tax and tariff rates.
The concept has been tried in a number of African countries, including Kenya, Zimbabwe and Togo, but so far without such results. Mauritius enjoyed an average annual growth rate of 7 percent for four years after the fledgling export zone was revitalized in 1983 with cuts in income taxes and corporate taxes. The per-capita income is now around $2,000 a year, catapulting the country from the low-income ranks into the middle-income category, as measured by the World Bank. 
The transformation was largely a result of textiles, which account for about 85 percent of the new industry. Fakhru Currimjee, the founder of Bonair, recalled that survival, and then success, did not come easily.
 
Expatriate Expertise
Bonair is one of the biggest companies in the zone, and copies of French Vogue in its waiting room set the tone of a fashion house rather than a textile mill. One of hundreds of factories opened after the establishment of the export zone, Bonair started out with expatriate expertise - Mr. Currimjee had been in the margarine business - and a dud of a first year.
''I came back without selling anything,'' Mr. Currimjee said of his first attempt to sell his products to European buyers in 1975.
Then he received an order from a French company to make an evening sweater according to a designated design. After some false starts in manufacturing - the necks were initially crocheted so tightly that women could not pull them over their heads - thousands were sold by the French company, and Mr. Currimjee had his first steady customer.
Now Bonair sells to the Galeries Layfayette and Au Printemps department stores in France, to the Cacharel label in France and to Next, a British chain of stores. The company also sells to Germany, Italy and Japan. Some Mauritian textile companies export to the United States, but American textile quotas have prevented large sales.
 
Distinct From Africa
Mauritius, whose population is largely Indian, Creole and Chinese, with a smattering of Mauritians of French descent, is usually counted as part of Africa because of its membership in the Organization of African Unity. But people like Mr. Currimjee, whose family came from India as traders more than 100 years ago, insist that the island has little in common with the African continent.
''This country is lumped into Africa, but it's not,'' said Mr. Currimjee, pointing to some of the reasons for Mauritius's economic growth that are missing on the continent.
The first is political stability in a multiparty democracy, a rare system in Africa. Indeed, a recent economic survey by the United States Agency for International Development assessed the political climate in Mauritius as better for business than those in some cheap-labor countries outside Africa, like Sri Lanka and the Philippines.
The second basic ingredient has been a reasonably well-educated work force. Since the country became independent from Britain in 1968, education through secondary school has been free. In contrast, many African nations, like Kenya and Uganda, require impoverished parents to pay school fees. More than half of Mauritius's Government officials have university degrees. Mr. Curimjee graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; his son, Arif, the managing director of the company, graduated from Williams College five years ago, and his daughter is currently studying Japanese at Brown University.
Mauritius's timing was also fortuitous. The Government of Prime Minister Aneerood Jugnauth rejuvenated the export zone in 1983 with some classic supply-side economic policies - cutting the corporate and income taxes by half, to 35 percent. At that time, Hong Kong investors, nervous because China will take control of their homeland in 1997, were starting to look for places to park their money. Hong Kong is now the largest foreign investor in Mauritius.
 
Connections With Europe
Another important factor for Mauritius was its membership in the Lome Convention, under which products from third world nations receive preferential treatment from the European Community.
The country's long connection with France has helped as well. The French were the first colonizers, even though the British took over in 1810. Many Mauritians are fluent in both English and French.
''French buyers were very happy I spoke French and came from Mauritius,'' Mr. Curimjee said. ''One buyer said to me, 'If you can match Hong Kong, I'll give the business to you, because you speak French.' ''

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Up; Dollar Off

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Sept. 10

 BODY:
But despite mild bullishness on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, investors remain cautious, the brokers said. ''I don't think anybody really believes the market is posting lasting gains,' said Philip Gordon-Lennox, the fund manager at the Nippon Credit Bank. 
In the early afternoon, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 964.93 points, or 4.03 percent, to 24,927.00. It ended the morning session at 802.53 points, or 3.35 percent, to 24,764.60, after rising 286.47 points, or 1.2 percent, in the first 10 minutes of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei gained 150.16. The Nikkei fell slightly at the start of the afternoon session, but then recovered and kept climbing.
''The market is consolidating after hitting a 1990 low'' of 23,405.71 last Friday, Tadayasu Hasegawa, an analyst at Kokusai Securities, said after the morning close.
But brokers expect selling pressures this week because September stock index futures contracts will expire Thursday. They see listless trading in anticipation of corporate earnings reports later this month.
''Financial institutions can't make any money in this market, so they're just sitting around,'' said a broker at a large Japanese securities house.
The dollar was lower against most leading currencies after being sold for the yen by dealers in pre-opening trading, dealers said.
The dollar opened at 139.50 yen and 1.5630 marks after closing at 140.05 and 1.5680, respectively, in New York on Friday. It had closed at 140.25 yen and 1.5595 marks here Friday.

HEADLINE: Brady Urges Lower Rates

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept 9,

 BODY:
Asked if he was worried about domestic rates declining while those in Japan and possibly West Germany were headed higher, he said no policy was without risks. The dollar has weakened but its fall is not precipitous, he said. 
Mr. Brady said the American economy was more resilient than many private economists believe. Because the economy has shown some slow growth, it might be more difficult to push it into a recession, he said.
His comments came after being told unemployment had risen to 5.6 percent last month, from 5.5 percent in July.
While acknowledging that surveys show consumer confidence is weakening, Mr. Brady questioned how big an effect the recent oil-price rise would have on consumer purchases. He said previously he did not expect the oil-price rise to push the domestic economy into a recession.

HEADLINE: Ladies' Home Journal Takes Russian Tour

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The issue, which is one of the largest in the magazine's 107-year history, carries interviews with what the magazine calls the 50 most powerful women in America.
 
Building Bridges
Myrna Blyth, the publishing director and editor in chief of The Ladies' Home Journal, said she will fly to Moscow in October for a party to introduce the magazine. The 50 most powerful women in the Soviet Union have been invited the party. 
''We are not doing this to start selling magazines in the Soviet Union as much as to demonstrate the power of women to do such a thing and the power of The Ladies' Home Journal to build bridges in this whole new world,'' Ms. Blyth said.
The venture is a partnership with Novosti, the Soviet press agency, which will distribute the magazines to kiosks throughout the Soviet Union. The magazine will be sold for rubles, which are not convertible to dollars.
Part of the proceeds will be donated to the Children of Crisis Foundation, a charity established by American and Soviet citizens to aid victims of the earthquake in Armenia, and to the Soviet Children's Fund.
 
No Profit for Journal's Owner
The Russian-language insert will be sponsored by Quintessence Inc., which makes Dare fragrance. Ms. Blyth said that the total cost of the Soviet venture had not been calculated but that The Journal, which is owned by the Meredith Corporation, would not make a profit.
Earlier this year, Business Week began publication of Business Week/ USSR, a Russian-language edition of the magazine, for distribution in the Soviet Union. Business Week/USSR is a joint venture between McGraw-Hill and Kniga Publishers of Moscow.
Among other American media ventures in the Soviet Union is a partnership between Rodale Press and an agricultural cooperative in the Soviet Union. One result of the partnership will be Novii Fermer, a magazine similar to Rodale's New Farmer. It is scheduled to begin publication early next year.
Omni, a magazine owned of General Media International, is published in the Soviet Union under an exchange program with the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
And International Data Group of Framingham, Mass., has been publishing PC World USSR in the Soviet Union since 1988.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Latest U.S. Import: a Japanese View of Japan's Economy

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
The 12-page newsletter is a synopsis of what has appeared in the various Asahi Shimbun publications the previous week, emphasizing in-depth analysis and commentary.
 
Explanation of Publication
In the first issue, Eiji Tominomori, managing director of Asahi Shimbun and publisher of Japan Access, wrote, ''Japan Access will explain accurately to its readers the Japanese point of view: how we do business, what we think and feel about our relationship with the United States and, perhaps most important, how we view the future of this relationship and our place in a fast-changing world in which we must compete.''
The newsletter is edited in Tokyo under the direction of Yasunori Asai, its executive editor, and transmitted by satellite to New York, where it is printed. 
Yasushi Hara, Asahi Shimbun's chief representative in New York, said that the initial press run was 10,000 copies but that it would be increased to meet the demand.
Asahi Shimbun already distributes 8,000 copies of the daily newspaper in the United States. Its circulation in Japan is nine million.
Japan Access, which will be published 50 weeks a year, will be sold by subscription only. A one-year subscription costs $250, or $5 a copy, and a half-year subscription is $175, or $7 a copy.
 
A Newsletter in Six Parts
The newsletter will consist of six parts: analysis of the most important news, focusing on politics, government and business; features on topics that especially concern the Japanese, with emphasis on prominent figures in business and government; a column of short items on people, places, trends and ideas; surveys and polls about the mood in Japan; columns on culture and opinion, and a question-and-answer column.
The first issue, for instance, has articles like ''Japan's Trade Surplus: Who Needs It?'' ''Broader Trade, Economic Relations Anticipated,'' ''Japan Demystified: Skyrocketing Land Prices'' and ''Technology: Bug-Free Pantyhose.''

HEADLINE: Either Force Oil Prices Down . . .

BYLINE: By Joseph Stanislaw and Daniel Yergin; Joseph Stanislaw is managing director, and Daniel Yergin is president, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
While these are all sound reasons, they do not begin to match the case for tapping the reserves.
The oil market is currently walking a high wire, highly susceptible to the state of panic the Administration is trying to avoid. Traders are nervous not only about a possible gulf war but also about the approach of winter, when demand for oil rises and ability to switch to natural gas diminishes.
Markets - financial as well as oil - are indicating that they expect the consuming nations to fall off the oil trapeze in October or November. As soon as shooting looks imminent - or it appears that supply will not match demand - the price will really take off, to $40 a barrel and beyond. 
The idea of using the S.P.R. only to avert a physical shortage ignores economic reality. A ''shortage'' at $20 a barrel will disappear at $40 a barrel, as the world economy crashes and consumers cut back sharply on purchases. The fundamental rationale of the international energy emergency system established in the 1970's was to protect economic growth.
Moreover, a persistence of sharply-higher prices will threaten the Administration's geopolitcal objectives. Consumer complaints about gasoline and heating oil prices will send political shock waves that will erode the national consensus on the gulf intervention. Worse, severe inflationary and recessionary effects around the world eventually will raise questions, as Saddam Hussein is hoping, about the costs of the embargo. This could undermine the even more remarkable international consensus that has been forged.
If geopolitical reasoning isn't enough, simple arithmetic should convince us to open the reserves. On paper, we seem to have enough suppplies to replace the four million barrels a day lost in the embargo of Iraq (perhaps with an assist from reduced consumption). But to get that extra oil into the market requires a lot more than the flick of a switch.
Some of the facilities in the exporting countries have been idled for 10 years. Inevitably, there are going to be engineering problems, and, possibly, accidents. Thus, it will be months before the additional suppplies can be brought to the market.
In addition, there can always be further, unforseeable pressures in the market: everything from declining Soviet exports to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The system is very taut. There is no security margin, except for the emergency stocks.
Panic takes a very specific form in the oil market. It always involves the hasty and fevered building of inventories that drives up price. The slightest uncertainty can set the process in motion, sending prices through the roof.
But the process also works in reverse. The best antidote to an upward spiral is the fear among buyers that the oil they are contracting to buy at $40 a barrel will bring $30 a barrel when they sell it two months hence. That's how the S.P.R. can cleverly be used now.
The Administraion could simply announce that the S.P.R. has been activated, run modest demonstration sales and respond to needs as they emerge. Such steps - combined with increasing domestic production and conservation - would send a powerful, calming message to markets and governments around the world.
Of course, there are problems with the S.P.R. Much of the oil has a high-sulfur content, which makes it unsuitable for some domestic refineries. But the same is true of most of the additional oil from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which the Administration is counting on to calm the markets and assure supplies this winter.
The real value of the reserves would be to counteract the inherent tendency to panic. Using it for this purpose would establish a new credibility, showing the markets not only that the S.P.R. exists but that it is going to be part of the energy equation.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bush & Gorbachev Inc.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Conveying to Saddam Hussein the message that Moscow was standing with Washington and the rest of the world was meaningful in itself, of course; the chances of persuading him to pull out of Kuwait depend to a considerable degree on penetrating the Iraqi dictator's tough psychological carapace and making him feel increasingly shunned, cornered, friendless.
But Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev appear to have gone a good deal further than that enterprise in Helsinki. Their meeting may have also marked the beginning of a common search for peace in the turbulent Middle East - a goal that has eluded world statesmen even longer than an end to the cold war did.
The meeting's outcome underlined President Bush's determination to help his beleaguered Soviet friend to show himself a world statesman and his country a player on the world stage when everything is going so badly at home. 
 
A Change in Tone
Only two months ago - at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference and the seven-nation economic meeting in Houston - Administration officials compared sending economic aid to the Soviet Union in its present parlous state to ''pouring money down a rathole.''
The Germans and the French, Mr. Bush himself said, could do what they liked, but he wasn't going to provide much assistance until he saw evidence of thoroughgoing Soviet reform.
The gulf crisis has changed Mr. Bush's tone.
But Mr. Bush gave Mr. Gorbachev something more than financial assurances. The Soviet leader said at Malta that he wanted to build a world - not just a European continent - that would be free from the ''psychological and ideological struggles'' of the last decade, and now Mr. Bush is giving him a chance to get to work.
Just as the United States determined in the years after World War II to help rebuild its foes in that global struggle, Germany and Japan, and to make them allies for the decades ahead, President Bush appears to have committed himself to at least the early steps toward an alliance with the cold war enemy.
Mr. Gorbachev seems to have acquiesced in the strategy because, for the moment, he has little choice.
''Gorbachev is increasingly a general without any troops,'' said Prof. Peter Reddaway of George Washington University, a leading scholar of Soviet affairs. ''The republics are breaking away from central control, and he is even starting to lose his hold on the armed forces. So he can't commit his troops to help in Saudi Arabia.
''But the more he can strut on the world stage, the more he can strike a pose as a moral leader in search of world peace, the more he can cover up his huge domestic difficulties.''
 
Appearances Matter, Too
Dmitri Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie Endowment, said, ''If you can't be a player, the next best thing is to look like a player.''
The Soviet Union has always sought a Middle Eastern role, long proposing a regional peace conference - a proposal the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevadnadze, has renewed since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met last week with the Israeli Foreign Minister, David Levy, neither man ruled out the possibility of such a conference, as long as it was not linked to the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi leader, has also proposed an international peace confrence, but one that would deal specifically with the gulf question in a regional context.
Moscow has been quietly improving its once-distant relations with Israel, the major American strategic ally in the area. Two of the 11 members of the influential Soviet Presidential Council have recently been in Jerusalem, and Mr. Shevardnadze recently had a lengthy meeting in Moscow with Ezer Weizman, the Israeli Science Minister, who is a leading Labor Party dove.
 
Could Help Reduce Tensions
Though Israel could prove a major stumbling block to a Soviet role in the Middle East, Moscow could play a helpful part, from the American point of view, in resolving tensions there.
A former Washington official who asked not to be identified said that he suspected, though he had no firm evidence, that Mr. Bush had already asked Mr. Gorbachev to use his army's influence with Soviet-trained Iraqi officers to discover whether there was any chance of a coup against Mr. Hussein.
And Mr. Simes said that Moscow might be in a position, within the context of a future Middle East peace conference, ''to put the kind of pressure on the Israelis, especially on the Palestine question, that no American President could ever afford to do.''

A front-page news analysis article yesterday about the Helsinki summit meeting referred incorrectly to the Israeli politician Ezer Weizman. He is a former Science Minister, not the current one.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH, REVERSING U.S. POLICY, WON'T OPPOSE A SOVIET ROLE IN MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The first sign of this change was given at the Gorbachev-Bush news conference in Helsinki on Sunday when Mr. Gorbachev said he had a ''secret'' to reveal - that Mr. Bush had confessed that in the past the United States had tried to keep the Soviet Union out of the Middle East but that now he felt that it was important to cooperate. Was Israel Consulted? The officials today called this aspect of the meeting, which was reflected in comments by Mr. Gorbachev and in the two leaders' joint statement, a development that was overshadowed by the two leaders' vow to oppose Baghdad in the immediate crisis and by their apparent divisions over the use of military force.
But it was unclear whether this new American attitude toward Soviet participation in Middle East peacemaking would actually promote movement toward resolution of longstanding Arab-Israeli issues that through the years have resisted various efforts - sometimes including the Soviet Union - at solution. Administration officials freely discussed the latest development today, although they did not seek to call reporters' attention to it themselves. It was not clear whether the United States had discussed its new willingness to accommodate a Soviet diplomatic role in the Middle East with Israel, which has adamantly opposed the idea in the past. 
The Helsinki meeting also produced a clear willingness by Mr. Bush to expand American economic and technical assistance to the Soviet Union in light of Moscow's help in the gulf crisis. At the news conference, Mr. Gorbachev rather testily asserted that his country was not accepting payment for its actions in the crisis. Mr. Bush noted that direct financial aid, like credits and normal tariff treatment, must await the enactment of economic reforms and passage of a long-promised bill allowing unfettered emigration.
But Mr. Bush reiterated his support for perestroika, Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic restructuring, and said, ''This remarkable cooperation that has been demonstrated by the Soviet Union at the United Nations gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible.''
Mr. Gorbachev badly needs Western help. But it was the apparent shift in American Middle East policy that lay behind his obvious delight when he spoke of changes in American attitudes toward his country. The new willingness to work with Moscow in the Middle East, he said, ''does really give me the hope that we'll get by.''
For decades, the United States has believed that the Soviet Union was seeking to foment, not resolve, regional conflicts, but at times in the past Washington was compelled to work with Moscow. More recently, the United States opposed Soviet involvement in Middle East peace efforts because Moscow had not restored diplomatic relations with Israel, which it broke in 1967, and because Washington believed that a foothold for Moscow would stack the deck against Israel because of the Kremlin's close ties to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
 
A New Attitude
But Administration officials said Soviet behavior in the gulf crisis suggested a new attitude. Assuming that new line continues, the United States is prepared not only to make room for the Soviet Union in Middle East diplomacy but perhaps even to work in tandem with the Kremlin, they said.
The United States believes that the Soviet Union could be helpful in resolving the dispute over the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, in bringing peace to Lebanon, in stemming the spread of missile technology in the Middle East and in creating a new security structure for the region once the immediate gulf crisis is over, an official said.
It is too soon to know how expanded Soviet-American cooperation will affect Israel, although Israel is not likely to welcome Soviet involvement in its dispute with the Palestinians and the United States is probably going to have to take pains to meet Israeli concerns.
''There is no blueprint here,'' an official said, ''but there is a recognition that Soviet foreign policy toward regional disputes is changing and that their new thinking deserves to be matched by new thinking here.''
 
Shift in Three Sentences
The apparent shift in policy was contained in three sentences at the end of the joint statement issued by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev in Helsinki.
It said: ''As soon as the objectives mandated by the U.N. Security Council resolutions mentioned above have been achieved and we have demonstrated that aggression does not pay, the Presidents direct their foreign ministers to work with countries in the region and outside it to develop regional security structures and measures to promote peace and stability.
''It is essential to work actively to resolve all remaining conflicts in the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Both sides will continue to consult each other and initiate measures to pursue these broader objectives at the proper time.''
Behind these words, an Administration official said, is the prospect of the first serious American effort to engage the Soviet Union in the Middle East peace process in the 13 years since President Carter backed off a proposal for a multinational peace conference to be jointly sponsored with the Soviet Union in the face of powerful Israeli opposition, and the desire of President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt to deal directly with the Israelis.
The official said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev had reached no specific agreements, but that the last three sentences of the statement were ''intended as a window on the future.''
''There is something potentially significant here,'' he said. ''Though we are not out of the woods on this crisis, people are impressed by and large by Soviet policy to date. People recognize the differences, and assuming this trend continues or even grows, it would be self-defeating not to take this into account when we approach other conflicts.''
 
Baker's Security Plan Cited
The official said the Soviet Union could play a part in American plans, outlined by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d last week, to create a new security umbrella for the gulf. ''Their efforts to participate in, or at least their willingness not to object to, some kind of new security arrangements, could be important,'' the official said.
In the Arab-Israeli conflict, the official said, the Soviet Union could help persuade allies including Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization to reach an accommodation with Israel.
The United States opposes an international peace conference that would link the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to the Arab-Israeli dispute and other issues. But the official said that if the current crisis is resolved, ''one can imagine an international conference, or some type of gathering, in which the Soviet Union and the United States would participate.''
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush both hinted at these prospects at their news conference. Mr. Bush said the common ground between the two countries outweighed their differences and added, ''We will continue to cooperate with President Gorbachev.''
Beaming, Mr. Gorbachev said: ''That last sentence does really give me hope that we'll get by. In our talks, the President said, 'You know, there was a long time when our view was that the Soviet Union had nothing to do in the Middle East.' This was something that we had to talk through during this meeting here in Helsinki, and what was said is that it's very important for us to cooperate in the Middle East, just as it is on other issues of world politics.''
This sort of talk is a powerful symbol for the Soviet Union, which has long been angered by American efforts to cut the Kremlin out of the Middle East peace process.
In December 1973, after the war between Egypt and Israel, the United States and Soviet Union convened a peace conference as co-chairmen in Geneva. But it lasted only a few days, and the United States then did the neogotiating between Israel and the Arabs.
After Mr. Carter's attempt to convene another conference collapsed in 1977, peace efforts shifted to the American-run Camp David process. Throughout the 1980's, the Soviet Union complained that the United States wanted to talk about cooperation in Afghanistan, Angola and Central America, but never the Middle East.
 
Senate Warning on Gulf Aid
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 (AP) - The Senate today approved a resolution threatening a deterioration in United States relations with nations deemed as failing to contribute enough to the effort against Iraq. Japan and West Germany were among countries singled out by irate senators.
The resolution, attached to a spending bill and passed by voice vote, directed President Bush to give Congress a detailed report on the Administration's cost-sharing efforts by Nov. 30.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
As the Iraqis Search for Support, They Will Restore Full Iran Ties <10,813>

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Continuing Process of Reconciliation
The announcement of diplomatic ties adds another layer of accord to the improvement of relations between the two nations, which has included the release of about 50,000 prisoners of war by both sides and the return to Iran of all territory occupied by Iraq during their eight-year war.
The resumption of ties came as United States officials in Washington said that truck convoys from Jordan and Iran had pierced the blockade of Iraq, although in numbers too small to prop up the economy. The worldwide embargo on Iraqi oil exports also continued, although President Saddam Hussein of Iraq offered today to give oil free to developing countries in a move aimed at ending his country's isolation [Page A17.] The Iranian decision to accede to Iraq's requests to resume ties comes as the Iraqis continue seeking to enlist help in the face of the international commercial and military embargo led by the United States. The embargo seeks to force Mr. Hussein to abandon his occupation of Kuwait, and, perhaps, bring about the collapse of his Government.
Iraq wants Iran to send food and medicine, more important, to help sell embargoed Iraqi oil in repayment for the Iranian assistance. 
 
Successful Mission to Teheran
A visit to Teheran by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, came after Mr. Hussein moved last month to put a formal end to the war with Iran, which began in 1980 and halted with a United Nations-brokered cease-fire in 1988.
Although negotiations on a peace treaty had apparently been stalled, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, there were increasing signals that the two countries were engaged in secret talks to move toward a final settlement at Iraq's urging.
While the degree of help that Iran is willing to give Iraq remains unknown, the Iranian press agency quoted Mr. Aziz tonight as describing his talks there as ''positive, serious, practical and friendly.'' The Aziz visit was the first in a decade to the Iranian capital by a senior Iraqi official.
The Iranian press agency went on to say that the Government's reaction to Iraq's formal request for the restoration of normal relations was ''a positive response.'' Iranian officials, it said, had given ''their consent in this connection.''
Iranian officials in Western Europe interviewed tonight by telephone, asked to characterize the future of the relationship with Iraq, said only that the normalization falls within the context of ending the Iran-Iraq war.
Arab and Iranian officials also noted that one official who accompanied Mr. Aziz to the talks was Issam al-Chalabi, the Iraqi Oil Minister. He has been leading an effort to break the embargo on the sale of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude oil.
An Iranian oil-industry official underlined today in a conversation that Iran was one of three members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that refused in August to endorse a decision by the cartel to increase oil output. Iraq and Libya also opposed the resolution, which was inspired by the Saudis and Venezuelans. Libya and Iran have expressed reservations about extending any embargo on Iraq to medicine and essential food.
 
Supplies Would Buoy Iraqis
''At this point, any effort to secure food and medicine would change the equation in Iraq's favor without any question,'' a Paris-based Arab diplomat said today. ''They can put up with the embargo for many months to come if this goes on.''
The resumption of diplomatic ties appears to be one of the final gestures before the signing of a formal peace treaty would put a formal end to hostilities between the two countries.
In return for Iran's cooperation, Iraq has virtually acceded to all of Teheran's conditions for ending the war, including the splitting of the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that is part of the two countries' long border.
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, it had insisted on full control of the waterway, which was its only outlet to the Persian Gulf. Its annexation of Kuwait gave it a Persian Gulf coastline.
Palestinians and Arab diplomatic officials suggested tonight that the Iranian-Iraqi reconciliation could eventually result in an alliance between the two countries.
A Palestinian official who asked not to be further identified said it was ''not farfetched to see an Iraq-Iran-Syria-Libya axis emerging'' in the face of the growing American military buildup in the gulf aimed at Iraq. ''In that region, there are many people who feel the United States is not there to look after Arab interests, but after its own interests,'' the Palestinian said.
 
Little Help From West
Iranian officials would not go that far, but they did say that Teheran's repeated gestures of good will toward the West, including the release of several American hostages held by pro-Iranian terrorists in Lebanon and of other Western hostages, have not been met with reciprocal moves.
''Our oil is still embargoed in the United States,'' an Iranian official said.
It appears from these comments that Teheran officials are pondering the costs and benefits of cooperating with the international embargo, and weighing this against a growing reluctance in their country to appear to favor a big buildup of American forces in the gulf region, even a temporary one.
Iran continued today to reiterate its opposition to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, and the Teheran radio quoted President Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying that Iran saw no contradiction between its position on Kuwait and the resumption of relations with Iraq.
''The Islamic Republic of Iran, keeping to its position toward the region and Kuwait, insists on the need for a comprehensive peace and implementation of agreements between the two countries,'' the Iranian press agency quoted Mr. Rafsanjani as saying.
The talks today in Teheran pave the way for a meeting between President Rafsanjani and President Hussein of Iraq.
 
Question of War Reparations
Experts in Iranian affairs said the heavy losses suffered by Iran in the war would require further concessions and perhaps reparations from Iraq before the Iranian leadership can induce its people to support any acts of cooperation with Iraq.
Given Iraq's predicament, Arab diplomats said they did not at all dismiss the possibility that Baghdad will give Iran oil to pay for such reparations and may collect only partial payment in food and medical supplies.
The Iranian Government may now be pondering the consequences of international anger over breaking the boycott of Iraq, against what many Iranians say are the meager benefits of slowly normalizing ties to the West.
 
U.S. Response Is Mixed
WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 (Special to The New York Times) - The White House said today that Baghdad's attempts to improve relations with Teheran posed no threat to the situation in the Persian Gulf region.
''I don't know that there is anything special to fear about it,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. ''There again, it shows Saddam Hussein is reaching out to a country where he murdered millions of their people. He's grasping at any straw he can find.''
''Iran says it will abide by the sanctions,'' Mr. Fitzwater added. ''We expect them to do that.''
Privately, United States officials expressed some concern over the decision. Some experts said the action could eventually lead Iran to move Iraqi oil through its pipelines for loading onto ships in Iranian ports.
Should that happen, an Administration official said, ''it would make things more difficult'' for supporters of the embargo, and the United States would probably be forced to stop Iranian tankers if the sanctions were to remain effective.

HEADLINE: Its Cash and Tempers Short, Philadelphia Seeks Solvency

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 10

 BODY:
In June, Moody's Investor Service responded to what it characterized as an unrealistic budget by lowering the city's bond rating to Ba, a rating for speculative investments, from Baa, the lowest rating for investment-grade bonds. It was the first time since Boston defaulted on bonds in 1980 that the credit agency had issued a speculative rating for a major city.
The chronic cash shortage, meanwhile, has prompted the officials to talk of such drastic steps as selling prime city property like Veterans Stadium and releasing several hundred prisoners from the crowded jails. Some outside observers have accused city officials of denying financial reality and resorting to accounting gimmicks.
No one can say exactly what would happen if Philadelphia becomes insolvent, but it would likely be forced to lay off employees, default on its debt and, under existing law, rely on the state to manage its finances. Will Other Cities Follow? Philadelphia's problems have no parallel in the nation now, but urban specialists say that if the national economy worsens other cities would follow Philadelphia's lead. ''Clearly, there would be financial emergencies in a number of municipalities across the country,'' said Douglas Peterson, the senior policy analyst for the National League of Cities. 
On Wall Street, investment bankers say that fiscal problems like Philadelphia's, which are occurring at the start of an economic downturn, will be much harder to resolve than those faced by New York, Boston and Cleveland just before the economy began expanding in the 1980's.
Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped navigate New York through its fiscal crisis in the mid-to- late 1970's, said Philadelphia's problems are ''startlingly similar'' to New York's at the time, although the dollar amounts were far larger in New York.
Like Philadelphia, he said, New York had balanced its budget by repeatedly arranging short-term, high-interest loans based on optimistic estimates of tax receipts, and by enacting budgets that did not reflect expenditures that officials knew were looming.
As in many other cities in the Northeast, the underlying cause of Philadelphia's financial problems is the flight of its population to the suburbs. The preliminary 1990 census figures show an estimated 1,535,000 people living in the city, as against 2.1 million in 1950. Most of those leaving have had more money than those who remained, leaving the city with a shrinking tax base but an ever-growing need to provide social services.
 
Politics and Economics
But what sets Philadelphia apart from other cities, many experts say, are the enduring political standoff over the budget and the willingness to use unsound fiscal practices. William J. Stull, chairman of the Department of Economics at Temple University here, said Philadelphia is the first major city to have a fiscal crisis in the last decade because ''here it is substantially a political problem with an economic component.''
He said that unanticipated declines in tax revenues caused by the sluggish economy account for only about 20 percent of the city's deficit of $206 million in a budget of $2.1 billion for the current fiscal year. The rest of the deficit, he contended, represents ''fiscal irresponsibility'' on the part of local officials who supposedly balanced the budget in May.
Under Pennsylvania law, Philadelphia is supposed to balance its budget every year, but deficits have become a chronic problem for several years as the cost of social services, courts and corrections consistently outpaced city revenues. Mayor W. Wilson Goode has repeatedly tried to raise local taxes, already among the highest in the nation, but the City Council has refused, fearing that higher taxes would accelerate the exodus to the suburbs.
 
Services Are Cut Back
Unable to raise more money or reduce services that are mandated by law, the City Council balanced the budget for the fiscal year 1991, which began July 1, by reducing discretionary services, like aid to the homeless and street cleaning, by $65 million. The council's budget, which Mayor Goode permitted to take effect without his signature, also ignored many anticipated expenses, including tax refunds, court settlements and arbitrated wage or benefit increases for city employees.
In August, the city issued a preliminary offering of $400 million worth of short-term notes in anticipation of tax revenues to finance operations until it collected the bulk of its property and business taxes in the winter. The offering disclosed, contrary to the statements of most elected city officials up to this time, that the city anticipated a large budget deficit.
Institutional investors shied away, declining to offer any bids at all. ''The notes don't meet our investment standards,'' said Heidi Baxter, marketing manager for Fidelity Investments. ''We consider them too speculative.'' City officials say they still plan to market the notes this week, and they have been searching for a foreign bank to guarantee the notes. Local banks declined to participate, said Jonathan A. Saidel, the City Controller, who opposes the note sale. ''If we sell the notes, we're still going to have an emergency here, so we might as well come to grips with it first,'' he said. Help From Foreign Banks? Mr. Rohatyn said the plan to seek help from foreign banks reminded him of earlier events. ''Philadelphia's looking for Japanese banks is reminiscent of New York's looking for an Arab sheik to lend the city a billion dollars in 1975,'' he said. ''I wouldn't say the Japanese investors are as mythical as the Arab sheiks were in 1975, but you can't assume that Japanese banks will be any easier to deal with than American banks in gauging the city's credit and the safety of their investment.''
By 1975, Mr. Rohatyn said, New York piled up $5 billion in debt and a $1.5 billion deficit on a $13.5 billion budget. Faced with bankruptcy, the city agreed to let the state oversee its finances in exchange for permission to borrow on the state's credit. The Federal Government, after first balking, agreed to provide guarantees for $1.5 billion in bonds.
''It had no choice, because a bankruptcy of that size would have shaken the banking system,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''There is no chance Philadelphia will get Federal help, because there is no indication the city and state can't take care of it themselves.''
Until now, Philadelphia's officials have had irresolvable differences among themselves and with state officials over the budget problems. To make matters worse, this year and next are election years for nearly all state and city officials, with the big exception of Mayor Goode, a Democrat who cannot seek a third consecutive term next year.
 
Trading Charges of Blame
Most city officials contend that the state does not adequately finance the city's social service programs; most state legislators argue that the city spends too much on these services. Both seem to communicate with each other only through the news media.
On Aug. 20, for example, Mayor Goode gave a speech on television about the city's problems and said he would press the State Legislature to enact his plan for resolving the city's fiscal problems.
Three weeks later, Republican legislators, who control the State Senate, say they have heard nothing from the city. And Democratic legislators, who control the state House of Representatives, say that the Mayor has no plan or that they do not support his fundamental demand for more taing authority.
''It's not just a communication problem,'' said Robert W. O'Donnell, a Philadelphia Democrat and speaker of the House of Representatives. ''There has been a total collapse of a political infrastructure in Philadelphia, and there is no mechanism to carry a plan forward. In any kind of effective political process, there is an underlying set of durable, predictable relationships that people trade on. It does not exist in Philadelphia.''
 
A 1985 Disaster Was Pivotal
Race enters any discussion about Philadelphia politics and Mayor Goode, the city's first black mayor. Many people, including some of the Mayor's supporters, say he has lost credibility and date his problems back to 1985, when the Mayor approved the bombing of the home of the radical group Move. The resulting fire killed 11 people, destroyed 61 homes in the black neighborhood and left 250 people homeless.
Mayor Goode discussed his political problems in an interview this week, but he insisted that his remarks about the financial crisis be off the record because of the pending sale of city notes. ''It is unfortunate that my supporters and nonsupporters can't seem to understand that the people of this city have put the Move situation in perspective and no longer see that as a negative factor in regard to me,'' he said. ''But you cannot overlook the issue of race in politics, and a lot of what's happening now, in terms of not having support from other leaders, is because of my race as well as a pure political struggle over who should control the city.''
In the Mayor's television address, his last public comment on the issue, he said: ''The city is not bankrupt, but it will run low on readily available cash next spring if corrective measures are not taken - and even sooner if we do not obtain temporary loans.''
 
Planning Where to Trim
He said he would prepare a selective freeze on hiring, capital improvements and development projects and would identify all nonessential services that could be suspended.
The Goode Administration plans to send a lobbyist to Harrisburg Sept. 22. Among other things, the Mayor is seeking a tax dedicated to finance mass transit, a sales tax and additional power to withhold wage taxes. The Legislature, many of whose members harbor deep resentment toward Philadelphia and its leaders, has refused to act on these requests in previous sessions.
This package has almost no hope of passing, since the Democratic leadership and Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, say they are looking for a comprehensive plan that has wide local support, and they have begun meeting with city officials. Republican leaders say flatly that they do not trust the city with more money.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Philadelphia's financial problems misstated Boston's fiscal record. The city of Boston did not default on its bonds in 1980; its bond rating was lowered in July 1981 by Moody's Investor Service to Ba, a rating reserved for speculative investments.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS;
A Foe to Be Feared: Prince Yormie Johnson

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Rebel Leaders Split
His involvement in the civil war that began last December stems from the bitter hatred between the Krahns, Mr. Doe's tribe, and the Mano and Gio tribes. Mr. Johnson, whose given name is a common one in Liberia and does not connote royalty, belongs to the Gio tribe.
Mr. Johnson is no stranger to coup attempts against the Doe regime. He was arrested in 1985 during an unsuccessful effort led by Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, but escaped to rejoin other exiles in the Ivory Coast. From there, four years later, the insurgents launched the attack against Mr. Doe. 
Once allied with another rebel leader, Charles Taylor, Mr. Johnson broke ranks this year to create a splinter group. The two men reportedly had a bitter split after Mr. Taylor accused Mr. Johnson of executing several rebels whom Mr. Johnson accused of looting.
Clearly Mr. Johnson has a flair for the dangerously dramatic. It was his threat to arrest foreigners in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, last month that spurred United States marines to evacuate scores of American Embassy officials and their dependents.
Mr. Johnson, who carried out his threat 24 hours after the evacuation and seized a dozen foreigners only to release them unharmed a few days later, said he wanted to provoke foreign intervention to help end the fighting that has claimed the lives of 5,000 people, mostly unarmed civilians.
 
'This Guy Is Dangerous'
While numerically smaller than Mr. Taylor's forces, Mr. Johnson's 600-member faction is considered by many Western diplomats to be more disciplined. Mr. Taylor's force controls most of the country, for example, but Mr. Johnson's guerrillas seized most of Monrovia, leaving Mr. Doe to defend his rule from his fortified seaside mansion.
''This guy is dangerous,'' said a Western official who is familiar with Mr. Johnson's tactics.
For the most part, his tactics have worked. Leaders of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States decided last month to send troops to halt the conflict. In contrast to Mr. Taylor, Mr. Johnson openly welcomed the troops, from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone.
But Western diplomats said that despite Mr. Johnson's pronouncements, it is unclear whether he will relinquish control once elections can be arranged or an interim government is set up by the peacekeeping force.
 
The Son of a Hunter
The son of a Gio hunter, Prince Yormie Johnson was born in Yorcomplay in Nimba County, an area in northeastern Liberia known for its rich iron deposits and industrious people.
Mr. Johnson grew up with an uncle in Monrovia, and was befriended there by an American family attached to the United States Agency for International Development. Friends and Liberian journalists said the family helped him complete St. Samuel High School, a private school in Monrovia.
He joined the Liberian Army in the early 1970's and quickly rose through the ranks as a military policeman and intelligence officer, ultimately attaining the rank of captain. Mr. Johnson is believed to have received some training from American military advisers, including instruction in guerrilla warfare tactics.
After the failed coup attempt in 1985, Mr. Johnson and other exiles regrouped and were frequently heard on British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts condemning the Doe Government, said Joe S. Kappia, a former Liberian journalist who now lives in San Jose, Calif.
The rebels mounted their invasion last December, moving into Nimba County from neighboring Ivory Coast.
 
Fighting Could Drag On
Mr. Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and African ancestry. Americo-Liberians are the descendants of American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.
Western analysts and Liberian-American groups in the United States said that despite the presence of the multinational troops in Liberia, fighting between the two rebel groups could drag on for months.
And with Mr. Johnson's promise of free elections juxtaposed against his violent tendencies, Western officials are not sure which direction he will ultimately choose.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
NATO Members to Weigh Adding Troops to Gulf Force

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Drawing West Europeans In
The move also appeared to be designed to draw the West Europeans more into the military alignment against Baghdad and to help defuse criticism in the United States that only Americans are risking their lives.
The Secretary of State also announced that in light of Moscow's agreement this summer to withdraw all Soviet troops from a united Germany by 1994 - effectively reducing Soviet troops in central Europe to zero - the understanding that the Soviets and Americans reached in Ottawa last February about their future troop levels in Europe was now null and void.
In the Ottawa agreement, the two said that they would reduce their troop levels in central Europe, as part of the conventional arms treaty now being negotiated in Vienna, to 195,000 soldiers each, from their present levels of more than 300,000 each.
''The understandings that were reached in Ottawa have been overtaken by events, and those understandings no longer pertain,'' Mr. Baker said. Mr. Baker said he and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, had agreed on this when they met in August in the Siberian city of Irkutsk. 
Mr. Shevardnadze said Sunday in an interview with Cable News Network that the Soviet Union does not expect the United States to reduce its troops in Europe to zero, after the Soviets do, but that Soviet officials do expect a cut in American forces to far below 195,000. He and Mr. Baker will begin negotiating a new understanding when the two meet in Moscow starting Tuesday.
 
Troops Not Available Soon
The troop accord could take weeks to negotiate and much longer to be completed and approved in treaty form, and thus it is not likely to make any more American forces available for the Persian Gulf crisis in the near future.
In the news conference after the NATO meeting today, Mr. Baker also announced that all of the pledges of financial support from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which he elicited last week, had been formally received by American embassies in the gulf region. The pledges amount to $12 billion dollars by the end of the year, he said. This will be split 50-50 between the United States and the poor Middle Eastern nations, like Syria, Egypt and Turkey, that have joined the coalition against Iraq but are suffering economically.
A substantial part of the $6 billion in aid to the United States will be in fuel, water, food and other essential materials, Mr. Baker said. Considering that Mr. Baker told Congress last week that the American military operation in the gulf would add $6 billion to the Pentagon budget by the end of 1990, it means that the Administration can say to the American people that there will be little cost to the United States Treasury from the gulf operation.
Mr. Baker said he had told his NATO colleagues that this financial assistance pointed ''to a central fact of the responsibility-sharing effort: Money is not enough.''
''The billions of dollars pledged are invaluable,'' he said. ''But all the money in the world cannot create the airlift and sealift capabilities required today to move heavy forces into place and to return refugees home. The industrialized democracies of Europe and Asia who have extensive airlift and sealift capabilities can help by making ships and planes available for this critical need.''
Mr. Baker said he had received the following new commitments today:
* West Germany, which says it is prohibited by its Constitution from dispatching troops abroad, will send additional airlift and sealift support.
* The Netherlands will contribute additional equipment for combating chemical and biological warfare.
* Belgium will send aircraft to Egypt to help evacuate refugees from Kuwait and will also provide 20,000 tons of food aid for Egypt.
* Norway will provide additional humanitarian aid to refugees and will respond to specific military requests after a debate by its Parliament.
* Greece's merchant marine committed three sealift vessels.
* Denmark pledged to supply garage ships for transporting vehicles and Egyptian troops.
Mr. Baker concluded by saying these were only the measures he felt comfortable listing in public, suggesting that others could not be disclosed.
Beside this appeal for transport assistance, though, Mr. Baker said he had told his NATO colleagues that Washington would ''welcome additional ground-based forces in the region should any of the countries around the table seek to send them.''
''We would welcome it, even if it were only symbolic,'' he said.
The NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, indicated that all the members agreed to consider the American request seriously, saying: ''There was a unanimous conviction that can and should still be done. The allies will consider and study favorably these requests.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Baker Will Go to Syria For Help Against Iraqis

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Sept. 10

 BODY:
''Syria has been very supportive of the international effort that has been made to isolate Saddam Hussein,'' Mr. Baker said at a news conference at NATO headquarters. ''They have been supportive, obviously, of the U.N. resolutions, and they are supportive of the United States presence in Saudi Arabia.''
Syria has a great deal to offer the campaign against Saddam Hussein. To begin with, President Assad and President Hussein are bitter foes who have been plotting against one another for years. Syrian intelligence services are believed to have cultivated agents within Iraq and among Iraqi opposition movements, most of whom are now based in Damascus. They could prove very useful in any attempt to destabilize the Hussein regime. 
Equally important, Mr. Assad's Arab nationalist credentials are widely respected, and if he is joining the movement against Mr. Hussein, and even sending troops to fight alongside the Americans, it sends a powerful legitimizing signal in the Arab world for the effort. #3,200 Commandos in Saudi Arabia Syria has sent roughly 3,200 commandos to Saudi Arabia, and in return the Saudis have given Syria generous economic aid, the amount of which has not been disclosed.
''It is important,'' Mr. Baker said, ''that we have a face to face discussion of the situation in the gulf and how we might be able to cooperate to achieve what happen to be mutual goals. That does not mean that the formally strained relations are cured overnight, and it does not mean that we don't have some differences and won't continue to.''
In announcing his trip to Damascus, Mr. Baker also disclosed that Washington had appealed to Iran, which reopened diplomatic relations with Baghdad today, to engage in a similar dialogue with the United States. Thus far, he said, all that the Iranians have responded through third-party diplomatic channels was, ''Thank you for the message.''
''Would we welcome anything Iran could do to assist in the isolation of Saddam Hussein?'' Mr. Baker said. ''You bet we would. Has this been communicated to Iran? You bet it has. Would we go to Teheran today? No. We do not have relations at all with Iran, for reasons which are well known.''
By going to Damascus to court Mr. Assad, the Administration would seem to be inviting questions about whether in its zeal to roll back Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait it is sacrificing human-rights principles. A similar desire to punish Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Iran led the Reagan and Bush Administrations to provide aid and military intelligence and food aid to Mr. Hussein's Iraq for years.
 
On Department's Terrorism List
Syria has been on the State Department's annual list of governments supporting terrorism for several years, along with Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Libya and the former Government of South Yemen, which merged with Yemen this year. Iraq, by contrast, was added to that list only last week.
The State Department's handbook ''Patterns of Global Terrorism,'' published in April 1990, states, ''Both Syria and Syrian-occupied Lebanon remain sanctuaries for a wide variety of international groups that have engaged in terrorism,'' including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command - which is widely suspected of masterminding the Pan Am flight 103 bombing.
But for years, American Secretaries of State have been prepared to overlook some of the more violent characteristics of Mr. Assad's Government -which in February 1982 suppressed a Muslim revolt in the town of Hama by killing some 20,000 of its inhabitants -to enlist Damascus's support for Arab-Israeli peacemaking efforts, help in stabilizing Lebanon or assistance in securing the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
When Mr. Baker was asked if he had any qualms about warming relations with Syria, he responded categorically. ''We are not embracing Syria and everything that it has done,'' Mr. Baker said. ''We talk to a lot of people with whom we have disagreements. It is important to show the extent to which Iraq is isolated in its unprovoked aggression.''
The Secretary said he would not be visiting Israel on this trip, but pointed out that he met with Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, in Washington last week.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Trade Violations Are Called Too Small to Prop Up Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
''The first point is that we've shut off the ocean routes,'' said a Bush Administration official who is following the crisis. ''That's the key to the embargo's overall effectiveness. And one reason we've been so effective is that people know what will happen to their ships if they go into that area.'' 
 
Ships Intercepted
That official said the Administration regards the naval blockade as more important than the sealing of overland routes because it shuts off Iraq's ability to export oil, and therefore denies President Saddam Hussein the money Iraq needs to buy food and other goods.
France said today that its ships had stopped five vessels on the high seas since its navy began enforcing the trade embargo on Aug. 28. The United States has also intercepted ships and has briefly impounded one.
Jordan remains the prime route for goods entering Iraq, officials said, but what had been a steady flow of trucks across Jordan to the Iraq border slowed to a trickle by this week. The Jordanian port of Aqaba is ''pretty much shut down'' as an entry point for Iraq-bound goods, one official said.
Jordan's ruler, King Hussein, has moved more openly toward complying with the sanctions since he was assured of international assistance to offset the loss of trade with Iraq.
Iran, the only other neighboring nation that has voiced some support for Iraq in the gulf standoff, has permitted smugglers to conduct a flourishing trade across the two nations' border.
In addition, several convoys ''involving long-distance trucks which the Iranian Government probably knows about'' also have crossed into Iraq in the last two weeks, one Government official said. Iran has indicated that it would allow some food to reach Iraq, but it was not known what the truck convoys carried.
 
General Compliance by Iran
With the exception of those apparent violations, however, the Iranian Government has generally complied with the United Nations embargo, Administration officials said.
In Brussels today, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was asked whether the United States would welcome Iran's help in enforcing the embargo and replied, ''You bet we would.''
While Administration experts profess to be delighted with the success of the sanctions, the most easily measurable impact, on Iraq's food supplies, has yet to be keenly felt, experts say.
Iraq's agricultural output has been anemic recently, said Patrick L. Clawson, an expert on the Iraqi economy at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. But the Iraqi Government has increased incentives for farmers this summer, and the next harvest is likely to be large, he said.
According to a report from the agricultural attache at the American Embassy in Baghdad, Iraqi Government stockpiles held about 1.2 million tons of wheat, barley, corn and rice in July. Human and animal consumption of these staple grains is estimated to be about 500,000 tons a month.
 
Humanitarian Shipments
Western diplomats have said repeatedly that starving Iraq is not a goal, and the United Nations embargo allows shipments of food and medicine for humanitarian purposes.
There were tentative signs today that Iraq was beginning to feel the economic pinch. President Hussein sought to break the prohibition on exports of Iraqi oil, offering to supply the oil free to any third-world country that would run the blockade of Iraqi ports.
The Government also toughened its price controls, threatening 15-year prison sentences to merchants who try to profiteer from food shortages. The Government also gave permission for all Iraqis to plant wheat, corn and rice on Government-owned land.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Iraq Offers Free Oil to Nations That Run Embargo

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Self-Service Delivery
He said that because of the embargo, Iraq would be unable to deliver the oil and that the other countries would have to send ships to pick it up.
Despite the pinch of rising oil prices, it seems doubtful that any developing country would take up Mr. Hussein's offer and run the risk of losing vessels to the armada of international warships that has quarantined Iraq. Insurance companies have stopped issuing coverage for ships destined for Iraq and almost all the sea traffic has halted.
In his brief television message, the latest of what has been a series of statements to the world, Mr. Hussein contended that his proposal would not violate the embargo because the oil was a gift and ''does not involve any buying or selling.'' 
The United Nations resolution imposing the embargo, however, makes no mention of the cost of goods, but merely prohibits their transport from or entry into Iraq.
In Baghdad today, thousands of Iraqis took part in protest demonstrations outside the United States and British embassies that were certainly approved if not fully inspired by the Government.
The protesters burned effigies of President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and carried signs expressing defiance of the economic blockade.
''No surrender even if we starve to death,'' read one sign. ''The economic blockade will fail, and Iraq will triumph,'' read another.
In London, British diplomats announced that the United States and Britain planned to charter another Iraqi Airways jet to fly British and American women and children from Baghdad to London, as part of an exodus that began more than a week ago.
After holding thousands of Europeans and Asians hostage for nearly a month, Mr. Hussein decreed last week that women and children could leave Iraq but that most men would have to stay behind as human shields to deter an attack by the allied forces in Saudi Arabia and nearby waters.
After several delays, groups of mostly women and children have started to depart from Baghdad. The latest group of women and children, a total of 438 people, including 165 Americans and 186 Britons, landed in London on Sunday.
 
Boycott Beginning to Be Felt
Mr. Hussein has tried several maneuvers to circumvent the embargo, which has been in effect a little more than a month and is beginning to be felt in Bagdhad, according to reports from travelers and diplomats. Bread, rice, sugar and other basic foods are being rationed, and many restaurants have either closed or begun offering limited meals.
Last week, the Ambassadors of Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Baghdad and told that the Government could no longer provide food for the tens of thousands of Asian citizens working in Iraq.
Instead, Mr. Hussein urged that the Asian countries confront the embargo by trying to ship food to Iraq for their own people.
 
Milk Can Be Found
Last week, he said in another television message, also read by an announcer, that children in Iraq were dying because of shortages of milk and medicines. The Iraqi leader has made prominent use of the fate of children, both Iraqi and foreign, in his public comments. Diplomats in Iraq said they had seen no evidence that Iraqi youngters were being deprived of milk.
A woman shopping in a neighborhood grocery store in Baghdad last week said that milk and some European-made baby foods were not available in all stores, but that with persistence they could be found.
 
The Broadcast Message
In his television message, Mr. Hussein said the developing countries need not pledge support for Iraq to get free oil.
''This decision,'' he said, ''was made irrespective of the stands you have taken toward the current crisis because we are understanding of your attitudes, and we do understand that there are differences of views and positions.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Junior Partner No More, Gorbachev Raises Role to Major Player in Crisis

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 10

 BODY:
By all indications, his desire was to tie the Soviets more tightly into the international consensus, to send to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq the picture of a solid front, not to open a new one.
In their joint communique on Sunday, the two Presidents remained in harmony on the ultimate objective: the application of international pressure until Iraq has carried out an unconditional retreat.
Mr. Bush could also feel satisfied that the statement included nothing to tie his hands if he decided to authorize military measures against Iraq. By not foreclosing the use of military force, the joint statement can be understood to mean that Moscow will not make a fuss if that is the option Mr. Bush chooses. 
But if Mr. Bush hoped for some more explicit closing of the ranks, he was disappointed.
On the contrary, Mr. Gorbachev was careful not to limit in any way his ability to maneuver as an intermediary.
First, he has made no commitment to involve the Soviet military in the gulf crisis. Indeed, in their news conference Sunday night, Mr. Gorbachev took pains to distance himself from any prospective military options.
 
Winning and Losing Points
Joining the military encirclement of Iraq would have won Mr. Gorbachev points with the White House, but it would have cost him at home - with his war-weary public and his Islamic minority - and narrowed his channels of communication with Iraq.
Second, he got a promise that the American troops massing in Saudi Arabia would not stay on after the crisis is resolved.
Mr. Gorbachev never showed much evidence of being personally worried on this score, but it has caused some anxiety among his military, and among some of the Arab nations that Mr. Gorbachev is cultivating.
The official Tass press agency, in its commentary today on the summit, singled out Mr. Bush's pledge: ''The Helsinki summit has answered the question that alarmed not only the Arabs but all the world - do certain Washington circles intend to exploit the present situation for perpetuating their military presence in the gulf area? President Bush replied unequivocally and with a sense of full responsibility that the Administration has no such plans.''
Third, Mr. Gorbachev underscored his insistence that the Iraq crisis is part of the broader Middle East problem, along with the Israeli-Palestian dispute and the civil war in Lebanon.
Mr. Bush sees this linkage as a recipe for delay, a sign of weakness in the face of Mr. Hussein. Mr. Gorbachev apparently feels that linkage could offer Iraq a face-saving excuse to retreat. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union has already suggested that he may visit Iraq to pursue such a deal.
Fourth, Mr. Gorbachev resisted pressure from Mr. Bush to make a show of withdrawing his military trainers and technicians from Iraq, though he may do so gradually. The Soviets have argued that if these contract experts are pulled out, Iraq might retaliate by seizing Soviet hostages.
 
Bristling at Condescension
Finally, the Soviet leader went out of his way to dispel the impression that the Soviet Union was surrendering its freedom of action because of the lure of Western economic aid.
When President Bush condescendingly observed that Moscow's cooperation on Iraq ''gets me inclined to recommend as close cooperation in the economic field as possible,'' Mr. Gorbachev fairly bristled in replying that Soviet foreign policy would not be ''bought for dollars.''
How Mr. Gorbachev will choose to use his independence remains to be seen, but the political risks in taking on the role of intermediary are minimal.
His own compatriots are preoccupied with their economic woes, and do not much care whether he succeeds or fails in extricating the world from the gulf crisis, as long as he does not get Russians killed in the process of trying.
 
Potential Reward
Worldwide, the optimism about a diplomatic settlement brokered by the Soviet Union is not high. There are no great expectations to be let down.
And if Mr. Gorbachev succeeds in claiming credit for a resolution of the gulf crisis, the potential reward is substantial.
At his news conference on Sunday, Mr. Gorbachev almost crowed about an invitation from President Bush to participate more actively in the Middle East:
''In our talks, the President said, 'You know, there was a long time when our view was that the Soviet Union had nothing to do in the Middle East - had no business being there.'
''This was something that we had to talk through during this meeting here in Helsinki. And what was said here is that it's very important for us to cooperate in the Middle East, just as it is on other issues of world politics.''
Though Administration officials today professed to welcome a new Soviet partnership in the Middle East, Mr. Bush may merely have meant that the Soviets are welcome to play a supporting role in the region as long as they see things the American way and do not tilt the balance against Israel.
But if Gorbachev is perceived as helping resolve the current crisis, his claim to a substantial role in the region will not depend on an invitation from the White House.

HEADLINE: Population Decline in Rural America: A Product of Advances in Technology

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCRANTON, Iowa, Sept. 7

 BODY:
''It looks like a ghost town,'' said Bill Gibson, a 74-year-old farmer, whose grandfather broke ground on the family's land with a team of oxen in the middle of the 19th century. ''I sure miss the people.''
 
Census Tells the Story
The 1990 census has put into numbers what people in small towns around the country have been experiencing through so many sad farewells. The American small town, which has long occupied a revered place in the nation's history and mythology, is becoming something of a museum piece. 
''The image of the all-American small town is deeply implanted in our national psyche,'' said Calvin Beale, a demographer for the Agriculture Department. ''But small towns and the countryside are in grave trouble. In an economic sense, a lot of these little places just aren't needed anymore.''
The preliminary Census Bureau numbers show that rural regions saw sharper losses than expected in the last decade, fueled partly by the farm crisis. Between 1980 and 1990, the population of Iowa declined 5.1 percent, a deeper loss than in any other state and 1.5 percent sharper than demographers had predicted. In Wyoming, the decline was 3.9 percent more than had been projected.
But the agricultural recession in the 80's has simply accelerated a trend away from rural areas that has gone on since the turn of the century.
In 1950, about 44 percent of Americans lived on farms and in small towns. That number has declined to about 23 percent. Big cities have been losing ground, too. The most dramatic growth has come in the suburbs, which have essentially replaced the small town as the quintessential American hometown.
 
Main Streets Die Out
For the most part, small towns emerged as commercial centers for farmers. But technological advances, starting with the tractor, and other economic forces have increased the size of farms and cut the number of farmers. As a consequence, there are fewer customers for the cafes, bars and clothing stores that once filled the main streets of small towns.
Demographers say small towns within a reasonable distance of metropolitan areas, like ones in DeKalb County near Chicago and in Putnam County near New York City, will survive, even prosper, as people search for cheaper housing and smaller schools. But if these small towns become popular, they will essentially become suburbs themselves, the next ring in an ever-expanding metropolitan area.
Even as people move to suburbs and bigger towns, Americans are more likely to say that small towns are the best places to live.
A year ago, the Gallup Organization asked people if they would prefer to live in a city, suburb, small town or farm. Small towns were the choice favored by 34 percent; 24 percent chose a suburb; 22 percent picked a farm, and 19 percent favored a city. Four of the five respondents lived in a metropolitan area.
 
A Change in Society
''People in metropolitan areas tend to either romanticize or ridicule life in small towns,'' said Charles H. Hassebrook, a policy analyst for the Center for Rural Affairs, a private research and advocacy organization in Walthill, Neb. ''Neither of the stereotypes fit.''
But the decline in rural areas will diminish the larger society, he said. ''At a wedding in a small town, you can find the lawyer, the banker and the guy who changes tires at the gas station,'' he said. ''I don't think you find that in many metropolitan areas. And it would be a shame to lose that sense of egalitarianism.''
The losses have been deep in Iowa, a state that is heavily dependent on the farm economy. Here in Greene County, about 80 miles northwest of Des Moines, the population has dropped 17 percent since 1980, to about 10,000.
''$1,000 Reward!!'' reads the headline on a poster in a card shop in Jefferson, the county seat. Underneath, it promises the payment to anyone who can help attract an employer who would provide at least 15 jobs.
''You've got to be innovative,'' said Mike Coyne, the economic development chief for Jefferson. ''You can't just give in to the trends and wait for the demise.''
 
Success With Tofu
In this county, where the rich black earth yields millions of bushels of corn and soybeans, civic leaders have scored a victory with tofu.
A Japanese company has announced plans to build a soyflake plant near Jefferson, using a new process that will turn soybeans into flakes that can be converted instantly into tofu. The plant would employ about 25 workers.
Iowa officials say the state's economy has turned the corner. They cite an unemployment rate that has dipped below 4 percent, rebounding farm prices and an upturn in the meatpacking industry. ''It's not like people are packing up the cars like in the 'Grapes of Wrath' times,'' said Harvey Siegelman, the state's chief economist.
As in Iowa, many rural areas are hemorrhaging, as young people typically seek jobs far from home. The average age in Greene County is over 50. Enrollment at Scranton High School dipped so low that the school was closed in 1987, and students were sent to Jefferson, about 10 miles to the east. Even so, Jefferson's school enrollment has dropped by nearly half since 1980.
In trying to curtail the exodus, Mr. Seigelman said the state was considering the campaign slogan, ''Don't let your kids take your grandchildren elsewhere.''
 
Some Come Back Home
And some have returned home, for reasons from family ties to fear of earthquakes. Clara Beth Shockey, 66 years old, returned from San Francisco last year after the quake there.
After 17 years away from Greene County, Cheryl Nailor and her husband, Roger, returned to Scranton. Ms. Nailor found work as a librarian. Mr. Nailor works for the local bank.
''We're some of the lucky ones,'' said Mrs. Nailor, the only woman from the Scranton High School class of 1968 who lives here now. ''We wanted to raise our children in the small-town atmosphere.''
Mrs. Nailor's brother, Dennis Hoyt, was forced to leave farming in 1985, during the agricultural recession. He now lives in Quincy, Ill., where the population of 45,000 is nearly 100 times that of Scranton.
''It was tough to leave. said Mr. Hoyt, who works for a farm management company. ''My family, my history is there. But I've appreciated some of what our family has been exposed to. We take in cultural trips to St. Louis and Springfield. Our kids have greater opportunities in sports and other things at school. My wife works at the community college.
''Things have gone well. But I would never rule out returning.''

HEADLINE: What Congress Can't Ignore

 BODY:
The Government certainly needs a budget, and getting one won't be easy. The crisis in the Persian Gulf has created enormous uncertainties, particularly in spending for defense and foreign aid. Any overall agreement between the White House and Congressional leaders still faces fractious debate among members of both parties, compounded by everyone's growing nervousness over the state of the economy. 
After months of posturing on all sides, there are now just 20 days before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct 1. And if the necessary work isn't done by then, there will have to be big cutbacks in all manner of Federal programs under the arbitrary strictures of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. In any event, America's procrastinating politicians present a sorry spectacle of irresolute leadership.
But while the budget is bound to dominate what's left of the 101st Congress, there is more to be done. Much more. Except for the savings and loan bailout package, last year's opening session was woefully unproductive. This year's concluding session was going to make up for it.
At last, there would be child care legislation for the working poor. At last, there would be a fundamental rewriting of the Clean Air Act. A landmark civil rights bill would restore teeth to job bias laws weakened by Supreme Court decisions. And it even seemed possible that Congress might approve meaningful reform in campaign financing, not least because so many of its members had been profoundly embarrassed by their past pandering to savings and loan interests.
There's more: the pending investigations of the so-called ''Keating five'' Senators for their savings and loan meddling, and of Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York for alleged meddling in housing contracts. And there's also the not-so-trivial matter of confirming or rejecting Judge David Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court.
Notwithstanding the importance of the budget and Iraq, all these pieces of business ought to be completed this year. If they're not, each one must start again through the 102d Congress. None of them, save perhaps child care, have a substantial bearing on the 1991 budget, and none relate to the gulf crisis. They could be handled in a lame duck session if necessary; skittish members always prefer to make tough choices after elections rather than before. It would be far better, however, and more responsible, if Congress completed its work in the regular session.
Finishing this agenda provides a truer test of the effectiveness of Congress's new Democratic leaders, House Speaker Thomas Foley and the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, than all the muscle-flexing over spending and taxes. Given leadership, and the will to act, the members of the 101st Congress can get their work done in time for adjournment in early October. If they do, they'll have built a creditable record to campaign on. If they don't, they will have no one to blame but themselves if the voters elect someone else.

HEADLINE: New York Can Be Made to Work

BYLINE: By Felix Rohatyn; Felix Rohatyn, a partner with Lazard Freres & Co., is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corp.

 BODY:
The workforce has grown by more than 50,000 people in the last 10 years. In the same period, labor contracts have grown generously, both in compensation and benefits. This is not the profile of a city without means, even though the needs to be met are also considerable.
Despite the growth in the workforce and its compensation, city services and the quality of life have declined. Thus, we need to question the city's overall wage and personnel policy. A test of the city's willingness to challenge past practices occurs in this year's labor negotiations. 
The 1991 budget deficit of $1.3 billion was closed with almost $900 million in new taxes, almost $300 million in surpluses from the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the balance in various types of savings. These actions cannot be repeated forever. Clearly, with the sharp deterioration in the city's economy, another budget gap of considerable proportions is looming. It could be well in excess of $1 billion, even $1.5 billion, without any increase in labor costs. Dealing with these deficits will be the Dinkins Administration's major challenge.
The city must develop an economic and management philosophy in setting wage and personnel policies. Failure to do so, in the highly uncertain economic environment, could result in a roller-coaster of layoffs and service cuts, damaging both the city and its employees.
To begin with, the city's 1.5 percent increase for labor costs, included in this year's budget, is more than the city can afford and probably less than the unions can settle for. The city could not find the $30-$50 million required to hire 1,000 additional policemen and had to finance these additions by piecemeal cutbacks in everything from education to libraries.
With today's lagging economy, the right approach is clear: a one-year freeze in total labor costs, while a clearer picture about the economic outlook is afforded, and while the city negotiates a different wage and personnel policy with its unions.
Nothing would be more destructive to the city's economy than an across-the-board labor settlement at rates the city cannot afford. Inevitably, this would be followed by widespread layoffs six months or a year from now or by further tax increases, which will drive more people out of town. Instead, the city needs to establish priorities among its working force and allocate its resources accordingly.
Thus, if crime control and public safety are the city's first priority, then, instead of hiring 1,000 policemen now and probably more later, the city should decide how many policemen are needed to do the job. If it's 5,000, then those 5,000 policemen should be hired and the funds taken away from lower priority functions, such as clerical. This can be accomplished by freezing the salaries of less essential workers, attrition and layoffs, or a combination of these. Reducing the size of the workforce need not mean fewer services; that is the challenge for city managers.
Public education deserves an equally high priority. If the city needs to increase teacher salaries, then the Schools Chancellor, Jospeh Fernandez, should be asked to reduce as drastically as possible the bureaucracy at 110 Livingston Street and the budgets of the local school boards.
It is always tempting to say, ''Increase taxes to pay for cops.'' Everyone wants cops. But then why not increase taxes to pay for teachers. Everyone wants teachers. But we have just had a $900 million tax increase and, in New York today, every form of human activity is taxed to the hilt. Before the city adds to the tax burden, New Yorkers will have to be given a credible, long-term plan for the city's economy and the structure of its services.

HEADLINE: $1 Billion a Year for New Jersey's Poorest Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:

 
'Tough' Scrutiny Promised
After this analysis, the teams and school principals and teachers will draw up new programs tailored to each building's needs. Both these programs and the new money to finance them must be approved by Dr. Ellis before the programs start and the first increase in state aid arrives next September.
''I will approve no program unless I believe it has a reasonable chance of success,'' Dr. Ellis said in an interview. ''It is imperative the money be well-spent. I don't want it to go into administration. I don't want it to go into overhead. We intend to be quite tough on this point.'' 
In moving to send more money into the poorer school districts, New Jersey is entering an unsettled debate among education experts over whether spending more money by itself can insure better education and higher achievement by students.
In a ruling last June that ordered the state to make sure that spending in its 30 poorest districts was comparable to that in its wealthiest, the New Jersey Supreme Court suggested that broader socio-economic changes might be needed to insure true educational opportunity.
 
Performance to Be Checked
Dr. Ellis and other education aides express confidence, but make no guarantees, that pouring money into these districts will result in better student performance. Three areas in particular will be closely watched, he said: test scores, dropout rates and attendance.
A variety of new programs will be covered by the new aid. They include pre-kindergarten and other programs to help very young children; longer school days; broader summer school programs; the state's first tests to measure student grasp of history, English, science, geography, mathematics and other specific subjects; tutoring by peers; alternative education for high-risk students, and more extensive parental involvement in programs.
In addition Dr. Ellis stressed that his aides would challenge principals and teachers in all 435 schools to offer ''innovative ways'' to improve education.
''We have every expectation that we'll see substantial improvements,'' said Carl E. Van Horn, Governor Florio's director of policy and an author of the Quality Education Act, the new state law creating the urban education program.
 
Results 'by the Year 2000'
''I don't think it's fair to look for dramatic results in six months or a year,'' Dr. Ellis said. ''But by the year 2000, we should have world-class schools for every child in New Jersey, and that would mean very comparable scores for the urban, suburban and rural districts. We'll march toward that at a measured pace.''
The 30 poorer districts, which serve about 25 percent of New Jersey's 1.1 million students, include troubled large districts like Newark, Camden, Paterson and Jersey City; smaller cities like New Brunswick, Perth Amboy and Asbury Park, where students have performed relatively well despite a lack of broad course offerings and well-equipped laboratories available to students in wealthy districts; and urban hubs like Phillipsburg, Vineland, and Pleasantville in sparsely settled, outlying areas.
For this academic year, the 30 districts are receiving $1.3 billion of New Jersey's total education aid package of $3.5 billion, state figures show. Under the Quality Education Act, the 30 will receive $2.28 billion in the 1995-96 school year.
 
Multimillion Increases Due
Those getting the biggest increases over the five years will be Newark, up $189.4 million to nearly $500 million; Camden, up nearly $110 million to $216 million; Paterson, up $104.4 million to $223.3 million, and Jersey City, which the state now runs, up $99 million to $213.4 million.
In its June ruling on equalizing school financing, the state's high court found the gap between property values - and consequently spending for each pupil - was widest between the 30 districts and the state's 54 richest. The state was ordered to put the 30 on a spending par with the 54.
But the Quality Education Act, enacted about two weeks after the ruling, overhauled the state's entire financing formula in search of far broader equity. Besides the 30 poorest districts, Governor Florio's new law gives 316 other districts, most of them urban and rural, millions in new aid from a new $1.3 billion state income-tax increase.
The law also imposes a state aid cut of $284 million on 232 richer districts between mid-1992 and mid-1996, and it requires all districts to pay teachers' pensions and Social Security costs, now about $900 million, for the first time.
 
Rise of Tax Protests
The law has led to a widening tax protest by residents and deep resentment in the richer districts over looming cuts in state aid.
In its June ruling, the State Supreme said money alone had not cured all the ills of urban education and suggested the state address housing, employment, child care, welfare and other factors in the urban environment that shape students' lives and determine their educational needs.
Dr. Ellis said he had approached other departments in state government about creating ''parent academies.'' He defined them as coordinated, multi-service offices offering parents help on child-rearing, nutrition, school and social issues, job training and placement and health care. He said crime, drug abuse, poverty and rundown housing created an ''overwhelming oppressive environment'' in some cities.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Crime Remedy: 'Produce the Police, Period'

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Sept. 10

 BODY:
But Mr. Cuomo did not address the question of how to pay for more police, a question that has occupied Mayor David N. Dinkins and the New York City Council for weeks. The Governor said he would discuss the issue further in a speech on Tuesday before the Citizens Crime Commission in Manhattan.
 
Criticism from Rinfret
In that speech, Mr. Cuomo is expected to call for 5,000 police officers to be added to the city's force, at a cost of about $250 million a year. He is also expected to announce that he will send 100 state troopers to the city to help fight crime. 
With his remarks today and his speech on Tuesday, the Governor appeared to be trying to quiet critics who have recently questioned his response to the city's latest wave of violence.
Mr. Cuomo, who has often responded to news events with a news conference of his own, has been uncharacteristically reserved on the city's crime problems. This prompted his Republican challenger for governor, Pierre A. Rinfret, to charge last week, ''This man refuses to speak out about any important issue facing New Yorkers, most especially the violence in our communities.''
The Governor's remarks today came one day after Mayor Dinkins, also stung by criticism, delivered an address on crime urging New Yorkers to participate in the fight against street violence. And in another indication that speaking out against crime has become a political imperative, both the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, today held news conferences to call for tougher law enforcement.
 
Cuomo Defends Dinkins
But even while addressing the subject today, Mr. Cuomo seemed eager to maintain some distance from the crime problem, repeatedly saying that it was the responsibility of the Mayor and the City Council to come up with solutions - and ways to finance them.
''The judgments need to be made by the city,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''You cannot pre-empt the City Council and the Mayor and say, 'Move over, pal, I think I can do this better.' We will be supportive, but they have to make the judgment as to what their fiscal, economic and safety situation requires.''
Mr. Dinkins has been criticized recently for what some consider a failure to express sufficient outrage over the latest rash of killings in the city. After a 22-year-old Utah man, Brian Watkins, was killed on a subway platform last week, Mr. Dinkins pledged to try to express his anger more effectively.
But Mr. Cuomo today defended the Mayor, saying that while Mr. Dinkins might express his outrage ''differently,'' he is ''constantly appearing, speaking after every tragedy, as I do.''
Dinkins administration officials said today that they were gratified by Mr. Cuomo's desire to help, but said his remarks did not seem to advance the debate very far.
''There's no doubt that the Mayor plans to increase the size of the police force,'' the First Deputy Mayor, Norman Steisel, said. ''But we have said all along that the question is, how do you pay for it?''
At today's news conference, the Governor refused to address that question directly. Last year, Mr. Cuomo said he would support an anticrime ''superfund'' to be financed through a surcharge on New York City income taxes. The Governor said today that he would still support such a plan, but noted that the Dinkins administration has already imposed an income-tax surcharge just to cover existing programs.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Attacks U.S. Priorities

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 10

 BODY:
Mr. Cuomo contended that the Bush and Reagan Administrations had forced state and local governments to raise taxes by slashing Federal aid to programs aimed at attacking national social problems, like drugs, education and homelessness.
''That creates a tension between the needs of states to raise revenues for unmet problems and the need to create congenial tax policies in order to attract and hold increasingly mobile business,'' he said. 
''States are pitted against each other in a kind of destructive competition, but that is precisely what we sought to move away from 200 years ago when we tore up the Articles of Confederation.''
Instead of the ''new federalism'' that has guided the Republicans, Mr. Cuomo proposed a ''progressive federalism'' that would recognize national responsibility for national problems.
As he has since early summer, when he introduced the theme in a speech at the New York State Democratic Convention, Mr. Cuomo used the Federal savings and loan bailout as evidence of misplaced Republican priorities.
''We know it is not the wallet that Washington lacks,'' he said. ''It's the will. It's the value judgment that is significant here.''
As of mid-July, when Mr. Cuomo last had to file a campaign financial report, the Governor had raised almost $8 million for his re-election war chest. His Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, a New York City economist, had raised $869,000.

HEADLINE: Though Views Differ on Progress, Budget Talks Are Called on Track

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
In comments today, the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said he was ''not very optimistic'' about reaching an accord and expressed disappointment at the pace of the talks. ''I would say that the talks are going nowhere fast,'' he said in an interview on the ABC News program ''Good Morning America.''
 
'Can't Get Its Act Together'
But the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, who spent about an hour this morning at the base in consultations with his Democratic colleagues, took issue with Mr. Brady's assessment. ''The suggestion that Congress can't get its act together is inappropriate and wrong,'' Mr. Foley told reporters, adding that it was the ''beginning of blame assessment,'' which would not be helpful. 
Mr. Foley conceded that progress had not been as rapid as he had hoped, but he said he was confident that a deal would be reached before the end of the month and perhaps by the end of this week.
In initial bargaining, Democrats proposed a $14 billion cut in military spending and a cut of about half that amount in programs like Medicare and farm subsidies that involve automatic benefits. Republicans have been seeking deeper cuts in the benefits programs and a smaller cut in military spending.
 
Views on Capital Gains Issue
Democrats and Republicans have agreed in principle that $25 billion of the deficit reduction would come from increased revenue from higher taxes, but they remain at odds on the components of the tax package. Officials involved in the talks said the Bush Administration agreed over the weekend to accept estimates by Congressional tax and budget experts that the cut in the capital gains tax rate sought by President Bush would lose money over five years and that they would be willing to propose other revenue increases to offset the loss.
The Administration has argued that cutting the capital gains tax rate would generate revenue because investors would cash in their holdings to take advantage of the lower rate and because the reduction in the rate would stimulate economic activity.
Democrats argue that cutting the rate would benefit mainly the wealthiest taxpayers and that such a cut should be offset by increases in the income tax rate for upper-income Americans.

HEADLINE: In 10 State Primaries, Candidates Scurry Not to Look Like Politicians

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Primaries in 10 States
Ten states, in addition to Rhode Island, Minnesota and Arizona, will hold primary elections on Tuesday: Connecticut, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, Utah, Vermont and Wisconsin. So does the District of Columbia, where Democrats will pick their nominees to succeed Marion S. Barry Jr., a three-term Mayor brought low by drug charges, as well as Representative Walter E. Fauntroy, a 19-year delegate to the House of Representatives, who is running for mayor.
In Minnesota, Mr. Perpich of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, seemed headed for defeat early this year, but he has gone up in the polls as his opponent, Mike Hatch, the former commerce commissioner, called on negative political tactics, attacking him in television commercials. This is evidence, Mr. Strother said, that attacks, while still widespread, are backfiring more often than they did in the past. 
For his part, Mr. Perpich has not even tried to make promises to the voters, Mr. Strother said, for fear they would not be believed. Instead he has gone on television and read from out-of-state magazines that said Minnesota, where he has been Governor for 10 years, was a good place to live and work.
In the closing days, Mr. Hatch has focused on his support for legal abortion, which Mr. Perpich opposes. If Mr. Perpich survives the primary, he will be one of five opponents of abortion around the country running as the Democratic nominee for governor against a Republican who supports abortion rights, an illustration of how complex the issue's political impact has become.
In Rhode Island, a businessman, Bruce Sundlun, has been making progress in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor on the theme of ''I am not a politician.'' But newspapers reported today that he had been raising money in a very political way, with hints of favors to come after the election.
One opponent, Mayor Joseph Paolino of Providence, who was dropping in the polls as he attacked Mr. Sundlun, an old political ally, went on television to say he was eschewing any more negative campaigning.
''Together, we can take a stand against the old-style negative politics,'' Mr. Paolino said tonight in a television advertisement produced by his media consultants, Doak & Shrum, who have lost races in Texas, California, Florida and Alabama this year after their candidates engaged in heavily negative campaigns.
The third Democrat running for governor in Rhode Island, Mayor Frank Flaherty of Warwick, was the first to campaign against the tone of the campaign. ''It's getting embarrassing,'' he said last week.
Attacks can still be effective, and are surely still commonplace, politicians report. But they are more dangerous than they once were, if they make the attacker look like an old-fashioned politician, which is just about the worst attack than can be made on a candidate this year.
 
Governor Looks Vulnerable
The Democrats in Rhode Island are battling fiercely for the Democratic nomination because it would give them the right to face Governor Edward D. DiPrete, who has been badly wounded by ethics conflicts and the sagging New England economy. Campaigning in 1988 for another two-year term, Mr. DiPrete promised not to raise taxes but then was forced to raise the sales tax. Mr. DiPrete, first elected in 1984 after Democrats wounded each other in a divisive primary, is expected to win his primary against a former radio host, Steve White. Even with the damage they have inflicted on each other, all three of the Democrats are currently ahead of Mr. DiPrete in polls. But the Governor has said he is sure he can come back.
The public distaste for politics is also illustrated in both the governor's race in Connecticut and the House race in Vermont. Tuesday primaries in both states are largely overshadowed by the fact that independent candidates, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former Republican Senator, for governor in Connecticut, and Bernie Sanders, a Socialist, for Congress in Vermont, will be on the ballot in the fall and are given a serious chance of winning against party nominees chosen Tuesday.
In Arizona, former Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached and convicted in 1988, is attempting a comeback in Tuesday's Republican primary for governor, saying he is the only candidate who can stand up to ''the powerbrokers'' and ''the Phoenix 40,'' a business group.
The front-runner for the Republican nomination, J. Fife Symington, a millionaire developer, said he would support any of his four Republican opponents in the general election except Mr. Mecham, who he said needed, ''a poke in the nose.''
The Republican nominee will face Terry Goddard, who resigned as mayor of Pheonix, after saying he would not, to run for governor. Mr. Goddard's father, Samuel P. Goddard, is chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party and was once governor.
The incumbent, Rose Mofford, a Democrat who succeded Mr. Mecham, is retiring.
 
Trouble in Maryland
A number of House members have had close brushes with defeat in primaries this year as the mood against politicians dilutes their advantages in fund-raising and access to constituents.
Another is in trouble Tuesday in Maryland. Representative Roy Dyson, a Democrat whose district includes Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore, faces a strong challenge from a state legislator, Barbara Kreamer.
Mr. Dyson has been in political trouble since an aide, Tom Pappas, committed suicide under mysterious circumstances in 1988. Mr. Dyson's situation further deteriorated when it was disclosed that he was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War - a position his opponents say they cannot square with his pro-military stands on the Armed Services Committee and the substantial campaign contributions he has received from military contractors.
In New Hampshire there is a spirited Democratic primary to face Gov. Judd Gregg in the fall. Joe Grandmaison, a former state Democratic Party chairman, is the front-runner in that race but faces two opponents Tuesday.
In Utah there are two Republican races for Congressional nominations, one for the seat held by Representative Wayne Owens, a Democrat who is a two-term incumbent.
In Vermont, Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election. Richard A. Snelling, a Republican who was Governor from 1977 to 1985, and Peter Welch, a former State Senator, face only token opposition in the primaries.
In Wisconsin, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, is expected to win renomination. and Congressional primaries have been quiet.

HEADLINE: Dukakis Antagonist Abandons Primary Race

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
Mr. Dukakis's popular support has vanished since the state's economic condition became clear in the aftermath of his loss to George Bush in the 1988 Presidential election. Ms. Murphy, like Mr. Dukakis, is a liberal, and they share many supporters, the aide pointed out.
The aide said Ms. Murphy's challenge to the Governor, which forced him to delay his European trip, only further tarnished the image of the state's Democrats, who have already been badly hurt by the prolonged fiscal mess, and enhanced the chance that the small Republican Party here could win the governor's office for the first time since 1970.
Ms. Murphy said today that she would support Francis X. Bellotti, a former state Attorney General, who is leading in the polls for the Sept. 18 primary. Mr. Bellotti ''comes closest to the values that are important to me,'' Ms. Murphy said, particularly on the issue of women having a right to choose abortion. 
 
Silber Raises Anger
Ms. Murphy did not indicate whether she would campaign for Mr. Bellotti, a 67-year-old veteran politician. Many of Ms. Murphy's liberal backers have already been deserting her for Mr. Bellotti in hopes of stopping the third candidate, John R. Silber, the president of Boston University.
Ms. Murphy's action therefore appeared likely to deal a further blow to Mr. Silber, a political maverick whose public standing has been slipping in the past few weeks after he made barbed comments that have alienated many voters. In one debate, for instance, Mr. Silber seemed to suggest rationing health care for the elderly when he said, ''When you've had a long life and you're ripe, it's time to go.''
But Mr. Silber said he welcomed Ms. Murphy's withdrawal. ''It's a new race in which voters will have a clear choice between the politics of the past, as represented by Frank Bellotti, and the fundamental changes in government that I have proposed,'' he said.
 
Facing Up to Reality
In explaining Ms. Murphy's public rebellion last week, Mark Longabaugh, her campaign manager, said today: ''She knew that her candidacy was a long shot. And she knew it would have repercussions on her campaign.'' But he added, ''she had some ideas she needed to put on the table.''
Then over the weekend, when her own polls showed that Ms. Murphy was still trailing badly in the three-way race, she decided to drop out, said Michael Goldman, a consultant to her campaign. ''It was an effort to come to grips with reality,'' he said.
Mr. Dukakis, speaking from Paris, said: ''I know something about disappointment in politics. Evelyn Murphy ran a strong and progressive campaign, and she put her heart into it.''

HEADLINE: Probing School Success Of Asian-Americans

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
Part of that success, the new research suggests, is explained by the fact that Asian-American students, far more than members of other minorities, see earning advanced degrees as the only sure-fire way to overcome discrimination. That perception operates hand in hand with strong family bonds to make Asian-American students work harder at their studies, doing almost 50 percent more homework than their peers from grammar school on.
Beyond that intense effort, Asian-American students come from families and communities that have been less devastated by racism than those of other minority students, and so have more economic and emotional resources to draw on for their education. There is also a hidden advantage for some Asian-American students who have performed the best: in many cases their immigrant parents were professionals in their native countries and instill in their children a striving for the status they lost on leaving their homeland.
Of course, no single answer applies to every student. There are many Asian groups in America, ranging from impoverished Vietnamese boat people to prosperous fifth-generation Chinese-Americans. Even so, the overwhelming success of Asian-Americans has intrigued researchers who hope to find clues that can help other minorities do better in school. 
Although researchers differ on other points, there is a strong consensus that protecting themselves from discrimination is a compelling motive for many Asian-Americans in seeking academic success.
 
Prejudice as Motivation
While there have been no studies showing a causal link between fear of prejudice and academic success, reseachers report that in interviews Asian-Americans repeatedly cite the fear as a reason for increased academic effort. In some cases, researchers who are themselves Asian-American testify to the link from their own experience.
For example, Stanley Sue, a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, recalls that his father was denied membership in the union at a shipyard where he worked because he was Chinese.
Dr. Sue said that experience led him to conclude that he would have to do well in school to overcome such discrimination. Although neither his mother nor his father had more than a high school education, he and his three brothers all went on to earn Ph.D.'s.
Dr. Sue argues that the impressive academic success of Asian-Americans is largely a result of their strong belief in education as an escape route from the social and economic limits imposed by prejudice - a belief they hold more strongly than do other minorities.
In a study of more than 10,000 high school students, Sanford Dornbusch, a sociologist at Stanford, found that Asian-American students far more than any other group believed that ''if you do not do well in school, you are doomed to a poor job.''
Many social scientists point to centuries of a mandarin tradition, in which Asian cultures, particularly China, had an intellectual elite that rose to power through passing stringent tests. They suggest that this model of a meritocracy of the intellect has left its mark in the high value Asians place on education.
One sign that Asian-American academic effort is propelled in large part by the need to overcome discrimination is that their academic achievement tends to drop over the generations, Dr. Sue said. Dr. Dornbusch, with Phillip Ritter, found that first-generation Asian-Americans had grade point averages of 3.2 on a scale of 4.0, while for the third generation it had slipped to 3.0. The more Americanized Asian-Americans have become, Dr. Sue said, the less they worry about being denied access to good jobs because of their ethnicity.
Several theories seek to explain why other minorities, unlike Asian-Americans, fail to gravitate to higher education. Leonard Gordon a sociologist at Arizona State University, looks to history to explain the difference he found between Asian-Americans and other minorities in studies of close to 600 students. While black and Hispanic students had the same life goals as did Asian-Americans, there was a great difference in their expectations. ''They didn't have the same hope of success as did Asian-American students,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''Their history leads them to be pessimistic about reaching their goals.''
That attitude marks one of the strongest differences in outlook between Asian-American students as compared with blacks, Hispanic Americans and native Americans, said John Ogbu, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley, who is leading a study of school achievement by minority students in San Francisco.
Most Asian-Americans are voluntary immigrants, drawn here in part by the dream of success, he said in an article in the current issue of Daedalus. Such immigrants see cultural differences as something to overcome, while involuntary groups tend to cherish differences. That leaves many members of those groups unwilling to fit into patterns that undermine their group identity, he said.
Some education researchers see a secret of Asian-American academic success in how parents coax children to work harder at school.
For example, Shinying Lee, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who came to America as a graduate student, said she gave her 6-year-old extra work after school. ''I have him practice Chinese by writing two sentences every day, and then I have him do a few math problems,'' Dr. Lee said. ''Most other Chinese parents I know do the same.''
In studies of grammar school children in Chicago schools, Dr. Lee, working with a colleague, Harold Stevenson, found that there was virtually no difference between Asian-Americans and other students in intelligence or achievement.
''We studied first-graders in Chicago schools,'' Dr. Lee said. ''There is virtually no difference between Asian-Americans and other groups on achievement tests in first grade.''
 
Working Harder
''That rules out a difference in I.Q.,'' Dr. Lee said. ''But by fifth grade, Asian-Americans had much higher math achievement scores.'' The most obvious reason for that difference, which emerges in grade school and grows steadily, is that like Dr. Lee's 6-year-old, they work harder than other students.
In studies of 7,836 high school students in the San Francisco area, Asian-Americans spent about 40 percent more time doing homework than did other students - about seven hours a week versus five. ''That is the first and most important reason for the differences: Asian-Americans work harder,'' said Dr. Dornbusch, who did the studies.
There is also a fundamental difference between most Asian American parents and other parents in how they react to a child's poor performance. ''Most American parents are willing to accept a child's weak areas and emphasize the strengths,'' said Dr. Dornbusch, who has done dozens of studies on academic achievement among Asian and other minority groups. ''But for Asians, the attitude is that if you're not doing well, the answer is to study later at night, and if you still don't do well, to get up and study earlier in the morning. They believe that anyone can do well in school with the right effort.''
Behind the harder work, said Dr. Dornbusch, lies another basic difference between Asian-American and other students. ''They are oriented toward their families, not just their friends,'' he said. Interviews he conducted in his studies lead him to conclude, he said, that ''Asian kids tend to think of themselves as representing their family and see their task as doing well in school, not just for themselves, but for their families as a whole.''
A hidden factor in the academic success of Asian-American students is that a large number are themselves children of professionals, said Ronald Takaki, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ''There is an important class difference between Asian and black or Hispanic students,'' he said. ''Those Asian-Americans who seem to be super whiz kids are mostly from professional families.''
While many black and Hispanic parents feel that education would help their children evade the pain of racism, they often do not have the same family resources available. ''Over 50 percent of black kids are from impoverished single-parent families,'' Dr. Takaki said. ''They don't have an intact family with highly educated parents, like many Asian-American students.'' Black students who come from such families perform above average academically, Dr. Gordon has found.
In many cases the parents of Asian-American students are immigrants who were not able to find jobs in America in the professions for which they trained in Asia. Such parents feel ''a tremendous psychological need to recover their lost class status,'' said Dr. Takaki. ''The way for them to do that is to be sure their children get high-status degrees.''

HEADLINE: Wrong Once, Expert Keep Quiet On Volcanic Activity in California

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE

DATELINE: MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif.

 BODY:
Local businessmen are still angry at geologists for issuing the earlier warning and say they would rather take their chances with a restless volcano than yield to fears that harm the economy.
This widespread attitude is now haunting state and local disaster officials who, working closely with Federal geologists, are trying to develop a new warning system for volcanic hazards in the area. The system that twice led to public warnings about volcanic activity in the early 1980's was dropped in 1983.
 
Fear of Crying Wolf
''We have not been able to decide when to alert the public,'' said Dr. Richard Andrews, chief deputy director in charge of the earthquake and volcano program at the California Office of Emergency Services. Frequent warnings about the sort volcanic activity that is happening now, he said, can scare away tourists. But if geologists felt that an eruption were imminent, he said, the public would have to be told of the danger and evacuated. 
''It's going to be a very hard call,'' said Dr. Andrews. ''We don't want to cry wolf.''
Mammoth Lakes is a four-square mile resort village with 5,500 year-round residents, well known for its nearby ski slopes, hiking and biking trails, ice-cold lakes, hot springs and extraordinary geologic features. Among them is the Long Valley caldera, the oval mouth of a collapsed volcano that is 19 miles long by 9 miles wide at the foot of the mountains rising behind the village.
Today the caldera is covered with fragrant grasses, grazing cows and a geothermal power plant. But 700,000 years ago, it was a young volcano that produced one of the largest volcanic eruptions in Earth's history.
Pieces of the volcano landed in Missouri, and its ash traveled to New York and beyond, said Dr. Hill. While the famous Indonesian volcano of Krakatoa ejected 48 cubic miles of molten material in 1883, the Long Valley volcano tossed up 360 cubic miles of material.
It is this caldera, or giant volcanic crater, that is now showing renewed signs of life. Volcanic activity has persisted in the area for hundreds of thousands of years, said Dr. Hill, but this is the first time modern geologists have been around to watch events unfold.
 
A Devastating Alert
Things began popping in 1980 with four earthquakes that measured 6 on the Richter scale, said Dr. Hill. Startled geologists discovered that the lava dome thought to underlie the caldera had risen by 10 inches between late 1979 and early 1980. Swarms of small earthquakes continued through 1982 as the dome rose several more inches.
On May 27, 1982, Federal geologists issued a notice of potential volcanic hazard, the lowest alert level in the system then used. The notice was issued on a Friday afternoon before a local weekend festival, said Dr. Andrews, and it had an immediate impact: tourists stayed home.
The local economy collapsed, said Glenn Thompson, Mammoth Lakes' town manager. Housing prices fell 40 percent overnight. In the next few years, dozens of businesses closed, new shopping centers stood empty and townspeople left to seek jobs elsewhere. Public anxiety was kept high in early 1983 by two magnitude 5 earthquakes, a continuing swarm of smaller earthquakes and new measurements showing the dome had risen another three inches. Federal geologists considered issuing a volcano watch, its second and more serious alert level telling people to prepare for disaster, but held off to see what would happen. The third level, a volcano warning, would have meant an eruption was thought to be imminent.
But after mid-1983, nothing happened. Tourists, home buyers and new businesses did not regain confidence in the town until 1986, said Mr. Thompson. The economy has been recovering steadily since then.
So when the caldera began showing new signs of life in spring of 1989, businessmen were shaken and geologists were circumspect. Scientists recorded thousands of small earthquakes throughout last summer and found that the dome had lifted another three inches. After a period of quiet, the small earthquakes - often hundreds a day - began again in December and have continued, off and on, through the present.
 
No Official Notice
The dome has probably lifted another two inches, said Dr. Hill. ''It means the magma is moving again,'' he said. Aside from a few articles in the local newspaper and one town meeting a year ago, said Dr. Hill, geologists have not said much to the public about the current activity. There has been no official notice of volcanic activity.
There are good reasons to stay quiet for now, said Dr. Hill. In 1983, geologists had few scientific instruments in the Long Valley region. Today they have at least 40 seismic stations and a network of other instruments that are providing a wealth of data on the caldera's behavior.
The emerging picture, said Dr. Hill, is potentially menacing but not in the near future. Under the caldera are several magma chambers capable of generating relatively serious volcanic eruptions, he said, but not on the scale of 700,000 years ago. Researchers estimate that the caldera would have to rise another one and a half to three feet before the overlying rock might give way to the pressures below.
Geologists say they are encouraged in their decision to not warn the public - at least not yet - because of the way two other active calderas have behaved in recent years. A caldera near Naples, Italy rose by nine feet in two bursts of activity over the last decade and did not erupt, said Dr. Hill. Similarly, a caldera in Papua New Guinea rose by more than six feet in the early 1980's, and nothing further happened.
The Long Valley caldera may be doing what it has normally been doing for thousands of years, said Verne McLean, a geologist with the National Forest Service in the nearby town of Bishop. It might roil around underground for some time, he said, ''or produce small volcanic eruptions that squeeze out magma like toothpaste.'' Or, he acknowledged, it could blow up, causing widespread damage and loss of life.
 
Signs of Violent Eruption
Fortunately, scientists think they will get strong warnings in the days or weeks before a violent eruption would occur. These include major earthquakes accompanied by ground tilting, changes in magnetic fields, earth tremors that exhibit harmonic frequencies and other signs indicating that the magma is headed for the surface.
In the meantime, geolgists and state and local offiicals have been working out a new warning system for the public. Instead of three levels, the proposed system has five alert levels, based on the intensity of geologic events and specific combinations of events. For example, swarms of small earthquakes might elicit a low level of alert. But the swarms accompanied by rapid tilting of the ground or venting of steam could elicit a higher alert level.
The first three or four levels would not be made public, Dr. Andrews said. The information would be used by geologists and disaster officials for ''internal readiness,'' he said. In to the chain of responsibility, geologists alert state officials who then decide when to alert local sheriffs.
Martin Strellnick, the Mono county sheriff whose district includes Long Valley, said he does not know when the public will be told about volcanic threats. ''If it gets to the hazard stage, the public has a right to know,'' he said. ''But who has the expertise to say a volcano will or will not do something? It's a scientific guessing game.''

HEADLINE: Cities Begin Taking Action on Environment

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 7

 BODY:
With a loan from the Interamerican Development Bank, Mayor Camacho reported, Mexico will be able to reduce its foreign debt by $150 million and use the money to plant trees on some 150,000 acres of now barren Federal lands around the city.
In an interview, Mayor Camacho said that not only would the project protect water quality, guard against soil erosion and provide recreation areas around Mexico City, the use of carbon dioxide by the trees would also help reduce the threat of global warming.
Carbon dioxide and other industrial gasses accumulating in the atmosphere are absorbing radiation from the sun and will cause the Earth's surface to warm by three to eight degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of the next century, many scientists now agree. 
Mayor Art Eggleton of Toronto described the measures his city was taking to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by the year 2005. Its plan calls for expanding mass transportation, creating bicycle lanes for commuting, requiring more efficient lighting and new standards for energy conservation in houses, planting trees on a large scale and a variety of other measures. Toronto is believed to be the first large city in the world to initiate its own program for addressing the global warming threat.
Dr. James Hansen, the director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Science, a pioneer in preparing projections of global warming and in calling the dangers to the attention of the public and policy makers, presented computer predictions of the effect of global warming on some cities around the world. In the past, such models had been available only for a sample of cities in the United States.
When carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases reached a level double that of the pre-industrial era, Dr. Hansen projected greatly extended periods of very high temperatures. For example, Rio de Janeiro, which now averages five days a year of temperatures over 95 degrees Fahrenheit, would have 52 days a year of such high temperatures; Singapore would go from zero days over 95 to 124; Rome from six to 55, and Tokyo from five to 41.
Dr. Hansen emphasized that those projections were based on current trends but could be altered by lowering emissions of greenhouse gases.
The meeting was sponsored by the United Nations Environmental Program, the International Union of Local Authorities and the Center for Innovative Diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Another Toyota Plant in U.S.; Location Will Be Set Later

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 10

 BODY:
So far, no Japanese auto maker has built an assembly plant in a state that already has a Japanese plant, which has allowed those companies to build fairly broad political support where they have invested. Analysts have reported that Kansas might be Toyota's first choice, partly because no Japanese auto maker has built an assembly plant in that state.
Toyota's disclosure, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, was not surprising in light of Toyota's often-stated goal of selling 1.5 million cars and trucks in this country by the mid-1990's, half of which would be assembled here. If Toyota achieves that number, it will have captured approximately 10 percent of the nation's car market; for a number of years the company, Japan's No. 1 car maker, has had an internal corporate campaign, called ''Global 10,'' aimed at capturing 10 percent of the world market. 
While it was not announced which vehicles would be produced at the new plant, it is likely to be either the compact Camry or subcompact Corolla, two cars for which Toyota says it cannot meet customer demand.
In the last year Toyota has increased its overall United States vehicle sales by 17.1 percent, at a time when Detroit's Big Three have attributed their sales declines to a soft market. Toyota's share of the domestic market grew to 7.6 percent through the end of August, from 6.2 percent in the first eight months of 1989. Both the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have lost market share, while the General Motors Corporation's share has risen slightly after years of decline.
Toyota now also operates an assembly plant in Canada and a joint venture with G.M. in Fremont, Calif., where it will begin producing compact pickup trucks next year.
 
'Transplants' Bolster Sales
Of the Japanese auto makers, Toyota has made the biggest inroads into the U.S. market, followed closely by the Honda Motor Company. As a group, the sales of Japanese auto makers have surged strongly in the last year, largely as a result of increased production by the ''transplant'' operations that build cars in the United States. Domestic auto makers and European importers are thus feeling tremendous pressure, particularly since the overall market is soft.
The transplants have an advantage over plants owned by American companies because their work forces are generally younger and healthier, which keeps health-care costs down. Pension expenses are also lower.
 
Gains Seen for Lexus
ATLANTA, Sept. 10 (Reuters) -The Toyota Motor Corporation expects higher sales for its Lexus luxury cars despite the uncertain outlook for the automotive market and the economy in general, the division's top official said today.
Davis Illingworth, Toyota's vice president in charge of the Lexus division, said more buyers than expected had switched to Lexus from Mercedes-Benz and BMW. After a meeting with dealers from the Southeast, he said the company was on track to meet its goal of shipping 60,000 of the imported cars this year.
Despite a ''difficult, uncertain'' American market, almost 40,000 Lexus cars had been sold through August, the executive said. The cars cost up to $40,000 each.
''If we do 60,000 this year, clearly we believe we'll do better than that next year,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Rose 7.4% in July

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 10

 BODY:
The July advance was the largest since a 7.8 percent jump in November and approximated the $4.42 billion monthly average of 1988 and 1989.
 
'Two Explanations'
The Fed said consumer credit growth slowed to an average of $1.78 billion a month during the first seven months of 1990.
''There are two explanations'' for the sharp increase, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. ''One is that it simply is a statistical aberration'' and that it will decline in coming months to $1 billion to $2 billion a month. 
''The other, more important possibility,'' he said, ''is that consumers are getting pinched right now. Prices were going up in general even before the oil crisis. Wages were not keeping up with prices, so consumers were relying more and more on revolving credit.''
The rise in credit in July came before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the sharp rise in oil prices that followed. In addition, since July the two major consumer confidence surveys have dropped sharply, showing that Amercans are more worried now about the possibility of a recession. Both these developments could mean that the next credit report will show the pattern moving back to the decline for the year that the annual numbers showed today.
In August, the University of Michigan index of consumer confidence dropped 11.8 points, to 76.4, its lowest level since the 1982 recession. The separate survey done by the Conference Board showed a decline to 83.8 in August, down from 101.7 in July. All the declines early this year had been much smaller.
Big declines in consumer confidence have helped push the economy into recession in the past, as people, even if they have the income, stop buying. Such a pullback by consumers would reduce the buying or revolving credit, which was the main reason for the July increase in consumer credit.
Nearly 75 percent of the July gain was in revolving, or credit card, debt. It was up 21.7 percent at a annual rate, or $3.77 billion, after rising 7 percent in June. Such debt had increased 18.8 percent in May.
The sluggish automobile sector, on the other hand, declined 2.2 percent, or $534 million, on top of a 7.3 percent drop a month earlier. It was unchanged in May.
Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 7 percent, or $1.20 billion, after gains of 4.4 percent in June and 2.1 percent in May.
Borrowing for mobile homes edged up 1.7 percent, or $33 million, after falling 4.3 percent in June. It had risen 6 percent in May.
The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of July at $729.1 billion.

HEADLINE: G.M. in New Moves To Halt Slide of Olds

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 10

 BODY:

 
Division Needs a 'Rationale'
G.M. executives say such a consolidation is not in the cards. They say that while there is some overlap between Oldsmobile and other G.M. brands, more cars can be sold with Oldsmobile than without it.
Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco, says he thinks Olds can be turned around and can survive on its own. ''I don't think it costs a lot to have separate divisions,'' he said, ''but each division has to have a rationale. Therefore, Mr. Losh must work to differentiate Oldsmobiles from other G.M. cars.'' 
G.M. executives hope that by emphasizing contemporary styling and new technology, Oldsmobile can be distinguished from the sporty racing image of Pontiac, the more traditional theme of Buick, the higher-priced exclusivity of Cadillac and the economy approach of Chevrolet.
Oldsmobile's 1991 line, which officially goes on sale this month, features some improvements but no new cars. In the absence of new cars, Mr. Losh is making at least three significant changes.
He is starting an unusual warranty program to cover used cars, which could help dealers sell more used cars and fetch higher prices. On another front, Olds last week introduced a sport-utility vehicle called the Bravada, a luxury version of the Chevy Blazer, to tap into the trend of using trucks as personal transportation.
Finally, Mr. Losh is renewing efforts to redefine a brand that in recent years has lost its identity. Shelving the ad campaign that boasted, ''This Is Not Your Father's Oldsmobile,'' Olds is introducing a campaign aimed at younger, better-educated and more affluent consumers, emphasizing advanced technology and contemporary styling.
Oldsmobile was once a hugely successful franchise, positioned midway between the budget-minded Chevrolet and the luxurious Cadillac. The strategy was developed in the 1920's by Alfred Sloan, who was then G.M. chairman.
Over the years, Olds became known as the technology leader of the G.M. divisions, and was the first to install front-wheel drive, in its first Toronado model in the late 1960's. For many years the division distinguished itself by applying the Rocket 88 name to its engines, with the attendant implication of power and space-age technology. By the early 1980's, however, consumers became aware that all G.M. engines had become basically the same.
The new Olds mission, Mr. Losh explained, is to attract customers interested in new technology and cleaner, modern styling. Mr. Losh declined to predict next year's results, citing economic uncertainty, but he vowed to increase the division's share of sales of domestically made cars to 6 percent, from 5.5 percent. In 1983, Olds's share was 10.9 percent.
G.M.'s other divisions have also attempted to sharpen their marketing focus, and with more success. Buick, once as sick as Oldsmobile, has increased its market share this year by concentrating on a more ''mature and traditional'' audience, emphasizing comfort. Buick's restyled Park Avenue, for example, borrows design flourishes from Jaguar.
Cadillac, too, has increased its share of the luxury-car segment. Pontiac, which had been G.M.'s biggest success story of the 1980's, has managed to hold, though not increase, its share. Chevrolet has attracted more younger, budget-conscious buyers through its Geo sub-franchise. All told, G.M. has increased its share of the American car market slightly in 1990 after losing 10 points in the 1980's.
Oldsmobile's main problem has been the defection of younger buyers, many of whom have moved to trucks, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles. In 1984, the average age of all buyers was 44, while the average for Oldsmobile was 49; by 1989, the average at Oldsmobile had risen to 55 while the industry average remained the same.
Because Olds cars were selling so poorly, G.M. last year let the division sell a mini-van developed for Chevrolet. In the same vein, Olds last week introduced the Bravada. But because of production constraints, the Bravada and the Silhouette mini-van can theoretically restore less than 100,000 sales.
Beyond adding trucks to its lineup, Oldsmobile has restyled its once-popular full-size station wagon, the Custom Cruiser, for the first time in 13 years. The top-of-the-line 98 and Toronado models will get more powerful engines, and the Cutlass Supreme will receive a new multi-valve V-6 engine.
Olds has also been trying to curry favor with customers. The division agreed last year to replace any new car within 30 days with a comparable model if a customer was not satisfied. Mr. Losh said that about 1.2 percent of new cars were returned, but that dealers told him the offer led to about 20,000 additional sales.
 
Dealers Have Suffered
Oldsmobile's replacement offer bespeaks a recognition that poor quality had driven away many customers. ''We went through hell in 1987 and 1988,'' said Dick Smith, owner of Royal Oldsmobile in Charleston, W. Va. ''No one at G.M. would listen to us.'' Although G.M.'s warranty covers repairs of defective cars, the warranty's $100 deductible alienated many of his customers, Mr. Smith said.
Aside from hurting G.M., the sharply lower sales have been disastrous for the division's 3,150 franchised dealers. To compensate, some have added Japanese franchises; others have sold their businesses or closed. Mr. Losh said fewer than half of Olds dealers were profitable in 1989; that proportion increased to 70 percent this year, but he said he could not feel comfortable until at least 90 percent were profitable.
Analysts agree that the Olds managers grew complacent in the early 1980's, presuming that the venerable Cutlass nameplate would sell any vehicle they produced. In 1977, for example, about 555,000 Cutlass Supremes were sold - more than the entire division's sales this year. The Cutlass name is still used on the midsized Supreme, midsized Ciera and compact Calais, accounting for 67 percent of all Olds sales.
 
Acclaimed Ads Canceled
G.M. executives concede that the division's marketing image had grown blurry. One of Mr. Losh's first moves was to kill a series of advertisements by Leo Burnett, G.M.'s longtime agency, entitled ''This Is Not Your Father's Oldsmobile.'' The campaign had received much favorable comment within the ad industry and had scored highly in terms of consumer recall.
''It got a lot of attention, but those ads talked about what we weren't, not what we were,'' Mr. Losh said. The division's theme, he said, is ''smart, contemporary vehicles that are one step ahead in design, value and total satisfaction.''
The ads' main theme will remain ''The New Generation of Olds,'' and will emphasize technological improvements like a holographic display on one version of the Cutlass Supreme that allows drivers to see the gauges without looking away from the road, and, on the top-of-the-line 98, a computer-command ride that allows the driver to adjust the suspension between normal and firm settings. They also emphasize a smooth and rounded styling from which hood ornaments are absent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Fall in Slow Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
''I don't think oil is the most germane issue at the moment,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''The budget is the key to what the Fed will or won't do. And if we don't get a budget agreement in the next 24 hours, my feeling is they won't have one until the end of the month, when sequestration will push them into it.''
 
Some Expect an Accord
Although there appeared to be little reason for optimism, Mr. Capra and a few other market participants said that some sort of budget accord might emerge before tonight, when President Bush is scheduled to deliver a televised address on a number of topics, including the budget. 
If Congress is unable to come up with a budget compromise by Oct. 1, Gramm-Rudman legislation requires that some $100 billion in outlays be cut to meet the law's targets.
According to analysts, quick agreement on a deficit-reduction package might help to pursuade the Federal Reserve Board to move to ease short-term interest rates. Given the anemic state of the economy, a move by the Fed has been widely anticipated.
The central bank disappointed those who were looking for lower short-term rates again yesterday. Its open market operations did not provide any evidence that it had changed its stance on monetary policy, analysts said. Indeed, many said that time was growing short for the Fed to make a move, since the first of a series of bad reports on inflation is expected to be released at the end of the week.
''If the Fed is thinking of easing right now, their window of opportunity seems to be shrinking, because the market will get a very bad report on producer price inflation for August on Friday,'' said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets.
''And if the Fed allows this window of opportunity to pass, I think it will bode ill for the economy,'' he added. ''There are no signs yet of a complete collapse, but if policy makers wait for those sorts of signals it will be too late.''
 
Oil Price Jump a Factor
Because of the big run-up in oil prices, economists are expecting that inflation moved sharply higher in August.
By late yesterday, the turnaround in oil prices had pushed the price of the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020, securities that are the most sensitive to changes in inflation expectations, down by 17/32, to an offered price of 97 26/32, to yield 8.96 percent. Late Friday the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.90 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.82 percent. Disappointment over the Fed's decision to leave monetary policy unchanged helped to push down the price of the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent two-year notes by 1/8 point, to 100 1/8, to yield 8.05 percent.
At the weekly Treasury bill auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.41 percent, up slightly from the average rate of 7.39 percent at last week's sale. Meanwhile, bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.34 percent, down from an average rate of 7.36 percent a week ago.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was light, dealers said. Prices of most corporate bonds slipped by 3/8 point to 5/8 point, largely in sympathy with the decline in Treasury securities. Municipal bond traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues dipped by 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains But Eases Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A recovery on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has raised interest in Japanese investments, and traders who had put their money into currencies such as the British pound recently were now turning to the yen, said James T. McGroarty, a senior vice president with Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.
Investors also believed that interest rates in Britain, which have supported the pound, would begin to decline from their current high levels, Mr. McGroarty said. Such a development would make sterling a less attractive investment.
The dollar was higher against all major currencies except the yen yesterday, but ''it's more of an individual currency assessment rather than an overall dollar view,'' Mr. McGroarty said.
In New York, the dollar fell to 139.52 yen from late Friday's 140.10. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to a closing 139.43 Japanese yen, from 140.25 Friday, and in London, it fell to 139.20 yen.
The pound fell sharply against the dollar, closing at $1.8580 in New York, compared with late Friday's $1.8930. In London earlier, sterling fell to $1.8565, from $1.8933 dollars late Friday.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose more than a pfennig, to 1.5820 marks, from 1.5680 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.3175 Swiss francs, up from 1.3055; 5.3005 French francs, up from 5.2530; 1,180.00 Italian lire, up from 1,170.50, and 1.16675 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16335.

Political Worries Spur U.S. Chamber's Effort

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Because the fight goes on.'' This and other ads, created by Siddall, Matus & Coughter in Richmond, will run in newspapers and business magazines. 
The group decided to begin the effort because of ''a growing concern within the business community about the direction our economy is taking, particularly with the disruption of oil supply and the reality that we are tilting into a recession,'' said Bruce Josten, group vice president of development for the Washington-based organization.
The ads discuss issues like the savings and loan scandal and the Federal budget deficit as sources of concern for the chamber's membership.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Bush's Two Audiences

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
At times during his nationally televised speech to a joint session of Congress, the President seemed to be talking directly to the Iraqi leader, man to man, as when he declared bluntly, ''Saddam Hussein will fail.''
Mr. Bush appeared determined to demonstrate to the nation, the Iraqis and, indeed, the world that the passage of time would not erode American resolve.
 
Restating His Goals
He made it plain that he would not countenance the kind of process that the British weekly The Economist has described as the greatest danger to his strategy - a buildup of doubts and caveats at home through which ''slowly the turning-back of Iraq threatens to become a wobbling mirage that is redefined until it is unrecognizable before fading away.'' Fighting that tendency, he reiterated, without a shade of difference, the goals he set weeks ago. 
But there are other dangers, of course. The use of military force could strain the coalition with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev by which the President sets such great store. It could drive the moderate Arab states that now back the United States position into Saddam Hussein's arms. And it could extract a heavy political price at home if it did not have a clearly attainable goal and did not produce recognizable results in a reasonable time.
Another threat to solidarity on the home front is a rising feeling among average voters and among members of both parties on Capitol Hill that the United States is bearing much too great a share of the burden in the gulf.
 
Allies' Share of the Burden
In the House this afternoon, Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr., Democrat of Kentucky, and Representative Craig T. James, Republican of Florida, castigated Japan for what they described as Tokyo's inadequate financial contributions, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany acknowledged publicly last weekend that he feared that the same sort of criticism would soon be directed at Bonn.
Responding to the President's speech on behalf of the Democrats, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, said Mr. Bush had the party's backing. But he called upon the Japanese and the Germans to ''respond to our potential sacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own.''
While attacking no one, Mr. Bush said pointedly that ''the response of most of our friends and allies'' to American appeals for burden-sharing ''has been good.'' He did not say ''all our friends and allies,'' and he added:
''We insist others do their share as well.''
Mr. Bush has done well in the past when he talked tough. His emulation of Clint Eastwood - ''Read my lips, no new taxes'' - was widely accounted one of the main factors in his sweeping electoral victory in November, 1988.
But he has backed off that pledge now, and some White House aides have expressed fears that in doing so, he has undercut the credibility of his future pledges. That may be another reason why he so doggedly went back tonight over all the promises he has made in his dozens of comments on the Middle East in recent weeks.
President Bush spoke on Capitol Hill, a setting for major speeches that he prefers to the Oval Office used so often and so effectively by Ronald Reagan, in a week marked by a confluence of events that he believes could go far toward defining his Presidency.
 
'New Partnership' With Moscow
He had just returned from a meeting in Helsinki with Mr. Gorbachev which, he said, may have laid the groundwork for ''a new partnership'' between Moscow and Washington, something stopping just short of an alliance and playing a key role in a new world order.
He had been told, just before traveling down Pennsylvania Avenue, that there suddenly seemed a better chance of agreement with the Democratic-controlled Congress in the protracted negotiations on the fiscal crisis.
His nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire, is to begin testifying on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
And the crisis in the gulf wears on, with Mr. Hussein wiggling and squirming to try to evade the trade boycott, offering free oil even to his ancient enemy Iran, manipulating the hostages and playing for time as tens of thousands of American troops sweat in the Saudi desert, wondering when their moment will come - the moment of battle or the moment to pack their gear and go home.
Only two months down the road loom the midterm elections, which could be heavily influenced by either the situation in the Middle East or by the budget negotiations. So Mr. Bush tried to sound statesmanlike, telling the legislators before him that ''Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here.'' But there was an obvious partisan edge to his demand for fast action on the budget.
''If the Congress cannot get me a budget,'' the President said, in what sounded a lot like attempted electoral point-scoring, ''then Americans will have to face a tough, mandated sequester'' - in other words, their fault, not mine, if you suffer.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BUSH VOWS TO THWART IRAQ DESPITE FEAR FOR HOSTAGES; U.S. WON'T BE 'BLACKMAILED'

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
''Of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and their families,'' Mr. Bush said. His voice growing harder and his forefinger stabbing at the lectern, he added, ''But our policy cannot change. And it will not change. America and the world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy.''
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Mr. Bush said, ''is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth.''
The speech seemed intended to leave no doubt in the mind of President Hussein that the United States would use force if necessary to push Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, and to prepare the American people for the possible loss of the lives of American soldiers and hostages if war broke out. 
 
Videotaped Talk to Iraqis
On Wednesday, Mr. Bush will try to take his message directly to the Iraqi people, videotaping a 10-minute address to offer to Iraq's national television network. But White House aides did not hold out great hope that the tape, which is to be hand-delivered to Iraqi representatives in the coming days, would be broadcast in Iraq in its entirety. The White House said it would not release the tape here or in other countries until Iraq had been given a chance to broadcast it.
The Democratic Party's response to Mr. Bush's speech, delivered by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Majority Leader, was strongly supportive at a time when public opinion appears to be solidly behind Mr. Bush and the gulf crisis seems to be going his way. Mr. Gephardt called opposition to Iraq ''a cause worth standing and fighting for.''
He called on other countries to provide more money for the effort. Mr. Gephardt said, ''When countries like Egypt can stand beside us, when young Americans stand on the front lines, only miles from the threat of poison gas, the least the Japanese and the Germans can do is support us - and not just with words.''
 
Iraqi Envoy in Chamber
The packed House chamber, which was filled with legislators, Cabinet members, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and foreign diplomats, gave Mr. Bush a 2 1/2-minute standing ovation as he entered the room. With the Iraqi Ambassador, Mohammed al-Mashat, virtually the only listener sitting impassively, the crowd punctuated the speech more than 30 times with applause.
But the loudest applause, and the few cheers that echoed in the chamber, were reserved for Mr. Bush's comments on the Federal budget deficit, particularly his call for a cut in the capital gains tax rate.
Addressing domestic concerns, Mr. Bush for the first time since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait offered a stern admonition that the United States had, through what he said was short-sighted policy, put itself in a vulnerable position by becoming overly dependent on Middle Eastern oil to fuel its economy.
 
Dependence on Imported Oil
Mr. Bush spoke of the country's ''failure'' to address its long-term energy needs. He said that by the time of the Iraqi invasion, the United States had increased its oil imports from 6 million barrels a day in the early 1970's to nearly 8 million barrels a day.
''We'd moved in the wrong direction,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And now we must act to correct that trend.''
To meet the challenge, Mr. Bush said, the United States must ''take advantage of our energy sources across the board: coal, natural gas, hydro and nuclear.''
Even as his comments seemed to embrace the energy policies of Jimmy Carter, they carried an implicit criticism of Ronald Reagan, as did a later passage in which Mr. Bush spoke of the Federal budget and said, ''America is tired of phony deficit reduction.'' Reaching for the all-encompassing principles behind his response to the immediate crisis in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush said the United States' leadership, its credibility as a superpower and its economic vitality are at stake.
 
'Test of Our Mettle'
He offered some hope, saying a ''new partnership of nations'' has been born in the midst of the threat of war on the Arabian Peninsula that could produce a world ''freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace.''
But the President warned, ''This is the first assault on the new world we seek, the first test of our mettle.''
''How we manage this crisis today,'' he said, ''could shape the future for generations to come.''
 
Iraq's Isolation Stressed
Throughout his speech, which the President and his aides refined virtually until the hour of his appearance in the House Chamber, Mr. Bush struck the central argument of his war of words with Mr. Hussein: that the United States is backed by the weight of world opinion and the support of even many of its former adversaries.
''This is not, as Saddam Hussein would have it, the United States against Iraq,'' he said. ''It is Iraq against the world.''
Mr. Bush's primary message was that while ''our brave servicemen and women stand watch in that distant desert and on distant seas,'' the United States is still counting on the worldwide economic embargo against Iraq as its primary weapon.
But the struggle, he said, will be a long one, and he made it clear that the United States is prepared to use its military muscle if there is no other choice.
 
'Review All Options'
''I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will not let this aggression stand.''
The President said the economic sanctions appear so far to be working. ''Together with our friends and allies, ships of the United States Navy are today patrolling Mideast waters,'' he said. ''They have already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions. Three regional leaders I spoke with just yesterday told me that these sanctions are working. Iraq is feeling the heat.''
Mr. Bush said he hopes ''that Iraq's leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them. They are cut off from world trade, unable to sell their oil. And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through.''
 
Humanitarian Shipments
He tried to balance pressure to address humanitarian needs of civilians in Iraq with his efforts to hold together the disparate band of nations that are backing the embargo in the face of continued Iraq efforts.
He noted that he and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union had said in their meeting in Helsinki that they supported humanitarian shipments to Iraq, but he said that would occur only ''when the embargo is so effective that the children of Iraq literally need milk, or the sick truly need medicine.''
''Then,'' he said, ''under strict international supervision that guarantees the proper destination, then food will be permitted.''
Mr. Bush said the United States would have a ''lasting role'' in the Persian Gulf beyond the current crisis. Then, in what appeared to be a threat that whatever happens in Kuwait, Iraq will not be permitted to develop nuclear weapons, he said, ''Our role is to help our friends in their own self-defense. And something else: to curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missile, and above all, nuclear technologies.''
Mr. Bush said that ''vital issues of principle'' were at stake in the Gulf crisis.
He said the economic stakes were high, arguing that if Mr. Hussein were allowed to remain in Kuwait, he could end up controlling much of the world's oil supply. ''We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless,'' he said. ''And we won't.''
 
Test of U.S. Leadership
The President depicted the Persian Gulf crisis as a test of American leadership. He stressed the breadth of the alliance against Iraq, including United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning Iraq, imposing economic sanctions, demanding Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and calling for the release of all foreign nationals held in Iraq and Kuwait.
''It is a mockery of human decency to call these people 'guests,' '' Mr. Bush said. ''They are hostages and the whole world knows it.''
Reflecting his struggle to fit the current threat of war into the larger context of a world in which East-West barriers have been falling and peace seemed more assured than ever in Europe, the President said, ''We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment.''
 
New U.S.-Soviet Relationship
Because of the unparalleled Soviet- American cooperation so far in the Gulf crisis, Mr. Bush said, ''no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted U.N. action against aggression.''
''The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation,'' Mr. Bush said.
He continued: ''A hundred generations have searched for his elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born: a world quite different from the one we've known, a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.''

HEADLINE: White House and Congress Closer In Effort to Cut the Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
''Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and between the branches over budget matters,'' the President said. ''It is high time we pulled together and get the job done right. It is up to us to straighten this out.''
Mr. Bush reiterated his call for a cut in the capital gains tax and other measures he has pressed for all year. He gave no indication that the tax increases and spending reductions needed to reduce the deficit would by necessity cause pain. 
 
Leverage in Budget Talks
He also urged Congress for the first time to enact measures to encourage energy conservation, as well as more domestic oil production.
The President's handling of budgetary and economic matters has not been among his strongest political suits. But he may have gained leverage by presenting his case in a speech largely devoted to the military and diplomatic activity in the Middle East, couching the budget issue in patriotic terms.
The talk at the White House and in the Capitol today was more optimistic than it has been since the current budget talks began Friday. In part, that reflected the actual developments. But it also seemed to result from Republican efforts to smooth the way for the President's speech tonight and from the Democrats' desire to avert criticism from Mr. Bush.
''I'm on the positive side of the mood swing,'' said John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
Congressional leaders took a similar stance about the negotiators' work.
''Each day they get closer,'' said the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington. ''There is progress. There is movement.''
A crucial Republican in the talks, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, agreed with that assessment, saying, ''We're at the place now wherethere is enough on the table on both sides that we can begin to pick and choose.''
 
Five Days of Talks
The negotiators began meeting at Andrews on Friday, away from reporters, camera crews and lobbyists. The meeting continued through the weekend and until 1:30 this morning. After a few hours' sleep the negotiators resumed talking until they adjourned to vote on other bills late this afternoon and for the President's address. They plan to return to the air base on Wednesday and to meet day and night until they reach an agreement.
Without a resolution soon there will not be enough time for Congress to pass the necessary legislation to avoid Draconian across-the-board cuts in most Government programs that would go into effect on Oct. 1, at the start of the next fiscal year, under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
Some negotiators said Democrats had agreed to make much deeper cuts in programs like Social Security, Medicare and agriculture than they had accepted before.
The Republicans have demanded that these and other domestic programs be cut by at least $120 billion from what they would cost over the next five years if no changes are made in the laws, and by today Democrats had agreed to $100 billion in cuts.
But the Democrats have balked at a Republican proposal to sharply raise the premiums and deductibles that the elderly pay for Part B of Medicare. This is the part of the medical insurance program that pays doctors' bills.
 
Subsidy on Medical Insurance
A plan backed by Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, which was said to save $40 billion over five years, would eliminate the Government subsidy for medical insurance altogether for people with annual incomes of more than $40,000 and for couples with incomes of more than $51,200.
Government officials could not say today how much such people would have to pay to purchase Government health insurance on their own.
For their part, the Republicans have agreed to a five-year reduction in military spending about $170 billion below what would be needed to keep pace with inflation, close to the figure the Democrats have insisted on. The cost for operations in the Persian Gulf are excluded from this accounting.
On taxes, both sides seem prepared to raise taxes on alcoholic beverages and luxury items like jewelry. But the Republicans continued to oppose raising the income tax on the wealthy, and the Democrats remained strongly against a cut in the capital gains tax.
 
Tax Breaks Proposed
In his address tonight Mr. Bush said the budget agreement should include not only a cut in the capital gains tax but also tax breaks for individual retirement accounts and saving accounts and new tax incentives for research and oil drilling.
He did not suggest what measures he might favor to encourage energy conservation, saying only that the ''trend'' toward importing more oil should be corrected.
''America is tired of phony deficit reduction or promise-now, save-later plans,'' Mr. Bush declared. ''Enough is enough. It is time for a program that is credible and real.''
In the Democratic response to the President, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said the budget deal should emphasize ''fairness.''
''We must ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair share to prevent recession and reduce our debts,'' he said.

HEADLINE: African Force Is Protecting Doe's Tribe

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Most of the killings in the eight-month-long civil war have involved four of Liberia's 16 main ethnic groups: the Krahn; the Mandingo, who are said to have aligned themselves with the Krahn, and the Gio and Mano tribes, from which the rebels are said to draw much of their support.
 
Gambian Cites Plea for Help
Gambia's President, Sir Dawda Jawara, who is also the head of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States, said that his group had received a request from the executive mansion for protection and that they were providing it as an ''humanitarian act.''
''If any other tribe or faction got into a corner like that and seemed to face massacre or extermination, I think it would only be humane for Ecowas to try and get them out,'' Sir Dawda said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Ecowas is an acronym for the West African group. 
He added that President Doe's death appeared to complicate efforts to reach a settlement in the civil war.
''When you consider the relations between the tribes in Liberia,'' Sir Dawda said, President Doe's death ''could only worsen a very bad situation.'' The manner of his death, while he was visiting the peacekeeping force headquarters for reasons that have not been fully explained, has raised questions about the role that the West African group is playing in the conflict.
 
Already Faced Hurdles
Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Deputy Foreign Minister of Ghana, a major contributor to the force, said at a news conference today that President Doe's capture and death created ''an embarrassing situation which has exposed the difficult and complex posture'' of the West African force.
''Ecowas may eventually rue the day they got involved in this mess,'' a Western diplomat here said. ''The whole episode involving Doe was badly botched. And they are about to get themselves in even deeper by trying to protect the Krahns.''
The five-nation force was assembled last month after leaders of the West African group decided that the war was no longer solely an internal conflict because thousands of their citizens were trapped in Liberia, while an estimated 400,000 Liberians had fled to neighboring countries.
''Probably the only thing the rebels have in common is their hatred for the Krahns,'' said a Liberian businessman who recently fled the fighting there, ''There's going to be a lot of resentment if the peacekeeping force appears to be helping to keep them in power.''
 
U.S. Watching and Waiting
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 (Special to The New York Times) - A State Department spokesman said today that the United States does not recognize any of the forces fighting to take power in Liberia, but is talking to all of them.
''The two rebel groups and elements of the remaining forces of Samuel Doe are all claiming to be the legally constituted Government of Liberia,'' the spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said. ''We continue to be in touch with the various factions in the Liberian conflict.''
Asked if the United States recognized any of the groups, he replied: ''It's not for us to choose. At this point the situation as far as who's in charge, who's in control in Monrovia, is very confused.''

HEADLINE: Spanish-Cuban Asylum Battle Ends, Bitterly

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, Sept. 11

 BODY:
But in this case, with Havana asserting that Madrid had joined forces with the United States in trying to undermine the Cuban revolution, both the Spanish Government and public opinion were stunned when the Cuban leader himself resorted to fierce mud-slinging against Spain.
''I don't think the normalization of relations with Cuba, including the resumption of economic aid, can come tomorrow,'' Spain's Deputy Foreign Minister, Inocencio Arias, said last week. ''Unfortunately, these incidents, which in no case were provoked by us, leave a sediment.'' 
Mr. Castro told Spanish television that he was ready to patch things up, but added, ''We are not a country that can be humiliated or threatened because we have a high sense of honor and dignity that is part of our Spanish heritage.''
In reality, even before the first of the asylum-seekers entered Spain's mission in Havana on July 9, relations between the two countries were already being strained by suggestions from Madrid that Mr. Castro start liberalizing his Government in the wake of events in Eastern Europe.
Along with Mexico and Venezuela, Spain even discreetly asked Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel literature laureate, to convey a message to his friend, the Cuban leader, that Havana risked total isolation unless it made some democratic gestures. An Elected King? But last March, during a visit to Brazil, Mr. Castro sent a public message back to Madrid, scoffing at the idea of elections in Cuba by asking rhetorically whether voters had chosen King Juan Carlos to be Spain's head of state. His remarks brought a formal protest from Spain.
What appears to have awakened Mr. Castro's suspicions of a conspiracy in the case of the asylum-seekers was that 48 Cubans entered five European embassies in Havana in July almost immediately after Albania granted exit visas to 4,500 Albanians who took refuge in foreign embassies there.
In contrast to Albania, however, Cuba said none of its nationals could leave the country unless they sought permission through normal channels. Further, Spanish officials said, Cuba ordered nine police agents to force their way into the Spanish Embassy posing as asylum-seekers.
By the end of July, all the Cubans had left the Swiss, Czech, Italian and Belgian Embassies, but 18 remained in the Spanish mission. And after Cuba accused Spain of interfering in its internal affairs by encouraging asylum-seekers, Spain withdrew its Ambassador and suspended an aid program worth $2.5 million this year.
Verbal exchanges intensified. Cuba launched a personal attack on Spain's Foreign Minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, while Spain's Secretary of International Cooperation, Luis Yanez said Cuba was ''a parched field in which any spark could set off a blaze.''
On July 26, Mr. Castro called Spain ''an accomplice of Yankee imperialism.'' Recalling Cuba's fight for independence in the 1890's, he also accused Madrid of ''colonialist arrogance.''
By late August, though, the asylum-seekers began leaving the Embassy. Spanish officials said that, when genuine asylum-seekers left, some police agents followed. The last five people left on Sept. 4. The officials said that while two wanted to be taken to their homes, three suspected agents asked to be dropped off in downtown Havana.

HEADLINE: Frustrated Chinese Look to U.S. as a Haven

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 8

 BODY:
''There are two kinds of people in China these days,'' said a worker in his 20's, continuing with a cheerful exaggeration. ''First, there are those who simply want to go to the United States. And second, there are those who are already well along in their preparations to depart.'' 
Not everyone is afflicted by the ''emigration fever,'' as it is called here, but it is clear that the urge to leave has markedly increased since the army's crackdown on the democracy movement last year. That urge to relocate is motivated not only by political repression but by a far-deeper sense of frustration and discontent, as well as by rising economic expectations that China cannot meet.
''This place isn't stable, for all the official talk about stability,'' said a woman in her 40's, who agonized over lists of English words to prepare for moving to the United States. ''And everyone finds it stifling, with few opportunities to use your skills. What's more, Americans all have cars!'' Alarmed by the flood of students going abroad - compared with the trickle of people returning - the Chinese Government early this year imposed restrictions that on their face prevented college graduates from going abroad to study until they have worked for five years.
But ingenious young scholars are putting their minds to work evading the regulations. The most common method is to invent an aunt or uncle in Hong Kong or the United States, and take advantage of a clause allowing those with relatives abroad to pay fees instead of working for five years.
''We've had no significant change in the types of people who come in applying for student visas,'' an American diplomat here said. ''We're still seeing lots of recent college graduates who come in. The number of applicants and the number of issuances are both up.''
In August, for example, the United States Embassy in Beijing received 1,550 applications for student visas, compared with 1,371 applications in August 1989 and 949 applications in August 1988. The portion receiving visas has also risen, to 60 percent from 43 percent two years ago.
There is no doubt that the new regulations have had an effect - many recent graduates say that they have postponed their plans to go abroad - so one explanation for the increase in the number of applicants is that it would have soared without the restrictions.
''Five members of my senior class are applying to American universities,'' a high school student in Beijing said. ''I could do very well here, and join the Communist Party, and find a suitable husband, and get a good job. But there are lots of limits on what we can do here, and I think I'll be better off with training in America.''
A young business executive said that a few years ago, a Japanese executive offered to pay for her to study in Japan. She refused, and these days she thinks she made a terrible mistake.
''Now I can see that if you have talent here, you're suppressed and harassed,'' she said. She complained about her cramped dormitory room, which she shares with three roommates, and about her company's plans to send her to work in a factory to gain an appreciation for manual labor.
''I'm optimistic about my own future,'' she said, ''because I plan to go abroad, but I'm pessimistic about China. Anyone with talent is trying to leave. Absolutely everyone I know is looking for an exit.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
With Simple Arms and Derring-Do, Guerrillas in Kuwait Vex the Iraqis

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 5

 BODY:

 
In Small Bands
Western diplomats said that they did not know the strength of the resistance forces, but that they were apparently organized as guerrilla bands of a dozen members or less. Some of the fighters are former policemen or soldiers from Kuwait's armed forces, the diplomats said, but others are Kuwaiti civilians with no military background.
''The Kuwaitis had a quilt-work of neighborhood groups and alliances that were a part of their way of life, and these are the basis for the new guerrilla groups,'' one diplomat said. ''They are closely woven networks, and it is easy for the members to keep in touch with each other.'' 
Iraq swept into Kuwait on Aug. 2 with 150,000 soldiers, 1,200 tanks and 1,000 other armored vehicles. A diplomat said Iraq ''could vaporize'' the rebels with its superior force. But he and others said it appeared that the Iraqi Army was trying to avoid clashes.
''The Iraqis don't want to create a siege mentality,'' a diplomat said. ''For political purposes, Iraq would like the situation to seem normal.''
 
Weapons From Police Armories
The Kuwaiti rebel forces were originally equipped with weapons taken from the Kuwaiti police and military armories during the initial retreat. Some arms were captured from the Iraqis or purchased from Iraqi deserters, the diplomats said.
But the diplomats said the resistance now appears to be receiving support from inside Saudi Arabia. They cited unconfirmed reports that United States Army Special Forces teams are working with Kuwaitis there.
''I believe the Americans are in touch with the guys in Saudi Arabia,'' a diplomat said.
Before the invasion, Kuwait, a little smaller than Vermont, was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a per-capita income of nearly $15,000. Some of the guerrillas are communicating with expensive cellular telephones, a diplomat said.
Some people who have left the country in the last few days said they had seen Kuwaitis throw firebombs at Iraqi trucks and tanks and detontate remote-controlled explosives under military vehicles. In the early days of the Iraqi occupation, they said, some Kuwaitis used their cars to run down lone Iraqi soldiers.
 
Iraqis Travel in Groups
''Now you rarely see fewer than four Iraqi soldiers alone,'' a European who left the country said. ''They go out in groups for their own protection.''
Doctors in Kuwait have told diplomats that 20 to 25 Iraqi soldiers are arriving at hospitals nearly every night with gunshot wounds.
''The resistance is not strong enough to actually push the Iraqis out at this point,'' a diplomat said. ''But they are making life difficult for the Iraqis. They're making their presence known, and they are a force that can be built upon.''
A European woman recalled watching red tracer bullets sail through the night sky. On nights like these, she said, her family slept on the living room floor, well away from the windows.
Iraq has denied that a Kuwaiti resistance exists. None of the radio or television stations or newspapers, all run by the Government, have reported any guerrilla activity, and Government officials belittle the stories that have leaked out.
 
Wishful Thinking, Iraq Says
''It's very strong in your press,'' said Naji al-Hadithi, the chief spokesman for Iraq's Ministry of Information. ''It's very strong among wishful thinkers.''
But when the Rev. Jesse Jackson visited Kuwait with reporters on Aug. 31, the Iraqi security forces were clearly worried about being attacked. The Iraqi described as the chief local protocol officer carried a 9-millimeter automatic pistol jammed in his belt, and three carloads of men with rifles escorted Mr. Jackson everywhere.
Mr. Jackson asked why the Iraqis accompanying him were so heavily armed.
''We have to carry guns for safety and to make sure peace and security prevails,'' one of his escorts replied.
To guard against attacks from speeding cars, the Iraqis have set up a series of S-turns at approaches to their checkpoints throughout Kuwait City. Immediately after the invasion, diplomats said, sandbag bunkers were assembled along the waterfront to guard against raiders from the sea. Now, they said, the bunkers face inward, so Iraqi riflemen can scan the streets and buildings for guerrillas.
 
Protecting Foreigners
Diplomats and fleeing residents said the guerrillas have also been protecting foreigners hiding in Kuwait.
After initially moving to detain Westerners and Japanese in Iraq and Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein has been allowing some women and children to leave. He has said that most of the men will be detained as human shields against an American attack as long as the military standoff in the Persian Gulf continues.
After Mr. Hussein declared that any resident sheltering a foreigner would be executed, the rebels put out the word that they would shoot anyone who turned in a foreigner.
Two Dutch women said the Iraqis had marked the houses of foreigners in their neighborhood with red paint and the houses of Kuwaitis with black paint. Overnight, the women said, Kuwaitis opposing the occupation covered all of the red markings with black paint and obliterated street numbers on the houses.
To confuse the occupiers further, the two women said, resistance members also took down most street signs.
Before the invasion, Kuwait had a population of about two million, of which about a third were native Kuwaitis. More than 600,000 people have since fled to Jordan, and several hundred thousand others are believed to have taken refuge in Saudi Arabia. The declining population works to the disadvantage of the rebels, who try to blend in with other Kuwaitis and rely on them for support and information about the occupiers.
 
Hoping for a U.S. Attack
The guerrillas are yearning for a large-scale attack by the United States, but there has been no indication that their hopes will be met.
Kuwait's Crown Prince, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, asserted at a news conference in London that the resistance would ''continue and escalate.''
Mr. Hadithi, the Iraqi spokesman, was asked whether his Government would consider holding a referendum in which Kuwaitis could decide whether their country should become part of Iraq. ''We don't hold referendums on matters of national sovereignty,'' he replied. ''This is a matter of national sovereignty.''
The Crown Prince said he also opposed a plebiscite in Kuwait.
''The Kuwaiti people have already expressed their opinion,'' he said. ''They are emphatic about what kind of Government they want.''
A European diplomat said the resistance could expect almost ''unlimited funding'' from Kuwait's royal family, which has vast holdings outside the country, and from Western nations committed to reversing Iraq's conquest.
''Money is going to be available from everyone,'' the diplomat said. ''The resistance is serious about what it's doing, and it's going to get plenty of help.''

Attempts Have Been Made to Break Trade Embargo Against Iraq, U.S. Officials Say

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:

 
Disclosure Seen as Deterrent
None of the oil deliveries or the payments appear to violate the United Nations sanctions, which apply only to oil sales or other trade with Iraq conducted after Aug. 6.
The Bush Administration is citing the oil shipments and efforts to break the trade ban to United Nations diplomats in an effort to underscore American resolve and to deter potential violators by making it clear that illegal trade with Iraq will be detected and revealed.
United States intelligence agencies have uncovered efforts by private concerns in two dozen nations to smuggle goods to Iraq and have immediately notified the host governments and urged them to take legal action, Administration officials said today. 
One Government official said several of those concerns were ''professional sanctions-busters,'' experienced in breaking embargoes against such nations as Rhodesia, that are now seeking to sell their services to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
That official said the companies were based in such locations as Brazil, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Austria and Britain. They are described as ''fronts'' with no real corporate structure, none of them well known internationally.
None of those Governments were aware of the concerns' secret overtures to Iraq, the official said. He said Eastern European smugglers were proving a particular problem because the region's new democratic governments were ill-equipped to track or thwart illegal deals.
 
Some Deals Are Reported
The Associated Press, citing a State Department document, reported today that Cuba and Romania had struck oil deals with Iraq and that two unnamed companies in Western Europe had secretly offered to smuggle food into Iraq. The report also said unidentified companies in Eastern Europe, East Asia and Africa had offered to smuggle weapons and other goods as well.
Romania's Ambassador to the United States, Virgil Constantinescu, today denied the A.P. report and issued a list of his nation's oil purchases since Aug. 5, all from nations other than Iraq.
Mr. Constantinescu said in a written statement that Iraq had offered to give Romania about one million metric tons of oil to settle past debts but that the offer had been rejected. He also said Romania had canceled two contracts with an American oil company, Chevron Corporation, for 150,000 metric tons of Iraqi oil.
An Administration official, speaking on condition that he not be named, said that Iraq had discussed oil sales to Romania but that it was uncertain which nation had raised the prospect of a sale.
Romania, like many Eastern European nations, had conducted a busy trade with Iraq and is suffering economically from the trade embargo.
Officials said the Cuban oil shipment had been unloaded from the Iraqi-flag oil tanker Amuriyah, which docked in Cuba in the last week of August. Shipping officials said the Amuriyah left the Turkish city of Ceyhan on July 31, two days before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, after taking on a cargo of crude oil at an Iraqi pipeline that terminates on the Mediterranean Sea near Turkey's border with Syria.
Cuba has been hit by oil shortages stemming from a slowdown in deliveries by its major supplier, the Soviet Union, and President Fidel Castro recently imposed drastic energy conservation measures throughout the island.

Transcript of President's Address to Joint Session of Congress

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
They are some of the finest men and women of the United States of America. And they're doing one terrific job.
These valiant Americans were ready at a moment's notice to leave their spouses, and their children to serve on the front line halfway around the world. And they remind us who keeps America strong. They do.
In the trying circumstances of the gulf, the morale of our servicemen and women is excellent. In the face of danger, they are brave; they're well trained and dedicated. 
A soldier, Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville, Tenn., now stationed in Saudi Arabia, wrote his parents of his worries, his love of family and his hope for peace. But Wade also wrote: ''I am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression. I am proud of my army and its men. . . . I am proud to serve my country.''
Well, let me just say, Wade, America is proud of you, and is grateful to every soldier, sailor, marine and airman serving the cause of peace in the Persian Gulf.
I also want to thank the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell; the Chiefs here tonight; our commander in the Persian Gulf, General Schwarzkopf; and the men and women of the Department of Defense. What a magnificent job you all are doing, and thank you very, very much. I'm grateful to you.
I wish I could say that their work is done. But we all know it is not.
So if there ever was a time to put country before self and patriotism before party, time is now. Let me thank all Americans, especially those here in this chamber tonight, for your support for our armed forces and for their mission. That support will be even more important in the days to come.
 
Objectives in the Gulf
So tonight, I want to talk to you about what is at stake, what we must do together to defend civilized values around the world and maintain our economic strength at home.
Our objectives in the Persian Gulf are clear, our goals defined and familiar:
* Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately and without condition.
* Kuwait's legitimate Government must be restored.
* The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured.
* And American citizens abroad must be protected.
These goals are not ours alone. They have been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council five times in as many weeks. Most countries share our concern for principle. And many have a stake in the stability of the Persian Gulf. This is not, as Saddam Hussein would have it, the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the world.
As you know, I've just returned from a very productive meeting with Soviet President Gorbachev. And I am pleased that we are working together to build a new relationship. In Helsinki, our joint statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter Iraq's threat to peace. Let me quote: ''We are united in the belief that Iraq's aggression must not be tolerated. No peaceful international order is possible if larger states can devour their smaller neighbors.''
Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West confrontation to stymie concerted United Nations action against aggression. A new partnership of nations has begun. And we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective - a new world order - can emerge: a new era, freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and south, can prosper and live in harmony.
A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. And today that new world is struggling to be born. A world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.
 
A Shared Vision
This is the vision that I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki. He, and other leaders from Europe, the gulf and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generations to come.
The test we face is great - and so are the stakes. This is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world.
America and the world must defend common vital interests. And we will. America and the world must support the rule of law. And we will. America and the world must stand up to aggression. And we will.
And one thing more: In the pursuit of these goals, America will not be intimidated.
Vital issues of principle are at stake. Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face of the earth. We do not exaggerate. Nor do we exaggerate when we say: Saddam Hussein will fail.
Vital economic interests are at risk as well. Iraq itself controls some 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Iraq plus Kuwait controls twice that. An Iraq permitted to swallow Kuwait would have the economic and military power, as well as the arrogance, to intimidate and coerce its neighbors, neighbors who control the lion's share of the world's remaining oil reserves. We cannot permit a resource so vital to be dominated by one so ruthless. And we won't.
Recent events have, have surely proven that there is no substitute for American leadership. In the face of tyranny, let no one doubt American credibility and reliability. Let no one doubt our staying power. We will stand by our friends. One way or another, the leader of Iraq must learn this fundamental truth.
 
Response to Aggression
From the outset, acting hand in hand with others, we've sought to fashion the broadest possible international response to Iraq's aggression. The level of world cooperation and condemnation of Iraq is unprecedented.
Armed forces from countries spanning four continents are there at the request of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to deter and if need be to defend against attack. Muslims and non-Muslims, Arabs and non-Arabs, soldiers from many nations, stand shoulder to shoulder, resolute against Saddam Hussein's ambitions.
And we can now point to five United Nations Security Council resolutions that condemn Iraq's aggression. They call for Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government, and categorically reject Iraq's cynical and self-serving attempt to annex Kuwait.
Finally, the United Nations has demanded the release of all foreign nationals held hostage against their will and in contravention of international law. It's a mockery of human decency to call these people ''guests.'' They are hostages, and the whole world knows it.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a dependable ally, said it all: ''We do not bargain over hostages. We will not stoop to the level of using human beings as bargaining chips ever.''
Of course, of course, our hearts go out to the hostages and to their families. But our policy cannot change. And it will not change. America and the world will not be blackmailed by this ruthless policy.
We're now in sight of a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders. We owe much to the outstanding leadership of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The United Nations is backing up its words with action. The Security Council has imposed mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq, designed to force Iraq to relinquish the spoils of its illegal conquest. The Security Council has also taken the decisive step of authorizing the use of all means necessary to ensure compliance with these sanctions.
Together with our friends and allies, ships of the United States Navy are today patrolling Mideast waters. And they've already intercepted more than 700 ships to enforce the sanctions. Three regional leaders I spoke with just yesterday told me that these sanctions are working. Iraq is feeling the heat.
We continue to hope that Iraq's leaders will recalculate just what their aggression has cost them. They are cut off from world trade, unable to sell their oil. And only a tiny fraction of goods gets through.
The communique with President Gorbachev made mention of what happens when the embargo is so effective that children of Iraq literally need milk, or the sick truly need medicine. Then, under strict international supervision that guarantees the proper destination, then food will be permitted.
 
Sharing the Burden
At home, the material cost of our leadership can be steep. And that's why Secretary of State Baker and Treasury Secretary Brady have met with many world leaders to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be shared. We are prepared to do our share and more to help carry the load; we insist that others do their share as well.
The response of most of our friends and allies has been good. To help defray costs, the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the U.A.E., United Arab Emirates, have pledged to provide our deployed troops with all the food and fuel they need. And generous assistance will also be provided to stalwart front-line nations such as Turkey and Egypt.
And I am also heartened to report that this international response extends to the neediest victims of this conflict - those refugees. For our part, we have contributed $28 million for relief efforts. And this is but a portion of what is needed. I commend, in particular, Saudi Arabia, Japan and several European nations who have joined us in this purely humanitarian effort.
There is an energy-related cost to be borne as well. Oil-producting nations are already replacing lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti output. More than half of what was lost has been made up. And we're are getting superb cooperation. If producers, including the United States, continue steps to expand oil and gas production, we can stabilize prices and guarantee against hardship. Additionally, we and several of our allies always have the option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserves, if conditions warrant. As I have pointed out before, conservation efforts are essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible. And we must then take advantage of our energy sources across the board: coal, natural gas, hydro and nuclear. Our failure, our failure to do these things has made us more dependent on foreign oil than ever before. And finally, let no one even contemplate profiteering from this crisis. We will not have it.
 
Resolve on Kuwait
I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Sanctions will take time to have their full intended effect. We will continue to review all options with our allies, but let it be clear: We will not let this aggression stand.
Our interest, our involvement in the gulf, is not transitory. It predated Saddam Hussein's aggression and will survive it. Long after all our troops come home, and we all hope it's soon, very soon, there will be a lasting role for the United States in assisting the nations of the Persian Gulf. Our role, then, to deter future aggression. Our role is to help our friends in their own self-defense. And something else: to curb the proliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missile and, above all, nuclear technologies.
And let me also make clear that the United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator, and with his aggression. Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait. And that's not a threat, not a boast. It's just the way it's going to be.
Our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depends on how we conduct ourselves at home. Our economy, our armed forces, our energy dependence, and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friends and stand up to our foes.
For America to lead, America must remain strong and vital. Our world leadership and domestic strength are mutual and reinforcing; a woven piece, strongly bound as Old Glory.
To revitalize our leadership, our leadership capacity, we must address our budget deficit - not after Election Day, or next year, but now.
Higher oil prices slow our growth, and higher defense costs would only make our fiscal deficit problem worse. That deficit was already greater than it should have been: a projected $232 billion for the coming year. It must - it will - be reduced.
To my friends in Congress, together we must act this very month, before the next fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, to get America's economic house in order. The gulf situation helps us realize we are more economically vulnerable than we ever should be. Americans must never again enter any crisis, economic or military, with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of Federal debt.
Most Americans are sick and tired of endless battles in the Congress and between the branches over budget matters. It is high time we pulled together, and get the job done right. And it's up to us to straighten this out.
 
Tax and Military Goals
And the job has four basic parts.
First, the Congress should, this month, within a budget agreement, enact growth-oriented tax measures to help avoid recession in the short term and to increase savings, investment, productivity and competitiveness for the longer term. These measures include extending incentives for research and experimentation; expanding the use of I.R.A.'s for new homeowners; establishing tax-deferred family savings accounts; creating incentives for the creation of enterprise zones and initiatives to encourage more domestic drilling, and, yes, reducing the tax rate on capital gains.
And second, the Congress should, this month, enact a prudent multiyear defense program, one that reflects not only the improvement in East-West relations, but our broader responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw action and regional conflict. Even with our obligations in the gulf, a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms, and we are prepared to accept that. But to go beyond, but to go beyond such levels, where cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety, is something I will never accept.
The world is still dangerous. And surely that is now clear. Stability is not secure. American interests are far-reaching. Interdependence has increased. The consequences of regional instability can be global. This is no time to risk America's capacity to protect her vital interests.
And third, the Congress should, this month, enact measures to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil. These measures should include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration, fuel switching and to accelerate the development of the Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife.
As you know, when the oil embargo was imposed in the early 1970's, the United States imported almost six million barrels of oil a day. This year, before the Iraqi invasion, U.S. imports had risen to nearly eight million barrels per day. And we'd moved in the wrong direction. And now we must act to correct that trend. And fourth: The Congress should, this month, enact a five-year program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by $500 billion - that's by half a trillion dollars. And if, with the Congress, we can develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month, we can avoid the ax of ''sequester,'' deep across-the-board cuts that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption.
 
Tests for a Budget Agreement
I want to be able to tell the American people that we have truly solved the deficit problem. And for me to do that, a budget agreement must meet these tests:
* It must include the measures I've recommended to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil.
* It must be fair. All should contribute, but the burden should not be excessive for any one group or programs or people.
* It must address the growth of Government's hidden liabilities.
* It must reform the budget process, and further, it must be real.
I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive five-year deficit reduction program to me as a complete legislative package, with measures to assure that it can be fully enforced. America is tired of phony deficit reduction, or promise-now, save-later-plans. It is time for a program that is credible and real.
And finally, to the extent that the defict reduction program includes new revenue measures, it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn us back towards the days of punishing income tax rates. That is one path we should not head down again.
I, I have been pleased with recent progress, although it's not always seemed so smooth.
 
But now it's time to produce
And I hope we can work out a responsible plan. But with or without agreement from the budget summit, I ask both houses of the Congress to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package, not later than Sept. 28th.
And if the Congress cannot get me a budget, then Americans will have to face a tough, mandated sequester.
I'm hopeful, in fact I'm confident, that the Congress will do what it should, and I can assure you that we in the executive branch will do our part.
In the final analysis, our ability to meet our responsibilities abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home. It's never easy in democracies, for we govern only with the consent of the governed. And although free people in a free society are bound to have their differences, Americans traditionally come together in times of adversity and challenge.
Once again, Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and distant shore. At this very moment, they serve together with Arabs, Europeans, Asians and Africans in defense of principle and the dream of a new world order. And that's why they sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun.
And if they can come together under such adversity, if old adversaries like the Soviet Union and the United States can work in common cause, then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this great chamber - Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives - can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here.
Thank you, good night and God bless the United States of America.

HEADLINE: Work With China, Without Illusions

 BODY:
The U.S. and other democracies should encourage these constructive moves now by easing the diplomatic ostracism imposed on Beijing after the June 1989 bloodbath in Tiananmen Square. President Bush was always right to insist that the world had nothing to gain from isolating China. But he then undermined support for his own arguments by downplaying Beijing's gross abuse of human rights. 
There's good reason for hard-headed diplomatic realism; there's no excuse for reviving soft-headed fantasies about the nature of Deng Xiaoping's China. Beijing's leadership has left no doubt about its determination to uphold Communist dictatorship by force, despite Communism's collapse elsewhere. Wise American policy would keep both American interests and values in clear sight.
Mr. Bush isn't the first President to let his diplomatic stance toward China color his reading of Chinese politics. For more than two decades after the Communists won control of the mainland, the U.S. insisted that Mao Zedong's regime was an extension of Soviet power, with the real China temporarily camped in Taiwan. This self-deception kept the U.S. from grasping the reality of Sino-Soviet rivalry, and contributed to disastrous misjudgments about the strategic significance of Vietnam.
Richard Nixon, while he prevented others from acting on the Sino-Soviet schism, made it a centerpiece of his own approach. Together with Henry Kissinger, he stood the old China policy on its head, courting Beijing as a strategic ally against Moscow.
The image of a heartless ''Red China'' yielded to something more worthy of American friendship: a land of Ping-Pong players, pandas and the Great Wall. That was all the more remarkable since the new U.S.-China amity began during the final years of the radical, murderous Cultural Revolution.
Mr. Deng's rise to power brought welcome economic reforms, but American leaders ignored continued political repression. To be sure, U.S. diplomats weren't the only ones surprised by the brutality of last year's massacre. But more than a year later the Bush Administration still won't reconcile its policies to Chinese realities.
Nations can make common cause in foreign policy even when they do not share common values. China's leaders understand that well enough. They wage fierce war against ''bourgeois liberalization'' and Soviet-style reforms at home even while they cooperate with Washington and Moscow. America's leaders would do well to learn that pragmatic alignment does not require wholesale endorsement.

HEADLINE: 'Motor-Voter' Bill: Good for Democracy

 BODY:
The House has already passed a bipartisan bill that would replace present state-by-state barriers to enrollment with reasonable standards for Federal elections. Similar legislation will soon reach the Senate floor. Democracy will surely be expanded if the Senate swiftly rebuffs ill-considered opposition from the Bush Administration and the Senate minority leader, Robert Dole.
The core provision of the so-called ''motor-voter'' bill, sponsored by Senator Wendell Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, would require states to enable eligible voters to register to vote when they apply for a driver's license or license renewal. That would be a tremendous boost for enrollment, since about 90 percent of voting-age Americans drive. The impact on actual turnout, while harder to forecast, would probably also be significant, since roughly 8 registered voters in 10 go to the polls.
Other provisions would permit registration by mail, and make registration forms available at public agencies like welfare and unemployment offices. The bill would also end the destructive practice of purging voters from the rolls simply for not voting.
These laudable efforts to boost participation have drawn fire from the Administration and Senator Dole, who has introduced a weaker bill in the hope of siphoning enough Republican votes to defeat mandatory reforms.
One complaint is that the bill could lead to voting fraud. The House version, however, contains strong anti-fraud provisions that could be incorporated into the final bill. Mr. Dole also says the new Federal requirement would usurp state authority. But that's precisely the point. If Congress won't act decisively to expand the franchise, who will?

HEADLINE: Sex Education Declines, Teen-Age Births Rise;
Plight in New York

 BODY:
The state tried to offset some of the loss with modest annual increases. But the funds were well below what was needed to keep up with the burgeoning needs of the quarter-million low-income women and adolescents who rely on the statewide network of 250 family-planning clinics for subsidized primary care.
Clinic visits for treatment of sexually transmissible diseases alone have increased by almost 80 percent since 1984. It is estimated that $2 million a year out of family-planning money goes toward these related services. Clinics also had to dig into pregnancy-prevention resources to start a department for human immunodeficiency virus in 1987 without any new appropriation. Doubling and tripling of Pap test costs has added some $1 million more to the squeeze, leaving fewer dollars earmarked specifically for contraceptive education and services. 
These funding constraints, plus major staffing difficulties, fueled by shrinking resources for nursing salaries, have severely reduced access. Forced to retrench vital services, clinics in some areas of the state have seen waiting time for appointments stretch to five weeks.
Our latest analysis shows that adolescents younger than 18 and women with family income less than 150 percent of the poverty level have become a steadily decreasing proportion of family-planning patients in the last three years.
The unmet need is tremendous. Upstate, less than 40 percent of adolescents 13 to 19 years old at risk of unintended pregnancy are receiving family-planning services. In New York City, the unmet need is significantly higher, with less than 25 percent served in discrete family-planning projects that provide subsidized care.
New funds are desperately needed in New York State to forestall further retrenchment in the family-planning program. Until we close the funding gap, we can expect to see more and more of the medical, social and economic consequences of unwed teen-age parents.

HEADLINE: We're on the Wrong Side in El Salvador

 BODY:
The suppression and exploitation of the Salvadoran people by less than 10 percent at the top of the economic structure, and by an army that fights only for that elite, is a serious matter for us, since our tax dollars, in large amounts, sustain that situation.
The Salvadoran Government, whether in league with the army or too weak to oppose it, in 1987 declared an amnesty, dropping charges against all army personnel accused of participating in massacres against, no doubt, ''leftist'' peasants, ''leftist'' members of the clergy, perhaps even ''rebels.'' The following year a judge threatened to prosecute army officers known to be connected with death squads; the case, or rather the judge, was disposed of by one more death-squad murder. 
As a stingy taxpayer, I'm always interested where our money goes. A little information comes from a House of Representatives resolution introduced two years ago by half a dozen representatives (at least one of them a Republican), which discloses that in the previous year the United States gave the Salvadoran Government $608 million. This is support for a government by and for the very small percentage of the Salvadoran people who own 90 percent of the land and everything else. The $608 million was 105 percent of what all Salvadorans contributed to their government's expenditures.
I don't think we can be proud of our support for this war against peasants, members of the clergy and ''rebels,'' the underdogs on whose side any normal American would be, if normal Americans received a little information about this situation.
That we have openly appropriated only $85 million this year is hardly encouraging. It is still going to the wrong side, and who knows how much more we're sending the oppressors through the Central Intelligence Agency.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Not the Only Crisis

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Not at all. West Germany and the Soviet Union, for instance, now have agreed on how to share the costs of Soviet troop withdrawals from East Germany; so German reunification actually will take place on Oct. 3, barely three weeks from now. In the long run, this might be the most important event of 1990, or the coming decade; but it's taking place in a vacuum of public and perhaps official discussion, owing to the Middle East frenzy created by a dedicated Administration and a headline-happy press. 
Only five weeks ago the major topics of American political discussion were the nomination of David Souter to the Supreme Court, the $50 billion savings and loan scandal that made Neil Bush a household name, an economy that even an upbeat President called ''sluggish,'' his broken pledge to oppose new taxes, and efforts to deal with the budget deficit.
None of these matters have disappeared or been managed. Though Senate hearings on Mr. Souter are at hand, all have taken second place to the idea of the U.S. standing tall in the desert, in opposition to aggression and in defense of oil. It's not clear which comes first, and both are admittedly important; but so are other problems that existed before Saddam Hussein loosed his tanks - problems that will not be solved by more troops from Egypt or more Presidential backslapping in Helsinki.
In keeping to his August vacation schedule, Mr. Bush sought to show that he was not hostage to the Middle East crisis, as President Carter was thought to have been when Iran was holding U.S. hostages. Staying in Maine thus made some sense (though with oil supplies supposedly in danger the President at least could have beached his gas-guzzling speedboat). In fact, Mr. Bush's single-minded attention to the Iraqi problem, however successful his efforts, may have made him as much a hostage to a single issue as Mr. Carter was.
In particular, that sluggish U.S. economy, and the dubious determination of Democrats and Republicans alike to raise taxes anyway, demands Mr. Bush's attention as much as does the Middle East. An economic collapse at home would make a major military commitment abroad incongruous, if not impossible, even with Saudi money as a backup. And what would distinguish one supposed superpower from another if each tried to maintain a military front on top of an economy sliding into ruin?
It has largely escaped notice, moreover, in Americans' persistent innocence of even their own history, that Mr. Bush has reverted to the sort of imperial Presidential conduct that the Vietnam War should have taught the nation to question. It's true that he has kept Congress informed about his Middle East policy; but the strategy, decisions and announced goals all have been his, including one that could backfire - to expel Iraq from Kuwait and restore the emirate.
Few now dispute that goal; but suppose Iraq suddenly withdraws from Kuwait, contradicting Mr. Hussein but apparently bowing to overpowering opposition as well as to Mr. Bush's demands. That would bring about the end of the blockade, the embargo and the anti-Iraq coalition, force Mr. Bush to bring U.S. troops home and leave Iraq unscathed as a military power - perhaps, having defied the U.S. and the world without real loss, even enhanced as a dominant voice in the Middle East.
Mr. Bush's imperial crisis management might not then seem so impressive; both Congress and the public might ask some embarrassing questions, such as: Who was the real winner? And who took the U.S. out on a limb that could be cut off behind it?

HEADLINE: In S.& L. Bailout, U.S. Is Moving to Evict 8 Rent-Regulated Tenants

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The Resolution Trust foreclosed on the eight apartments as assets of a failed Long Island savings and loan association, and has said it intends to sell them.
Thousands of rent-regulated apartments in New York State are potentially at risk because they are owned either by thrift institutions, by investors who are in a tight financial squeeze because of the real-estate slump in New York and the rest of the Northeast, or by lenders who have foreclosed on the apartments.
Tenants of any of the apartments that are seized by the Resolution Trust Corporation could be evicted, Federal officials said yesterday.
State officials said they could not predict how widespread evictions would become if the Federal agency prevails on East 57th Street. Lawyers on Mr. Abrams's staff said yesterday that they knew of two other buildings in New York City and its suburbs where Federal regulators had already foreclosed on rent-regulated apartments, but they declined to specify the locations of the buildings or the number of apartments at risk. In a letter to the executive director of the Resolution Trust Corporation, David C. Cooke, Mr. Abrams called the Federal action illegal. The New York State Commissioner for Housing and Community Renewal, Richard L. Higgins, who oversees rent-stabilization laws, said lawyers for New York State were preparing to challenge the East 57th Street evictions in court. 
''They are trying to solve the savings and loan crisis on the back of our rent-regulated tenants,'' Mr. Higgins said, ''and we will not stand for it.''
A spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corporation in Washington, Stephen Katsanos, said the agency would not withdraw its eviction notices at the East 57th Street building.
If the Federal agency prevails, Mr. Katsanos said, it might evict rental tenants in any building it takes over from an insolvent lender.
Legal experts said the Resolution Trust Corporation might assert its right as an agent of the Federal Government to supersede state law.
The Resolution Trust Corporation said it was authorized to withdraw from any lease obligations through the same Federal legislation under which it was established, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. Mr. Katsanos said the Federal law allowed it to supersede state or local rental protection measures.
In the case of the East 57th Street condominium, the Federal agency sent letters to the eight rental tenants on Aug. 17 that gave them notice of eviction and offered them the opportunity to buy their apartments. The asking prices ranged from $330,000 to $920,000.
 
Protection Against Eviction
None of the tenants have accepted the offer. A lawyer for the tenants, Robert A. Machleder, said yesterday that some might consider lower offers but that all planned to defend themselves against eviction in court.
Some of the tenants' apartments are rent controlled and the others' are rent stablized. Rent control covers buildings construct before 1947. Rent stabilization generally covers apartments in buildings constructed between 1947 and 1974 and those built later with city tax abatements. Although the two sets of regulations apply different formulas to rent increases, they both offer the same protection against eviction.
Mr. Katsanos said the Federal agency decided to serve notice of eviction at the building because the tenants were paying rents far below the market rate and far less than the Government, as landlord of their units, would be required to pay in monthly common charges and other expenses. Collectively, the eight tenants pay rental bills of $9,000 a month, he said. In addition, carrying charges for the Government - which include common charges, taxes in arrears and payments to the condominium's reserve fund - are $37,000 a month.
 
Authority to Override
The eight tenants pay monthly rents ranging from $550 to $1,700.
The notices sent to them say that if they do not purchase their apartments, they must vacate when their current leases expire, some as early as Sept. 30.
Mr. Abrams said yesterday that the legal dispute with Resolution Trust would revolve around the Federal Government's authority to override state law. ''We assert that they do not have the power to override a law that protects peoples' homes,'' he said.
If Resolution Trust proceeds with its evictions, the action would not affect many tenants in the East 57th Street building. The eight apartments are among more than 20 in the building with rent-regulated tenants, officials said.
The other apartments were not used as collateral for bank financing by the sponsor in the building's 1982 conversion, Gerald Guterman, a New York developer. After converting the building, Mr. Guterman used some of his unsold, rent-regulated apartments as collateral for bank loans - a common practice among cooperative and condominium converters in the real-estate boom of the 1980's.
His loans were obtained from the Nassau Federal Savings and Loan Association of Long Island. In 1986, facing a financial downturn, Mr. Guterman defaulted on the loans, and the eight apartments were seized by the thrift institution.
But Nassau Federal was also a victim of the region's real-estate slump, and its assets were seized by the Resolution Trust Corporation in July.

HEADLINE: Morrison Is Democrats' Pick For Governor of Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 11

 BODY:

 
Cibes Withholds Endorsement
The turnout in the primary was light, with about 20 percent of the state's 681,000 registered Democrats turning out to vote.
But it was not clear that the divisions within the party would be healed as quickly as Mr. Morrison hoped. Mr. Cibes, a professor of government at Connecticut College and a 12-year veteran of the General Assembly, conceded defeat just before 9:30, about 90 minutes after the polls closed, but he said he would withhold his endorsement of Mr. Morrison, pending further discussions with him.
Mr. Cibes, who entered the race in March with little money or name recognition, based his appeal to voters on what he said was the ''hard truth'' that Connecticut's tax system had reached a dead end and needed a complete overhaul, including the introduction of a personal income tax on wages. The state is one of only 10 without a tax on wages and salaries. 
''The issues that we raised in this campaign will not go away,'' Mr. Cibes said in his concession speech at the campaign headquarters here. He told his supporters that they should be proud of raising the issue of changing the tax system. He predicted tax change would ultimately be embraced by the party.
 
Landslide Proportions
Mr. Morrison, a former legal assistance lawyer for the poor in New Haven who has represented Connecticut's Third Congressional District since 1983, predicted last week that he would win by a 10 percentage-point margin, or by about 55 percent to 45 percent, the traditional measure, he said, of a landslide. But the victory was even greater than that.
Mr. Morrison won by major margins in his own Congressional district and also carried towns in the First Congressional District around Hartford, considered an important battleground. He carried East Hartford, for example, with 1,460 votes to 925 for Mr. Cibes. But many of the small towns like Columbia and Andover went to Mr. Cibes.
Mr. Morrison had maintained throughout the campaign that the real choice to be made was not the question of Mr. Cibes's tax plan but rather who would do best in November against Mr. Weicker and Mr. Rowland. Mr. Morrison said he opposed the income-tax plan and would never impose such a dramatic change on the state without first holding a referendum to seek majority approval.
In the only other major primary race today, for the Republican nomination for the Third Congressional District seat, the endorsed candidate, State Senator Thomas Scott, defeated former State Representative Gerard B. Patton, winning about 70 percent of the vote. Mr. Scott will face the Democratic nominee, Rosa L. DeLauro, in November.
While today's vote in the governor's race ended the formal competition for supremacy in the party, a number of unknowns still hang over the Democrats as they begin the race toward November.
 
O'Neill's Role at Issue
One is money. With three candidates in the running and the state's economy slumping, the competition for campaign contributions is intense. Mr. Cibes, for example, who had set a goal of $200,000 by Primary Day - a modest amount to start with compared with the other candidates - raised only $120,000 by last week. Mr. Morrison was forced to borrow more than $300,000 earlier this year to keep his campaign afloat and had only about $26,000 on hand.
Another question is the role of Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat who will leave office after 10 years.
Mr. O'Neill, who intended to run for a third term, saw his popularity plummet beginning last year as residents blamed him for the state's souring economy and soaring tax rates. Although he withdrew from the race in March and stayed formally neutral, his presence hung over the primary and affected both candidates.
In comments to reporters, for example, Mr. O'Neill frequently displayed a distaste for Mr. Morrison in subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle terms and an open fondness for Mr. Cibes, a longtime colleague who helped organize Mr. O'Neill's campaign in 1986.
Mr. Morrison also appeared to cultivate his differences with Mr. O'Neill, identifying himself throughout the campaign as a governor who would be ''on your side for a change.''

HEADLINE: New York City Acts to Protect Water

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y., Sept. 11

 BODY:
The overhaul is motivated by development pressure that has degraded, by varying degrees, water quality in the three systems. Tap water is still safe to drink, environmental officials say. But the existing regulations have failed to keep pace with changes in the reservoir watersheds, they add.
 
'Playing a Lot of Catch-Up'
New York City's authority to place restrictions on development in watershed areas stems from a state law passed 85 years ago. The law gave the city the right to take upstate lands and flood them for reservoirs. Today, the city owns 18 reservoirs, 12 of which are in the Croton system and 6 in the Catskill and Delaware systems. Besides New York City, they serve residents of Orange, Putnam, Ulster and Westchester counties. 
''This has not been gone through in 37 years and we're playing a lot of catch-up,'' Albert F. Appleton, the city's Commisioner of Environmental Protection, said today at a briefing here on the proposals to revise the 1953 regulations.
If the effort fails to halt the slippage in water quality, New York City may have to spend $2 1/2 billion - the state's estimate - or $4 billion - the city's -to filter water from the Catskill and Delaware systems that now receives minimal treatment. New York City is already building a $600 million filtration plant for the Croton system, which lies in Westchester and Putnam counties. The Croton system supplies 10 percent of the city's water. The Catskill and Delware systems supply the rest.
The tighter controls greatly concern upstate residents, who worry about their cost and impact on the economy.
 
Imperious Attitude Resented
''I'm worried that there is very little buildable land left'' and that the new regulations will put the remaining sites off limits, said Marian Umhey, supervisor of Shandaken, a town in Ulster County that relies on tourism.
Some residents are also resentful of New York City's imposing its will in empire-like fashion.
Herbert Hekler, planning director of Ulster County, said relations between the city and upstate residents had improved in recent years. ''But if New York comes in and says you can't do this and can't do that,'' Mr. Hekler said, ''there will be hostilities.''
New York officials are going to some lengths to blunt upstate suspicions. Today's proposal was an informal draft. After absorbing local views for several months, city officials plan to reissue the regulations, hold formal public hearings and then make them final, perhaps by March 1991.
 
City and State at Odds
Overhaul of watershed regulations is part of a broader effort by the Dinkins administration to preserve drinking water quality. The city has also sued upstate sewage treatment plants and a town planning board and intends to spend $44 million to upgrade nine upstate, city-owned sewage plants.
But the watershed regulations have not been revised since 1953. Pressure to do so has come from Federal and state governments. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has stated that municipalities can avoid building filtration plants if they can demonstrate they have adequate watershed controls.
The State Health Department has proposed that filtration is the only way to assure a safe water supply. The city and state are at odds, and the issue may be decided by the state Health Commissioner by next January.
Mayor Dinkins and Mr. Appleton say the city can ill afford a filtration plant they estimate will cost $300 million in annual operating expenses and force a rise in water rates to pay for it. The less expensive and environmentally sounder approach is tougher watershed controls, Mr. Appleton said.
 
Widened Buffer Zones
The proposed regulations prohibit discharging hazardous substances. But the rules would widen the buffer zones between water and storage areas for hazardous materials or septic systems.
The rules would also limit the paving that could be done, in an effort to reduce runoff into streams or reservoirs. Disposal of snow removed from roads and parking lots into a waterway would be prohibited.
Some activities, like building new sewage treatment systems and designing stormwater runoff plans, would require approval by the City Department of Environmental Protection. Also, department notification would be required for catastrophic events like an oil spill.

HEADLINE: S.I. Naval Base Wins a Reprieve

 BODY:
Nonetheless, the fate of the port, on which Congress has already spent $230 million, is still unclear.
Ms. Molinari's amendment would prevent closing of the port until 30 days after Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sends Congress an overall plan on the closing and realigning of naval installations. 
Ms. Molinari said last night she did not know when that might be.
 
Dinkins Wants Base Closed
''We had anticipated the Defense Secretary would have come in with the base closure recommendations already, but he hasn't because of the Persian Gulf crisis.''
But she said she was ''very optimistic that the Defense Deparment would recommend keeping the port.'' She called it ''vital for the New York City economy.''
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who supports closing the base on the grounds that some ships stationed there would be carrying nuclear weapons, called the action ''disturbing.''
''The home port neither serves our nation's strategic interests nor protects the safety of the millions of people who live along the shores of New York Harbor,'' Mr. Dinkins said.
The port was one of six planned under a Navy program begun in the mid-1980's when the Administration's goal was a 600-ship Navy.
Ms. Molinari, who succeeded her father, Guy, in Congress last March after he stepped down to run a successful campaign for the office of Staten Island Borough President, saw the 230-to-188 vote as a victory to keep the port open.

HEADLINE: Head of Census Defends Urban Tallies

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Census officials and members of Congress said it was difficult to assess how big a problem the challenges would represent, or when the wave of formal objections to a census count would crest. The 39,000 local jurisdictions that were given their preliminary counts during the last weeks of August each have three weeks to respond and, if necessary, challenge the bureau's counts of housing units in their areas.
Bureau officials could not say today what percentage of local responses were represented by the 1,073 challenges. They also stopped short of any assurances that all the challenges would be rechecked before the bureau numbers could be made final.
 
Complaints From Texas
During the hearing, one witness, Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas, argued that the preliminary counts released last month offered clear indications that Hispanic people in his state had been missed by the bureau's enumerators. 
Mr. Frost listed the population counts for eight predominantly white, suburban counties, whose preliminary 1990 population totals all exceeded the Census Bureau's own earlier estimates.
By contrast, in eight largely Hispanic counties, including two on the Mexican border, the preliminary counts fell consistently below the Census Bureau's earlier estimates.
''The pattern is not uniformly true for every single county in Texas,'' Mr. Frost said. But he added, ''It does occur often enough to raise very serious questions about the accuracy of the count in my state.''
 
Skepticism From Pennsylvania
Representative Tom Ridge, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district in and around the City of Erie showed a sharp decline in population, said he had ''a real strong feeling'' that the census bureau would be fielding many challenges.
''Do you have the time and resources to check all of them?'' he asked Dr. Bryant.
She responded that the bureau was ready to recheck housing units in as many as 500,000 local neighborhoods, which are designated as ''blocks'' on census maps. Other census officials said later that the bureau had set aside money to recheck up to 2.1 million individual housing units.
Others at the hearing questioned how much the housing counts could augment the 1990 census. Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who has been an outspoken critic of the census, said local jurisdictions might have little recourse if the possible shortage in the preliminary figures was caused by people, rather than homes, being missed.
The bureau has until mid-October to assess the challenges, which will come in on a staggered basis until Sept. 24, said John J. Connolly, an assistant to Dr. Bryant.
New York City's challenge, reflecting its review of more than 30,000 census ''blocks'' is due Sept. 19.
While those operations and other last-ditch efforts to augment the preliminary census count of 245.8 million are under way, a parallel process has begun. Bureau statisticians are now beginning their evaluations of a just-completed survey that is considered a crucial measure of how well the original census counted minorities, inner-city residents and the poor.
 
Questions From 1980
The success of this mini-census of 150,000 homes around the country is considered a critical element in the Commerce Department's eventual decision as to whether the flaws in the count are so severe that it should be statistically corrected.
New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Dade County, Fla., filed a lawsuit after the 1980 census seeking to force such a statistical correction of the 1990 count to insure that final figures accurately reflected minority and inner-city populations. That lawsuit is still pending, but in a 1989 agreement the Commerce Department agreed to conduct the mini-census to make an adjustment possible.
At today's hearing two witnesses, Robert S. Rifkind, a lawyer for New York City, and Eugene Ericksen, a statistican in favor of adjustment, questioned whether the bureau was deliberately complicating the completion of the analysis of the mini-census.
The subcommittee chairman, Representative Thomas C. Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat, joined Mr. Ridge in questioning Mark W. Plant, Commerce Department Deputy Under Secretary for economic affairs, as to whether the completion of the analysis was being jeopardized. They asked if the department was setting a higher standard of accuracy for the mini-census than for the 1990 count itself.
Mr. Plant, responding to the Congressmen, said '' We have to make sure that the Secretary has sufficient information to make a decision.'' Census Director Defends Her Agency Over Its Urban Tallies Why are so many moving vans going in the same direction? By FELICITY BARRINGER WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 - The director of the 1990 census responded heatedly today to officials of New York City and other towns and cities around the country who have widely criticized the preliminary census figures that they contend severely undercounted their populations.
Making her first public statements since the Census Bureau began releasing the preliminary figures last month, the Director, Barbara Everitt Bryant, challenged assertions by New York officials that the census failed to count 600,000 people, and that the count should show a large population increase over 1980.
Speaking at a Congressional hearing, she said in response to New York complaints: ''Why did the school enrollment drop by 54,000? Why do the moving vans show more people going out than coming in?''
''If local governments think there are more people out there, let them take out a were-you-counted form and find the people for us,'' she said, referring to the bureau's continuing program to find people missed when census counters did their work in the spring.
 
Challenges Come Early
After appearing before the House Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee on census and population, Dr. Bryant disclosed that 1,073 local jurisdictions had already filed challenges to the preliminary census figures only two days into the three-week period that localities have to respond to the figures.
Census officials and members of Congress said it was difficult to assess how big a problem the challenges would represent, or when the wave of formal objections to a census count would crest. The 39,000 local jurisdictions that were given their preliminary census counts during the last weeks of August each have three weeks to respond and, if necessary, challenge the bureau's counts of housing units in their areas.

HEADLINE: GOVERNOR VICTOR IN MINNESOTA VOTE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Although Mr. Perpich opposes abortion, supporters of abortion rights did not mobilize the kind of national effort for Mr. Hatch that they have done in other states where opponents of abortion faced supporters of abortion rights.
The winner of the Republican nomination was Jon Grunseth, a businessman, who in the last days of the campaign bought thousands of dollars in television time to attack his opponent, State Auditor Arne Carlson, who had been favored to win the nomination. Mr. Grunseths, like Mr. Perpich, opposes abortion; Mr. Carlson supports legal access to abortion.
 
Questions About Integrity
Mr. Dyson survived a strong challenge in Maryland's First District from state Delegate Barbara Kreamer. He narrowly won re-election in 1988 after controversy over his financial support from military contractors ensnared in the Pentagon procurement scandal, and Ms. Kreamer attacked his integrity again in this campaign, She made an issue of the disclosure in the final days of the campaign that Mr. Dyson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of the military, had been a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. 
But she was hamstrung in getting her message across in the sprawling district that stretches across the television markets of Baltimore, Washington and Salisbury in southeast Maryland and the Eastern Shore.
Ms. Kreamer's staff said she bought television time in Salisbury, on the Eastern Shore, and, in the final days, in Baltimore. But she could not afford spots on Washington television stations, which cover about 25 percent of the district.
With 70 percent of the precincts reporting at 11 P.M., Mr. Dyson won his party's nomination with 56 percent of the votes to Ms. Kreamer's 30 percent. The remaining votes were split by two minor candidates.
Wayne Gilchrest, who barely lost to Mr. Dyson two years ago, won an eight-way Republican primary for another opportunity to challenge Mr. Dyson.
 
Replay in Rhode Island
In Rhode Island, Bruce Sundlun, a millionaire businessman, won the Democratic nomination for governor. Gov. Edward D. DiPrete, a Republican who raised taxes after promising not to, is viewed as very vulnerable in his race for a fourth two-year term.
Mr. Sundlun defeated the Mayor of Providence, Joseph R. Paolino Jr., and the Mayor of Warwick, Francis Flaherty, in the Democratic primary today.
In Vermont, former Gov. Richard A, Snelling won the Republican nomination to seek his old job. He will face the winner of the Democratic primary, Peter Welch, former president pro tem of the State Senate. Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, a Democrat, decided not to run again.
Representative Peter Smith won the Republican nomination to for re-election to Vermont's lone House seat for the second time. His main challenge will be from the independent candidacy of former Mayor Bernard Sanders of Burlington, a Socialist, who had no opposition in today's voting. Two Democrats sought their party's nomination but politicians said neither of them would be as strong a candidate as the well-known Mr. Sanders.
In another comeback effort, Evan Mecham, impeached as governor of Arizona in 1988, ran against four other Republicans, lead by Fife Symington, a Pheonix developer. The Republican nominee will face Terry Goodard, who resigned as Mayor of Phoenix to seek the governorship, once held by his father. He won the Democratic nomination over token opposition.
Three Republican Governors - Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Edward D. DiPrete of Rhode Island and Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin - had token primary opposition.
But the weakened political position of Mr. DiPrete, who promised not to raise taxes but did so when Rhode Island's economy deteriorated, drew three Democrats into a fierce battle for their party's nomination to challenge the Republican incumbent.
Mr. Gregg easily defeated the operator of a nudist camp, Robert Bonser.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
ABOUT EDUCATION

BYLINE: By Fred M. Hechinger

 BODY:
Donald Stewart, president of the College Board, which administers the tests, cited a recent survey that found that more than half of the country's high school students read no more than 10 pages a day. ''Reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among too many American students, and that would be a national tragedy,'' he said.
Much of the debate in the last year has been on education's goals and ways to keep tabs on the schools' progress in reaching those goals. The Governors, largely in agreement with President Bush, have proclaimed their educational wish list: by the year 2000, all children would start school ready to learn; 90 percent of high school students would graduate, competent in basic subjects; American students would lead the world in math and science, and schools would be drug-free and safe. 
This week, at the starting gate of the race toward those goals, schools seem weighed down with a lot of ballast. Reflecting the downturn in the economy, many districts find their budgets cut.
Even though teachers' salaries have improved slightly, to an average of $33,300 a year, teachers are unhappy. A new report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching finds that 96 percent of the teachers say they must spend their own money to pay for some necessary supplies.
Almost half of the 21,000 teachers questioned felt they lacked control over their professional lives. Ernest L. Boyer, the foundation's president, said, ''We've had much discussion about school-based management in recent years, yet our data reveal that when it comes to crucial decision-making, teachers often are left out.'' He expressed the ''uncomfortable feeling'' that the school reform movement ''has begun to stall.''
The endorsement of school-based management - letting each school be run the way its leaders think is best for the children - is a revolt against a dominating bureaucracy.
To succeed, the revolt needs well-educated and highly motivated teachers and principals. Yet the improvements in teacher training, licensing and certification have run into roadblocks.
Yesterday's promise too often becomes today's failure. For example, only a few years ago the policy of making failing students repeat a grade was thought to be beneficial. It turned out to be not necessarily so. In New York City, Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez reported that 40 percent of those who had once been held back would later drop out of high school. Perhaps one reason was that the extra year apparently gave them no help toward success.
Critics of the way the schools are run ask whether such matters should be subject to standardized policies. Or should the decision on whether a student is held back be made on an individual basis by teachers, principals and parents?
The answer to that question may also hold the answer to whether there is hope for the public schools.
There is hope if there are enough teachers like the one last week on a public-television program, ''Learning in America: Schools That Work'' (MacNeil/Lehrer Productions), who said: ''The kids are first. The teacher is there for them.'' Or principals like the one who said the central office should not be a power source but a help source: ''Problems have to be solved school by school.''
There is hope if reading, writing and numbers are taught to every child. Enough successful models exist to do this. Will they be replicated?
There is hope for drug- and violence-free schools - if the society cleans up its drug and violence problems.
There is even hope that by the year 2000 all American children will enter school ready to learn - but only if there is a quick shift to emphasizing prenatal care, child care and early-childhood education, available to all, but particularly to poor children. Without that, the experts and common sense tell us, the goal is out of sight, and there will be no hope for millions of children and, ultimately, for the schools and the country.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

 BODY:
A number of disparate factors came together to produce the modern Napa Valley. World War II forced Americans to come to terms with the rest of the world, on which they had turned their backs; travel in the postwar years made that world and its cultural riches more accessible, and an era of unparalleled prosperity gave many American discretionary income and the time to use it. Not a few of them discovered wine.
Simultaneously, other Americans were beginning to question the harsh competitiveness and materialistic excesses of the postwar years. A surprising number of them found the meaning they sought in nature, in the land. And a fortunate few found it in growing grapes and making wine.
And what better place to do those things than in the Napa Valley, a magnificent 25-mile-long stretch of farmland nestled against the eastern slope of the Mayacamas Mountains, and only an hour's drive north of San Francisco? 
Shaw once remarked that marriage was a successful institution because it had two ideal components: maximum temptation and maximum opportunity. Wine in the 1960's and 1970's was similar. It had a growing number of people eager to drink it and a growing number of people eager to make it for those eager to drink it.
As in the Gold Rush of the previous century, a colorful crowd descended on the valley. There were disillusioned business executives and starry-eyed academics, yearning to plunge their hands into the earth and give substance to their lives. There were foreign winemakers entranced by this new El Dorado. There were old-timers in the valley who decided grapes would make them richer than almonds, and there were hippies just wandering through. Finally, there was a host of the just plain rich, buying into what they saw as a chic new life style.
Mr. Conaway describes them all, some with indignation, some with fine irony, some with deadpan humor, a few with true pathos.
There are the lordly di Pins, of Beaulieu, like characters out of Offenbach; the enigmatic and ultimately tragic John Daniel of Inglenook, and the flamboyant Mondavis, right out of Verdi. And there are the hard-working, mostly anonymous Mexican laborers and a passel of sleazy corporate types from - where else? - the East.
Napa is Mr. Conaway's setting, but he can't resist slipping away to furnace-like Modesto for the melodramatic tale of the mighty Gallo brothers. He dashes off to Bordeaux to talk about Philippe de Rothschild, then jumps back in time to recall Carry Nation and her axe.
He dwells at length on a meeting of the Gastronomic Order of the Nonsensical and Dissipatory, a group of prominent Napa Valley winemen who meet occasionally to eat and drink to excess, dress foolishly, tell off-color jokes and - violating a club rule - talk business.
And there is a hilarious account of Robert Mondavi's trip from the Napa Valley to Woodbridge, in the Central Valley, for the blessing of the grapes. Woodbridge, near Lodi, is the site of the ''other'' Mondavi winery, a big plant that turns out the family's low-end wines.
Accompanying the famous wine maker in a limousine are his wife, Margrit, the priest who will pronounce the blessing and a woman identified only as Nina, whose sole function seems to be to fawn over Mr. Mondavi. ''You're a genius, Bob,'' she says, or something similar, whenever he pauses for breath.
Mr. Conaway is a reporter with a Saroyan-like sense of humor and, here and there, a Balzac-like eye for detail. If he had limited himself to these portraits and vignettes, he would have produced a delightful but ultimately slight book. But he has a larger agenda.
Only a few far-sighted people in the late 1950's and early 1960's understood the Napa Valley's potential as a world-class wine region. The tract developers were poised, ready to pounce, and the landowners, tired of scratching a living from prunes and cattle, were ready to accomodate them.
In a no-holds-barred battle that raged for years - and this is Mr. Conaway's real story - the people who wanted to save the land eventually won. The valley became an agricultural preserve with a minimum lot size of 20 acres. Subdividing was finished and the valley's future, at least for a time, was assured.
The valley had been saved, but for what? Two decades later it was well on its way to becoming something of a wine Disneyland. All summer long, the main road through Yountville and Oakville and Rutherford and St. Helena is jammed with tourist traffic. Wineries have become souvenir shops selling hats, T-shirts and corkscrews, and St. Helena, once an attractive little country town, has become a collection of banal tourist shops and trendy restaurants.
Worse, some of the biggest wineries have become giant wine factories, but not for Napa wines. They regularly truck in millions of gallons of cheap wine from other parts of the state to be bottled in the valley. The vines around their tasting-room doors are there to fool the tourists.
They did not fool the grape growers in the valley who depended on the wineries as customers for their grapes. ''What is a winery?'' the growers asked. ''A souvenir shop? A bottling plant?'' They demanded a moratorium on new wineries and a requirement that all wines bottled in Napa contain 75 percent Napa grapes. (They prevailed on the latter, but not the former.) Mr. Conaway throws himself into the fray reportorially (and sometimes at tedious length) but he sees the struggle as a metaphor for land-use battles everywhere. He comes down hardest on some greedy winery owners who cynically sided with the development faction to make sure their own development projects went forward.
The growers, he writes, ''considered the vintners a bunch of egomaniacs too selfish and too removed from reality to understand what they were doing to the valley by expanding and by importing grapes to be made into inferior wine.''
As for the vintners, they ''considered the growers little more than yahoos trying to create a monopoly and jack up the price of their product.''
Mr. Conaway reserves some of his deepest contempt for a particular group of vintners, who ''hungered after aristocracy, or the appearance of aristocracy.''
''Owning a winery,'' he writes, ''a California chateau, was often as close as they could get. Some vintners so yearned for nobility that they pursued barons, counts and princes, entering into deals with them and otherwise celebrating the association.
''It was good public relations, good marketing. But their one opportunity for truly noble behavior - to protect the land absolutely -they squandered in ego gratification and profits.''
 
TASTINGS
Gewurztraminer, Zind-Humbrecht, Herrenweg Turckheim, 1988; about $13.
 
First, let's get the terminology down. The wine is from Alsace, which is in France, in spite of all those Germanic jaw-breakers. Gewurztraminer is the grape, Zind-Humbrecht is the producer, and Herrenweg Turckheim is the vineyard. Zind-Humbrecht is in the little Alsatian town of Wintzenheim and Wintzenheim is just down the road from Turckheim. Why so much verbiage? To let you known that this wine is from a single vineyard. Most producers in Alsace buy grapes from many growers. Only a few own vineyards that are big enough to grow sufficient fruit to make single-vineyard wines. Leonard Humbrecht makes some of the finest wines in Alsace, and this one is especially rich. It tastes of nuts and fruit and spices, and while it can be drunk with food, it is really much better on its own, as an aperitif. Why does Mr. Humbrecht call his business Zind-Humbrecht? Because Zind is his wife's name and, so the story goes, her dowry included a very good vineyard.

HEADLINE: Kuwaiti Bank Serves An Economy in Exile

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
Today, most of the bank's top managers are in London, where the bank is trying to incorporate after managing to smuggle its records out of Kuwait. Some American and European banks have restored credit lines, and about half of the bank's $14 billion in assets is outside Kuwait. Of Kuwait's six largest banks, it is the only one up and running so far.
Oil and finance had been the twin engines of the Kuwaiti economy. So, not surprisingly, executives of the state-owned oil industry have also set up shop here, housed in the offices of Kuwait Petroleum International, which is in charge of Kuwait's extensive refining and marketing operations in Europe. 
Sheik Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah, the governor of Kuwait's central bank, is working out of the London headquarters of the state-owned Kuwait Investment Office, which oversees a large portion of Kuwait's estimated $100 billion in foreign investments. Sheik Salem has been holding meetings almost daily with executives of the banks.
Before the invasion, the National Bank of Kuwait seemed to have everything going for it. While Kuwait's five other big banks, which were badly hurt by financial scandals and the collapse of the country's stock market in 1982, still had to depend on Government support, the National Bank of Kuwait was self-sufficient. With a market capitalization of $3.5 billion, it accounted for about 40 percent of the value of companies listed on Kuwait's stock exchange.
Besides being Kuwait's biggest bank, it had the reputation for being the best run and seemed well positioned to take advantage of an expected resurgence of the economies of the Persian Gulf region.
But after the invasion, its future looked anything but certain. Not only were half of its assets in Kuwait, but so were vital records. To make matters worse, the bank - like other financial institutions with Kuwaiti ownership - had to contend with severed lines of credit and a freeze on assets imposed by many governments.
 
'First Weeks Were a Nightmare'
Mr. Dabdoub, a Palestinian who has been with the bank 31 years, recalled the despair that prevailed at a board meeting on the afternoon of Aug. 2, in a room heavy with anxiety about the future of the bank and relatives in Kuwait.
''One of our board members actually cried,'' Mr. Dabdoub said, adding that while his wife and two children are out of Kuwait, other relatives and friends are still there. ''The first weeks were a nightmare.''
It was his round-the-clock struggle to save the bank, Mr. Dabdoub insists, that enabled him to cope emotionally. ''Work is the best therapy,'' he said. ''I really forgot everybody. My priority is the survival of the bank. It is my baby.''
The bank was lucky: six of the eight people on its board were not in the country when the Iraqis invaded. Of its five senior executives, only one is trapped inside Kuwait.
 
Branches Overseas
Unlike the other big Kuwaiti banks, it had branches in Singapore, New York, London, Bahrain and Paris, and two wholly owned subsidiaries in London and Geneva. And the vast majority of countries around the world, including the United States, have either lifted the asset freeze or given the bank enough leeway to function.
Of its foreign assets of about $7 billion, half was in loans and half in money-market securities. About 40 percent of those assets are in Britain and 20 percent in the United States.
After the invasion, the bank's first priority was to increase liquidity, to make sure it could meet its financial obligations and satisfy customer demands for funds, executives said. In the first two weeks, the bank sold about $1 billion of high-quality corporate loans and $400 million in securities. The bank also reduced by $1 billion its money-market positions.
Also making life easier, a handful of American, German and British banks - including Morgan Guaranty, Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover - have restored lines of credit. But many, including Citicorp and Japanese institutions, are still refusing, and the total credit lines ''are nothing compared to before,'' said one National Bank of Kuwait executive, who declined to be more specific.
The Kuwait Investment Office is also helping. It has made $300 million available to the bank; about $100 million has been used.
Members of Kuwait's cabinet in exile have also been touring the capitals of world powers. They have been trying not only to make sure that international pressure on Iraq is maintained, but also to build confidence in the Kuwaiti businesses and financial institutions operating in exile.
The Kuwait Investment Office, which was secretive before the invasion, has not become any more forthcoming. But at news conferences in late August, Kuwait's Finance Minister, Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, hinted that Kuwait's state-owned companies, including the investment office, might increase their holdings of British stocks, whose prices he thought were low. The Kuwaiti Investment Office already has sizable stakes in British Petroleum and Midland Bank.
He also said that the state-owned companies, which hold big stakes in Daimler-Benz A.G., Hoechst A.G. and Metallgesellschaft A.G., planned to buy more German stocks. He said 36 to 38 percent of the Kuwait Investment Office's holdings were in Europe.
 
Pledges of Support
Besides helping Kuwaiti banks, the investment office has other demands on its resources: the Government in exile has pledged to provide $2.5 billion to support the multinational military forces in the Persian Gulf and $2.5 billion to help countries like Turkey and Egypt that are being hurt by the United Nations trade sanctions against Iraq.
In addition, the Government has promised to supply generous aid to exiled Kuwaitis. It plans to allocate about $55 million a month, according to The Financial Times. There may be as many as 250,000 of these exiles, with the vast majority in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.
The National Bank of Kuwait has also been trying to help exiles. For 10 days after the invasion, the bank offered to pay 500, or $930, to any Kuwaiti who had an account with it, no matter how small. And even though Kuwaiti dinars became worthless after the invasion, the bank still exchanges them at the rate that prevailed before the invasion: $3.46, or 1.80, to the dinar.
''The message we would like to give is, Kuwait is not really sand dunes and camels,'' Mr. Dabdoub said. ''It's a small, international country whose financial institutions are international and sophisticated enough to survive outside.''

Although a Palestinian - one of the 300,000 to 400,000 who had been living in Kuwait - he makes it clear that his loyalties do not lie with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the many Palestinians who support President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
''I don't agree with Arafat at all,'' Mr. Dabdoub said. ''He has been attacking Israel on the premise of the illegality of its occupation.''
But now, he added, Mr. Arafat ''is approving an illegal occupation'' in the case of Kuwait.
Mr. Dabdoub added: ''It doesn't make sense. I think he has bet on the wrong horse.''

See Who's Dying For Regulation

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
When airline safety rules were written in the 1940's and 50's, child seats were not an issue because practical restraints did not exist. Children too young to sit up in an ordinary airplane seat were safer in their parents' arms.
But since 1985, portable restraints have been widely available and all airlines now allow passengers to bring them on board. The only catch: children on laps ride free. To guarantee a seat to anchor a child restraint, parents must pay. According to airline estimates, four of five families would rather take a chance than come up with the extra cash. 
Child seats became a public issue after the United Airlines DC-10 crash in Sioux City, Iowa, in July 1989, in which a 23-month-old toddler was ripped from his mother's arms and suffered fatal injuries. Six months later, another baby died when an Avianca 707 ran out of fuel over Long Island. The National Transportation Safety Board, responsible for investigating both accidents, asked the F.A.A. to order mandatory restraints. Bills to the same end were served up in both the House and Senate. The airline industry, wishing to avoid the role of villain and perhaps scenting an opportunity to do well by doing good, decided to support the proposal.
With no organized opposition in sight it was widely assumed that the new rule would be quickly approved. But the regulators had other ideas. And, in the view of Richard MacKenzie and Dwight Lee, economists at the University of Mississippi and the University of Georgia, that is just as well.
Writing in a publication of the Cato Institute, a libertarian advocacy group in Washington, the two economists contend that the costs of restraints would far outweigh the likely benefits. Indeed, they argue, there might be no benefits at all.
A Department of Transportation study, they point out, concluded that restraints could have prevented just one infant death in the last 12 years. Another study by researchers at the Harvard Medical School estimated that the rule would save three lives every five years. On the other hand, they note, the F.A.A. has estimated that the airlines would sell an extra 3.3 million seats annually, at a cost to consumers of $205 million.
Much of that $205 million would represent a revenue windfall, as airlines charged for seats that would otherwise have flown empty. And in a competitive market, one would expect that a lot of this cash would be recycled in the form of lower fares for other passengers. But a portion represents a real cost, because airlines would undoubtedly add flights to meet some of the extra demand for reserved seats.
Worse yet, says the F.A.A., the parents of a fifth of the babies who now fly would be priced out of the air. And since car travel is at least 20 times as dangerous as commercial air travel, the net number of infants - and parents - dying en route would rise.
Airlines might be put under pressure to adopt a free-fare policy for babies, thereby assuring that the child restraint rule would, on balance, be a lifesaver even if parents were unwilling to pay for the extra security. But that still leaves the nagging question of social costs and benefits.
Suppose two of three infants would fill otherwise empty seats. The remaining one in three - 1.3 million children a year flying at a bottom-line cost of, say, $60 a flight - would add $78 million a year to the nation's air travel bill. If it is indeed worth $70 million-plus to avoid less than one death a year, why stop there? Why not, for example, make it a national policy to entice parents from their cars with Government subsidies for air travel?
One answer, of course, is that people contemplating the expenditure of $78 million to prevent an airline fatality might want to spend a few dollars saving babies from more cheaply avoided hazards. Come to think of it, they might even want to save a few adults.

HEADLINE: 2 Companies Agree to Use Product From Rain Forest

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The objective is to encourage the local population to preserve the rain forest and harvest a renewable crop instead of cutting down the trees for logs.
In addition to buying buttons from Ecuadorean harvesters, the companies will pay a licensing fee to Conservation International, a Washington-based organization,. The fee will be used to market buttons and other products made from the tagua.
Patagonia, based in Ventura, Calif., expects to buy $80,000 to $90,000 worth of buttons in the first year. Smith & Hawken, based in Mill Valley, Calif., plans to spend $50,000 to $60,000 on the tagua. The combined fee the companies will pay Conservation International is $50,000.
The development of a new industry based on a local product would help promote economic growth in the area, where the annual per capita income is less than $1,000 a year, according to an official of the Corporacion de Investigaciones para el Desarrollo Socio-Ambienta, an Ecuadorean conservation group that will coordinate the program.

HEADLINE: Nissan Adds New Model Of Infiniti Car

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 11

 BODY:

 
Emphasis on Handling
Along with the Toyota Motor Corporation's more successful line of Lexus luxury cars, the Infiniti lineup aims squarely at buyers of European luxury brands, including Jaguar, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Like the European makers, Infiniti and Lexus have stressed handling and performance, sumptuous interior appointments and ample leg room.
William R. Bruce, a Nissan vice president and general manager of the Infiniti division, said that about 30 percent of Infiniti customers traded in a BMW, Jaguar or Mercedes. Another 30 percent traded in a Lincoln, made by the Ford Motor Company, or a Cadillac, manufactured by the General Motors Corporation. 
Mr. Bruce said today that Infiniti aimed to sell 40,000 cars in the 1991 model year, which begins in a few weeks, more than double the 17,000 Infinitis sold in the United States since the line's introduction in November. The G-20 is expected to account for a third of the line's sales in the next model year; about half of the total sales would be of the top-of-the-line Q-45 model, with the M-30 coupe and a new M-30 convertible accounting for about 15 percent.
 
Could Hurt Maxima Sales
But if Infiniti reaches its goal of selling 14,000 of the G-20 sedans, it could cut into sales of the Nissan Maxima, which is about the same size as the G-20 and is similarly priced.
''Our exercise is not intended to cannibalize Maxima sales,'' Mr. Bruce said, but he acknowledged that ''there will be some cross-shopping'' by prospective buyers.
Infiniti plans advertising that emphasizes the luxury appointments and long list of standard equipment, as well as Infiniti's 24-hour road service and more extensive warranties than Nissan currently offers.
One new extra from Infiniti is a computerized suspension system -the first of its type on a production car - which independently adjusts the height of each wheel, giving an improved ride over bumpy roads and around corners. The ''active suspension'' system, which Infiniti is offering as an option on the Q-45, costs $4,000.
It also adds 120 pounds to the car's weight and reduces mileage by about 2 miles a gallon. But Nissan executives say they do not expect prospective buyers of the Q-45 to be put off by that, since they already pay a Federal ''gas guzzler'' tax of $500, which is included in the car's $39,000 price.

HEADLINE: Small Rise In Trade Gap

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11

 BODY:
The Commerce Department compares how much the nation spends on imports with what it earns from exporting goods and services, including banking, financial transactions, overseas earnings and tourism.
The first-quarter shortfall was the smallest in five years, and the combined deficit in the first half of 1990 was the smallest of any six-month period in more than six years, the department said. 
Last year, the current account deficit shrank to $110.03 billion, from $126.55 billion in 1988 and a peak of $153.96 billion in 1987.
Economists attributed much of the improvement in the deficit in the first half of this year to the slowing economy, which has dampened demand for foreign goods, rather than a dramatic improvement in the sale of United States goods.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Dire Forecast On Oil Supplies

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Because of the difference in quality, making up the resulting supply shortage will require far more than the 4.2 million barrels a day being lost from the two Middle East countries.
In all, the replacement oil, from such countries as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela, is likely to produce about 8.5 percent less gasoline and home heating oil per barrel, Mr. Leuffer said. That means that more than an additional 500,000 barrels a day are needed, he estimates.
That plays an important part in Mr. Leuffer's estimate that even with additional production from a variety of sources, the world will need to draw down inventories of crude oil and products by 1.4 million to 2.5 million barrels a day in the final three months of this year, assuming that the embargo against Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil remains in force. In the first quarter of next year, when winter weather is normally more severe, he estimated the needed inventory drawdown at 1.8 million to 2.9 million barrels a day. 
That is a direr forecast than the consensus, in part because Mr. Leuffer believes it will be difficult to get additional oil production from Alaska, where he thinks that no more than an extra 100,000 barrels a day will be produced, far below the 250,000-barrel figure mentioned in Congressional testimony by a Federal energy official.
He also puts less stock than many in conservation as a means of reducing demand for oil because governments from Washington to Tokyo have been putting pressure on oil companies to restrain gasoline price increases, thus delaying conservation responses that follow higher prices. He also estimates that an additional 500,000 barrels a day of oil products will be consumed by the military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Leuffer calculates that if his estimates are correct, world inventories by the end of next March would be cut to their lowest levels since 1979. Companies, he predicts, are likely to run out of oil supplies needed for operations, which would force countries to tap official reserves, like the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
Even with that, oil prices would probably rise, which is a major reason that Mr. Leuffer forecasts that $35 oil is likely, assuming no negotiated settlement. So far, the consensus of Wall Street on the current crisis - as shown by price movements - has been that it is unlikely to endure for long. While oil for October delivery closed yesterday at $30.76 a barrel, oil for delivery in January, the height of winter, was priced at only $28.05 a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading. The gasoline spread is even larger, with wholesale gasoline for October delivery trading at 93.6 cents a gallon, 14.5 cents more than gasoline for January delivery. Mr. Leuffer estimates that current share prices for oil companies reflect an anticipated $25 oil price. ''Portfolio managers simply do not believe this will last very long,'' he said.
If the Middle East crisis was to end with a negotiated settlement that lifted the embargo, oil and gasoline prices would likely fall, as would oil company share prices. But Mr. Leuffer thinks that the other options - war or stalemate - are much more likely and is recommending oil stocks. He has buy recommendations on Exxon, Texaco, Kerr-McGee, Occidental, Pennzoil, Unocal and USX. He also likes Crown Central, a refiner.
Refiners could end up being major beneficiaries of any shortage. ''What we see is a shortage of oil, but an even greater shortage of products,'' Mr. Leuffer said, adding that refineries were already operating near capacity before the crisis began. ''That will ultimately boost refining margins.'' One thing that could go wrong with bullish forecasts for oil company shares is Government action. A windfall profits tax could slash profits for oil producers, although it is hard to imagine President Bush, a former oilman himself, making such a proposal.
But Mr. Bush did not shy away from putting pressure on oil companies not to increase gasoline prices, and Mr. Leuffer says that retail gasoline prices are still about 9 cents a gallon less than the price of crude would suggest they should be.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Modest Gains; Many Traders Focus on Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:

 
Nervous Mood
Ian Foakes, foreign exchange manager at Paine Webber International Inc. in New York, said a nervous mood prevailed in the market.
European currency dealers, meanwhile, said the dollar got a lift from speculation that the cost of German unification would undermine the mark.
The West German Government said Monday that it would pay 12 billion marks, or about $8 billion, to the Soviet Union to help repatriate that country's soldiers from East Germany. But the overall cost of unification is expected to run into the hundreds of billions of marks. 
The Japanese yen was the focus of activity on many foreign exchange markets, where dealers sold yen to pocket profits made during the currency's recent advance.
 
Renewed Interest in the Yen
The yen, which suffered when tensions first flared in the Middle East, has since regained strength. The Bank of Japan's decision to raise a key interest rate on Aug. 30 coupled with a recovery on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has renewed buying interest in the yen.
The dollar moved higher against the yen in New York, ending the day at 140.31 yen, up from 139.52 yen late Monday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 139.85 yen, up 0.42 yen from Monday's finish. In London, the dollar was quoted at 139.20 yen late in the session.
British sterling benefited from the selling of yen but still lost ground against the dollar. The pound finished at $1.8565 in New York, compared with $1.8580 late Monday. In late London activity, a pound was quoted at $1.8490, compared with $1.8565 late Monday.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5865 marks, from 1.5820.
 
Gold Rises $1.90
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for September delivery rose $1.90 a troy ounce to settle at $380.50, after falling $10.90 on Monday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $380.25 an ounce, or 35 cents higher than Monday's 4 P.M. bid.
Gold traded in London at a late price of $381.25 a troy ounce, down from $384.75 on Monday. In Zurich, gold was bid at $381.50 an ounce, down from $387 late Monday.
Gold in Hong Kong dropped $4.90 an ounce, to $379.6.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Chrysler Eases Attack On Japanese

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
''Everything from Japan is perfect,'' he said. ''Everything from America is lousy.''
Japanese car makers were also mentioned in other ads in the series.
In the new campaign, the Japanese are never directly mentioned, although some of the ads make comparisons between Honda and Chrysler models. One spot begins by praising Honda: ''A good car the Honda Accord; no doubt about it,'' the announcer says as a beautiful shot of the car is shown. 
But the commercial quickly turns into the expected pitch for Chrysler as a Plymouth Acclaim pulls in front of the Honda. ''Compared to the Plymouth Acclaim, it has less interior room, a smaller engine, no air bag and costs $1,300 more,'' the announcer says. ''Now, we're not saying the Accord is second rate, merely second best.''
Some auto industry analysts were not surprised that Chrysler changed its anti-Japanese stance. After all, it has not significantly helped Chrysler's sales, which have been in a slump. ''The Japan-bashing obviously was not working well,'' said Tom Healy, an analyst with J. D. Power & Associates, an automobile marketing company. ''A 'Made in Japan' label is not necessarily a turnoff to many car buyers.''
Chrysler was also criticized for attacking Japanese car makers because it imports vehicles made by Mitsubishi in Japan and sells cars made in a joint venture with Mitsubishi in Illinois.
For its part, Chrysler, which spends about $700 million a year on advertising, said it had decided to modify its approach in part because research found that American consumers do not like to see other cultures criticized.
The company also decided to concentrate on ads that compared some Chrysler cars with Honda models, which it has done previously, because it found the tactic effective. Even though Chrysler's overall sales have been falling, Mr. Damoose said sales of Plymouth Acclaim have improved significantly since last spring, when ads comparing it with the Accord began to run.
The commercials are also more humorous than those in the past. ''It takes the edge off the criticism of Japanese cars,'' said David Bell, the president of Bozell, the agency that created both campaigns.
The agency also decided to give the ads a ''hip'' look to try to change some consumers' perception that Chrysler has not been moving with the times.
''We've found that a lot of people still associate Plymouth with an old-fashioned attitude,'' said Bert Gardner, an executive creative director at Bozell. ''We wanted to create a more contemporary image.''
To direct the commercials, Bozell hired Lol Creme, a former rock musician who now produces music videos. The sets on which the cars are photographed look like Broadway stage sets - they feature abstract representations of skyscrapers, mountain peaks and trees. The music sounds like a synthesized blend of Big Band tunes set to a rap music beat.
One spot features a group of dancers in clothes reminiscent of the 1960's, moving to a groovy beat as they cross the set to a 20-year-old Honda. The announcer tells viewers that Americans were once attracted to Honda because it was a well-made, less-expensive alternative to American cars.
The music and the clothes change to a 1990's version as the same group boogies back to a pack of new Chryslers and the announcer says that car buyers are now looking for well-made American alternatives to Honda.
Mr. Iacocca appears in only one commercial, for Chrysler's mini-van. Acting like a tour guide at a Chrysler factory, he explains how the mini-van has been redesigned.
In another spot about the design evolution of the mini-van, the agency used innovative computer-generated graphics that show the dashboard being reconfigured, the engine growing larger and the chassis changing shape.
It was an expensive and time-consuming commercial to create, but agency executives said it was necessary. ''The most convincing way to illustrate to consumers that the mini-van had drastically changed,'' Mr. Gardner said, ''was to show them the metamorphosis happening before their eyes.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Bonn and Tokyo Are Criticized For Not Bearing More of Gulf Cost

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
On the floor, in television and newspaper interviews and in speeches to their constituents, the legislators are using startlingly abrasive language. To a considerable degree, that reflects the views of newspaper editorialists and of the general public, as reflected in recent opinion surveys.
''The most negative question you hear is why our allies aren't doing more,'' said Senator Trent Lott, a conservative Republican from Mississippi.
Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr., Democrat of Kentucky, said that ''the Japanese have been acting totally the way they usually do: if there's no profit in it for Japan, forget it.'' 
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said the Japanese were motivated by ''greed and avarice,'' and Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said West Germany, which plans to spend $7.5 billion to subsidize Soviet resettlement of troops now based in East Germany, ''is giving the money to the wrong people.''
In a speech on Tuesday night, Speaker Thomas S. Foley sought to quiet the rebellion, arguing that ''Japan has done more to respond to requests for assistance, arguably, than any other nation, yet finds itself more singled out'' for attack than others.
The Bush Administration is also trying to limit the damage; Mr. Bush treaded lightly on the issue in his speech Tuesday night, and Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, observed today that ''generally, we think that the response has been good,'' while conceding that ''in some cases, we think countries can do more.''
 
Potential to Damage Relations
But the potential for damage to relations with two important political and economic allies is great, and Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, warned today that ''these people who are talking this way run the risk of eroding the political support for the President's policy by focusing attention on arguments over money.''
Burden-sharing dominated the debate in the House today on the military spending bill. The amendment, proposed by Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, would require Japan to pay the full cost of stationing United States armed forces in that country, including their salaries, which Mr. Bonior estimated at more than $4.5 billion a year.
If the amendment became law and Japan refused to pay the costs, the United States would be obliged to begin withdrawing 5,000 of the 50,000 troops now based in Japan every year.
 
A Powerful Signal
Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, who heads the House Armed Services Committee, opposes the measure, as does his counterpart in the Senate, Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia. That makes it highly improbable that the amendment will ever reach the law books, but the vote nonetheless sent a powerful political signal, which might ultimately oblige Bonn and Tokyo to reassess their positions.
Mr. Aspin said that ''if you're picking on one country, it should be Germany, which is doing even less than Japan.'' Mr. Nunn said the Japanese response to any such legislation would be to say to the American troops, which defend United States regional interests as well as Japan, ''Adios, amigo.''
But both said they shared the general feeling that the two countries, which have the world's largest trade surpluses, two of the world's most productive economies and considerably more dependence on Middle East oil than the United States, have done too little.
 
Sending Equipment
Both countries are sending equipment to the international force, but Bonn has pledged no money yet and Japan has pledged only $1 billion.
The two nations have constitutional prohibitions against the use of their troops except in self-defense. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has said he will seek to remove that prohibition from the constitution of the new, unified Germany, which is to come into being in three weeks.
Hideaki Ueda, the counselor for public affairs at the Japanese Embassy here, confirmed tonight that Japan would announce this weekend a grant of $2 billion to Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, the three countries other than Iraq that have been hardest hit by the United Nations trade sanctions. He said, ''This is not a small amount.''
''We find this criticism disturbing,'' Mr. Ueda said. ''We need to show unity. We are not fighting against each other, and we hope that reasonable men in the Senate and the House of Representatives will come to see that.''
A senior German official, who insisted on anonymity, said: ''We are astonished. We said we would bear our fair share, and we are ready to.''
Mr. Kohl is expected to present to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who is scheduled to arrive in Bonn on Friday or Saturday, a plan for West German underwriting of American air-and sea-lift expenses in the Persian Gulf. But the official cautioned against any expectation that the Germans would make large cash grants.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
RESIST U.S. IN GULF, TOP IRANIAN CLERIC URGES ALL MUSLIMS

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 12

 BODY:
''We will never permit the United States to make a foothold or turn the region into its zone of influence wherever we are present and have influence and anywhere our words, as the voice of Islam, are heard by Muslims,'' Ayatollah Khamenei told a group that included leaders of Iranian veterans organizations.
The statement was quoted by the Iranian press agency and broadcast over Iranian radio and television.
Ayatollah Khamenei's comments were the clearest indication of Teheran's tilt toward Iraq in its confrontation with Saudi Arabia and its Western and Arab allies.
 
Linking the Pipelines
But some Iranian and Mideast experts said it was clearly in Iran's interests to see the gulf situation continue as it stands today, because it would weaken Iraq, increase Iran's oil revenue, keep the United States tied up with a regional conflict and conceivably prompt internal disturbances in Saudi Arabia, toward which Iran feels a deep antipathy. 
The Iraqi oil will be transported by idled trucks that once carried oil from Iraq to the Jordanian port of Aqaba for export before the embargo imposed by the United Nations on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
Eventually, the oil industry officials said, larger quantities of Iraqi oil could be pumped directly to Iran if Iraqi and Iranian pipelines that run close to each other on both sides of the long Iranian-Iraqi border were to be linked.
In taking a position similar to that of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who also called for a holy war to fight American troops in Saudi Arabia and for the liberation of the holy places of Islam, Ayatollah Khamenei is only supporting the position of those in the Government of Iran, like President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose main concern is to draw the maximum benefit from the situation.
Ayatollah Khamenei bitterly criticized Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing Arab countries that invited American troops in after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
''Foreigners' defense of regional governments brings shame and disgrace to these governments,'' the press agency quoted him as saying. ''If these governments had relied on their nations they would have defended their national prestige, honor and dignity through resistance and devotion. Those governments defending themselves with the help of foreigners have humiliated their nations. The stain of such humiliation will not be effaced for years.''
The criticism, clearly aimed mainly at Saudi Arabia, indicates that Saudi-Iranian relations, already badly strained over the last three years, may be getting even worse.
More important, some experts on Middle East affairs argued, the development signals that an increasing number of Iranian leaders appear to believe that the American military presence in the gulf is a greater danger to Iran's vital interests than Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.
Ayatollah Khamenei's comments came after announcements about the reconciliation between the two nations, which fought a bitter war from 1980 until a cease-fire was brokered by the United Nations in 1988. With the resumption of diplomatic ties announced two days ago, the nations have exchanged prisoners of war and Iraq has withdrawn troops from Iranian territories occupied in the war, after Baghdad agreed to all terms Teheran had demanded for a peace treaty formally ending the war.
Ayatollah Khamenei raised the specter of a holy war in his speech when he said, ''Anyone who fights America's aggression, its greediness and its plans to encroach on the Persian Gulf region, has engaged in a holy war in the cause of Allah, and anyone who is killed on that path is a martyr.''
Gary Sick, an American expert on Iranian affairs, said Ayatollah Khamenei's remarks were probably motivated by Iran's desire to keep oil prices high, preserve its revolutionary credentials and keep President Hussein in a confrontation with the United States as long as possbile.
''As far as they are concerned it couldn't happen to nicer guys,'' Mr. Sick said in a telephone interview. ''They have absolutely no interest in getting militarily involved but would love for this to go on for quite some time.''
Indeed, The Teheran Times, which reflects the views of the administration of President Rafsanjani, said in an editorial today that Iraq was considering supplying food and medicine to Iraq.
''Iranian officials are convinced that the Muslim Iraqi people should not pay for the mistakes of their Government,'' the newspaper said. ''Iraqi children and women have had no role in the occupation of Kuwait by Baghdad troops.''
 
No U.S. Comment
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (Special to The New York Times) - The White House withheld comment today on Ayatollah Khamenei's statement, but senior Administration officials said they were closely watching to see if Iran moved to break the embargo against Iraq.
While officials said they expected continued Iranian adherence to the sanctions, and questioned whether Ayatollah Khamenei's statement reflected a firm decision by Iran to challenge the embargo, they acknowledged that Iran could produce a crucial break in the opposition to Iraq.
The officials said they believed Iran would not violate the embargo because it is seeking economic help from European countries, which all suppport the sanctions.
United States intelligence agencies are trying to monitor the 700-mile border between Iran and Iraq. The agencies have reported some truck movements into Iraq, but not a large flow. Washington's ability to track political developments in Iran is limited.
Officials said they had seen the reports of an Iraqi offer to give Iran oil in exchange for food and other help, but could not confirm that Iran had accepted the proposal.
The deputy State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said: ''We'll have to look at more than what we've seen so far to know if there is such a deal. But we consider that Iran is firmly obligated under the U.N. sanctions to implement them, and, as I said, absent evidence that something is going on to the contrary, we would expect them to do so.''
 
15 Convicts Sent to Iran
 
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Sept. 12 (Special to The New York Times) - Fifteen escaped convicts whose fates are tied to those of Western hostages in Lebanon have been turned over to Iran by Iraqi occupation forces in Kuwait in another sign of improved relations between Baghdad and Teheran, Shiite Muslims here said today.
The 15, who were convicted of roles in bombings in Kuwait nearly seven years ago, broke out of their prison with other inmates on Aug. 2, the day Iraqi troops invaded, said Lebanese who fled Kuwait after the invasion.
A total of 17 men were convicted by Kuwait for their part in bomb attacks in December 1983 against the American and French Embassies and Kuwaiti public buildings and oil installations. Six Kuwaitis were killed and 80 wounded in the explosions. Two of the prisoners were released last year after serving their terms.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
A Historic Moment Slips By, Overtaken by Other Events

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 12

 BODY:
And yet the ''Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany,'' to give it its full title, arguably had a significance akin to agreements familiar from every high school history text -the Versailles Treaty of 1871, from which a united Germany first emerged; and the Potsdam conference of 1945, from which the Germans emerged severed in two.
Now, after 45 years, the victorious allies were finally resolving the ''German Question'' and putting an end to the last formal remnants of occupation.
 
The Price of Full Sovereignty
They were restoring full sovereignty to a nation that had savaged Europe a half century earlier. In exchange, the Germans were renouncing all claims to ancestral lands east of the Oder and Neisse Rivers lost to Poland and the Soviet Union, restricting their military and pledging that hereafter only peace would emanate from German soil. 
More broadly, the European powers were laying the groundwork for a new European order, with a potent, wealthy Germany at its heart. Perhaps more clearly than any previous event, the treaty demonstrated the retreat of Communism from Europe. Not only the West German mark had gone East - the full Western package of liberal democracy, free-market economy and the North Atlantic alliance were being voluntarily accepted by the bankrupt rump of the ''first state of workers and peasants on German soil.''
Yet it was probably the first modern peace treaty that took pains to leave no winners or losers. The Germans, in fact, were insistent that it not be called a ''peace treaty'' at all, to underscore that it had been achieved in peace. In 1871, by contrast, a united Germany was proclaimed by Bismarck after a war against France, and in 1945 the victors had met in the midst of the smoldering ruins of the Third Reich.
 
'Without War, Pain or Strife'
But this, Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared, was ''the first unification of a country in modern history achieved without war, pain or strife.''
The statement invited a quick knock on wood, but it did reflect what the six signers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and the two Germanys - all agreed had been a harmonious and creative negotiation.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the process had created a ''new lexicon of openness, cooperation and partnership,'' and he went out of his way to praise Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union.
The very harmony of the process was one reason why the signing of the final settlement could not attract as much attention as economic turmoil or military tension. Despite some 11th-hour haggling on technicalities and the price the Germans would pay the Soviets, the ''two plus four'' negotiations never really developed suspense.
The talks, moreover, were not really the locomotive or even the key to German unity. It was really the momentum to reunification touched off by the breach of the Berlin wall and the collapse of Communism in East Europe that had finally compelled the old Allies to resolve the nettlesome ''German Question.''
 
Forcing the Pace
In the end, the forces that brought Nazi Germany to its knees and partitioned it 45 years earlier often seemed to be pushed toward a settlement at a pace that they neither set, nor really liked.
The Soviet Union, which had, through its own internal reforms, directly empowered the East Germans to shed Communism, found itself especially uneasy at the prospect of losing its premier foothold in the West, and much of the real bargaining was over how to disentangle the Soviets from their enormous commitment to East Germany.
The solution was both bizarre and Solomonic. The Soviet Union was given four years to withdraw its army from Germany, and in the interim the Germans would help pay for the force and finance new housing for the troops when they return home. NATO forces would stay out of East German territory, though they would maintain garrisons in Berlin.
Mr. Gorbachev tried to put a positive twist on the situation, saying that the Soviet troops were now ''representatives of a friendly country.'' Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany was more blunt: the $7.5 billion deal, he said, was ''the price of unity.''
 
Credit for Gorbachev
It was not a cynical comment from Mr. Genscher. He had been among the first to recognize the promise for Germany held out by the soviet policy of ''perestroika,'' or openness, and the large majority of his countrymen shared his view that Mr. Gorbachev was the true midwife of German unity, and deserved a reward.
Military-political technicalities dominated the immediate discussion of the treaty. But if this served to obscure the historic dimensions of the accord, it also underscored its major virtue -that for once in their history, the Europeans were shaping a new order without bloodshed or trauma.
The negotiators seemed to tacitly agree from the outset that to humiliate the Russians or to frustrate the Germans would only undermine European security, and the main challenge of the negotiations became to find ways of avoiding either pitfall.
The initial breakthrough was the decision at NATO's summit meeting in July to forswear any aggressive intentions and to extend a hand of cooperation to the Soviets. That cleared the way for the next major step, the Soviet-West German summit talks at which Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Kohl agreed on a face-saving way for the Soviets to extricate themselves from East Germany while maintaining influence in European affairs.
The ''new European security order'' that both East and West have now declared as their goal, in which the two alliances would be replaced by a single conflict-resolving mechanism based on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, is still a long way off. It will be four years before the last Soviet troops leave East Germany, and both Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union still face great upheavals.
But by making history as quietly as they did, by signing a treaty without undue debate and controversy, the authors of the Moscow treaty may have shown that shaping a new order does not necessarily require a major upheaval.

HEADLINE: Politics of Police Strength;
New York City's Demands for More Officers Raise Questions About How to Use Them

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:

 
'Form of Political Stampede'
Police officers are among the costliest municipal employees, and New York already has a lot of them -26,000, a uniformed force twice as large as the nation's next largest - Chicago. What it does with them is only part of what is at stake in the growing clamor.
''My concern is that this whole thing is a form of political stampede because of some truly terrible crimes that have been committed,'' said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association, a research and watchdog group that studies the justice system. ''More police, if they're part of a community policing strategy, can be an effective tool, but only if they're part of a larger plan to address the social and economic problems that drive crime.'' 
But Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, another watchdog group, said of the 5,000 figure, ''An augmentation of that level is necessary, first to deal with the workload, and two, to install community policing and make it work to make a dramatic difference in the levels of crime and public order in this city.''
 
Many More Civilian Employees
The number 5,000 - cited by everyone from Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown to the Crime Commission to the City Council - is simply the difference between the current number of officers and the all-time high of about 31,000 in 1970. Restoring that total has been a formal goal of the city since at least 1984, when Mayor Edward I. Koch announced he would do so by 1988.
But the comparison is misleading because of the substantial increase in the number of civilian workers on the force, who do many tasks once performed by officers who were among the highest-paid clerk-typists in the world. In 1970, the department had 2,159 civilians; now it has 7,412, so adding 5,000 officers would put the department's actual uniformed strength well ahead of its all-time high.
City budget officials say that thanks to the civilians, when the force stood at 28,000 officers two years ago - before fiscal constraints led Mr. Koch to let it shrink - it had about as many uniformed officers available for duty as it did before the layoffs of the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's. If the separate transit and housing police forces were considered, it had even more.
 
Examining Every Unit
Crime has increased markedly since 1970, when there were 578,149 reported crimes and 1,117 murders, and last year, when there were 712,419 crimes and 1,905 murders. Serious assaults have more than doubled.
And even as the force grew, so did dozens of units and headquarters functions, which Mr. Dinkins said this week took thousands of officers from street duty. Mr. Brown has said that the department is too specialized, and he repeated in an interview yesterday that he was weighing every unit and ''its effectiveness, its goals and its mission'' for a report to Mr. Dinkins on personnel needs. The report is due Oct. 1.
However many officers are hired, Mr. Brown wants the extra power to fuel ''community policing,'' the most common image of which is officers who work on old-fashioned foot patrols in neighborhoods. It actually involves a mix of tactics - old and new - in which officers are urged to take time to emphasize solving community crime problems, rather than just cruising in patrol cars and reacting over and over again to the same kinds of crimes.
If that sounds a bit hard to define, it is. But Mr. Brown maintains it includes the aggressive hyphenated tactics of stop-and-frisk and buy-and-bust and is ''as tough as traditional policing, and tougher, because you do it smarter.'' Even hardened veterans like Mr. Reppetto of the Crime Commission, who spent years as a police commander in Chicago, say it is the wave of the future, and because it takes more time, it takes more people.
 
Other Government Approaches
''If your radio cars are now running 90 percent of the 911 calls, they can't do problem solving,'' Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Gangi complains that no one is talking about other government approaches to solving problems, like improving schools, housing and job opportunities, to keep communities stable enough to be susceptible to the effects of community policing.
''The kids who ripped off those people from Utah and killed the guy were out to rob somebody that night,'' he said. ''If there had been cops standing next to those folks, they would have robbed somebody else. You can't ever have enough cops on the street to prevent that kind of crime.''
But Mr. Reppetto said, ''What education is going to go on if all the kids are worried about is getting to school without getting shot?''
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said Mr. Brown's report would ''not simply be an analysis of the numbers, or how best to deploy them, but also a managerial agenda for the entire system.'' More officers will mean more arrests, which will require more prosecutors, Legal Aid lawyers, judges, courtrooms and jails - all of which take money.
 
Question of Money
But Mr. Steisel added: ''We feel it's not enough just to put money into the traditional criminal justice agencies. There are other places where we think other commitments need to be made. For example, we have to look very hard at supplementing programs for youth.''
No one yet knows how the city will pay for all this, but Mr. Dinkins now says he expects to, whether it takes $300 million, $400 million or $500 million a year, at a time when the city is facing a projected budget gap for the coming year of at least $1 billion and has not yet resolved how to bear the full cost of 1,058 new officers whom he promised last month to hire.
The Mayor warns that inevitably hiring more officers will lead to some combination of higher taxes and reduced services.
''If you're going to say that to a public, you've got to be able to explain why you need, what you need, where you're going to put it,'' he said on Tuesday. ''And so those who say 'Yeah, but you have got to say you need 5,000 cops now,' well, it seems to me that what I've been saying is eminently superior.''

HEADLINE: Cuban Defector Tells of Soviet Cuts

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 12

 BODY:
''The honeymoon has ended and now Cuba has no opportunity for re-exporting oil,'' Mr. Gonzalez said at a conference sponsored by the University of Miami's Research Institute of Cuban Studies. ''Even if they wanted to, the Soviets have no capability to maintain the kind of financial aid they have maintained during the last 30 years.''
 
Drastic Cuts Ahead
While Cuban officials have spoken in general terms about major changes in relations between the Soviet Union and Cuba, Mr. Gonzalez is the first Cuban involved in the negotiations with Moscow to reveal substantial details. 
In tense discussions in Moscow and Havana early this year, Mr. Gonzalez said, the Soviet Union informed Cuba of its intention to reduce its support drastically in almost every area of economic aid, from barter trade to subsidized prices for Cuban products and low-interest debt financing.
While Cuban officials reacted with surprise when the Soviet newspaper Izvestia published previously secret information on Cuba's debt to Moscow this year, Mr. Gonzalez said that he learned in a meeting with Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the vice president of the Cuban Council of Ministers, that the Soviet debt figure of 15 billion rubles was, by Cuban calculations, at least 2 billion rubles too low.
The difference took on special importance, Mr. Gonzalez said, because of a warning by a Soviet Deputy Prime Minister, Leonid Abalkin, during a visit to Havana in April that Cuba's debt to the Soviet Union would be payable in dollars beginning in 1995, at an exchange rate to be determined this year.
 
'Special Period' Lies Ahead
Cuba has reacted to these and other changes in its ties with the Soviets by preparing people for what the Havana Government has called a ''special period in a time of peace,'' an era of draconian austerity that began recently when the Government announced steep reductions in supplies of electricity and gasoline.
After an initial period of hostility toward President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's restructuring program in the Soviet Union, Mr. Castro has reverted to a largely conciliatory tone.
But Mr. Gonzalez said that official Cuban disenchantment with the dwindling Soviet commitment manifests itself in complaints that many large Soviet industrial development projects are white elephants that have proven burdensome to the Cuban economy.
 
Nuclear Plant Cited
He cited an inoperative nuclear power plant that is $800 million over cost and is now encased in walls six yards thick because of concerns over safety after the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in the Soviet Union.
Another example, he said, was a new Soviet-built nickel plant that is at least twice as inefficient as plants dating from the 1950's.
Citing an energy shortage, the Cuban Government recently decided to close the nickel plant, Mr. Gonzalez said. But at least part of the motive for closing it, he added, was to send Moscow a message that ''if you reduce our oil supplies, we can reduce supplies to you too.''

HEADLINE: FINAL DRIVE NEAR ON BUDGET ACCORD

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
''It's like buying a used car,'' said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip. ''The buyer sort of thinks he likes the price of the car that he thinks he may be getting, and the seller sort of thinks he likes the price of the car he may be selling. But nobody has yet said, 'Here is the real car, and here is the real price.' '' 
 
'Everything Is Very Fluid'
Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, cautioned that agreements that seemed solid could come unstuck.
''Everything is very fluid,'' he declared. ''Everything that seems to be dead could be revived very suddenly. Everything that is out of the packages could be in, and everything that is in both packages could be out.''
Thus, lawmakers said, general decisions made earlier this week to raise taxes on alcoholic beverages and luxury items and to reduce Medicare costs to the Government should not be considered final.
The two sides have basically agreed on the size of the deficit reduction they want to make, $50 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 and $500 billion cumulatively over the next five years. Moreover, they are not far apart on how they want to apportion the cuts in the military and domestic programs and for increases in taxes and fees.
 
Working on Tough Issues
But basic disagreements remain on which specific programs to cut and which particular taxes to raise.
''We're on the tough issues,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the Budget Committee. ''Nothing is agreed to unless everything is agreed to.''
Clearly wanting to avoid a battle of words with President Bush, Democrats refrained today from publicly criticizing him for calling in his televised address Tuesday night for a budget settlement without suggesting that politically it might be necessary to raise taxes or cut popular programs.
But lawmakers from both parties observed that they were unlikely to make friends with their budget decisions.
''We're going to lose votes on both sides,'' said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.
Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office, the Government's chief auditor, issued a report today urging budget cuts of more than $1 trillion over the next six years. That is much more ambitious than what the negotiators are contemplating.
The deficit, the agency said, is ''out of control'' and threatens the nation's economic well-being for years to come.
No New Yorker is involved in the talks at Andrews. But all 34 of the state's Congressmen signed a letter today saying they would oppose limiting the amount of state and local tax payments that taxpayers could deduct on the Federal returns.
The White House has been advocating such a limit on deductions, but Democrats have resisted it.

HEADLINE: A Good Gulf Pep Rally

 BODY:
The President has thus earned the confidence to say that Iraqi aggression will be defeated. ''And that's not a threat, not a boast,'' he said. ''It's just the way it's going to be.'' 
Mr. Bush also has chosen the right strategy. He is tightening the world's embargo against Iraq, asking for patience and pressing ahead with his military buildup in the region. The clear-eyed purpose is to convince Mr. Hussein that he can neither outlast nor outduel the nations arrayed against him.
But in any situation this complicated, risky and volatile, there are bound to be unforeseen land mines and false steps. And several recent actions by the Bush Administration need to be explained more convincingly by the White House.
Relations with Syria. Secretary of State Baker is off to Damascus to strengthen ties with a nation that has sent troops to Saudi Arabia, and possibly to explore Syrian flexibility toward Israel. That's all well and good, but President Assad of Syria is a major supporter of anti-American terrorism. The Administration has to take the greatest care not to be fooled by him or to elevate his power, the very mistake the White House made in dealing with Saddam Hussein.
An international peace conference. Moscow has been pushing for such a meeting soon as a way of starting Israeli-Palestinian talks and encouraging moderate Arabs standing up to Iraq.
Mr. Bush seemed to back the proposal at the Helsinki summit meeting last week. But in Moscow on Tuesday, Mr. Baker gave the right response: no such conclave at any time soon, when it could be linked with the gulf crisis. At best such a gathering now would be diversionary; at worst it would reward Palestinians for their support of Iraq.
A regional security system. Administration officials continue to speculate about a peacekeeping force - U.S.-Arab, or multinational, or U.N.-sponsored - that would be created after the present crisis ends. That's a worthy idea, but the composition and purposes of such a force require much more thought.
America does not want to commit itself to the indefinite preservation of the Persian Gulf's autocratic regimes. For the long run, the U.S. should be trying to make itself less dependent on energy from this turbulent region.
All of these considerations aside, Mr. Bush did well in his address before the nation. He bought time for the noose to close around Iraq, and time to nurture support for further action if need be.

HEADLINE: Japan's One-Way Lobbying

 BODY:
These activities are entirely legal, Mr. Choate acknowledges, but also ''deeply corrosive of the U.S. political and economic system.'' One-third of the principal officials in the White House Trade Office since 1973 have left to become foreign agents, mostly for Japan. Japanese-led PAC's contribute heavily to political campaigns. Most university programs in Japanese studies rely on Japanese money, sapping academic independence, Mr. Choate says.
The money that slushes through the American political system is certainly occasion for unease. But in buying influence, Japanese companies are behaving just like Americans and other foreigners. On what basis, other than scale, is there reason to single out Japan?
The most serious reason is reciprocity. The Japanese political system is far less open than that of the United States, with intimate ties between Government ministries, industry and politicians. Foreigners are largely excluded from this tight triangle. This asymmetry could put American businesses at a considerable disadvantage.
The remedy is not to put specific restrictions on Japan's lobbying in the United States, although tighter rules for all lobbyists, domestic and foreign, may well be justified. The better course is to persuade Tokyo to make its political system more open. As with the United States, Japan's weight in economic matters gives foreigners many legitimate interests in its domestic affairs.
Japan's huge lobbying effort is fair subject for discussion, even if it buys less influence than Mr. Choate supposes. But the troubling asymmetry is better corrected with more openness in Tokyo than with more restrictions in Washington.

HEADLINE: Preventing Genocide in Liberia

 BODY:
Until the 1980's, Liberia's main divide was between indigenous people and the Americo-Liberians, descended from freed U.S. slaves. Mr. Doe's bloody coup ended the old elite's dominance. Power and patronage flowed instead to the Krahn. That favoritism, along with the regime's brutality and incompetence, sparked opposition from other ethnic groups, like the Gio and the Mano. One rebel leader, Prince Johnson, is from the Gio. His rival, Charles Taylor, is an Americo-Liberian.
The U.S. cannot be proud of its own early association with the Doe dictatorship. The Reagan Administration convinced itself that Mr. Doe could provide a strategic bulwark against Communist advance. It ignored abundant evidence of official misdeeds and popular discontent and made Liberia the largest per capita recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa. Congress finally cut back American support after 1985. When Mr. Doe's enemies began closing in on him earlier this year, the Bush Administration rightly resisted his pleas for help.
Instead, a peacekeeping force was raised from the 16-member Economic Community of West African States. With 5,000 Liberian civilians dead and 400,000 refugees streaming over the borders, neighboring states feared chaos. Yet the force's arrival last month touched off reprisals against foreigners and fears of a wider war.
Those concerns remain valid. President Doe's murder has not ended Liberia's ordeal. The prospect of ethnic genocide compels preventive action. From Sri Lanka to the Balkans, political opportunists have exploited ethnic rivalries in the quest for short-term advantage. Too often, their efforts have drowned their countries in blood. For taking risks to prevent the worst, West Africa's peacekeepers deserve the world's appreciation, and support.

HEADLINE: Clean Air Bills Are Likely to Cost More Than Anyone Expected

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The clean air bill being considered by Congress will pack a far greater economic wallop than anyone expected. Residents of New York State alone could pay as much as $5 billion a year for additional air-pollution controls, according to a study by Denny Technical Services. Nationwide costs of clean air proposals range between $51 billion and $91 billion a year, depending on decisions Congress will make this fall.
The Senate and House of Representatives are trying to reconcile their clean air bills in conference. If the most extreme proposals are enacted, citizens of New York would be required to pay $57 million more for controlling air toxics emissions, $160 million more for controlling acid rain and $4.8 billion more for controlling ozone - every year.
Our nation cannot ignore the enormous costs of clean air legislation, and these expenses will inevitably worsen America's economic problems. There are effective and affordable ways to clean our air. High-cost options will not necessarily mean improved environmental protection.
The business community, which my Clean Air Working Group represents, wants Congress to pass a clean air bill this year, and we believe Americans deserve a significant return on investment in improved environment. We need a law that allows us to meet our environmental goals without unduly burdening a sagging economy.

HEADLINE: Clean Air Bills Are Likely to Cost More Than Anyone Expected;
The Price of Breathing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While Peter Passell's Economic Scene column on clean air (''What Price Cleaner Air,'' Aug. 15) contains valid points, one could wish he had applied himself to the question, What price polluted air? In reviewing an unpublished analysis by the economist Paul R. Portney, Mr. Passell seems to acknowledge that translating health into dollars is guesswork. Recent polls suggest, however, that most Americans place a higher value on clean air than most economists do. 
Both houses of Congress are considering amendments to the Clean Air Act that would exempt automakers from the stringent pollution controls needed to reach the Environmental Protection Agency's air-quality objectives. Critics say that not enough Americans are suffering to justify the expense. Yet E.P.A. studies indicate that approximately 40 percent of air pollution is attributable to motor vehicles. The new controls would substantially reduce auto emissions for only $130 a vehicle. Where industry sees billions of dollars in ''unjustified'' expenses, advocates, such as the American Lung Association, see a relatively small sacrifice that most Americans would accept for cleaner air.
We aren't willing to accept a new status quo in which poor air quality continues to prevent children and adults with lung diseases from enjoying the outdoors fully. We don't think economics alone should dictate solutions that ignore the needs of millions of Americans.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Free The Baltics II

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A little over a year ago, an incendiary headline appeared in this space: ''Free the Baltics.'' A dispatch from a Baltic capital appeared here later with a provocative dateline: ''RIGA, Soviet-occupied Latvia.''
This went beyond the usual Op-Ed thumbsucking to the borders of naked political agitation. In neglected causes - Kurdistan for the Kurds, independence for the Balts, freedom from the polygraph - pundits are allowed to engage in such open agitprop. 
Campaigning for an end to the Soviet occupation of the three nations illegally handed to Stalin by Mr. Hitler, I confess to an ulterior motive. A return to independence by these captive nations would not only redress a great moral wrong done to Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians. I hoped it would also be the beginning of the end of the Russian empire that went by the name of ''Soviet Union.''
The reasoning: The world would benefit from the breakup of the superpower that has supported much of the mischief in the world. The disparate peoples now in the grip of Moscow's dead hand would do better, and be less of a threat to peace, if permitted to go their own nationalist, non-Communist way.
Today, Soviet disunion is coming right along. The Balts have been leading the way, issuing proclamations of sovereignty, protesting the presence of Russian troops, publicizing the crackdowns and cutoffs intended to intimidate them.
The Bush Administration, in the beginning, treated the Baltic aspirations only ''correctly,'' protecting Mikhail Gorbachev; recently it has begun to go with freedom's flow. This includes a belated recognition of the popular support behind Boris Yeltsin, who embodies the dissatisfaction with Mr. Gorbachev's timidity in overturning the Communist apparat and economic system.
But Mr. Bush, along with most of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, is of two minds about the breakup of the internal empire.
In one mind, he likes the end to a superpower-polarized world, because now nations can act collectively to repel aggression. In his other mind, Mr. Bush hates to lose his coordinated interlocutor - the Soviet Union, now nicely weakened but still answering as an entity - in exchange for a loosely confederated group of nations, headed by a bunch of strangers, that might fall to squabbling.
We should resolve the ambiguity on the side of disunion. We should be rooting for the orderly devolution of power - independence for the Baltics, autonomy for the dozen Soviet republics, with central control limited to nuclear and space defenses.
We should be rooting against the seat-of-the-pants improvisation of Mr. Gorbachev, because drift invites anarchy; bread lines and panic could bring on a military-K.G.B. coup. Better an amicable separation, with agreed-upon custody of the nukes, than an explosive divorce.
''To be, or not to be, a united government,'' said Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov this week, arguing against a free market, ''that is the question.'' This is no time for Hamlet, lest he usher in a Caesar; this is the time for the Shatalin 500-day crash diet to organized disunion.
I am indebted to Elizabeth Teague, the brilliant Kremlinologist at Radio Free Europe in Munich, for fingering Stanislav Shatalin as the fulcrum of controversy last week. He is the Yeltsin economist advocating a free-market economy, private property and devolution of sovereignty - including the power to tax - to the republics.
With all its attendant ills - ethnic hatred, class resentment, the opportunity for personal failure - this cold-turkey Shatalin approach is a way out of Communism's addiction to false security.
It embraces a truth that Mr. Gorbachev has for five years refused to face: Political and economic freedom cannot be separated. Mr. Shatalin even dared to leave the word perestroika out of his devolutionary plan, because he knows the Gorbachev rhetoric is a smokescreen for continued central control.
How can we help this along? Not by inviting the Russians into the Middle East, or by sending trade missions to salvage their old system - but by pressing for disarmament down to our level of 6 percent of gross national product from their current 24 percent, by sending a Capitalism Corps to prepare the way for investment and by predicating our cooperation on freedom within the republics.
One final way: by urging the crumbling center in Moscow to recognize that its lust for control has been overtaken by events, and to proclaim its new realism by freeing the Baltics.

HEADLINE: New York City Will Prevail

BYLINE: By David N. Dinkins; David N. Dinkins is Mayor of New York City.

 BODY:
New York City is at war with its criminals, and the city needs help from every quarter.
 
When I arrived at
City Hall in January, I found a police force severely restricted in its size and effectiveness by the policies of the last 12 years. Over the past five months, we have deployed our troops and squeezed our budget to place the equivalent of nearly 3,000 more cops in the trenches to battle street crime.
These are not imaginary police officers, created by politicians or statisticians to placate an enraged public. These officers, skilled and dedicated, have been shifted from desk jobs and paid to work a second shift. Hundreds more will move in a few weeks from the Police Academy straight onto the streets, rather than to interim programs in borough headquarters. 
We have already placed more cops on foot patrol and have dedicated the force to the principle of community policing to choke off criminal activity before it can grow. The Police Department dispatched these officers to high-crime areas to attack the thieves, muggers and pushers on their home turf. Preliminary figures suggest that the strategy is paying off: as arrests rise, the number of criminals on the street falls, and so does the number of victims.
We did not set out to wage war by degree. We have a strategy. We have had it since April and we are implementing it. And we will prevail.
We will prevail because so many have heeded our cry to join the battle, as the City Council Speaker, Peter Vallone and Gov. Mario Cuomo have now done.
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown will complete an analysis of the staffing needs in his department this month - the first manpower review of the department in nearly 30 years. We will then know exactly how many more cops it will take during the next several years to win this war. Whatever his number - 3,216, or the 5,000 often mentioned, or 6,481 - the city must find a way, as the Governor has made plain, to pay the bill even in this fragile economic environment.
The commitment of the Speaker and the Governor to our plan offers substantial hope that these thousands of new officers will not vanish with the next budget modification.
And we need more help. We need the Congress and the State Legislature to stand up against the gun lobbyists to give us effective laws against automatic weapons. We need business and civic leaders to come forward to fight the battle here in America's greatest and most complex urban center.
But most of all, we need the good people of New York - the great majority of the men and women of our communities - to keep the faith and stand together. We can and must roll back the wave of crime that began to afflict our neighborhoods more than 25 years ago.
In August, in neighborhoods throughout the city, residents who had hidden behind their window grates and steel doors came out to organize their communities to drive away the fear. We helped them form block patrols and have provided $1 million for communications equipment and training.
We must stop the drug runners, the child killers and the muggers, but we must also refuse to tolerate the subway fare-beaters and the car thieves. We need the calm assistance of every citizen of New York to win this war.
The plea for more personnel immediately issues from our contempt for criminals and our human need to do something, anything, in the face of inhuman behavior. Yet, more personnel is not the only solution. Paradoxically, it isn't even the best solution. Random violence cannot be cured with random solutions, sketched on the back of an envelope, then fired off into the nearest microphone.
We must not forget the irrefutable truth that if we abandon our schools, abolish drug treatment or close our libraries to pay for an ill-conceived plan to hire an arbitrary number of cops, we will soon find ourselves with more criminals wreaking more violence requiring even more cops.
Merely more officers would not eliminate group violence, the kind that introduced us to Bernhard Goetz, the Central Park jogger, Yusuf Hawkins and Brian Watkins.
Indeed, crime in the subways, particularly group violence, has risen even though the number of Transit Police officers will next month reach the highest level in the system's history. Nor would more personnel ease the torrent of automatic weapons flooding our streets. These afflictions yield only to a perceptive and determined strategy that does more than throw soldiers into the line of fire.
We have yet to deploy fully this city's greatest resource: our pride and collective will. As the Watkins family reminded us last week with such dignity and courage, we can face down the thugs if we but join hands -with our police officers and other law enforcement officials, with our business, religious and civic leaders and with each other. This is our town, and we intend to fight for it.

HEADLINE: Post at the Brink Again as Owner Seeks Wage Cuts

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The New York Post, which has lost money for decades, is at death's door for the second time in two and a half years, and union leaders met all day yesterday with representatives of the paper's owner in an effort to hammer out an agreement that would keep it alive.
On Tuesday, Peter S. Kalikow, who owns The Post, said he would close the paper unless unions agree to $18.5 million in wage and benefit concessions by 8 P.M. Friday. Last week he set a deadline of midnight Saturday, but revised it so that The Post could announce its own salvation - or demise -on Saturday.
''I desperately want to keep it open,'' Mr. Kalikow said in an interview yesterday. But he added that he was not willing to put more money into a paper that has cost him more than $100 million since he acquired it in 1988. 
Mr. Kalikow said he wants to preserve The Post in part because it is the city's only politically conservative paper. And on most days, he said, he does not regret buying it.
But his weariness is apparent. He said the prospective buyers that courted him last year ''have evaporated'' more recently, and added that he negotiated to sell the paper this spring to a buyer he declined to identify, but the deal fell through.
Union leaders say that they do not think that Mr. Kalikow is bluffing. In general, they subscribe to the popular wisdom that New York City cannot support more than two daily newspapers, and have long regarded The Post's continued existence as a gift made possible by a rich person's whim.
The death of the city's oldest daily - it was founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton - would silence New York City's most unrepentantly sensational newspaper voice. In typical Post style, its headline yesterday shrieked ''Salaam Baloney!'' in reference to a poem read by Yusef Salaam at his sentencing for his part in the rape and beating of a jogger in Central Park.
 
Painful Proposals
George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella organization for the paper's nine unions, said there was little progress in yesterday's talks, although he remains ''optimistic'' that a deal can be struck. Though the Allied includes 10 unions, the small Photoengravers Union has no members at The Post.
Mr. McDonald said that moving up the deadline is unlikely to make a difference. ''If we're going to do it, we can do it by Friday,'' he said.
But the cost cutting would be painful. For instance, Barry F. Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild, said late yesterday that The Post had effectively demanded a 46 percent cut in wages and benefits from the Guild's 352 members, who include newsroom, advertising and circulation employees. The Post has essentially ruled out layoffs as a means of achieving the $5 million or so in savings it has demanded of the Guild, because current staffing levels are already lean.
Mr. Lipton said he has been unwilling to accept such huge salary cuts, adding ruefully, ''We're going to keep at it.''
 
A Word From The News
The negotiations were further complicated Tuesday when The Daily News notified the Guild that it would seek for itself any cost reductions granted The Post. Mr. Lipton, the Guild's president, described The News's action as an attempt to scuttle The Post negotiations and put a competitor out of business. He said The News has no legal right to concessions the union might give Mr. Kalikow.
A News spokesman, John T. Sloan, said his paper hopes The Post survives, but has an obligation to the shareholders of The Tribune Company, The News's parent company, to pursue the savings because The News is also facing severe economic hardship.
William Adler, a spokesman for The New York Times, said yesterday that The Times ''would seek to gain concessions as well,'' to the extent that they were related to the same adverse economic conditions that have affected The Post and The Daily News.
But Mr. McDonald said that under the language of The Times's contract, which expires in March 1993, it would not be entitled to concessions given to The Post.
 
Seat on the Board
Mr. Kalikow said that his plan is to reduce The Post's overall annual costs to the break-even point, and that he is willing to operate indefinitely without a profit. He said he would give unions a stake in the paper's ownership and a seat on the board.
But he said he would no longer subsidize the operation.
In documents presented to the paper's unions, he has estimated 1990's costs to be $108 million, which would mean a $27.5 million loss if revenues are the expected $80.5 million.
In addition to slashing union expenses, he has cut management staff, negotiated lower newsprint prices and plans to reduce the number of pages in the paper.
Yesterday, the city announced that The Post would be given reduced electrical rates that could save the paper $8.3 million over 20 years, under an economic development program used since 1985 to keep businesses in the city and preserve jobs. A spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins said the rate reduction would be available even if The Post's work force is reduced.
The Post has operated in the red virtually without interruption for almost two decades and newspaper analysts are skeptical that the hemorrhage could be stopped for long, even with a 25 percent cost reduction.
 
Advertising Slump
''I think it would be just temporary relief,'' said Kevin R. Gruneich, a newspaper analyst for First Boston Company, an investment banking firm in New York City.
All of the city's dailies, including The News, The Times and New York Newsday, have suffered advertising declines as the region's economy has slumped during the last 18 months, and no end to the trough is in sight.
In a tight advertising market, with fierce competition for every available dollar, The Post is at a particular disadvantage. It has no Sunday paper, which is the other papers's principal advertising vehicle, and also has a smaller circulation than the others, if Long Island Newsday's readers are included with New York Newsday's.
Many of The Post's traditional advertisers, like Korvette's, have closed, and there is also a reluctance by many retailers to advertise in a publication that Mr. Kalikow, with some pride, describes as ''a little bit crazy.''
 
History of Decline
In 1988, the year Mr. Kalikow acquired The Post from Rupert Murdoch, the paper's advertising dropped 20 percent, and then declined another 13.5 percent in 1989, according to Media Records, which tracks newspaper advertising lineage. Through July, this year's lineage had declined a further 12.5 percent, compared with the same period a year before.
Documents provided to unions by Mr. Kalikow estimated that 1990's ad revenues would be $35 million. Mr. Kalikow said that 1988's ad revenues were almost $48 million.
The Post's history of steady economic decline was known to Mr. Kalikow when he agreed to buy the paper from Mr. Murdoch for $37.5 million, a figure he said grew to $48 million after closing costs, inventory and receiveables were calculated.
 
Change of Editors
Mr. Kalikow, whose main business is real-estate development, had emerged as a white knight to save the paper after Mr. Murdoch established his own deadline and threatened to close it unless unions agreed to $24 million in savings.
Mr. Murdoch, who had owned the paper for 11 years, estimated his cumulative losses at $150 million.
Mr. Kalikow hired Jane Amsterdam, a repected editor who moved the paper away from the focus on sex and mayhem that had marked it under Mr. Murdoch. Mr. Kalikow also began a Sunday paper in an effort to attract more advertising.
But the Sunday paper failed, with Mr. Kalikow losing about $25 million. And Mr. Kalikow dismissed Ms. Amsterdam after concluding that The Post had become a bit too sedate and needed to shift emphasis toward local political coverage, as well as such staples as scandal and crime.
Under Jerry Nachman, a streetwise political columnist and former broadcaster whom Mr. Kalikow made editor, The Post prompted controversy by its sensational headlines, but was also first to report some important news.
Some union leaders note that Mr. Kalikow only threatened to close The Post after the Board of Estimate in late August removed a hurdle to Mr. Kalikow's plan to build an apartment tower on a site now occupied by a tenement complex that had been designated as a landmark.
Mr. Kalikow said that in June he began telling union leaders he needed relief, and that owning The Post had probably worked against him with the board because it attracted so much attention.

HEADLINE: THE 1990 ELECTIONS;
Primary Results Across U.S. Reflect Wide Outcry Against Politics as Usual

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
A public outcry against business-as-usual politics welled up among voters in primary voting around the country on Tuesday, illustrating a mood of anxiety about growth, the economy, the quality of life and the quality of politics.
In the suburbs just north of here voters dumped the chief executive of Maryland's largest county, a jurisdiction more populous than either Baltimore or Washington.
Voters in the Democratic primary in Montgomery County, a booming suburb typical of the places where much of American politics is now shaped, moved to replace the County Executive with a candidate who had railed against special interest groups and said that he wanted to impose a tax on development. The vote reflected the public mood as voters in 10 states and the District of Columbia voted in primary balloting with less than two months to go before the general election. 
 
'A Mood of Change'
In the Rhode Island governor's race, Democrats turned their backs on two veteran politicians, the Mayors of Providence and Warwick, and instead nominated as their candidate a businessman, Bruce Sundlun, who insisted that he was not a politician at all, his two previous races against the Republican Governor, Edward D. DiPrete, notwithstanding.
''There is definitely a mood of change in this country,'' said Mark Gearan, executive director of the Democratic Governors Conference. ''Candidates who were able to capitalize on that were successful.''
Nonetheless, it remained difficult to oust incumbents. A Maryland Representative, Roy Dyson, was renominated by Democratic voters, perhaps because his opponent could not afford enough television time to reach voters.
An important element of the voter mood of frustration this year, particularly in suburban jurisdictions, is an anger at crowding, traffic congestion, noise and dirt.
''It is one of those unexpressed, inchoate grievances among the electorate here,'' Bill Bradley, who publishes a newsletter on California Politics, said in Sacramento. ''Growth is a huge issue here. Both candidates for governor are trying to incorporate what they describe as their support of growth management into their campaigns.''
 
Issue of Growth
The issue of growth has become a way in which many voters express the belief that government is on the side of powerful interests, instead of ordinary people, politicians said.
''The people of this county can control their own interests,'' Neal Potter said after capturing the nomination for Montgomery County Executuve against the incumbent, Sidney Kramer. Mr. Potter, a 75-year-old Council member, ran on a platform to curb growth.
The defeat of Mr. Kramer, who has served four years as the County Executive, was the most dramatic illustration. Steady growth in recent years has pushed Montgomery County's population to 750,000 people, making it the largest jurisdiction in Maryland.
In a county that tends to vote Democratic, Mr. Potter has become the the favorite in November to defeat the Republican nominee, Albert Ceccone.
 
Crowding in California
Candidates in other areas are trying to show their concern about growth and the quality of voters' lives. Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic candidate for governor of California, has called for a growth management commission, while her Republican opponent, Senator Pete Wilson, has been citing his experience in managing growth as Mayor of San Diego.
In June, Californians approved a gasoline tax increase on the promise that the money would be used to alleviate freeway crowding.
Concern about growth and suspicion toward government came through clearly in the voting across the country on Tuesday as the primary season neared an end. Other themes were less certain.
Supporters of legal abortion won a victory in Maryland, but lost in Minnesota. In Maryland, four state legislators who had been part of a filbuster against legislation to protect legal abortion, were defeated in primary voting. But in Minnesota, often thought of as an early part of the anti-abortion movement, supporters of legal abortion were defeated in both the Democratic and Republican gubernatorial primaries by opponents of abortion.
The incumbent Governor, Rudy Perpich, a Democrat, will now face a conservative businessman, Jon Grunseth. Mr. Perpich said he was glad the Republicans had nominated a conservative because now he could occupy the middle ground.
But Mr. Grunseth, making it clear he planned a sharp attack on what some Minnesotans contend has been Mr. Perpich's odd behavior in office, replied, ''I'd rather be a little conservative than a little goofy.''
Mr. Grunseth won the Republican nomination by launching a wave of negative campaign commercials against his principal opponent, Arne Carlson, in the final weeks of the campaign. Mr. Grunseth's attack was described as the largest buy of television time for a political campaign in the state's history.
While public restiveness overturned one incumbent in Maryland, it was not enough to defeat another. Representative Dyson survived a challenge from State Delegate Barbara Kreamer and two other candidates. Mr. Dyson, a hawk on military issues, was embarrassed by the disclosure that he had been a conscientious objector in the Vietnam War.
Politicians said Ms. Kreamer had been unable to buy enough television time to reach all of the district, which sprawls through three television markets from Baltimore to Washington.
Mr. Dyson's victory set up a rematch with Wayne Gilchrest, a Republican who nearly defeated Mr. Dyson, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, in 1988 after the disclosure that some of his campaign contributions came from military contractors linked to the Pentagon procurement scandal.
In Arizona, voters rejected a return bid by Evan Mecham, who was impeached and ousted as Governor in 1988. He was defeated for the Republican nomination for governor by J. Fife Symington, a Phoenix developer. Mr. Symington will face the Democratic nominee, Terry Goddard, whose father, a former Governor, is now the state Democratic chairman.

Rowland, who did not face a primary fight, but former Senator Lowell Weicker. Mr. Weicker, a Republican, is running as an independent. Mr. Morrison's opponent in the primary, William J. Cibes, a little-known and poorly financed member of the General Assembly, had attempted to make the election a referendum on introducing a state income tax on wages and salaries. Mr. Morrison would avoid one unless the voters approved it in a referendum.

Turner Jr., who was unchallenged in the primary.
Jesse Jackson won his first election ever, becoming the Democratic nominee for the District's ''shadow senator,'' a postion created by the city to lobby Congress for statehood. Eleanor Holmes Norton was narrowly elected the Democratic nominee for the city's nonvoting delegate to Congress, overcoming recent disclosures that she had not paid city taxes for several years.

He faces an uphill battle in November against Democratic Governor William Donald Schaefer, who coasted to renomination.
Faced with a struggle for his political life, Rep. Roy P. Dyson held on to the Democratic nomination, despite attacks on his integrity for taking hawkish positions on defense spending in Congress after havind declared himself a Conscientious Objector during the Vietnam War. Wayne T. Gilchrest, who narrowly lost to Mr. Dyson two years ago, defeated seven other candidates for the Republican nomination.

Andrew J. Spano (D) 29%
In a campaign that focused more on attacking the Republican incumbent than echa other, Carol Bellamy, the former New York City Council president, handily defeated the Westchester County clerk Andrew J. Spano.
She now turns her attention to the incumbent, Edward V. Regan, the only Republican holding statewide office who is up for re-election in November. Already Ms. Bellamy has attacked Mr. Regan for being a tame watchdog over the state's finances. In turn, Mr. Regan has questioned how independent Ms. Bellamy will be of the Democratic governor.
Both the incumbent Governor, Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Pierre A. Rinfret, had already received their parties' nominations before Tuesday's election.

Bruce Sundlun (D) 41%
Joseph Paolino (D) 33%
Frank Flaherty (D) 27%
Gov. Edward D. Diprete, a Republican who is seeking a fourth two-year term, faced only token opposition in the primary. But he is seen as vulnerable by Democrats after he broke his promise not to raise taxes. The troubled New England economy is also expected to make it a difficult campaign for him. Millionaire businessman Bruce Sundlun, who has been defeated twice before in gubernatorial contests with Mr. Diprete, gained the Democratic nomination after beating Mayor of Providence Joseph Paolino and Mayor of Warwick Francis Flaherty.

Chase Faces Many Doubts on Wall Street

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Just how bad off are the large New York banks? Investors are acting as if many of them are in very poor shape.
With the common stocks of some banks already trading at their lowest levels in eight years or more, banks received another jolt on Tuesday with the news of an extremely poor auction for bonds issued by the Chase Manhattan Corporation. As a result, Chase will pay a little more than 13 percent interest on $200 million in borrowing for the next two years.
''It was the clearest manifestation of the fact that investors are very leery of bank holding company paper,'' George Salem, the banking analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said yesterday. 
At Chase, Michael Esposito, the chief financial officer, said the auction result ''was a function of the marketplace at that time.''
He added that ''there has been a general deterioration'' in the perception of banks in general.
Nowhere is the deterioration more evident than at Chase, whose common stock price has fallen 57 percent since it sold 16.1 million shares to investors at $40.125 each last fall.
Yesterday, as investors reacted to the auction results, the shares fell 50 cents, to $17.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are now trading at their lowest levels since 1982, when the Mexican debt problem burst into investor consciousness.
While worries over third-world loans remain, they have been joined by concerns over the fate of loans made for leveraged corporate buyouts in the 1980's and, especially, over possible real estate losses.
''The biggest risk to the bankers now is a significant recession,'' said Ronald Mandle, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''That would cause higher loan losses and would put earnings under even greater pressure.''
Chase's common stock now pays a quarterly dividend of 62 cents, for an annual yield on yesterday's stock price of 14.5 percent, the highest of any large bank. There has been widespread speculation that the payout could be cut, but Mr. Esposito said yesterday that the bank expected to maintain it.
In the most recent quarter, ending June 30, Chase reported profits of just 24 cents a share, or $52 million, after setting aside a $225 million provision for loan losses as nonperforming real estate loans soared. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a Wall Street firm, about 17 percent of Chase's commercial real estate loans were nonperforming as of June 30.
''We certainly recognize that our profitability was below acceptable levels,'' Mr. Esposito said yesterday, adding that he expected it to improve as a result of Chase's restructuring program. Under that program, the company hopes to cut about $300 million a year from annual expenses, which have been running at around $4 billion.
Mr. Mandle said he expected the restructuring to be successful and to enable Chase to maintain its dividend. He is recommending the stock.
He noted that Chase has 4.6 percent in ''tier one'' capital, in excess of the the Federal requirement for 1992 of at least 4 percent of assets. Mr. Esposito said there were no plans to raise additional tier-one capital by selling common stock. But he said the company might sell subordinated debt from time to time. Such debt counts as tier-two capital.
But some other analysts say the dividends of many banks, including Chase, could be in jeopardy. ''I think a year from now we will have seen several dividend reductions from major banks,'' he said. ''Morgan's dividend will go up, and the dividends of some of the ailing banks will go down in the next year.''
Among the seven largest New York commercial bank holding companies, J. P. Morgan & Company, the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust, has seen its stock suffer the least over the last year. Its dividend yield, at 5.6 percent, is also the lowest of any of the companies, indicating higher investor confidence. Morgan is widely perceived to be the best capitalized of all major banks.
The recent auction by Chase was for an existing bond issue of $200 million in subordinated debt, which matures nine years from now. Issued in 1987, it yielded 9.66 percent in the first three years. Through Tuesday's auction, the rate was reset for two years, after which a new auction will be held.
Chase determined the date of the auction three years ago, and it had the misfortune to choose the day on which the General Accounting Office issued a report warning that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fund that insures bank deposits may be depleted. That report may have made the psychology even worse for the auction.
At the auction, those holders who wanted to sell their bonds at face value could do so, as long as there were sufficient bidders for the bonds. The maximum rate those bidders could seek was 5 percentage points above two-year Treasury securities. The eventual result was 4.92 percentage points above that rate, for a yield of 13.017 percent.
Mr. Mandle estimated that the added interest payments would reduce Chase's annual earnings by about 4 cents a share.
At the auction, the largest buyer of the bonds was Salomon Brothers, one of the original underwriters of the bonds, said Jay Weintraub, a bank bond analyst for the firm. He said yesterday that Salomon had later found buyers for all those bonds, and said they were trading in the secondary market at slightly above face value.
The most recent similar auction for a similar bank issue was in May, when an auction by the BankAmerica Corporation produced a yield of 9.37 percent. In part, the higher yield of the Chase bonds reflects the fact that BankAmerica is considered a somewhat better credit risk, but most of the increase would seem to indicate rising investor concern over the entire banking system.
It is such concern that can create opportunities for investors. ''The whole banking group is exceptionally undervalued relative to the market,' Mr. Mandle said. He is recommending several bank stocks besides Chase, among them Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover.
But Mr. Salem, who has been negative on bank stocks for more than a year, said it was still not time to buy. ''Bottom fishing in bank stocks is a sport much like spear catching,'' he said yesterday.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Rushing to Lift Caps on F.D.I.C. Premiums

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
As dire predictions about the future of the Federal fund that insures deposits at banks continued to mount, lawmakers moved quickly today to propose regulatory reforms in an apparent effort to escape the political taint of another taxpayer bailout.
The proposals come amid reports by the General Accounting Office yesterday and the Congressional Budget Office today that one large bank failure or a further downturn in the economy could wipe out the remaining $13.2 billion in the fund and force taxpayers to rescue it.
The depletion of a separate fund insuring deposits at savings and loan institutions has forced a bailout that is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over 30 years.
Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill today joined the Bush Administration in proposing the lifting of limitations that prevent the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from increasing the premiums banks pay to the insurance fund. 
Urging Congress to act before it begins a recess next month, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., said he would introduce a measure eliminating caps on these premiums. Last month, the F.D.I.C. said it would increase the premium to 19.5 cents for every $100 of deposits; an increase of 30 percent, the maximum permitted under legislation adopted last year.
A similar proposal eliminating the caps on premiums was also introduced today in the House with the support of the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry B. Gonzalez. Last week, Mr. Gonzalez introduced a package of measures he said would save the fund money by substantially reducing the amount of insurance available to depositors.
Late this afternoon, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said it would endorse eliminating the ceiling on premiums to give the F.D.I.C. greater flexibility in setting rates.
In moving to abandon the statutory caps on premium increases without actually suggesting a new rate, Congress and the Bush Administration are clearly seeking to shift the political pressure to the F.D.I.C., which oversees the fund.
But there is no indication that the F.D.I.C. will take the bait. In a letter last week to Representative Gonzalez, L. William Seidman, chairman of the F.D.I.C., said that while he would like the discretion to make further increases, he did not foresee the need for them now. Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the F.D.I.C., said there had been no change in the agency's view since the letter was sent.
 
Passing New Costs to Consumers
Bankers have raised the prospect that a further increase in premiums could lead more banks to post losses at a time when the industry is suffering from poor loans and declining real estate markets in many parts of the nation. They have also suggested that a further increase in premiums would force banks to pass much of the new costs on to their customers by making fewer loans, charging higher rates for them, and generally increasing their fees.
''The increase that has already been announced will bring in $5 billion to the fund plus an additional $1 billion in interest income, and we expect that even under the G.A.O. projections, that should be enough,'' said Kenneth Guenther of the Independent Bankers Association, a trade group for small banks.
Senator Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, cautioned that an increase in the premium could be more harmful than helpful by further weakening the industry.
''We just can't willy-nilly raise premiums because it's the perception that we should and place in jeopardy a lot of these smaller institutions,'' he said. ''It's a dilemma and I don't know exactly where we should go.''
 
Fund at its Lowest Level
Still, both the G.A.O. and the budget office predict that even under the most optimistic of economic forecasts, the fund will be unable to reach its required level of $1.25 for each $100 of deposits by 1995 - a prospect that has raised concern among the lawmakers.
Now, at 70 cents per $100 worth of deposits, the fund is at its lowest level since it was created during the Great Depression. It is at half the level mandated by last year's bailout legislation of the savings and loan industry. Bank regulators predict the fund will likely lose as much as $2 billion this year.
Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that over the next three years, the insurance fund would probably lose at least $20.8 billion from the failure of 631 insured institutions.
 
'On Thin Ice'
''We're on thin ice, but our skates are still dry,'' Mr. Reischauer told the Senate Banking Committee. ''The fact that the failure of one of the very large banks could, by itself, deplete the fund, underscores the fund's vulnerability.''
He added that the budget office projections for the next few years did not consider a sharp downturn in the economy.
''The uncertain economic outlook, exacerbated by declines in real estate values and sharp increases in oil prices, raises concerns that spending from the fund could be greater during the next few years than we have estimated,'' he said.
The committee also heard fom Michael DeStefano, a vice president at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, which rates the soundness of securities issued by corporations and municipalities. As a further sign of the decline in the banking industry, Mr. DeStefano said that within the last six months Standard & Poor's had lowered ratings of 36 bank holding companies, some more than once, and upgraded only four.

HEADLINE: Black Business Ownership Up

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 12

 BODY:
The number of businesses owned by black Americans rose modestly from 1982 to 1987, but revenues for the same period more than doubled, according to a new Census Bureau survey released on Tuesday. 
In 1987, there were 424,000 black-owned businesses in the United States, up 38 percent from 308,000 in 1982, while receipts swelled to $19.8 billion, from $9.6 billion.
The total number of concerns in the United States grew 14 percent, to 13.7 million. Revenues leaped to $1.99 trillion, from $967.5 billion. Large corporations are not included in the survey.
On average, revenues per black-owned businesses were $47,000, compared with $146,000 for all American concerns, the study showed.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Mixed Amid Worry

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
Donoghue's analysts noted that the employment figures for August showed the economy in a perilous state. ''It is close to a recession,'' said Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist. ''The markets are waiting for the Federal Reserve Bank to move toward easing interest rates if we are to avoid a serious decline.'' 
So far, the Fed, concerned about fueling inflation, has held off cutting interest rates, which is why yields have remained flat all these weeks, Mr. Frank said.
 
Need for Easing of Rates Seen
Any budget agreement negotiated in Washington would likely include tax increases and budget cuts, he added, which would need to be offset by an easing of rates.
Managers of tax-exempt funds shortened the number of days that securities were held in portfolios by one, to 58. But many analysts maintain that the average is still unusually long.
Assets increased by $1.3 billion, to a total of $81.2 billion, as the average seven-day tax-exempt compounded yield rose 11 basis points, to 5.54 percent for the week. The 30-day average yield rose by 10 basis points, to 5.39 percent.
For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket, the equivalent taxable seven-day compounded yield is 7.69 percent, and it is 8.26 percent for investors in the 33 percent bracket.
Among tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund gave the best return. The compounded average yield is 6.30 percent, or about 36 basis points better than the average. The fund is distributed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc., Milwaukee.
 
Taxable Fund Assets Up
Meanwhile assets of taxable funds rose by $1.1 billion, to $399.9 billion. Most of the activity was in consumer funds, where assets increased $1.1 billion, to $315.7 billion, with virtually no activity in institutional funds, up only $14 million, to $84.2 billion. Some of the money going into the consumer funds may be coming from banks, where yields continue to erode.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased by one, to 47, the highest in three years.
Donoghue's said the seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund was unchanged at 7.75 percent, while the 30-day average yield fell a basis point, to 7.76 percent, underlining the flatness in yields.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Mixed in a Quiet Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in lackluster trading yesterday, and interest rates on the longer maturities rose slightly.
In the wake of President Bush's address to Congress on Tuesday night, dealers said that market participants were taking a wait-and-see attitude on a number of fronts.
''Everything is on hold,'' said Joe Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. ''There are expectations about a budget package, but the market can't react to that until it sees a deal. The Middle East is stalemated, and likely to remain that way for a while, and oil prices are fairly stable. For the first time in several sessions, the market spent the day marking time.'' 
Market participants said the only breath of real activity occurred at midmorning, when the World Bank priced a $2 billion offering of five-year global bonds.
 
'Something Good' Expected
''The market still has expectations that something good is going to happen,'' one government bond trader said. ''But we will be in a narrow trading range until we get some news that addresses those expectations. Still, the market held and $2 billion worth of securities were sold. Under the circumstances, that's not a bad performance.''
In addition to the World Bank offering, the City of New York offered $850 million worth of general obligation bonds to investors in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
With the city's economy still under pressure and its image tarnished further by the recent spate of violent killings, investors demanded higher interest rates on the new securities than at the last offering of general obligation bonds in late June.
The negotiated issue consisted of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2004, two sets of term bonds insured by the Financial Guaranty Insurance Corporation and an additional set of uninsured term bonds.
The serial bonds were priced to yield 6.50 percent in 1992, 7.20 percent in 1995, 7.70 percent in 2000 and 7.85 percent in 2004.
The 7.30 percent insured bonds, which mature in 2005 and 2006, were both priced to yield 7.35 percent.
At the city's last sale of new general obligation debt in February, interest rates on serial bonds sold ranged from 6 percent on securities maturing in 1991 to 7.71 percent on issues that matured in 2013. Insured bonds, which carried maturities from 2014 to 2019, were priced to yield 7.15 percent.
Bear, Stearns & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
 
Shortfalls Seen
In assigning its A-minus rating, Maury Cooper, an analyst who covers New York City for S.& P., did not sound a sanguine note about the future.
''Present economic and revenue trends indicate that the current $27.9 billion budget will likely show revenue shortfalls,'' Ms. Cooper wrote in assigning the rating. ''Due to the fiscal and economic risks and uncertainties, S.& P.'s long-term rating outlook remains negative.''
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 2/32 late yesterday, down 1/8 point, to yield 8.93 percent, compared with 8.92 percent late Tuesday.
Among note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 22/ 32, down 2/32, to yield 8.68 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.99 percent.
While a substantive budget accord would meet with approval in the fixed-income markets, analysts said an agreement would be viewed especially favorably by foreign investors.
''The budget is much more of a focus for our foreign clients than either inflation or a possible recession,'' said Roger A. Portnoy, director of international production in the London office of Technical Data, a bond market advisory service.
 
Bill Rates Drop
As bonds and notes were turning in a mixed performance, short-term Treasury bill rates moved slightly lower.
By late yesterday, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.35 percent, down three basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates dipped by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.28 percent. And one-year bills fell by two basis points, to 7.21 percent.
Aside from the New York City bond offering, a $100 million competitive offering of bonds from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was priced in the municipal bond market. The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1996 to 2010 and a term bond that matures in 2030. Yields on the serial bonds range from 6.40 percent in 1996 to 7.20 percent in 2010. The 7.25 percent term bonds were priced to yield 7.37 percent.
A bid from a group led by the investment banking subsidiary of Bankers Trust won the issue, which is rated AA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were little changed in light trading.
Meanwhile, most actively quoted issues in the secondary municipal bond market rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, dealers said.Bear Stearnsd (Bear, Stearns)

World Bank's 5-Year Bonds Are Priced to Yield 8.74%

 BODY:
The World Bank yesterday priced $2 billion in five-year global bonds through a group of 15 international dealers jointly managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets and Salomon Brothers Inc.
The issue was priced simultaneously in the United States, Europe and Japanese markets, with the 8 5/8 percent bonds offered at 99.54 to yield 8.74 percent, or about 31 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Yesterday's offering was the third global bond issue by the World Bank in nearly a year.
The last offering was in February, when $1.5 billion in 10-year bonds were priced to yield 8.75 percent. Those bonds were the first such issue to be sold directly on the Japanese market.
Investment bankers familiar with yesterday's transaction said demand for the new issue was spread fairly equally among New York, Tokyo and London.
The bankers said participation by American investors was better than for previous global bond offerings. World Bank officials had made a special marketing effort to attract American buyers.
The World Bank, owned by 151 Governments, including the United States and Japan, is the largest source of loans to third world countries. Proceeds from the sale will be used for these loans.
Bond traders said the bank's outstanding debt was rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mostly Up in U.S. But Tumbles Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher in New York yesterday after falling in overseas trading and reaching a 13-month low against the Japanese yen in Tokyo. Gold prices advanced. Analysts said a variety of factors, including German reunification, helped move the dollar higher in domestic dealings. 
''There is some skepticism in the market about whether or not the reunification process can be completed without any disruptions,'' said Bill Janson, an analyst with the Discount Corporation.
That uncertainty weakened the German mark against the dollar. The United States currency closed at 1.5915 marks in New York, up from 1.5865 late Tuesday.
The possibility of interest rate changes accounted for other gains by the dollar in New York - but also attributed to its decline overseas. Indications that French and Swiss rates will decline bolstered the dollar in United States trading, Mr. Janson said. Yet dealers in London said earlier that expectations of lower United States rates depressed the dollar there.
Lower interest rates are a negative for any currency, as they reduce the yield on investments in that currency.
The Japanese yen, meanwhile, continued to recover from its own recent losses. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at a 13-month low of 138.30 Japanese yen from 139.85 yen at Tuesday's close. It was the dollar's lowest closing there since Aug. 4, 1989, when it finished trading at 138.05 yen.
Later, in London, the dollar fell to 137.60 yen and in New York, it fell more than two yen to close at 138.075 yen, down from 140.305.
The yen had been depressed recently by the tensions in the Persian Gulf. The Japanese import almost all of their crude oil, and there were concerns the country's businesses would be hurt by energy prices that rose sharply after Iraq invaded Kuwait last month.
The British pound rose slightly against the dollar in New York and closed at $1.8590, up from $1.8565. In London earlier, the British pound rose to $1.8650 from $1.8490 late Tuesday.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.3290 Swiss francs, up from 1.3245; 5.3303 French francs, up from 5.3125; 1,187.75 Italian lire, up from 1,183.00, and 1.16355 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16095.
Gold rose in New York, picking up $1.60 and closing at $382.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: 'NATO' in the Gulf: A Certain Disaster

BYLINE: By Caleb Carr and James Chace; Caleb Carr and James Chace are co-authors of ''America Invulnerable: The Quest for Absolute Security From 1812 to Star Wars.''

 BODY:
An entangling alliance in the Persian Gulf, as outlined by Secretary of State James Baker in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Sept. 5, is not in the national interest of the United States.
In speaking of ''a new regional security structure,'' designed first to contain Iraqi aggression and later to help create a ''stable gulf'' in which ''legitimate security concerns can be preserved'' and ''energy supplies flow freely,'' Mr. Baker seeks to apply the lessons of NATO's successful 50-year defense of Western Europe to the Middle East. But the parallel is fatally flawed. The free flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf is vital to Western Europe and Japan, which meet more than half their energy needs with gulf oil. Any crisis that threatens a cutoff of that oil therefore merits a forceful American response, even though we receive only 5 to 10 percent of our oil from the region. 
Secretary Baker's remarks, however, reveal that the American military umbrella opening over the Persian Gulf is more than a pragmatic, decisive response to a single threat to Western security. It's the opening move in the formation of a nominally multilateral but effectively American and, more alarmingly, open-ended commitment to defend the integrity of the oil-producing states of the Arabian Peninsula.
Such a commitment is disturbing for several reasons. Because the Bush Administration is determined not to relinquish effective control of the peacekeeping force, we will continue to bear the greater part of the economic burden for the operation. As in the case of NATO, our allies will be allowed to spend less than their fair share because we wish to retain authority.
But the United States of 1990 is not the United States of 1949, the year NATO was formed. As the world's greatest debtor nation, we can today ill afford even the $15 to $18 billion (almost certainly a conservative estimate) that Operation Desert Shield alone will cost in fiscal 1991, much less the additional burden of a semi-permanent regional security arrangement. Even should the Arab states underwrite the alliance, America could end up beholden to them. Secretary Baker's plan will only heighten the insolvency of our foreign policy and intensify our domestic economic debate.
Perhaps more dangerous than the purely economic cost of Mr. Baker's proposed security system is the fact that it will cast us in the role of status quo power in the Persian Gulf. Besides Saudi Arabia, the United States now has military units stationed in Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - nations that, like Kuwait, have exhibited little attachment to the principles of liberal democracy.
Agitation for a greater popular voice in governmental affairs is today characteristic of most of the Arab world. By interposing to protect the sheiks and emirs of the gulf, we run the very great risk of eventually making enemies not only of those unpredictable leaders but of the peoples they rule, the peoples whose right to ''live free of the fear of coercion'' Secretary Baker says we are in the gulf to protect.
It is one thing to mobilize a temporary alliance for definable ends, such as the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. It is a far more dangerous thing to erect an alliance structure in which we play the commanding role in countless skirmishes, expending our blood and treasure in a region that is of greater importance to our allies than to ourselves. The Middle East may be an inescapable entanglement, but it need not be a permanent one.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
JAPAN DEFENDS AID IN MIDEAST EFFORT

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Jolted by mounting criticism of Japan in Washington, Government officials asserted today that Japan had done more than any other country outside the gulf region to aid the American buildup in the Middle East and pledged another $3 billion in assistance to the region.
The officials said that $2 billion, for economic aid to Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, includes a fast infusion of $600 million to make up for revenues those countries lost because of the sanctions against Iraq.
In addition, the officials said, another $1 billion will be used to assist the multinational military effort in the gulf beyond the $1 billion announced two weeks ago.
The new money will bring to $4 billion the total amount Japan has committed to the Persian Gulf since the beginning of the crisis caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. [In West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl also pledged more help, apparently trying to soften the anger expressed in Congress that Bonn is not pulling its weight in the gulf. He offered few details. 
 
Page A11.]
Since Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced the previous pledge of $1 billion, only one shipment of goods, consisting of 800 vehicles, has gone to the Middle East.
Shipments of goods by Japan have been delayed for several reasons, partly because of the reluctance of Japan Airlines and independent shippers to send material into a combat zone.
Japanese officials also said Tokyo had to wait for the creation of a legal entity before it could in effect write a check to help pay for the American military effort.
Japanese officials said a direct transfer of money to another country, like the United States, is forbidden by law unless it is for purposes like economic assistance or disaster relief. ''As soon as we finish working out a scheme in cooperation with the United States Government, the money can be processed,'' a Japanese official said.
A larger obstacle to Japanese assistance has been the interpretation long applied to the Constitution written by the United States after the end of World War II. The Constitution rules out use of force by Japan in pursuit of its interests. Tokyo has cited the clause in rejecting an American appeal to send minesweepers, refueling tankers and other equipment.
 
Vehicles, Housing, Money
Japanese officials said that while other countries outside the gulf had sent troops and ships to the Middle East, no country outside the region had come up with a sum anywhere near even the $1 billion Japan had previously committed.
Kuwait's exiled Emir has said he will contribute about $5 billion to the effort before the end of the year, and the Saudis have promised to contribute about $500 million a month. The United Arab Emirates has also pledged a sizable contribution.
The Japanese assistance is to come largely in vehicles, housing, air-conditioning equipment and other goods, as well as direct financial support for the multinational military effort.
In addition, officials said the $2 billion for Jordan, Egypt and Turkey will help their economic development in the years ahead.
But it has not been clear whether the $2 billion in economic aid is in addition to or part of the roughly $10 billion a year Japan has committed in recent years for economic development in poor countries.
 
Dismayed by Admendment
On Thursday night officials said they were especially dismayed by the passage on Wednesday of an anti-Japanese amendment to a military spending bill in the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 370 to 53.
''Some of those 370 Congressmen may not be aware that Japan is the biggest supporter of United States forces overseas,'' Taizo Watanabe, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in an interview Thursday night. ''We hope that once they know the full magnitude of what we are doing, their appreciation will increase.''
Other officials warned that the part of the resolution calling for a reduction in American forces in Japan was potentially dangerous. The resolution called for a cut of 5,000 troops each year if Tokyo does not increase its support for the 50,000 American troops on Japanese soil.
''These resolutions are coming out of pure ignorance,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. ''To withdraw 5,000 troops a year for Japan is sheer nonsense. It would destroy not only the national interest of Japan, but of the United States as well.''
 
Protecting American Interests
He added that American troops are in Japan ''not for the narrow purpose of defending Japan alone,'' but to protect American interests in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
 
Prime Minister Kaifu telephoned
President Bush about the announcement of additional aid, the Japanese Embassy in Washington said, adding that the President said he appreciated the efforts.
A White House spokesman, Sean T. Walsh, said, ''The President and Secretary Baker have been asking all the allies to contribute and we would welcome the additional contribution.''
The tone of statements from Japan earlier this week had been one of alarm, apparently mixed with a feeling that criticism in the United States seemed to be inevitable because of what some have acknowledged to be the delays in Japanese assistance.
The 800 vehicles finally shipped, for instance, were delayed because union seamen did not want to take such cargo to a combat zone.
In addition, some 38 Japanese company representatives in Iraq made an unusual appeal two weeks ago to the Tokyo Government to rescind the $1 billion effort for the United States and instead spend the money for food and medicine in Baghdad. The appeal was disavowed by some of the companies' headquarters in Japan.
Mr. Kaifu was also said to be ready to submit legislation to create a United Nations Peacekeeping Amendment to Japanese statutes. As envisioned by some officials, the measure would permit Tokyo to pay for United Nations efforts now barred by current law.
A change in the law might enable Japan to send vehicles, medical aid and other items to the military peacekeeping missions of the United Nations, Japanese officials say.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.N. Council Votes Strict Limits On Food Aid to Iraq and Kuwait

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Security Council voted overwhelmingly tonight to adopt a plan setting tight limits on humanitarian food supplies sent to Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
The Council voted 13 to 2 in favor of the plan, with Cuba and Yemen in opposition. The resolution, drafted by the United States and the other four permanent members - Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China - says the Council alone will determine when such deliveries are justified in light of the United Nations embargo against Iraqi commerce.
The measure also requires that any food supplies be distributed ''through the United Nations in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross or other appropriate humanitarian agencies'' to insure that they reach ''the intended beneficiaries'' and are not seized by the Iraqi Government for its supporters. 
The Council plans to monitor Iraq's supplies to determine whether a threat of famine exists that would justify emergency food deliveries.
It pledged to pay particular attention to the plight of the more vulnerable groups, including children under the age of 15, pregnant women, the sick and the elderly.
 
Cuba and Yemen Vote No
In voting against the limits, Cuba and Yemen, the Council's sole Arab member, argued that the 15-member Council had no right to place any restrictions on access to food.
But the United States Representative, Thomas R. Pickering, described the plan as ''a fair procedure'' that would enable the Security Council to meet genuine humanitarian needs without undermining the trade sanctions.
The plan seeks to insure that the embargo, which has been in effect since early August, can legally be relaxed only in extreme cases. Iraq has said it will not permit international supervision of the distribution of food, raising doubts about whether even the limited shipments allowed in principle by the resolution will ever take place.
Because the Security Council resolution adopted last month on trade sanctions included provisions for humanitarian relief, questions quickly arose on whether Iraq would be able to evade the embargo by having friendly countries send in ''humanitarian'' aid.
The United States made it clear last week that it intended to press for United Nations approval of exceptions to the embargo on a case-by-case basis, with each shipment monitored by an international agency, like the Red Cross.
At the meeting on Sunday in Helsinki between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the two men agreed on such monitored food shipments.
An Iranian newspaper that reflects the views of the Government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani said on Wednesday that Iran was considering sending food and medicine across the border to Iraq. ''Muslim Iraqi people shouldn't pay for the mistakes of their Government,'' the editorial in The Teheran Times said.
The Council is expected to allow India to send a shipload of food to Kuwait for the hundreds of thousands of its citizens living there and in Iraq who, along with tens of thousands of other expatriate workers, are having trouble finding food.
There have been reports of severe food shortages in Kuwait, with Iraqi troops reportedly seizing supplies and sending them home. There have been no reports of severe food shortages in Iraq itself.
Western diplomats see the witholding of food from Asians in Kuwait and Iraq as a calculated attempt by Baghdad to weaken third world support for sanctions.
The final votes on the guidelines for humanitarian aid and on India's request to dispatch its food ship were held up by Cuba and Yemen, which have consistently sought to weaken and delay sanctions against Iraq in the past.
Today Cuba introduced an alternative resolution that would have exempted all food supplies from the United Nations trade embargo, but the measure won no support from other members. Western diplomats accused both countries of trying to postpone a final decision through a variety of procedural maneuvers but expressed confidence throughout the day that their version would eventually be approved.
Cuba and Yemen sought to link approval of the Indian relief shipment to Kuwait with acceptance by the Council of the general guidelines for emergency supplies proposed by the five permanent members. They argued that the United States might block the Indian shipment once the Council approved the restrictive guidelines. Will the Needy Get the Food? The potential effect on world opinion of the sight of starving women and children has long been recognized by the Security Council as one of the most vulnerable aspects of its effort to use a comprehensive trade embargo to force Baghdad to retreat from Kuwait.
But whether needy people in Iraq and Kuwait will ever receive food supplies was thrown into doubt on Tuesday by Iraq's United Nations representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
After meeting with the Secretary General, he told reporters that Iraq would never allow foreign organizations to control the distribution of food suppplies, saying that this would be an affront to its sovereignty. But Western diplomats said they doubted that local Iraqi humanitarian organizations like the Iraqi Red Crescent could be relied on to insure that the food goes to the people for whom it is intended.
Finland's deputy representative, Marjatta Rasi, who heads the Security Council committee monitoring compliance with the embargo, said today that Iraq's food stocks are still relatively plentiful, enough to last anywhere from two months to more than six months.
 
Using 'the Food Weapon'
But Mrs. Rasi said that Iraq was already using ''the food weapon'' against tens of thousands of poor Asian workers still in the country by denying them ration cards. Withholding food in this way, she said at a news conference, constitutes a ''gross violation'' of Iraq's duty to protect foreign nationals under international law.
Asian diplomats confirmed that Iraqi authorities had told India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines that their nationals would be given no food and would have to rely on suppplies from home. An estimated 150,000 Indians, some 93,000 Sri Lankans and about 60,000 Flipinos are in Iraq and Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Split, Catholic Bishops Defer Proposals on Women's Issues

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
A final decision on a seven-year effort by the nation's Roman Catholic bishops to set church policy on issues of concern to women, from abortion to sexual discrimination to ordination, was postponed indefinitely yesterday under the weight of criticism from both liberals and conservatives in the church.
The National Conference of Catholic Bishops had been scheduled to vote in November on a final draft of the policy-setting pastoral letter on women's concerns, but the conference's administrative committee postponed the vote after the Vatican requested that the bishops preparing the document consult with fellow bishops in other nations on the matter.
 
A Division Over Tradition
The pastoral letter has sharply divided Catholics who want more change in church practices regarding women and those who uphold traditional restrictions. Representatives of both positions have demanded that the whole project be dropped. 
Yesterday's postponement provoked sharply different interpretations of the likelihood that a statement on women's concerns would ever emerge from the bishops' deliberations.
''I certainly do not think that this is the first step toward abandoning the project, nor a hint from Rome that this is a way to close down the pastoral letter,'' said Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet, Ill., who heads the panel of six bishops that has been working on the letter since November 1983. ''I look upon the consultation and extra time as a great opportunity.''
The international consultation ''means another year of work,'' Bishop Imesch said. ''This is Rome's recognition of the importance of the topic,'' he said. ''This is not just a national issue. The concerns of women are worldwide.''
Other Catholics, many of whom had already expressed unhappiness about the all-male hierarchy writing a document on women, took the opposite view about the life of the project. ''I could be wrong, but I think this means the end of the pastoral letter,'' said Sister Maria Riley, a feminist writer and staff member at the Center of Concern, a Catholic research organization dealing with economic and political questions.
In recent weeks the Vatican has been urging the international consultation, which probably will take place in Rome sometime next year, Bishop Imesch said yesterday. Pastoral letters are not necessarily binding on Catholics, but they sometimes include authoritative teaching and always set guidelines for preaching, educational efforts and national programs by the bishops' conference.
 
'Sin of Sexism' Condemned
There have been two drafts of the pastoral letter on women, and the committee had been receiving further amendments from the bishops. Both drafts condemn the ''sin of sexism,'' expressed in violence against women, sexual exploitation and economic discrimination, and both said sexist attitudes had colored church teachings.
The first draft, however, was considered to be too liberal by many lay people, bishops and Vatican officials. They criticized the draft for appearing merely to restate without clearly endorsing the church's prohibitions of contraception and the ordination of women and for recommending further discussion of these teachings.
The second draft, issued in April, endorsed the prohibitions in detail and took a position closer to that of Pope John Paul II, who has said that debate is closed on the matters. Also, while not eliminating the earlier version's criticism of sexual discrimination in the church, the April draft toned it down.
As a result, a number of liberals and conservatives alike have rejected the second draft as an unacceptable compromise between upholding traditional church teachings on the one hand and affirming the equality of women in nearly feminist terms on the other.
Sister Riley, of the Center of Concern, said that although the April draft probably included the ''strongest statement of any Catholic Church document on the radical equality'' between men and women, her organization had called for the letter to be dropped.
In June, the center had issued a statement concluding that the draft ''clearly illustrates the current untenable position the institutional church finds itself in as it tries to respond to the historical shift in human consciousness about women and simultaneously maintain its traditional patriarchal structures and processes.''
Only two weeks ago, Women for Faith and Family, a St. Louis-based traditionalist organization, also asked the bishops to reject the draft and abandon their effort. The pastoral letter, the group said, threatened to compromise traditional church teaching, encourage dissent and increase polarization among Catholics.
 
Amendment Was Proposed
Earlier a group of seven bishops sent Bishop Imesch an amendment for the November meeting that would have transformed the letter into a simple report from the drafting committee and called for further discussion with women.
Last May, Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee wrote in his diocesan paper that the letter should be dropped, saying that it evaded the question of women's leadership in the church and that ''the section in the new draft on the ordination of women comes as an even more chilling cold shower.''
The Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which brings together many of the leaders of religious orders of women, also said last month that the project should be dropped. The church was ''not ready'' for the kind of self-criticism implied in ''its insistence on the fundamental equality of all persons,'' the group said, although it applauded the drafting commitee's ''effort to take the unique experience and insights of women seriously.''
Groups of Catholic women voiced similar opposition when consultations on the letter began in the mid-1980's, but that criticism was somewhat muted after the first draft in 1988 cited both liberal and conservative testimony from Catholic women and seemed to create openings for further discussion of the most controversial issues.
 
'Voices Heard Are Negative'
Bishop Imesch rejected the conclusion that the church was too divided to reach a consensus. ''The only voices being heard are the negative ones,'' he said. So far the committee has received responses to the April draft from only 40 of the church's 185 dioceses, he said.
In one precedent for international consultation on pastoral letters, the Vatican summoned American bishops to Rome to consult with bishops from NATO nations before the Americans issued their 1983 statement on war and peace.
Unofficial accounts of that meeting have portrayed it as subjecting the American bishops to harsh criticism, but Bishop Imesch said he did not foresee anything of that nature if the consultation included strong representation from other Western nations where discussions of issues of sexual equality are similar to those in the United States.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Warning Congress to move cautiously in trying to cure the ailing banking system, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said today that increasing the premiums that institutions pay to the declining fund that insures bank deposits could be more harmful than helpful, threatening some banks with insolvency.
Instead, Mr. Greenspan proposed increasing the amount of money that banks must hold as a cushion against losses and called for more extensive reviews of banks by regulators.
Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan also said that the Federal Reserve had detected in recent months that banks were ''pulling back'' on extending credit, and he reiterated his longstanding position that adoption of a ''credible'' Federal budget that reduced the deficit would lead to an easing of interest rates.
Lower American interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners, and the dollar had a steep slide against all major currencies yesterday after Mr. Greenspan's testimony. 
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that raising banks' capital requirements would probably force many of them to reduce credit further even when they have already shown signs of restricting loans. Such a move would also lead to greater consolidation in the banking industry and slower growth, he said.
Still, he said, increasing the capital requirement is necessary to protect the banks and the Federal insurance fund, which is expected to post its third consecutive loss this year. Some analysts have even said the fund could be wiped out by either an economic downturn or the failure of one or several large institutions.
 
Concern About Risky Lending
Mr. Greenspan stopped short of proposing precise figures for increasing the standards, but said that the current level of capital was not adequate to protect institutions, particularly those interested in making riskier types of loans and investments.
After estimates this week by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office that the insurance fund might soon be exhausted, legislators and the Bush Administration have moved to eliminate the restrictions on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's ability to raise the premiums that banks pay to the fund.
The accounting office said a significant number of failed banks had not appeared on the F.D.I.C.'s list of ''problem banks'' before their collapse, or had been listed only shortly before failing. Both the accounting office and the budget office have said the present standards of financial reporting make it difficult for regulators to detect troubled banks early enough to intervene and reduce the costs to the deposit insurance fund.
The two agencies' estimates, while generally in line with earlier forecasts by the F.D.I.C., look at the fund from a broader perspective. The accounting office's auditors said they knew of 35 banks that had failed or would probably fail, at a total cost to the fund of $4.4 billion to $6.3 billion. They also said that the fund's balance sheet had failed to take account of $8 billion that might have to be spent in connection with Southwestern banks.
 
Worries on Capitol Hill
Declining real estate markets in many parts of the nation and the growing number of troubled loans held by banks have increased concern on Capitol Hill that the number of bank failures could increase to the point of depleting the insurance fund. Lawmakers, stung by the costly rescue of failed savings and loan associations, are now worried that they will be blamed if taxpayers are forced to bail out the banking industry.
Yesterday the stocks of several leading banks, which were already trading at or near their lowest levels in many years, continued to drop. Shares of Chase Manhattan dropped 37.5 cents, to $16.75; Chemical Banking fell 50 cents, to $20.875; Manufacturers Hanover was off $1.25, to $25.625, and BankAmerica lost 62.5 cents, to $21.75.
Last month, the F.D.I.C., which oversees the bank fund, said it would raise premiums by 30 percent, to 19.5 cents for every $100 in deposits, by the beginning of the year. The increase was the maximum permitted in the savings bailout legislation adopted last year. Lawmakers are now proposing to amend that provision of the legislation.
Mr. Greenspan, in his Congressional testimony today, joined the chorus of Government officials who are worried about the deposit insurance fund.
 
'The Fund Is Under Stress'
''There is no question that the fund is under stress, and it should be audited closely by the regulators and Congress in order to avoid the problems that have occurred with thrifts,'' he said. ''That the ratio of insured funds to deposits is a low number and heading lower is of concern.''
He said that while he supported the move to give the F.D.I.C. greater discretion in setting insurance premiums, any move to raise them further could ultimately cost the fund more than it brings in because it might squeeze the industry too hard.
''Let's remember that we can create problems for the American taxpayer by having premiums that are too low, or too high,'' he said. ''If we set the premiums too high, we can induce more bankruptcies. The banks would then fall back on the F.D.I.C., and taxpayers would be worse off.''

HEADLINE: Moscow and Bonn in a 'Good Neighbor' Pact

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Soviet Union and West Germany today initialed a broad ''treaty on good-neighborliness, partnership and cooperation'' setting a framework for relations between Moscow and a united Germany.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union, who initialed the document, hailed it as something of a historic breakthrough.
In fact, the treaty included few concrete agreements, and consisted largely of pledges of peace and cooperation. 
Western diplomats said the document had been part of the package sought by the Soviet Union in exchange for its agreement to German unity. In effect, it replaced the treaties Moscow had concluded with the separate German nations with one broad statement on the shape of future relations.
 
For Domestic Consumption
The diplomats said part of Moscow's reason for seeking the pact was for domestic consumption, to demonstrate to a nation reared on the accounts of Soviet sacrifices in World War II that a united Germany was prepared to put its peaceful intentions on paper.
The treaty was initialed the day after foreign ministers of the Germanys, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France signed the ''two plus four'' treaty settling all Allied claims on Germany stemming from World War II and clearing the way for the Germans to reunite.
The Soviet-German treaty was only initialed because it is to be signed later by Chancellor Helmut Kohl for a united Germany and by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the Soviet Union. But both sides evidently wanted to publicize the treaty in conjunction with the ''two plus four'' document, as well as on the 35th anniversary of the restoration of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany on Sept. 13, 1955.
The preamble declared that both sides were ''resolved to continue the good traditions of their centuries-old history,'' and spoke of ''historic challenges on the threshold to the third millennium.''
 
'This Is a Great Thing'
The document included statements banning aggression against each other and calling for annual summit meetings, consultation in times of crisis and expanded trade, travel and scientific cooperation. Though it had no detailed projects, officials said separate treaties detailing economic relations, including German financial aid for the Soviet Union and incentives for trade and investment, were under negotiation.
''The treaty leads both our countries into the 21st century marked by responsibility, trust and cooperation,'' Mr. Genscher said. Mr. Shevardnadze called the treaty a ''historic document in spirit and content,'' adding: ''Now we can rightly say that the postwar era has ended. We are satisfied that the Federal Republic and we again appear as partners. This is a great thing.''

HEADLINE: TAXES APPROVED BY ISRAELI CABINET

BYLINE: By SABRA CHARTRAND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Israeli Cabinet unanimously approved an economic package today that includes harsh new taxes to help pay for the absorption of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
The plan now goes to Israel's Parliament, where members of the Government, which is led by the rightist Likud party, expect a tough battle for approval.
The proposal to raise $450 million more in taxes from an already heavily taxed nation marks the Government's first real effort to extend the burden of paying for the massive influx of Soviet Jews to the Israeli public. Until now Israel has sought funds mainly from Washington and from Jews across the world, particularly in the United States. 
The plan proposes to raise the money through several new taxes, including a 16 percent value-added tax on fruits and vegetables; taxes of 20 percent on nearly all types of savings accounts, pension plans, and life insurance; a 20 percent tax on corporate stock-market profits, and a 16 percent tax on the tourism industry.
 
A Heavily Taxed Nation
Sales taxes on beer and cigarettes will be increased.
Even if all of the provisions were adopted, the new revenue would only provide a fraction of the money needed to build houses, create jobs, educate and otherwise absorb the hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants expected here in the next year or so. The Government has estimated the cost of absorbing what some predict could be as many as 500,000 immigrants at $30 billion.
Israel is already one of the most heavily taxed nations in the world. Israelis like electronic goods and cars are subject to staggering taxes of up to 250 percent.
The average income for a family of four is $16,800 a year, but income taxes can range up to 45 percent. There is even a ''travel tax,'' a $120 tariff that Israelis must pay to leave the country.
The economic package also proposes to liberalize Israel's restrictive capital and foreign-currency markets to stimulate private investment and create more jobs. A key measure calls for lowering the minimum wage from its present level of $490 a month by an as yet unspecified amount.
 
Opening Markets
Another provision would eliminate some import restrictions and open the country's markets to nations that do not have trade agreements with Israel.
Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai, the author of the economic plan, hopes the changes will inject $40 billion into the economy by 1995 and create thousands of jobs, primarily for Soviet immigrants.
Israel's unemployment rate is 10 percent, and inflation is currently rising by an annual rate of 20 percent.
The proposals do not envisage any cuts in Israel's defense budget. Nor does the plan reduce Government subsidies on basic foodstuffs, or impose taxes on Government stipends for children or add fees for health care or education.
Mr. Modai had barely finished announcing that the economic plan was approved before a Likud colleague, Tourism Minister Gideon Patt, began what may ultimately become a bitter fight in Parliament over the taxes.
''I don't know what will come out of this subcommittee but I can assure you of one thing, it won't be a 16 percent tax on tourism,'' Mr. Patt said.
Labor Party officials also criticized the plan. The party leader, Shimon Peres, accused the Cabinet of speaking in two voices on the tax on fruit and vegetables. He said that agreement on the economic package should be sought from the trade union federation and from industrialists.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Oil Deal With Iraq Denied in Iran, But Private Executives Confirm It

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 13

 BODY:
An Iranian daily newspaper known to reflect the views of the Iranian Foreign Ministry today denied reports that Iran had agreed to take oil from Iraq to use in its own refineries.
But American, Arab and Iranian oil executives, confirming reports Wednesday, asserted that an agreement had been negotiated between the two countries in which Iran would help break the United Nations embargo of Iraq by taking about 200,000 barrels a day of Iraqi crude oil and some refined products like fuel oil and naphtha, which Iran used to import.
The Teheran Times, an English-language daily, today quoted what it described as an ''informed source'' who said the Wednesday reports of the Iran-Iraq oil deal were ''totally baseless.'' 
 
'Kept Its Options Open'
The newspaper said the Iranian Government had not decided whether to supply its blockaded neighbor with essential food and medicine, even though Iranian officials were quoted earlier by other Iranian dailies as saying they would do so.
''The Government has kept its options open on that,'' the paper, which is close to aides of President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, asserted today.
But American, Arab and Iranian oil executives who live in Western Europe and the gulf region said in interviews today that Iran and Iraq had discussed details of a plan that would lead to the delivery of some 200,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq to Iran. They said the oil would be moved by barges to Abadan in Iran across the Shatt al Arab, the narrow estuary that divides Iran and Iraq, and to Ahwaz by road.
 
'It's a Done Deal'
The oil executives said Iraq made the offer in talks in Teheran that included Foreign Ministry and Oil Ministry officials on Sunday and Monday.
''It's a done deal,'' said a chief executive of an American oil company that handles substantial Middle East oil sales. ''They will provide the oil by barges and trucks to be fed into Iranian refineries.''
The executive said that he was not sure when the shipments would begin. He said the deal meant that although Iraq would sell some of its oil, all the Iraqi oil would be used internally in Iran and no Iraqi crude oil would surface on world oil markets, Arab oil executives in the gulf region said the plan presumed that the oil going to Ababan would be fed into the Abadan refinery, which can process some 130,000 barrels a day.
 
Trucks From Recent War
One Iranian oil executive in Western Europe confirmed that Iranian officials had consulted him on these arrangements with Iraq.
He said some Iraqi oil would be trucked to Ahwaz overland. From 1980 to 1988, when Iraq and Iran were at war, Baghdad developed a large fleet of trucks to carry some 200,000 barrels daily to be shipped from the port of Aqaba in Jordan. The fleet, the oil executives say, can easily be reactivated and expanded.
The Iranian executive said the deal was seen in Iran as a ''small and symbolic'' gesture primarily aimed at ''encouraging'' Iraqi dependence on Iran. He said there were discussions of expanding the deal eventually, but that this would require the linking of Iraqi and Iranian pipelines near Ahwaz.
The American chief executive said Iraqi officials had told him they hoped to raise exports to Iran to as much as 600,000 barrels a day, however.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Jordan Port Falls Still And Its Leaders Seethe

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AQABA, Jordan, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The streets seem virtually deserted, the hotels are empty, most of the port structures lie still and more than 80 percent of the 11,000-strong tractor-trailor fleet sits parked and silent.
Aqaba, Jordan's only port, seems almost a ghost town today, a victim, depending on whom you ask, of Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait or of American gunboat diplomacy.
''Aqaba is the lifeline for Jordan, and now we are almost at a standstill,'' said Bassam E. Kakish, a retired general who is chairman of the Aqaba Regional Authority. ''For God's sake, before we strangle here, tell your people to take your armies back. Go home and leave us alone!'' 
Aqaba, a somnolent little port town for decades, doubled in size as it grew wealthy on all the money earned from shipping mountains of arms to Iraq starting in 1981, after Iraq's only port was blocked in the war with Iran.
 
Town Is Transformed
At the height of that war, 60 or 70 ships sat in the harbor every day, and the ripple effect through the economy brought on by all that shipping transformed the town.
The port more than doubled its installations and work force so that 5,000 people worked there, until last month. Business blossomed for gas station owners, mechanics and tire salesmen serving the fleets of trucks shipping goods to Iraq.
Aqaba's population boomed too, from 22,000 10 years ago to 45,000 just before the gulf crisis began. Next to the ancient Arab village, a new town sprouted up - dozens of clean white apartment buildings that housed thousands of Egyptian workers and others.
But most of those itinerant workers have now gone home. The town seems a hollow shell of its former self, and it leaders seethe with resentment.
The director of the Aqaba Customs Authority, Ahmed Haayari, raised no eyebrows among six other local leaders in the room this afternoon when he said, ''This is the jihad,'' the holy war. He added, ''I hope I will be given the honor of fighting Americans in the desert and be killed there. That would be my honor.''
 
Only 3 Ships in Port
Three ships were in the harbor today, when before, Mr. Kakish said, the daily average was 20. The American naval blockade in the Red Sea, put in place when it became clear that Jordan was not enforcing the United Nations sanctions against Iraq, has cut off most of the shipments bound not just for Iraq but for Jordan, too, he asserted.
''Jordan is a small country, 85 percent desert,'' he said. ''We don't have many ships just for Jordan. We can't fill them up. So some of our goods are put on other ships with goods for other countries, including Iraq. And now those goods are being turned away.''
A local woman said: ''We can't get chicken here anymore. All of it was imported, frozen, from Europe.''
Still, even with the shipping business almost at a standstill, local diplomats report that a trickle of trucking freight still trundles up the road, though it is not clear how how much cargo is bound for elsewhere in Jordan and how much is to be slipped through the blockade.
While the shipping business has been sharply curtailed, the town's tourism business is in suspension. Because of the fear of war, the tourists who came here at the rate of 20,000 a month during the season last year have gone to other destinations.
''They don't come mostly because they are scared, scared there will be a war between America and Iraq, and Israel is so close by, too,'' said Habab al-Wahhab, manager of the largest restaurant in town, Ali Baba.
 
Tourism Dries Up
Most tourists came from Europe, and they choose Aqaba or the neighboring Israeli town of Eilat for the beaches, sunshine and warm weather. The season here runs from about Sept. 1 until the end of April.
Last September, Mr. Wahab said, ''you had to wait two hours to get a table here for lunch.'' Today, he had to turn on the lights in the restaurant's largest dining room when visitors requested a table.
''Last month, we had 14 waiters,'' he said. ''Now we've laid off all but 3.''
Six large resort hotels line the beach, Jordan's only waterfront. Two have already closed and laid off their staffs.
At one of those still open, the 152-room Alcazar, the owner, William Sawalha, sat by the empty swimming pool this afternoon. Asked how many rooms were filled during this week,the second of the tourist season, Mr. Sawalha's wife, Jill, thought for a moment and said, ''We have three guests.''
Her husband shook his head as he corrected her. ''No,'' he said. ''They checked out. We're empty.''

HEADLINE: Capital Gains Issue Blocks Budget Talks

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept 13

 BODY:
Under mounting pressure to conclude an agreement on cutting $50 billion from next year's Federal deficit, White House and Congressional budget negotiators remained at loggerheads today over the issue that has dogged them for the past four months: reducing the tax rate for capital gains.
Documents made available to reporters late today showed that the latest Republican proposal on taxes includes tax breaks for business, including oil and gas producers, as well as the capital gains tax reduction. These tax cuts would be offset by limits on the deductibility of state and local income taxes. Lawmakers assert such limits would disproportionately hurt states like New York and California, which rely heavily on their income taxes to finance a variety of programs. 
The Republican proposal also calls for increases in taxes on beer, wine, gasoline and other petroleum products, among other measures.
According to the Congress's bipartisan Joint Committee on Tax, the net effect of the Republican tax proposal would be tax increases for Americans with incomes under $50,000 while those with incomes above $50,000 would receive tax cuts. The committee said Americans with incomes over $200,000 a year would receive a tax cut totaling $7.4 billion in the first year.
The latest proposal by Democrats included a 20 percent surtax on the income taxes paid by people with incomes of more than $500,000 a year, The Associated Press reported. It would also double the taxes on beer and wine, as well as increasing the levy on distilled spirits. Also citing estimates by the Joint Committee on Tax, The Associated Press said the Democratic offer would lower by $4 billion the taxes paid by people with incomes below $20,000, while boosting them by $26.8 billion for everyone else.
But a senior Republican Congressional aide monitoring the talks said last night that news accounts appeared to be describing a Republican plan offered several days ago and complained that ''its release and distortion'' was a serious breach of ''the good will that had been developed in the sessions.''
With some elements of the deficit package at least tentatively agreed to, participants in the talks said the central issue dividing the negotiators was the demand by Republicans for reducing the gains rate and insistence from Democrats that such a cut be accompanied by an increase in taxes for the wealthy.
 
'Republicans Didn't Bite'
Democrats have said they would drop their demand for a tax increase on upper income Americans if Republicans would forgo the capital gains cut, but as one participant put it, ''the Republicans didn't bite.''
During today's session, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, argued that all the deficit reduction measures contemplated by negotiators would be a drag an already weak economy and that cutting the capital gains tax rate would provide a stimulus by generating new jobs and investment.
Democrats countered that measures like higher excise taxes on gasoline and cuts in Federal benefit programs would strike hardest at low- and middle-income Americans and that the wealthy should bear their fair share with an increase in income taxes.
Congressional tax experts have said that 90 percent of the direct benefits from reducing the capital gains tax would go to the wealthiest 10 percent of taxpayers.
The negotiators, who have been meeting at Andrews Air Force Base just outside Washington, are now in their seventh day of bargaining. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington told reporters that it was quite possible that the talks could go through the weekend.
Delays in reaching an agreement have already taken a toll at the Capitol, where Congressional leaders have been forced to postpone votes on major legislation to accommodate the negotiators' schedules. As word of some spending cuts under consideration, particularly those involving the Medicare program, filtered back to Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties began to protest.
Mr. Foley got a taste of the backlash this morning in a stormy meeting with leading members who told him they would not accept some premium increases and benefit reductions being contemplated for the health program for the elderly.
With Republicans arguing equally vehemently that the elderly should not bear what Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called ''an unconscionable burden,'' there were signs that the budget negotiators were considering a change.
 
Backing Off on Medicare
Officials involved with the talks said the negotiators had scaled back their proposals for cuts in Medicare and were rapidly backing away from a suggestion to link benefits to income levels.
Democrats who are not participating in the talks said they had been assured by their colleagues on the negotiating team that no proposals for a link between benefits and income had been accepted. But officials said Democrats have agreed to support a lifting of the wage cap for payroll taxes that finance a portion of the program.
A payroll tax of 1.45 percent on the first $51,300 of workers' income pays for Medicare coverage of the cost of hospital stays. The other part of Medicare, which covers doctors' fees, is financed partly by premiums paid by beneficiaries, but the bulk of the costs are paid by the Federal Government.
Some 33 million elderly and disabled Americans are covered by the Mediare program, which is expected to cost the Federal Government an estimated $105 billion this year.
The negotiators are aiming for a package that would cut $500 billion from the Federal deficit over five years, but they have yet to agree on a new and tougher rules for enforcing the future year spending cuts. Republicans have insisted that even if a compromise was reached on all spending cuts and tax increases in the package, no deal would be final without stiff enforcement rules.

HEADLINE: Iran's Dangerous Game

 BODY:
Beneath its spiritual leader's call for a holy war against a permanent American presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is playing power politics, crude and simple. Eyeing the conflict between Iraq and the United States, Teheran's two bitterest enemies, Iranian leaders may be wishing for it to last as long as possible. To give the beleaguered Saddam Hussein more breathing space, Iranians have signaled they will provide food and medicine to Iraq. There are also reports, as yet unacknowledged, that Teheran has agreed to accept Iraqi oil. What should the United States do? 
The best response now is to keep cool, especially since Western influence is quite limited anyway. A minor breach of the sanctions, as Iran seems to have in mind, will be undesirable but not decisive. If Teheran's hope is to auction off its favors between Washington and Baghdad, Washington should not bid, since to do so will only increase Iran's leverage. Better to stand aside and let the ayatollahs risk the opprobrium and other inconveniences their opportunism may invite both at home and abroad.
So far Iran has taken only one overt step, the restoration of diplomatic ties with Iraq. However, oil company executives maintain that Teheran has agreed to exchange 200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day for food and medicine. Both acts would violate U.N. sanctions. But provided they stay at the reported scale, not much harm to the embargo is likely.
If Iran and Iraq were to link their pipelines and expand the oil flow, that would open a very serious breach in the sanctions. But the danger is not immediate. Building pipeline connections takes time, and in any case Iran has not indicated an intent to wreck the embargo altogether.
Iran's goals are probably more limited. It still seeks Iraq's ouster from Kuwait. The Ayatollah Khamenei's call for a holy war seems directed against a permanent American presence in the gulf, not the present deployment.
A violation of the embargo on a larger scale would put at risk Iran's hope of European help in its reconstruction. Even though Iran is now less dependent on Western favor, with the doubling in the price of oil and its victorious peace with Iraq, the ayatollahs might still hesitate to burn their bridges by giving all-out support to Saddam Hussein. Such a policy also might be hard to explain at home, since 500,000 Iranians perished in Ayatollah Khomeini's drive to overthrow the Iraqi leader.
Iran has considerable ability to prolong the crisis with small, covert breaches of the embargo. But its leaders must recognize they are playing with fire. The longer the crisis lasts, the more room for miscalculation and catastrophe.
The ayatollahs certainly savor the thought of Saddam Hussein being crushed by American troops and the United States embroiled with the Arab world. But surely they must realize that any short-term gains in helping Iraq will destroy what seemed to be their long-term policy of re-establishing ties with the West.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
The Damascus Road

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis; Anthony Lewis's column will now appear on Mondays and Fridays.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Secretary of State Baker's visit to Damascus points to an important political byproduct of the Persian Gulf crisis. Syria is emerging from isolation to become a key diplomatic player in the region.
President Hafez al-Assad may even be ready to play a central role in a new effort to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict. Top Israeli officials think that is a real possibility. 
Given recent history, all that may seem eye-rubbing stuff. Syria has stayed aloof from the various initiatives for Arab-Israeli peace, for years taking a rejectionist line. It excoriated President Sadat for making peace with Israel and dismissed as useless the Bush Administration's effort to get talks going between Israel and Palestinians.
Moreover, President Assad has been ruthless in putting down dissent at home, and the United States has linked his Government to terrorism. A recent State Department report said that Syria's record had improved but that it still gave ''support and safe haven to a number of groups'' engaging in terrorist acts.
For those reasons, no one can operate on the assumption that Mr. Assad is a nice chap. But he is a realist. That is the point that Israelis make in discussing him. Ambitious though he is, for his country and himself, he is not a megalomaniac like Saddam Hussein. He has an acute sense of limits.
Events have been pressing in on Syria over the last two years. The end of the Iran-Iraq war gave new freedom of action to Syria's principal enemy, Saddam Hussein. The end of the cold war brought sharp cuts in Soviet military aid to Syria. The economy deteriorated.
Even before Iraq gobbled up Kuwait, President Assad had begun adjusting to those realities. Concluding that he could not look to the Soviet Union for help in the event of war and that isolation was dangerous, he made overtures to the United States and Europe. And he repaired relations with Egypt.
When Iraq attacked Kuwait, Mr. Assad supported American diplomacy and joined the military effort against Iraq. Syria now has 4,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia and is sending an armored division with up to 10,000 more. Its contingent will be the largest after the American force.
If the world forces Iraq out of Kuwait, Syria could emerge with Egypt and Saudi Arabia as leading powers in Arab diplomacy. The U.S. Ambassador in Damascus, Edward P. Djerijian, told The Boston Globe this week that such a combination ''is potentially very promising for regional conflict resolution, and especially for the Arab-Israeli peace process.''
Prime Minister Shamir of Israel actually invited President Assad to talk peace this spring. The move got nowhere, dismissed as a gesture to distract attention from Mr. Shamir's sabotaging of the American plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks. But if the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved satisfactorily, the idea of finding a road to peace through Damascus will be taken seriously.
One thing that commends that possibility to Israel is the belief that President Assad keeps his bargains. He has meticulously carried out the 1974 disengagement agreement with Israel. There have been no incidents on the Golan Heights.
Would Syria really agree to talk with Israel after all these years of refusing? The answer, as best we can tell, is that President Assad would go with Jordanians and Palestinians to an ''international conference'' or to something under U.S.-Soviet sponsorship - and under such an umbrella would negotiate bilateral issues with Israel. He wants the umbrella to avoid the unilateralism charge that he made against Sadat.
Israel has been negative about an international conference. But the collaboration between Moscow and Washington on the Persian Gulf has made the idea of jointly sponsored peace talks acceptable to the Bush Administration and very possibly to Israel.
The premise of any talks would have to be United Nations Resolution 242: territory for peace. President Sadat went to Jerusalem only after getting a fair assurance that Israel would withdraw from Sinai in exchange for real peace. For President Assad, the issue is the Golan Heights.
Israel has said that security requires retaining the Golan Heights. But in the new world of Soviet-American entente, it is possible to imagine other security arrangements.
These are all visions. With a reasonable outcome in the gulf, they could become the real challenges of diplomacy.

HEADLINE: Housing Lag In Newark: After a Year, One House

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 13

 BODY:
In the year since Newark agreed to stop tearing down its dilapidated public housing projects until new housing could be found, none of the city's battered high-rise projects have been razed, but only one new subsidized town house has been built.
Under a court settlement signed Sept. 14, 1989, the Newark Housing Authority was also supposed to renovate some 1,600 apartments in the high-rise projects for families. The authority has renovated more than 1,300, but tenants say the work is shoddy, amounting to little more than cosmetics that cover but do not correct serious defects like broken windows, rusted bathtubs and barely functioning heating systems.
''They have been doing some things, but we need windows and we need heat before the winter'' said Pearl Cole, president of the tenants coaltion at Building 1 of Hayes Homes, a pockmarked complex of 10 high-rise buildings and barren grounds in the Central Ward, not far from Newark's downtown business district. 
 
Unforeseen Problems Cited
Housing Authority officials said they had tried to comply with the letter and the spirit of the court agreement. But they said unforseen problems, like finding that some building sites were contaminated, had hindered their efforts.
So far the authority has built a single modular town house in the Central Ward, but it is considered only a demonstration model of the type of low-rise housing that will go up to replace the high-rises.
Until the settlement was reached last year, Newark pursued one of the largest public housing demolition programs in the country. The city planned to tear down 39 of 46 high-rise buildings that, without exception, had deteriorated so badly they were considered unlivable. More than 30,000 people lived in Newark's public housing projects.
In 1987 the Housing Authority dynamited four buildings containing 800 apartments and was prepared to take down others when a coalition of housing advocates and public housing tenants challenged the plans in court.
With the assistance of a state mediator, the Housing Authority and the housing groups reached a settlement under which the demolition plans were scaled back to 1,506 apartments in 11 buildings, including all eight high-rises at the Christopher Columbus Homes alongside Route 280 in the North Ward.
The authority is bound to replace each of the 1,506 lost apartments with new ones, and it can proceed in stages only after construction of the replacements has begun.
The acting general counsel to the Housing Authority, Frank L. Armour, said a contract for the first 100 new town houses could be signed next month, with construction starting early next year. The authority is soliciting bids for 512 more.
Mr. Armour said that the construction could have begun sooner but that there were problems getting clear title to the land involved. In at least one instance, he said, the land was found to be contaminated with hazardous wastes that must be removed before work on the new houses can begin.
Mr. Armour said demolition of the Columbus projects could start before the end of this year.
 
Minimum Requirements Met
At a news conference Wednesday at the site where the four buildings were torn down in 1987, Victor DeLuca, a leader of the Newark Coalition for Low-Income Housing, faulted the Housing Authority for the construction delays. He said that by continuing to seek demolition contracts, the authority was not showing good faith.
But he said also that the renovation work seemed to have gone as promised and that an independent monitor had been hired to oversee the authority's work.
''So far they have met the minimum requirements of the settlement,'' Mr. DeLuca said.
But several tenants of Hayes Homes called the renovations slipshod. Laura Foster, a tenant for 15 years, said that her renovated apartment had new kitchen cabinets and new linoleum tile floors but that her stove barely worked, her bathtub was rusted and her toilet flushed only if she put her hand in the tank and pulled the flapper.
 
Expectations Not Met
''It wasn't nowhere near what they said it was going to be,'' she said.
In Geraldine Smith's apartment, also at Hayes Homes, the tub had a splotch of rust the size of a dinner plate, one of the old casement windows was broken, the bathroom door was missing its knob, and one side of the new kitchen cabinets was splashed with paint.
''I know they can't make the apartments like new, unless they tear them down and start over,'' Miss Smith said, ''but we expected better than this.''
Housing Authority officials said any problems would be corrected.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Says 'No New Taxes' Is Not an 'Absolute' Promise

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BROCTON, N.Y., Sept. 13

 BODY:
Issuing one of the more elastic versions of a ''no new taxes'' pledge, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that he planned to hold the line on tax increases next year but could not make an ''absolute'' promise because of uncertainty over the state's economy and the Federal budget.
Mr. Cuomo, who is running for re-election on a record that includes two successive years of some of the largest tax increases in the state's history, said that the increase in next year's budget would be well below the inflation rate because neither he nor the Legislature could find the revenues necessary to keep pace with inflation.
''We know that we can't do taxes, nor would we want to,'' Mr. Cuomo told reporters who traveled with him on a state airplane to Chautauqua County in the southwest corner of New York, where the Governor spoke to graduating inmates at a shock-incarceration prison. But asked if this was a formal pledge, Mr. Cuomo said, ''No,'' explaining that certain factors that went into the budget were beyond his control. 
His comments were immediately ridiculed by the Republicans who control the State Senate and by his Republican opponent, Pierre A. Rinfret, who described Mr. Cuomo as ''the biggest con artist in the state.''
 
Rinfret Sees Ploy
Mr. Rinfret, who has already promised both a spending freeze and no new taxes if he wins in November, suggested that Mr. Cuomo's comments were simply a ploy to distract attention from the tax increases over which he has already presided.
Governor Cuomo and legislative leaders, struggling against projected budget gaps that widened as the year wore on, agreed to about $1.8 billion in new tax revenues this spring, including deferral of a planned $400 million cut in personal-income taxes. That came on top of $1 billion in new taxes they adopted to close similar gaps in 1989.
With no political gain evident in dwelling on those accomplishments, Mr. Cuomo appeared intent today on trying to shift the focus to the upcoming budget struggle, which will not actually play out until well after the November election. He has already gone on the attack against the Republican leader of the Senate, Ralph J. Marino, whom he has berated for declining to guarantee that he will approve a budget no larger than whatever Mr. Cuomo proposes.
In a shouting match that ultimately proved wearying to even the most enthusiastic observers of the Capitol, Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans spent weeks this spring arguing over who was a bigger spender.
The Republicans noted that the $49.8 billion budget they finally approved was $1.5 billion less than what Mr. Cuomo had proposed in January, while Mr. Cuomo countered by saying that he wound up pushing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars less than the final budget once the state's worsening budget problems became clear.
Mr. Marino's spokesman, John McArdle, put little stock in Mr. Cuomo's comments today, saying that the Governor's ''actions will speak louder than his words.''
''We'll believe it when we see it,'' Mr. McArdle added.
The Governor's demi-pledge of no new taxes was echoed by the Speaker of the Democratic-controlled Assembly, Mel Miller, who said that he could not envision his house approving yet another package of new taxes.
 
Tough Approach to Budget
''I think we've run out of the bag of tricks,'' Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said. ''The whole approach to the budget is going to have to be a very tough one, and I think we're going to be in the unenviable position of saying we can't deal with all of the priorities out there.''
Mr. Cuomo declined to identify areas where he planned to cut spending, but he did rule put proposing any reductions in money for criminal justice or for drug or AIDS treatment.
Here in Brocton, near the shore of Lake Erie, Mr. Cuomo attended a graduation ceremony at the Lakeview Shock Incarceration Center for 43 inmates who chose a six-month paramilitary course as an alternative to a longer sentence in a traditional prison. Most inmates were originally sentenced on drug-related charges.
Strolling along prison pathways with names like Shock Street and Discipline Drive, and stopping in classrooms and a cafeteria, the Governor asked several prisoners about the program and whether it had been effective. These drew repeated answers of ''Sir, Yes Sir,'' and occasionally, elaboration, though much of Mr. Cuomo's direct dialogue with inmates was held out of earshot of reporters.
Later, as wives, parents and children of the graduating inmates looked on, Mr. Cuomo praised them for putting themselves through the boot camp-like rigors of the program and told them that with their graduation they would ''regain the freedom to make your own choices.''
Now, he added, ''you're good enough and tough enough to go all the way -the right way.''

HEADLINE: Ideas Compete On Paying For Officers

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Now that Mayor David N. Dinkins has pledged to hire unspecified thousands of additional police officers, he is besieged with conflicting advice from his own aides, the New York City Council, state officials, citizens groups and business leaders on how to pay for them.
The one point of agreement is that it will not be easy to find the $300 million to $500 million each year that the Mayor has said such an undertaking could cost, particularly when the city is facing a projected budget gap of at least $1 billion next year and must reach new labor settlements with its unionized workers, probably within weeks.
Those giving the Mayor advice have used the demand for new officers as a lever to lift their own pet causes, whether freezing labor costs for other workers, protecting homeowners from property-tax increases or saving the regional economy from anticompetitive, counterproductive taxes that would drive people and business profits away.
 
Tax Surcharges to Telethons
''There's no easy option,'' said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which has called a special meeting in about 10 days to discuss the issue. ''You're trying to balance the fact that you've already had some substantial tax increases in the city and state this year and the impact that has on economic development, with the clear need to address public safety.'' 
''The bottom line,'' Mr. Shelp said in a phone interview yesterday, ''is going to have to be some combination of revenue increases, but also cost-cutting and reallocation of priorities.''
There is no shortage of proposals. The City Council has suggested a package that would rely heavily on a 25-cent surcharge on state lottery tickets sold in New York City. Others have proposed surcharges on property taxes, income taxes or the cigarette tax to pay for law enforcement.
One leading law-enforcement figure, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said yesterday that some business executives had even approached him about having private corporations contribute enough money to the city to finance the hiring of 100 officers.
Others, including the comedian Jackie Mason, have suggested sponsoring telethons to raise money for the police.
But Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, said that with city tax revenues falling below projections and costs rising, hiring more officers would mean hard choices on ''what we're not going to do.''
''We should begin the dialogue about what to cut now,'' Mr. Proctor said. ''Otherwise we could be in the undesirable position of adding cops now, and a year from now, without agreement on priorities, we'll be canceling the cop classes we added.''
If hiring thousands of new officers led to layoffs or wage deferrals for other city workers, Mr. Dinkins would be in the position of rewarding a union that did not support him politically while hurting unions that did. He won office with heavy support from most municipal unions but lost the endorsement of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to Edward I. Koch in the Democratic primary. The police union was neutral in the general election.
Spending hundreds of millions of dollars for the police could also tie the Mayor's hands on other initiatives.
 
An Investment Strategy
The current city budget includes only enough money for an average 1.5 percent annual wage increase for city workers, a number the unions have said is unacceptable. Senior city officials have suggested financing wage increases of something like 5 percent by diversifying union pension fund investments to earn higher rates of return. That could allow the city to reduce its annual contributions to the funds and use the difference for raises.
But now, one senior city official said, some business executives have suggested using such money to hire officers instead. That might be difficult, since changing the investment policy requires support from the union representatives on the pension boards, and they might not support the idea if their workers did not benefit.
On the surface, it may seem hard to understand how a city with a budget of $28 billion and a work force of a quarter million people cannot easily afford to hire police officers. Each new officer would cost about $60,000 a year, including benefits. But additional money would be needed to hire more prosecutors, Legal Aid lawyers, jail guards and probation officers to handle the additional arrests the officers would make.
Further, about 70 cents of each dollar in city revenues is effectively spoken for by the time it arrives. That money handles the existing workload and pay for employees either mandated by law or considered essential, like social service caseworkers and jail guards. And with the city economy stagnant, achieving growth in one city program is difficult without trims in another.
''We're essentially in the position of a very large business that has its revenues dropping and is unable to raise prices,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation. He argues that significant increases in the size of the municipal workforce and in its salaries in recent years did not lead to marked improvements in services. But better management, he suggests, might wring out improvements, even if new police hiring forced cuts in the workforce elsewhere.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a group financed by businesses, said the city should not hire more officers until it deploys the ones it has more efficiently, in more one-officer patrol cars, for example. But if more officers are to be hired, he said, ''I personally think the best way to do it is an across-the-board increase in the property tax.''
''It's a very straightforward approach that says if it works, then homeowners have an opportunity to praise the politicians who wanted to add the cops,'' Mr. Horton said. ''And if it doesn't work, then homeowners have an opportunity to vote them out of office.''

HEADLINE: Labor Talks Are Stalled As Post Deadline Nears

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The New York Post's negotiations with its three principal unions were stalled yesterday, and only hours remain before the deadline set by the paper's owner for closing it.
The Post has been losing money for years and its owner, Peter S. Kalikow, has said tomorrow's issue will be the last unless the paper's nine unions agree to $18.5 million in wage and benefit concessions by 8 P.M. today.
Union leaders say the paper's smaller unions are prepared to make the concessions demanded by Mr. Kalikow. Late yesterday Mr. Kalikow's representatives reached a settlement with New York Mailers Union Local 6, whose president is George E. McDonald, who is president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the newspaper unions' umbrella organization. 
But representatives of the drivers, pressmen and the Newspaper Guild, which includes news and advertising employees, have been unable to reach an agreement with Mr. Kalikow's representatives.
 
Cuomo Is Asked for Help
''I think it's touch and go,'' said Theodore W. Kheel, a lawyer who acts as an unpaid adviser to the unions.
Mr. Kalikow said he had asked Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for help in resolving the crisis, and the Governor has dispatched his Labor Commissioner, Thomas F. Hartnett, to participate in the negotiations today.
But Mr. Kalikow has declined union proposals that would result in savings smaller than he has demanded and has remained firm in his insistence that he must have concessions that will allow The Post to break even. ''It's not a victory to go from losing $20 million to losing $5 million,'' Mr. Kalikow said.
Union leaders and Mr. Kalikow were united yesterday in strongly criticizing The New York Times and The Daily News for what both described as damaging interference in the negotiations.
On Tuesday, The News asserted that its contract with the Guild would entitle the paper to any concessions given The Post under what is known in labor parlance as a ''me too'' clause.
On Wednesday, The Times said it ''would seek to gain concessions as well'' to the extent that they were related to the same adverse economic conditions affecting The Post and The News. The Times has declined to say whether it considers its contracts to have a me-too provision but has made a point not to cite such a provision as the basis for seeking concessions.
Union leaders have said that neither paper would be legally entitled to concessions granted The Post. They note that The News terminated its contract with the Guild earlier this year as a negotiating tactic and that The Times has contracts with no me-too provision that do not expire until 1993.
Mr. McDonald and Mr. Kheel said yesterday that even raising the question has made union leaders far more reluctant to grant the Post concessions.
Mr. Kheel said that the papers appeared to have acted in concert to scuttle the negotiations and that there might be criminal and civil liabilities if they were found to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Mr. Kalikow issued a statement saying The Times and The News were trying to ''ride on the back'' of The Post's negotiations and may have broken the law by interfering in them.
A spokesman for The News, John T. Sloan, said such ''false and irresponsible charges'' were the result of the ''stress of current labor negotiations.''
A Times spokesman, William Adler, said The Times would not respond to the assertions.
Even without such complications, The Post's negotiations are proving difficult for the three principal unions, each of which has a somewhat different problem.
 
A Stumbling Block
For the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York, which represents The Post's drivers, the fundamental stumbling block is the magnitude of Mr. Kalikow's demands. The Post has asked for $8.5 million in concessions from the drivers' union, or almost half of the total.
The Guild, which has been asked for $5 million, has objected to The Post's insistence that almost all the concessions take the form of lower wages and longer hours rather than layoffs, which would be based on seniority. The Post has said that to operate effectively, it must retain the younger and lower-paid employees whom a layoff would remove, but Guild leaders have said the deep wage cut for everyone is unacceptable. The Guild broke off talks yesterday, but, at Mr. McDonald's behest, agreed to resume negotiations today.
The New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union Local 2, representing the pressmen at The Post, has been asked for $2.7 million in concessions and is concerned particularly that cuts in manning for the paper's presses might damage the union's future negotiating posture with The Times and The News, which have similar presses.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says It May Tap Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration, confronting what it believes will be the maximum risk of an oil shortage over the next several weeks, seemed less confident today that it could avoid drawing on the nation's strategic reserve, a move that would almost certainly push prices down as the additional oil is auctioned into the market.
''We view the current market as relatively stable, but uncertain about future supply,'' Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told a Senate panel today. ''Should the situation warrant it, we are prepared to implement a coordinated drawdown of the more than one billion barrels in strategic stocks'' held by the United States and other members of the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group whose member countries have agreed to build stocks and to share oil in a crisis.
 
Calculating the Shortage
Secretary Watkins insisted that the United States would not move unilaterally without the agreement of the agency, which is scheduled to meet in two weeks. The world will have an average of 3.5 million barrels of oil a day less this month than it had before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August, which could produce a shortage. 
But as more and more countries increase their production, this shortfall is expected to contract to less than two million barrels a day in October and to a million or less by March.
Secretary Watkins cut short his appearance before the Senate Energy Committee to fly to Boston to announce the introduction of a public service campaign before a convention of the National Association of Broadcasters, which is being enlisted to promote it. [Page D6.] Setting the Conditions The Administration has repeatedly contended that the reserve should be tapped only in the case of shortages, resisting the pleas of those including Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who believe it should be tapped immediately to counter price increases. The reserve, the filling of which stopped shortly after the invasion of Kuwait to keep as much supply as possible in the markets, cannot be turned on and off, officials said.
At the same time, the Administration reaffirmed its opposition to a bill that would force auto makers to raise fuel economy in their fleets by an additional 40 percent over the decade to 40.2 miles a gallon by 2001.
Supporters of that measure, promoted by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, complained that this showed that the Bush Administration had yet to get serious about energy conservation despite the urgency implicit in the President's address on the Persian Gulf situation Tuesday night.
''I am clearly disappointed,'' said William A. Nitze, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a coalition of business, government, environmental and consumer leaders seeking improved energy efficiency. He referred both to the continued opposition to the Bryan bill and to a package of conservation and supply-enhancing measures disclosed by the Administration today.
The new measures, supplementing a list put forward in mid-August, consist mainly of hortatory items to reduce demand and raise supplies.
The initiatives are aimed at saving an estimated 530,000 barrels a day by the end of 1991. They include saving an estimated 120,000 barrels from ''better driving techniques;'' 90,000 from car-pooling, 75,000 from more efficient utility and industrial use and 50,000 each from proper tire inflation, use of lower octane gasoline and compliance with speed limits. Previously, the Administration had projected savings of 100,000 if tires were inflated to manufacturer's specification.
The supply-enhancing measures, totaling a hoped-for 607,000 barrels a day by the end of this year include 200,000 barrels a day of additional production from Alaska and various other efforts involving the extraction of heavy oil, state authorizations for faster pumping of wells, fuel switching, gasohol use and tax incentives.
Another critic, Edwin S. Rothschild, director of energy policy for Citizen Action, complained that the Administration is giving ''lip service to conservation but policy initiatives to production.''
In testimony today, Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said he was not sure what Mr. Bush meant Tuesday night in asking Congress to pass conservation measures since those announced by the Administration today required no such approval from Congress.
After the Administration abandoned its longstanding opposition to expanding the reserve, House and Senate conferees agreed late Wednesday - and the House passed overwhelmingly today - a bill to expand the reserve to a billion barrels. The reserve, currently authorized to rise to 750 million barrels, now holds 590 million barrels at a half-dozen sites along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas.
Mr. Moore said the Administration's opposition to expansion had become politically futile but that it had not changed its view that a larger reserve would not provide enough additional security to be worth its cost.
 
Refined Products Added
The bill increasing the reserve also requires that 10 percent of the reserve, now confined to crude oil, consist of refined products like gasoline.
This reflected doubts, shared by the Administration, about the industry's ability to process crude that might be drawn from the existing reserve, much of which is high-sulfur ''sour'' Mexican oil, which few refineries can handle. Moreover, much of the new crude coming on line to replace Iraqi and Kuwait oil is of relatively low quality. ''We are very concerned about the ability of refiners to continue operating at near maximum capacity for an extended period,'' Mr. Watkins said today.
Yet another provision of the bill authorizes the Administration to conduct a major test of the existing reserve, drawing up to five million barrels to make sure the reserve can be tapped smoothly at high rates for sustained periods.
The Administration called today's list of initiatives, most of which have been informally discussed before, ''medium-term'' measures that can be put in place pending its much-heralded 18-month effort to fashion a long-term national energy strategy to be completed this winter.
 
Use of Ethanol Ordered
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13 (AP) -All Agriculture Department employees have been ordered to use ethanol blends of gasoline in Government vehicles, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter said today, if the fuels are available at prices competitive with those of regular unleaded gasoline. In many locations, including Washington, they are scarce.
''Ethanol is produced from American corn and other agricultural products, and that's good for American farmers,'' Mr. Yeutter said, adding that it also helps reduce dependence on foreign oil.

HEADLINE: The Mileage Debate;
Some Say a Tax Increase Is Cheaper Than Putting Cars on a Stricter Diet

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
With the Middle East conflict pushing gasoline prices higher, the Senate is debating today a bill that would require a 40 percent improvement during the next decade in the fuel efficiency of cars sold in America. To its supporters, the issue is simple: if oil from the Persian Gulf is worth the risk of American lives, auto makers can surely be asked to produce cars that consume as little oil as possible.
But to many economists, the bill by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Nevada Democrat, is dismaying evidence of Washington's predilection for regulation over market-based incentives. The energy-security benefits of higher mileage standards might be worth the price, they concede. But they insist there is an easier, cheaper and safer alternative - taxing fuel at the pump. 
This is not the first time Congress has wrestled with the issue of squeezing more mileage out of America's auto fleet. Fuel economy standards, imposed in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo, required auto makers to double the average fuel efficiency of their cars to 27.5 miles a gallon by 1985.
 
Fulfilling a Demand
In the early years, said Robert W. Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institution, Congress was pushing on an open door: higher gasoline prices led consumers to demand the fuel-efficient cars called for by the corporate average fuel efficiency, or CAFE, standards.
But by the mid-1980's, Mr. Crandall notes, the real cost of gasoline had fallen to pre-embargo levels and the efficiency standard began to bind. A variety of measures were used to improve mileage, ranging from increasing the use of smaller turbocharged engines to decreasing aerodynamic drag. But much of the improvement, which saved billions of gallons of gasoline in the last few years, came from downsizing - selling smaller, lighter cars. By the 1989 model year, he estimates, manufacturers were meeting the requirements by paring the average weight of their cars by about 500 pounds.
Today, proponents of the Bryan bill argue that improved mileage would not burden drivers. Marc Ledbetter, an analyst for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said the higher sticker prices of comfortable, peppy cars that attain 40 miles a gallon would be more than offset by the savings on $1.30-a-gallon gasoline.
But that judgment, based on estimates of how much mileage could be improved with off-the-shelf technology, and at what cost, is vehemently disputed by every auto maker.
Carmine Defiglio, an expert at the Energy Department, ends up somewhere in the middle. At current gasoline prices, he says, a technological fix would pay for itself in savings on gasoline up to the 34-miles-a-gallon level.
Charles Lave, an economist at the University of California at Irvine, suggests that the auto makers might do better. ''CAFE standards,'' he said, ''increase the incentive to look for new cost-effective technologies.''
 
Paying Extra
But the prospect for such ''technology-forcing'' is a matter of speculation. It is likely that consumers would have to pay extra for fuel efficiency or accept smaller, less powerful cars.
Economists try to finesse judgments about how auto makers would meet fuel-efficiency requirements by extrapolating from the companies' past performance. Probably the most sophisticated such effort was made by Robert Leone of Boston University and Thomas Parkinson of the consulting firm of Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett. Their work was done with financing from auto importers, but it uses the same data and closely follows the reasoning of respected independent economists - notably Andrew Kleit of the Federal Trade Commission.
The Leone-Parkinson study concluded that a 40-mile-a-gallon standard would cost drivers about 15 cents for every gallon, even after accounting for the savings from using less fuel. The combined benefits of reduced dependence on imported energy and reduced pollution might indeed be worth 15 cents a gallon, Mr. Parkinson concedes. But the same savings in fuel, he argues, could be achieved at just one-fifth the cost by taxing gasoline.
 
Weighing the Factors
A gasoline tax would give all drivers an incentive to conserve fuel, he points out, while changes in the mileage standard would only change the fuel consumption of new cars. What is more, savings from higher mileage standards are partially self-canceling. For one thing, owners of more efficient cars tend to drive more because their cost per mile is less. For another, older cars that are less fuel efficient would remain in use longer because replacements are more expensive.
Yet another disadvantage of mileage standards, argue Mr. Crandall and John Graham, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health, is the probable deterioration in safety. Car makers, he points out, would, in part, adjust to higher standards by further downsizing. And smaller, lighter cars, even with comparable safety equipment, would inevitably be more dangerous. They estimate that CAFE-induced downsizing in the 1989 model cars will lead to an extra 2,220 to 3,900 highway fatalities and an extra 11,000 to 19,000 serious injuries.
Gasoline taxes would also tend to increase fatalities to the degree that consumers responded by driving smaller cars. But the impact on safety would certainly be far less because much of the fuel savings would come from changes in the use of older cars. ''If people drove less,'' points out John Meyer, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School, ''they would probably die less.''
By the same token, a gasoline tax would reduce pollution more than a mileage standard that reduced gasoline consumption by the same amount. Tougher mileage standards would keep older, dirtier cars in use longer. And because the price of gasoline would be lower, the total miles driven by cars of every vintage would be greater.
But for all their apparent superiority in saving gasoline, conservation taxes are far harder to sell politically than tougher mileage standards. And to Mr. Crandall, the reasons seem obvious: politicans - and perhaps voters - prefer the ''hidden tax'' imposed by expensive regulation.
Is it better to take a wasteful route to gasoline savings than not to save gasoline at all? Some economists, including Mr. Crandall, would take a hard line. But Charles Lave believes that the best cannot be allowed to be an enemy of the good: ''For what it is worth,'' he said, ''I'm for CAFE.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Free Trade Pact Pushed

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 13

 BODY:
President Bush, acting more swiftly than expected, will ask Congress next week for authority to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with Mexico, Administration officials said today. Though not the only reason, the Persian Gulf crisis was a factor in the decision, they said.
They also said Canada, already a free trade partner of the United States, was likely to participate, giving an accord hemispheric scope and clearing the way for common standards and trading rules in all three countries by the end of the century.
The integration of economies in North America would follow similar moves in Europe, as the European Community inches toward economic union. 
''Acting at this time is a way of telling Mexico that we're really serious,'' a senior Administration official said. In late August, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked the United States to open the talks.
 
Mexico's Oil Reserves
The Middle East crisis has focused the world's attention on global oil supplies. Mexico, with the eighth-largest reserves in the world, would be likely to attract more outside capital with a trade pact to help tap those reserves.
While the United States wants to work with Mexico on increasing oil production, another factor behind the speed-up, officials said, is a desire to accommodate President Salinas, who has seized on free trade to modernize the Mexican economy.
Mexico, which has already cut tariffs from 100 percent or more to less than 10 percent, sees an agreement with the United States attracting foreign capital that would spur modernization.
An economic basket case early in the last decade, Mexico, through deregulation and tax cuts as well as freer trade, has already reduced inflation and interest rates sharply and all but eliminated capital flight.
 
Cooperation in Energy
Bush Administration officials expect a trade agreement to intensify cooperation in the energy sector, for example, by increasing already robust sales of American oil equipment to Mexico.
One recent sign of cooperation was Mexico's pledge to lift overall oil exports by 100,000 barrels daily to help ease the current pressure on global supplies. Mexico exports about half of its 2.5 million barrels daily. The United States takes about 60 percent of the exports, Japan 15 percent and Europe most of the rest.
Far more controversial is the issue of American participation in Mexican oil and gas exploration, for 50 years the exclusive preserve of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex.
Because of political sensitivity about oil, many analysts consider it unlikely that international oil companies would be permitted to operate in Mexico.
''The political cost associated with accepting foreign investment in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry would be substantial,'' said Rafael G. Quijano, director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington energy consulting group.
Still Mr. Quijano, a former Pemex executive, suggested that ways might be found to get around the issue.
 
Foreign Investment Fund
One possible solution, he said, is a financial mechanism, like a trust fund established by foreign investors in a Mexican bank with which Mexican operators would carry out drilling activities.
Decisions on such issues are not likely to be taken before the Salinas Government tests its strength at the polls in 1991 midterm elections.
The Presidents of the United States and Mexico agreed in June to go forward with the pact, but the expectation then was that little progress would be made before yearend.
George W. Grayson, a Mexican oil expert at William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said that Mexico was producing about at capacity and that because of rising domestic use from its rapid industrialization, it badly needed to find new oil.
Immigration is another sensitive issue. Mexico had wanted to take up freer movement of workers as well as goods. Washington had warned that this could doom the talks and won its point. Immigration will not be negotiated, American officials said.
 
Immigration Issues
But immigration could be affected indirectly. If a free trade pact leads to a more prosperous Mexico, there will be less pressure on workers to come north.
Organized labor in the United States has already signaled its strong opposition to a free trade pact with Mexico. But most industry groups, seeing a large potential for exports, have come out in favor.
''Mexico is a wonderful potential market,'' said Colleen S. Morton, director of the United States Council of the Mexico-United States Business Committee. The council represents key American business groups.
If, as expected, Canada joins the talks, in return for greater access to Mexico, Canada would have to be willing to offer Mexico the same tariff cuts and privileged access to Canada as the United States offers.
The Administration's request to Congress starts a clock in which Congress has 60 legislative days, or at least four months, to determine whether such an agreement would be in the United States' interest.
If Congress gives its assent, which is considered likely, negotiations will probably continue until 1993, officials said. It took about 18 months for Canada and the United States to negotiate a free trade pact in the late 1980's. Though still controversial in Canada, that pact has been so successful that the two nations agreed recently to accelerate scheduled tariff cuts.
Mexico is the third-largest American trading partner after Canada and Japan. In 1989 two-way trade exceeded $51 billion. The United States is Mexico's primary export market.

HEADLINE: Early-Month Vehicle Sales Up by 2.5%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 13

 BODY:
Large rebates on many models drew buyers and lifted car sales above the trend for the year, as sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks increased 2.5 percent in early September over relatively weak sales a year ago. But sales of light trucks fell, a sign to some analysts that higher gasoline prices were beginning to take their toll.
Car sales increased 6.7 percent over last year's levels, a larger gain than many analysts had forecast. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 7.1 million, compared with 6.8 million in the period last year. Since January, cars have been selling at about a 6.6 million rate.
 
Not a 'Frothy Market'
''People are just buying up the remaining 1990 models, knowing that the manufacturers are offering big rebates on them and expecting higher prices on new 1991 models,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz in New York. ''We're not talking about a frothy market.''
Dealers said rebates had lifted showroom traffic. ''The sales comparisons are against a weak year-ago period,'' observed Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, ''but even so, I would say they look mighty good.''
Light-truck sales declined 4.4 percent in early September. Some analysts suggested that a sales slide that began in August indicates that consumers are beginning to shift away from less fuel-efficient pickups, mini-vans and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
''Trucks are this generation's gas guzzlers,'' Ms. Keller said, ''and I think we are seeing the effects now of higher gasoline prices and a weaker economy.''
The sales gains in early September were not shared by all 10 makers of vehicles in the United States. The General Motors Corporation reported an increase of 6.4 in car sales, to 70,697 units. But its light-truck sales fell 13.8 percent, to 33,655. The Chrysler Corporation continued to struggle, posting sales declines of 15.9 percent in cars, to 15,984, and 17 percent in light trucks, to 12,755, including Jeeps and mini-vans.
The Ford Motor Company sold 36,817 cars, unchanged from a year ago, despite a 13.9 percent increase in sales of its Escort subcompact, which has sold poorly since its introduction in April. The No. 2 auto maker posted strong sales of its light trucks, which increased 10.2 percent, led by the Explorer, a four-wheel-drive vehicle that has caught on quickly.
Among the Japanese auto makers, the Honda Motor Company reported its car sales increased 89.1 percent, to 10,234 units, while the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales rose 70.9 percent, to 3,277 units. Honda manufactures cars in Marysville, Ohio, and Toyota operates plants in Fremont, Calif. and Georgetown, Ky.
Over all, the Big Three lost ground in early September, as their share of the United States car market fell to 87.7 percent, from 92.8 percent a year ago. The Japanese transplants picked up more than 5 points of market share, growing to 12.3 percent of the domestic market for cars, compared with 7.2 percent in the period last year.
With labor contracts between the auto makers and their American and Canadian workers due to expire at midnight Friday, many dealers have taken precautions against a possible strike by building their inventories. Dealers who sell vehicles made by G.M., the strike target of the United Automobile Workers, increased their inventories to an average 73-day supply at the end of August, compared with a 58-day supply a year ago. Dealers of vehicles made by Ford, the strike target of the Canadian Automobile Workers, have raised their inventories to a 68-day supply, compared with a 63-day supply a year ago.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Turkey's Stake In Mideast Crisis

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

DATELINE: ANTALYA, Turkey

 BODY:
IN the midst of the Middle Eastern crisis, Turkey is struggling to maintain its strong support for the United States and the United Nations in their opposition to Iraq's aggression against Kuwait. But the Turkish President, Turgut Ozal, is under heavy pressure from other politicians and Turkish military commanders not to send troops to the Persian Gulf. The Turks are building up their forces along their border with Iraq.
Mr. Ozal has staked his presidency on his country's rapid economic development - which is threatened by the crisis. This year, Turkey's real rate of economic growth is expected to reach a record high of 10.04 percent, according to the forecasts of the State Institute of Statistics. 
Addressing the United Nations Development Conference here, President Ozal said the key element in sustained economic growth is the ''free interplay of market forces.'' He described the drastic measures Turkey had taken to ''transform an inward-looking economy into one which was to integrate with international markets.''
Historically, Mr. Ozal said, the main obstacle to Turkey's economic growth had been a shortage of foreign exchange. To overcome that, his Government took measures to stimulate private savings and adopted a liberal system to encourage foreign capital, aiming at ''export-led'' growth. Turkey has applied for membership in the European Community, but is being kept waiting by Germany and other countries that are loath to open their doors more widely to Turkish immigration.
The crisis in the gulf and the United Nations embargo against Iraqi oil, which Turkey has helped to enforce by shutting down the pipeline that carries Iraqi oil to its Mediterranean port of Yumurtalik, are putting renewed pressure on Turkey's inflation and balance of payments, which had moved into surplus and given Turkey $11 billion in foreign exchange reserves, its highest level ever.
So Turkey is seeking sizable financial assistance from the United States, Saudi Arabia and other countries to help it sustain the embargo against Iraq. Mesuf Yilmaz, a member of President Ozal's Motherland Party, who is expected to be Turkey's next Prime Minister, said in an interview that so far the cost of Turkey's ''quick and courageous decision to back the United States' stand'' had cost about $4 billion. He broke this figure down into four elements: $300 million in lost income from closing the pipeline; $1 billion for lost exports to Iraq; $500 million in lost transit trade through Turkey, and $2 billion from higher oil prices.
In addition, he said, payments had been suspended by Iraq on nearly $1 billion due on Turkish exports to Iraq, which were to be paid for by oil, together with $2 billion to Turkish construction companies on contracts for building the Vecma Dam near the Turkish border with Iraq.
Turkey is torn between its desire to improve its economic relations with the West as well as with the Arab countries. Mr. Yilmaz said Turkey's foreign policy was guided by the principle enunciated in the 1920's by Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey: ''Peace at home, peace abroad.'' That doctrine has led, he added, to Turkey's pursuit of ''a rather cautious foreign policy.''
Until 1965, Mr. Yilmaz said, ''our historical ties with the Arab countries were largely ignored, and became very distant.'' He added, ''But after the clash between Turks and Greeks over Cyprus, Turkey felt the obligation to improve its relations with the Arab countries; we became a member of the Islamic Conference.''
However, he said, in recent years, in its conflict with Bulgaria over the Turkish minority in that country, and its disputes with Greece, ''we did not get the support of the Arabs we expected and found this disappointing, and very recently we have faced conflict with Iraq and Syria over river water claims affected by the Ataturk Dam.''
Yet there is no consensus in Turkey about sending troops to the gulf. Far from it. Although Parliament has recently voted certain war powers to the President, Turkish politicians insist these are intended to be a deterrent to Iraqi aggression, not measures for war.
Mr. Yilmaz said: ''I have shared the opinion of President Ozal that Turkey should follow a more active policy to secure peace in its region, but have also considered it as my duty to warn the Government about the risks Turkey may be dealt. I don't think sending troops to the region will be meaningful.'' Turkish military leaders have also sought to restrain the President from sending troops to the gulf.
The present Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Bozer, said in an interview that he saw no big differences over Turkey's role. He named the main principles on which Turkey's policy is based: ''Be together with the West; Iraqi aggression has to be canceled; territorial integrity has to be restored in the region of Kuwait; territorial aggression has to be restored; apply United Nations resolutions without any exceptions, and avoid war.'' All these principles, he said, should be applied, but the main one is to maintain solidarity with the West.
That is the message President Ozal will be taking to President Bush when he visits Washington later this month. Political goals are reinforced by economic interests.

HEADLINE: Price of Oil Rises Amid Nervousness

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Persistent nervousness over the Middle East crisis and its effect on energy supplies pushed oil prices slightly higher yesterday.
Many investors hovered at the sidelines, unsure how long the standoff could last and unwilling to take on big positions amid such uncertainty, analysts said.
''It's really a market that people are afraid of,'' said Tom Bentz, director of trading for United Energy Inc. 
Crude oil for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 10 cents, to $31.07 a barrel, after swinging in a 60-cent range. That contract is now just 86 cents below its highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
 
A High for London Contract
In London, October futures for the world benchmark Brent blend reached a record contract high of $31.25 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. The exchange said it was the highest price since the contract began selling in 1988.
The nervous tone of the world's crude oil markets was underpinned by a steady stream of ominous statements about the Middle East crisis.
Iraq accused the United States of seeking an excuse to attack it and said it would hold President Bush responsible for any strike. And Washington has informed Baghdad that it knows pro-Iraqi terrorist groups are preparing to attack United States and allied targets, the Iraqi press agency reported.
''As time goes on, it seems more and more people think the only solution is some type of military action,'' said Craig Whitley, futures analyst at Booner & Moore in Houston. A crude oil price of ''$32 or $33 is not out of the question,'' he said.
Traders said they disbelieved Teheran's pledge that it would not break an economic embargo against Baghdad by swapping food and medicine for Iraqi oil.
Washington said there was no evidence that Iran or Romania had broken the embargo, but oil traders remained skeptical.
 
'I Wouldn't Count on Iran'
''I wouldn't count on Iran to abide by any United Nations embargo at all,'' one oil broker said.
Contracts for petroleum products were mixed as market players unraveled spreads, selling gasoline and buying heating oil, traders said.
The unleaded gasoline contract for October delivery fell 0.48 cent, to 93.36 cents a gallon.
Traders said gasoline prices were also under pressure from Wednesday's Energy Department inventory data, which showed stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week to Sept. 7. The American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday that gasoline inventories rose by 650,000 barrels.
Heating oil for delivery next month rose 0.89 cent, to 83.48 cents a gallon, on supply concerns ahead of winter, traders said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Narrowly Mixed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed in generally sluggish trading yesterday, despite a big drop in the value of the dollar, and interest rates for longer maturities rose slightly.
Dealers reported that a spurt of trading took place late in the morning, when reports of testimony before Congress by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, began to flash across news tickers and trading screens.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks, which included the suggestion that the Fed would react to a credible budget agreement by easing monetary policy, were seen as a mild positive for the credit markets. But the weakness in the dollar, a move spurred in large part by the Fed chairman's comments, prevented note and bond prices from moving much. 
''The big trade of the day was the dollar,'' one bond trader said. ''Treasuries have pretty much been back and forth.''
 
Foreign Accounts Unload
Prices moved higher immediately after Mr. Greenspan's comments. But market participants said that foreign accounts soon began to unload some positions, wiping out the earlier gains.
In addition to the dollar's weakness, analysts said auto sales for the first 10 days of September, which were reported yesterday, were disconcertingly strong. The Big Three manufacturers reported sales of around 7.1 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, a pace that does not suggest economic weakness.
''With the uncertainty in the Middle East and the rise in gasoline prices, a lot of people would have expected to see consumers move to the sidelines, yet you are not seeing that,'' said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.
Although the potential for a surprise always exists, analysts do not expect August reports due to be released this morning on the Producer Price Index and retail sales to shake interest rates out of the narrow trading range they have occupied since late August.
 
Braced for a Big Jump
Because of the sharp rise in oil prices, market participants are already braced for a big jump in the producer price figures. But a big rise in the index excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core inflation rate, would not be welcomed. Retail sales figures for last month are likely to be quite soft.
Bond traders said they did not expect anything conclusive from these reports. The market is focused on the Middle East and Federal budget negotiations, they said.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds were offered at a price of 97 30/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.94 percent, compared with 8.93 percent late Wednesday. Since late August yields on the benchmark issue have oscillated in a tight range of 9 percent and 8.90 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 5/8 in late trading, down 2/ 32, to yield 8.80 percent. Meanwhile, the 8 1/2 percent seven-year notes were offered at 99 2/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.68 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.99 percent.
 
Short-Term Rates
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.34 percent, down one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills fell by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.26 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the financially battered City of Philadelphia said yesterday that it had postponed a planned $375 million short-term note offering.
The offering, which will be used to help avert the city's looming insolvency, had to be pulled when a bank in Switzerland abruptly withdrew its plan late Wednesday to guarantee $50 million worth of the issue.
Investment bankers said it would take about a week before a reconstituted offering would be priced.
The largest offering in the municipal bond market yesterday was a competitive offering of $198 million worth of serial bonds from the State of Louisiana.
A bid from a group led by Lehman Brothers won the issue.
The securities, which carry maturities from 1991 to 2010, were reoffered to investors at yields from 6.10 percent in 1991 to 7.60 percent in 2010.
The Federal Reserve Board also reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose strongly during the week ended Aug. 27, but the report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
