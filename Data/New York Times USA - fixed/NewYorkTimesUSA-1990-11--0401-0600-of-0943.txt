The Law: A Difficult Year, But With Potential

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

 BODY:
After 20 years of nonstop growth, Manhattan's largest law firms are facing their toughest year in decades.
Largely because of the slump on Wall Street and the downturn in the financial-services industry, leading law firms are in creasingly dismissing lawyers -- a phenomenon virtually unknown until now.
And for the first time in years, there are jitters at law schools about whether jobs will be available -- especially at those firms that start new lawyers at $85,000 a year.
There are now more than 125,000 lawyers licensed in New York State and a majority of them do business in New York City.
Perhaps the best illustration of the industry's troubles is Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, Manhattan's largest firm, which hired away lawyers by the battalion from competitors. Skadden, Arps built a large national practice around its reputation as a premier Wall Street player. Now the firm has stopped hiring lawyers from other firms, frozen associates' pay at last year's levels and, some associates said, begun laying off dozens of junior lawyers.
 
The Boom in Bankruptcy
 Yet, there are some positive trends.
The law, more than most industries, finds profits in the hardships of the economy and is able to weather downturns somewhat better than other economic sectors. Litigation, for example, remains largely unaffected.
And bankruptcy practice, once disdained as a second-rate field relegated to has-beens and lower-rate practitioners, is now a hot practice and will likely remain so for some time. The larger bankruptcies, like those of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Eastern Airlines, require teams of lawyers to represent the companies, creditors and shareholders, and the cases can take years to resolve.
And, to the extent that large real estate developers like Donald J. Trump encounter significant difficulties, law firms can count on substantial business in attempting to keep their clients afloat.
Recognizing this, several leading firms, including Willkie, Farr & Gallagher; Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, and O'Melveny & Myers, have taken steps to bolster their bankruptcy practices.

Health Services: Medical Industry Is Still Flourishing

BYLINE: By Josh Barbanel

 BODY:
While some sectors of New York City's economy appear to be shrinking, health care remains an important growth industry, generating 7,000 new jobs a year and more than $1 billion in construction. Still, some economists say that despite this growth, there are ominous signs of decay.
One of every 12 private-sector jobs in New York City -- or a total of about 250,000 -- is in health services. These jobs have been increasing at a rate of about 3 percent a year, said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It has been one of the key growth engines of the economy throughout the 1980's," he added. "It continues to be the leading growth sector."
To Mr. Ehrenhalt, this job growth, financed in large part by government health insurance programs and insulated from the vagaries of the economy, has become a main source of employment for unskilled workers.
 
Problems Driving the Growth
 Others take a less sanguine view, pointing out, for example, that much of this growth has been driven by the city's worsening social and medical problems, including homelessness, drug addiction and AIDS. And the jobs are more likely to be for low-paid home health-care workers than for scientists.
"We don't have the kind of activity that is attracting future Nobel Prize winners," said Rae Rosen, an economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
Though New York City still ranks second, after Boston, in Federal medical research grants, it is losing ground, several studies indicate. "We are just being increasingly outbid by other parts of the country that can put together better facilities, better research and living conditions, and it really hurts the city," said William A. Polf, a deputy vice president for external affairs at Columbia University.
Still, one of every seven patients at the private hospitals is drawn from beyond the city limits by the promise of better medical care. A survey by U.S. News & World Report found that seven of America's best hospitals were in New York City, more than in any other city. And at least $1.1 billion in hospital construction is under way, with another $2 billion in work expected to begin in the next year or two.

Public Sector: Government Help, At Least for Now

BYLINE: By Richard Levine

 BODY:
Even in bad times, New York can count on prodigious public spending to help prop up its economy -- at least for a while.
Since the end of 1987, as industry after industry stumbled and private employment waned, jobs in govern ment rose by 23,000. That brought the total increase in government jobs for the 1980's to 95,000, or one of every four jobs created in the city's most prosperous decade since World War II. All of this increase was generated locally, because the small rise in the number of state workers was more than offset by a decline in Federal employment in the city.
No government can long continue to hire in the face of a declining economy, and Mayor David N. Dinkins said last week that he would eliminate about 5,000 positions this fiscal year and perhaps 20,000 more next year. But New York City still plans to spend nearly $4 billion a year on long-term projects, much of it on dilapidated public works.
In addition, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is spending huge sums. By 1992, it will have spent $16 billion in a 10-year effort to rehabilitate the commuter rail lines and the subways. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is spending $1 billion or so a year on its bridges, tunnels and airports. And the School Construction Authority will spend $4.3 billion over the next five years.
 
Powerful Stimulus for New York
 All this spending is a powerful stimulus even to an economy as big as New York's. The transportation authority's spending alone, for example, would keep more than 200,000 people employed for a year. And it is partially self-perpetuating, because it will generate $700 million in state and local taxes.
The drawback is that for decades, residents and businesses will be paying for this work in taxes and fees and fares. Mindful of the strain, the Citizens Budget Commission recommended somewhat regretfully that the city cut long-term spending, and the Dinkins administration has pushed back some projects and reduced others.
But Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority, said she believes that now is not the time to make large cuts in such spending, in part because it helps the economy but also because the work is necessary. "Everything needs patching and repairing," she said.

Banking: Many Questions About the Future

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
With their profits and stature at a low ebb, New York's largest banks are realizing that their size and traditions do not guarantee them a place at the top of the financial-services indus try in 10 years.
The banking industry prob ably faces more questions about its future than perhaps any other important segment of the New York City economy. Banking provides more than 170,000 jobs in the city, up by more than 10,000 in a decade. Still, banking employment has fallen by about 15,000 in the last three years.
Costly mistakes on loans to less-developed countries and real estate developers have so weakened the largest banks that they now lack the financial muscle to expand into new markets and businesses.
Still, demand for bank products is growing at a healthy rate, which is one reason why nonbanking companies like the General Electric Company have moved into areas like corporate lending and credit cards.
For now, the city's largest banks -- with the exception of J. P. Morgan & Company and the Bankers Trust Company -- are so strapped by bad loans that they are concentrating on cutting costs. But in the coming decade, bankers and analysts expect a wave of mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures.
 
Millions of Dollars in Savings
 The merger of any two big New York banks could raise their profits by hundreds of millions of dollars by eliminating duplicate branches, headquarters and executives.
Since Citibank, the nation's largest bank, has only about 15 percent of consumer accounts in the New York market, and Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover and Chase Manhattan, the next three, have a total share of only about 18 percent, some analysts see room for large-scale consolidation without any bank gaining monopoly power.
Thomas Labrecque, chairman of Chase Manhattan, said consolidiation need not be limited to banks. He noted that competitors like the mortgage unit of the General Motors Corporation often have lower costs. Chase would consider merging or creating joint ventures with such companies, he said.
Analysts are confident that a large banking industry will remain in New York City, but the organizations and even the names of banks are in question. The answers depend on whether banks are allowed and have the inclination to merge with each other or industrial companies, to develop nationwide branches, or to expand into securities and insurance.
New York City is likely to be headquarters for at least a few of the giant banks in the next generation, but many jobs will be elsewhere. A number of large banks already have credit-card operations in states like Delaware and South Dakota, where taxes and labor costs are lower.

The Media: Growing Trouble For the Networks

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

 BODY:
Network television is in a steep downturn that has led to forecasts of reduced profits and possible layoffs. Cable television, on the other hand, is doing fine.
And these trends are not good for New York City.
The three big television networks have always had their headquarters in Manhattan. Last year ABC, CBS and NBC employed about 12,000 people in New York and generated a total of $10.8 billion in corporate revenues.
The cable industry, by contrast, has important power bases in Denver, the home of the largest cable operator, Tele-Communications Inc., and in Atlanta, the home of Ted Turner's cable empire, though several important cable channels, including HBO and MTV, are based in New York City.
Network revenues grew by only 2.5 percent last year from 1988. That was less than half the annual growth rate of 5.7 percent from 1985 to 1989, according to the investment firm of Veronis, Suhler & Associates.
Some additional growth is expected this year, but several analysts predict a flat year at best in 1991. The following year, with the Olympics and a Presidential election, could bring a revival of advertising, they say.
"We are surely in a trough for the network business," said John Reidy, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
 
Problems for Publications
 The same advertising weakness is also affecting magazines and newspapers, which employ about 41,000 people in New York.
Several leading magazine publishers are based in New York, including the Time Inc. Magazine Company, Conde Nast and Hearst. In addition, The New York Times Company and Dow Jones & Company are based in Manhattan. All have been hurt by the advertising slump.
As a result, layoffs in the media industry seem to be likely. Mr. Reidy said layoffs were the only effective way to cut costs. But because the industry is so visible, he said, layoffs can create unfavorable publicity and contribute to the advertising slowdown.
Mitchell Moss, the director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said he thought the television networks could recover by becoming "idea exporters."
"What we do best here in New York is create ideas that are made into media products," he said. "The networks ought to be able to make television a global export."

Advertising: Too Many Ties To Walk Away

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
Like it or not, the advertising industry is stuck in New York City. As long as the city remains a mecca for the arts and the media, advertising will stay close by.
"We've looked at the possibility of moving the agency outside New York, and right now it just can't effectively be done," said Graham Phillips, the chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide. "The most creative people want to live in New York. They need the stimulus of things like the theater or simply the conversation at popular restaurants."
The New York anchor to the commercial-production industry also seems firmly in place. Because an advertising campaign can change many times before the final version is set, many advertising executives said, agencies still need to remain near production houses so alterations can be made quickly.
But while many production companies are still in New York, they are increasingly doing the filming in locations like Canada or Australia, where the work costs less.
Currently, half the people in advertising in the United States work at New York agencies. But the total number of people working in the industry in New York has declined to 39,000 from a peak of 41,800 in 1985.
The industry is in the midst of a slowdown. Many clients are cutting their budgets and the overall rate of increase in advertising spending has fallen drastically during the last few years. This trend is expected to continue for at least another year.
 
'The Next Logical Move'
 "Agencies are being squeezed by rising rents and taxes and falling compensation from clients," said John O'Toole, the president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies. "To cut costs, most agencies have moved from their expensive Madison Avenue locations to offices on the West Side and downtown. The next logical move will be out of Manhattan."
During the next 5 to 10 years, some large agencies will probably relocate operations like accounting, but many agency executives think New York will continue to be an advertising center.
The hundreds of small and medium-size agencies seem eager to stay in the city. "Smaller agencies tend to attract more adventuresome people," said Marty Weiss, the co-chairman of Weiss Whitten, one of the little companies. "Sure, New York is frightening, but that is part of what makes it creatively exciting."

Retailing: Big-Name Stores Strive to Survive

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
Sweeping changes in New York City's retailing and apparel industries seem inevitable, because of changing consumer tastes, in creasing competition and ever-growing finan cial pressures. Some big retailers may change ownership, and many are expected to close some larger stores, open smaller ones and, in general, have a tough time surviving.
Department stores, specialty shops and other retailers are among the largest employers in New York City, with nearly 260,000 workers, down slightly from 1989.
For more than a year, retail sales in New York and its suburbs have barely kept pace with inflation. In part, this trend reflected the layoffs on Wall Street and elsewhere in New York. It is also a reflection of the downturn in the national economy.
Indeed, sales at department stores in the New York metropolitan area declined by 4.1 percent in 1989, in contrast to an annual growth rate of 8.7 percent from 1982 to 1987.
 
Financial Pressures
 Perhaps more than anything else, the financial pressures created by merger-induced bankruptcies at the parent company of Bloomingdale's, at Abraham & Straus and at Stern's, and the debt-laden position of R. H. Macy & Company have raised questions about the future of these famous stores.
B. Altman closed its doors for those reasons in January, joining other failed New York retailers like Gimbels, Ohrbach's, Korvettes, J. W. Mays and S. Klein.
Some industry executives believe the major retailers will survive these difficulties. "Bloomie's and Macy's will still be around because of their unique position, while A.& S. and Stern's will continue to occupy the middle ground," said Thomas Rauh, regional director of retail services for the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.
Others have doubts. "I cannot say positively that Macy's and Bloomingdale's will survive," said Helen Galland, a marketing consultant and former president of Bonwit Teller. "They are too highly leveraged."
Reflecting much of the same consolidation and financial pressures, the garment industry is expected to be whittled down as retailers move more toward large suppliers with out-of-town or overseas manufacturing.
As in retailing, the trend to bigger but fewer companies will create opportunities for small and medium-size fashion designers and garment makers to provide more specialized merchandise. But these companies will have to be highly creative to survive.

Blue-Collar Workers: Industries Fading, But Not the Jobs

BYLINE: By Richard Levine

 BODY:
Once the bedrock of New York City's economy, the manufacturing industries that historically provided many blue-collar jobs have been leaving the city for years. Even during the prosperity of the 1980's, the city lost about 150,000 factory jobs.
But to the surprise of some labor economists, blue-collar workers are not disappearing. In fact, despite the lost factory jobs, the overall number of blue-collar workers increased by 140,000 from 1983 to 1989, bringing the total to 740,000 last year. Blue-collar jobs of all types now account for about a fifth of the city's work force.
Still, in a city that has become increasingly dominated by what Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls knowledge-based industries, many of these blue-collar jobs require more training and more skills than the usual entry-level, industrial jobs. Workers who once might have worked on carburetors are now expected to care for computers and other sophisticated electronic gear.
This problem is a worrisome one in New York City, where already perhaps half a million working-age people are not looking for work, because they are held back by lack of education or skills. Indeed, only 25 percent of the city's young people have jobs or are looking for them, about half the rate of their counterparts in Houston or Los Angeles.
Construction work has been a quick route to the middle class, especially for many people just starting their work lives. But that industry, which had surged in the 1980's real estate boom, is now experiencing a sharp decline that has idled as many as 25 percent of the workers in some trades.
"The more demanding jobs structure and an education system with a 38 percent dropout rate are on a collision course," Mr. Ehrenhalt warned.

HEADLINE: Finally, a Little Courage on Trade

 BODY:
After years of intransigence, and only weeks before the Uruguay Round of international trade talks is scheduled to end, the European Community offered last week to trim its protectionist farm policies. The European leaders did not offer much in the way of concessions. But the proposal will at least keep the trade talks alive.
Third world exporting nations threatened to pull out of the talks if industrialized nations refused to let in more food and textiles. In exchange for greater access, the third world would negotiate new rules -- important to the developed nations -- governing trade in agriculture, services and intellectual property. Until last week, the European leaders -- primarily at the insistence of the French and Germans -- had refused to budge. 
 Despite the new proposal, the negotiators remain far apart. If a deal is to be struck before the December deadline, President Mitterrand, Chancellor Kohl and President Bush will have to take charge, and soon.
The E.C. proposal would cut farm subsidies by 15 percent from current levels. That's a far cry from the demand of the United States and a group of 14 agricultural exporting nations, to cut price supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent. And the proposal includes an objectionable provision that would, in effect, allow the E.C. to increase tariffs on American soybeans and some other products.
The Europeans are not the only obstinate leaders. The Japanese won't agree to import rice; and the U.S. proposes to exempt telecommunications, aviation and shipping from the new regulations governing service industries.
The common thread in these difficulties is the willingness of government leaders to sacrifice the well-being of the vast majority of their citizens to protect the economic privileges of politically powerful industries.
European taxpayers pay huge sums, more than $100 billion each year, to support a handful of inefficient family farmers. Yet President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl, who faces an election early next month, fight to preserve these outrageous subsidies. To its credit, the Bush Administration seems willing to stand up to farm and textile interests. But it has caved in to the shippers, undermining a clean U.S. bargaining position.
The economic gains from an international trade agreement would be enormous, adding perhaps $1 trillion to the U.S. economy alone. To reap these benefits, the Western leaders will have to stare down the special interests.

HEADLINE: Socialist Vows to Be Capitol Outsider

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., Nov. 8

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, many Vermont residents saw Bernard Sanders as little more than a political hippie.
He was an outspoken advocate of social causes who called himself a socialist and called for taxing the rich, caring for the poor and building a truly progressive political party in America. 
 Now, irked by flip-flopping politicians and the legacy of Reaganomics, voters in this increasingly liberal state have ousted their Congressman and are sending Mr. Sanders to Washington in his place.
Mr. Sanders, the former Mayor of Burlington, identifies himself as a "democratic socialist," but he ran for Congress as an independent, defeating the state's lone Representative, Peter P. Smith, a Republican, by 17 percentage points on Tuesday. Mr. Sanders is the first truly independent candidate elected to Congress since Henry Frazier Reams, a former Democrat, was elected to the House in 1952.
"If timing is everything in politics, this was perfect timing for his campaign," said Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, who like other New England Governors is seeing her state slide into recession. "Now the question is whether a man who has made his career fighting the system will be able to be an insider and an outsider at the same time."
And while Mr. Sanders admits he has learned how to make short-term compromises, the 49-year-old Brooklyn native said his unequivocal answer to the insider-outsider question was "no."
His credentials as a socialist date to his membership in a Socialist party at the University of Chicago. In 1980 he was one of three electors for the Socialist Workers' Party, and then helped formed a new Vermont party, the Burlington Progressive Coalition.
In his victory speech Tuesday night Mr. Sanders said Vermont was "leading the way for the fight for a political revolution which would take power from the wealthy and return it to the people."
Sitting at his campaign headquarters here, surrounded by crudely written cardboard "Bernie" signs, and biting into a McDonald's pastry, Mr. Sanders said: "I'm not an insider. I know who I am. I know where I came from. I don't need to get down on my knees and ask rich people for their help. The point of this is to show the nation that we, here in Vermont, have given people a real political alternative."
His victory, he added, is evidence that working-class people can "fight against the establishment."
Mr. Sanders, who came to Vermont in 1968, has long been a renegade in a state that was once the most Republican in the union. After running unsuccessfully in four statewide races as a Liberty Union Party candidate, Mr. Sanders stunned established politicians in 1981 by defeating Gordon H. Paquette, Mayor of Burlington for five terms. His winning margin was 10 votes.
Mr. Sanders was elected to four consecutive two-year terms. Since leaving office in 1989, he has taught at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He has been praised for pushing through progressive programs in Burlington: an after-school program for youths, city-subsidized child care, a community boathouse, a city arts office and a youth council.
Mr. Sander's Congressional campaign, supported by an extensive grass-roots organization, was propelled by a backlash against Mr. Smith, a freshman Representative who seemed to change positions on two pivotal issues: gun control and the Federal budget.
Even though Mr. Sanders supports gun control, the National Rifle Association endorsed him after Mr. Smith voted for controls on semiautomatic assault-type weapons after earlier promising to oppose such measures.
In a campaign appearance by President Bush, Mr. Smith was critical of the final form of the budget, although he had voted for the preliminary Congressional budget package that would have cut $60 billion in Medicare spending and raised taxes on gasoline and home heating oil.
The Democrat in the House race, Delores Sandoval, trailed badly after announcing a proposal for "controlled legalization" of drugs.
Mr. Sanders says his agenda in Congress will include lower limits on campaign spending, a steeply progressive income tax, a national health care program, support for education, affordable housing and 50 percent cuts in military spending over the next five years.
Mr. Sanders said that he hopeds to join the Democratic Caucus in the House and would support the Democratic committee appointments but that he would not change his independent status to do so. "We are causing them a good deal of consternation I realize," Mr. Sanders said with a smile, "but I'm optimistic things will work out."
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, has said Mr. Sanders's membership would be subject to a caucus vote on Dec. 3. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic group, said he would wait to comment until the vote.
But Representative Charles Wilson, Democrat of Texas, expressed reservations about the newcomer. "The Democratic Caucus is for Democrats," Mr. Wilson said. "I'm sure the more liberal members of the caucus will welcome him in. But to many of us from the South, it is going to be hard when our opponents start saying that the Democrats and the socialists have all gotten together."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Syphilis Fools a New Generation

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
SYPHILIS, which is known as the great imitator because it mimics so many other diseases, is making its strongest comeback in 40 years in the United States. And it is fooling a generation of doctors who have rarely, if ever, seen a case.
Many doctors are scurrying to textbooks and flocking to lectures to learn about the unusual ways the bacterial infection can damage organs at any age, from newborns to the elderly. 
 Specialists from pediatricians to pathologists have mistaken the sores of syphilis for cancers, abscesses, hemorrhoids, hernias and other conditions. Pediatricians have mistaken the sniffles than can result at birth from congenital syphilis for the flu. Other doctors have also mistaken different forms of syphilis for dizziness from Meniere's disease and multiple sclerosis.
Dr. William Schaffner 2d, who heads the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, described a case that mystified several specialists in Nashville.
A young man with a painless sore on his penis went to a doctor who, believing the man had cancer, took a biopsy that he sent to a pathologist for identification under the microscope. The pathologist was stumped and he sent the biopsy to a colleague: he diagnosed syphilis.
Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a spiral-shaped bacterium known as a spirochete. The microbe is most commonly spread by sexual contact, and the disease appears in three stages.
The first stage is characterized by a painless sore, a primary chancre, that usually appears 21 days after exposure. The edges of the sore are hard, like cartilage, and can appear anywhere there has been sexual contact, such as the penis, vagina, cervix, tongue and anus.
Untreated syphilitic sores disappear after two to six weeks. From six to eight weeks later, the spirochete spreads silently through the blood to cause the second stage. It often appears as a rash that may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes throughout the body, a sore throat, weight loss, malaise, headache and loss of hair. The second stage of syphilis can also damage the eye, liver, kidney and other organs.
If untreated, the second stage of syphilis heals within two to six weeks. Then years to decades later it can damage the heart, aorta, bones and cause paralysis and dementia.
The symptoms from syphilis not only are transient but can vary greatly, which explains its reputation as the great imitator. And if a doctor misses the early stages, Dr. Schaffner said, "the patient becomes a biological time bomb waiting to develop tertiary syphilis."
Syphilis can also harm newborn babies through transmission of the spirochete from the mother to the fetus in pregnancy. A baby born with syphilis often has a runny nose and can have a rash and other symptoms that resemble an adult's secondary stage. Congenital syphilis can cause deafness, anemia and permament damage to the bones, liver and teeth.
But prompt and adequate treatment of the syphilitic mother with antibiotics usually prevents damage to the unborn baby, and treatment of an infant with syphilis generally prevents permanent damage.
Dr. Harold Neu said the infectious disease team he heads at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York had recently found a number of mothers whose blood tests showed no evidence of syphilis yet who gave birth to babies with the disease.
The doctors found that the mothers had such a heavy infection that standard testing methods were unable to detect it. The problem was solved by modifying the laboratory technique, Dr. Neu said.
New cases of syphilis are at the highest level since 1949.
Dr. Willard Cates Jr., an expert at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said the centers expected about 50,000 cases to be reported in 1990, as against 41,942 in 1949. The reporting of syphilis is the most reliable of all the sexually transmitted diseases.
The surging number of cases reflects social and economic factors like changing sexual habits; drug abuse, particularly trading sex for crack; rising rates of pregnancy among teen-agers who do not use contraceptives to protect against infection and declining support for public health services, which has limited tracing some cases.
Some epidemics occur because a microbe develops resistance to antibiotics, but the spirochete that causes syphilis is still killed by penicillin, the drug that has been used to treat it since World War II.
In New York State, "a booming syphilis epidemic" is occurring, says Dr. David Axelrod, the Health Commissioner. Testing for syphilis of all patients 15 to 45 years old who are admitted to hospitals and treated in emergency rooms is the current standard of medical care, Dr. Axelrod said. This practice was dropped in the years when the number of syphilis cases reached record lows. No other state has adopted a similar measure, though pregnant women are often tested in other states.
The surge is primarily among black and Hispanic heterosexual men and women in cities. A primary factor is the trading of sex for drugs. Women who give birth to babies with syphilis are more likely to have used crack while pregnant and less likely to have received prenatal care.
Health officials are also deeply concerned about the links between syphilis and AIDS. The open sores of syphilis are belived to make it easier for the AIDS virus to enter the body.
A rule among public health workers in past years was to not let the sun set on an untreated case of syphilis. But that goal is now often impossible because budget cuts have strapped the public clinics where most syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases are diagnosed.
"What happens is that clinics become backed up at 11 A.M. when they used to take new patients until 4 P.M. and some clinics have to stop accepting new patients before noon because they cannot handle the load," said Dr. King K. Holmes of the University of Washington in Seattle, an expert on sexually transmitted diseases.
The delays translate into additional cases of syphilis because untreated patients pass the infection on to sex partners and babies. Health workers who trace sexual contacts of syphilis patients have found that about one of two people named as contacts are also infected.
Until the recent resurgence, syphilis was not a research priority, said Dr. Edward W. Hook 3d, an expert in sexually transmitted diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "It was a hard organism to work with, time consuming, expensive, and people viewed it as a minor and declining problem," Dr. Hook said. "Now we find ourselves knowing so little about it."
Health workers cannot be blamed for ailments of patients who do not come for care, but Dr. Laurene Mascola of the Los Angeles County Health Department said that if she were a lawyer, she "would put society and health departments on trial for allowing the escalation of congenital syphilis cases in the era of penicillin."

But Is It a Business?
 Profit does not seem to be the point at Romeo Gigli 's new Manhattan store, which opened a week ago. With its Venetian-glass chandeliers, mosaics, Fornasetti screens, outdoor garden and gallery, the store is definitely unusual. But is it a business?
Takashimaya , a Japanese retail company that financed the Gigli boutique in Paris, bought the building, at 21 East 69th Street. The first three floors, where the men's and women's clothing are sold, are a joint venture of Takashimaya and Mr. Gigli. Mr. Gigli (whose name is pronounced ZHEE-lee) leases the fourth floor, which is a gallery, and the fifth, which is used for offices. Plans call for sales of $1.8 million in the first year. The first week, the store took in $20,000, which is off the pace, but boutiques often do better as time goes by.
The least expensive item is a pair of socks, for $35. Some of the coats, almost ecclesiastical in their embroidered finery, cost more than $30,000.
"In our business, image is No. 1," said Ellen Carey, who is, appropriately, the image director of the company in New York. "We really want to show the most creative pieces, even if they don't sell."
But more reasonable merchandise is on its way. Mr. Gigli's resort collection, which begins arriving this week, includes cotton-Lycra tops, skirts and pants in the $300 to $550 range. Next year there will be a lower-priced collection called G. Gigli, for both men and women. This more casual sportswear line is being created primarily for the American market.
"It will have all of his best shapes," Ms. Carey said, "all the pieces that everyone else has been knocking off."
The reason Mr. Gigli is doing a secondary line, apparently, is that everybody else seemed to be doing one.
 
Samples of the Time
 A sign of the current state of fashion retailing: the rise in sample sales. Historically, these allowed companies to clear out showroom samples and undelivered or mismatched shipments.
But Seventh Avenue manufacturers are now using showroom sales as a way of offsetting poor retail performance, said Elysa Lazar, the president of The S & B Report, a consumer guide to unadvertised showroom and sample sales.
Ms. Lazar said there had been 50 percent more sample sales this fall than in the same period last year. The November 1989 issue of The S & B Report listed 100 companies holding such sales; this year it has 150.
The depth and variety of merchandise at recent sample sales also suggest hard times. Instead of a few sizes and styles, there is a lot of everything, some below wholesale, compared with straight wholesale last year.
 
Toning It Down
 Charivari , the Manhattan-based retailer, is weathering the downward turn by expanding wholesale operations. The company recently introduced a more casual version of its private-label collection Sans Tambours ni Trompettes. (The name is French for "without fanfare," the opposite of Charivari, "din.")
The new line, STNT for short, is mostly men's wear costing $50 to $200. The line has been ordered by such stores as Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and I. Magnin.
 
By the Numbers: Color
 Reinforcing the folk wisdom that color is the best antidote to gray economic times, designers have been choosing brighter hues, according to Pantone Inc., whose swatch cards are used by clothing and textile manufacturers.
Black, which was No. 1 in 1989, has slid to 24th in Pantone's sales. That means yellow-green, or chartreuse, so popular in recent seasons, has also faded out of favor. The leading three colors this year are all variations on navy blue, followed by antique white and burgundy.

HEADLINE: Plant Lovers' Ambitious Goal Is No More Extinctions

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Malheur wire lettuce, an unprepossessing but rare plant that grows only in hot, dry central Oregon, appeared to have lost its struggle for survival.
The few existing populations of the plant that managed to cling to life in its inhospitable ecological niche were gradually erased by the hoofs of cattle, foraging by jack rabbits, fire and an invasion of Asian cheat grass. By the early 1980's there were no plants of the species known to be alive. 
 But Dr. Leslie D. Gottlieb, a professor of plant genetics at the University of California at Davis who discovered the plant in 1968, had stored a large number of its seeds. They were propagated at the Berry Botanic Garden in Portland, Ore., and the seedlings were planted on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Oregon. The extinct plant was returned to life.
 
Efforts Are Paying Off
 The resurrection of the Malheur wire lettuce is one of a growing number of successes of a nationwide cooperative effort among scientists, botanical gardens, state and Federal governments, and the Nature Conservancy and other private conservation groups to preserve the nation's endangered flora.
Don Falk, executive director of the Center for Plant Conservation, one of the groups leading the effort, said he believed that there need be no further losses of native plants.
"We have set as a realistically attainable goal preventing from this point on any further extinctions of American flora," Mr. Falk said in a telephone interview.
Saving every American plant would be a formidable task. There are about 25,000 native plants, of which 3,000 are considered in some danger of extinction. The Center for Plant Conservation has estimated that more than 700 plants will disappear in the next 10 years if strong measures are not taken to save them. More than a third of these could be wiped out in five years.
While there are many sources of danger, the chief cause of extinction is the destruction of the plants' limited habitat by housing, industry or other human activity.
"We are talking about protecting plant diversity on a continental scale and that is not a trivial exercise," said Mr. Falk. But he added: "This is not something we have any choice about. The consequences of not attending to the diversity of plant life would be felt fairly quickly as ecological communities deteriorate."
 
Role as Food and Drugs
 Little is known about most of the rare endangered plants, but many of them are genetically related to food crops, including grains, vegetables and fruits. Many could have pharmaceutical value and many others should be saved for their beauty, Mr. Falk and others engaged in the rescue effort contend.
As an example of the value of saving rare plants, Mr. Falk pointed to a Texas wild rice, Zizania texana, whose habitat is now reduced to a single stream in central Texas. The genetic characteristics that enable it to live in a hotter, drier climate could be used to extend the growing range of wild rice in the United States, where it is now generally limited to the North Central states.
Even more important, he said, is the value of the wild rice's genes as insurance against a significant warming of the earth over the next century as a result of the greenhouse effect. If, as many scientists expect, rising global temperatures make the nation's interior hotter and drier, crops that can grow under such conditions would be urgently needed.
"We are talking about a survival issue for Homo sapiens," Mr. Falk said.
Last month the Center for Plant Conservation announced that to strengthen its efforts to preserve species, it was moving from Boston to St. Louis to affiliate with the Missouri Botanical Garden, a leading institution for plant research. The botanical garden is coordinating the preparation of a 12-volume "Flora of North America," which will be the first comprehensive listing and description of the plants of the United States, Canada and Greenland.
Peter Raven, the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, said his institution's wide and growing storehouse of information about native plants would fit directly into the Center for Plant Conservation's efforts to identify and collect plants that are in danger of disappearing.
 
Returning Plants to the Wild
 The next step after finding and collecting those endangered plants, he said, is reintroducing them into the wild. Preserving seeds or a few plants in botanical gardens does not permanently protect plants because their survival depends on money and continuing care by people that could be cut off. Only re-establishing plant communities in their natural setting can save them over the long run, he contended.
Mr. Falk agrees. "A botanical garden is a holding pattern -- an ark," he said. "We have to find a place for the ark to land. Plants need to live in an ecological community with pollinators and symbiotic organisms such as fungi. Our objective is to restore species to a fully functioning existence in their ecological setting so that they can continue on their evolutionary pathway."
But before endangered plants can be reintroduced into the wild, they must be found and collected. This task is shouldered in large part by natural heritage programs run by state governments in cooperation with scientific institutions and cultural groups. The Nature Conservancy, a private nonprofit group based in Arlington, Va., plays a major role in this program, providing technical support and a data base for state programs.
Members of the the state programs meet at least once a year with the Center for Plant Conservation, representatives of botanical gardens, university scientists, Federal land managers and private conservation groups to discuss the status of the most critically threatened species and to determine which must be collected to assure their safety.
Plants identified as being in trouble are collected, their seeds stored, and individual plants propagated and studied. "If you have only a few populations of a plant left, you don't dare mess around with it," said Robert E. Jenkins, vice president for science programs of the Nature Conservancy. "You have to study it in the greenhouse to find out how much sun it likes, whether or not it should be fertilized and watered. Only then can you think about reintroducing it into the wild."
 
Some Are Skeptical
 Not all botanists think the goal of saving all native flora is realistic. Dr. Gottlieb of the University of California, for example, called the notion of zero losses of American plants romanticism. It would be a mistake to try, he said.
"We must save those species we know are very important and, if we have the time and the money, save the rest," he said, adding that there are not enough money or scientists or other workers to save every plant in danger of extinction.
He recalled that he had urged the California Fish and Game Commission, which decides which plants and animals to list as threatened or endangered, to try to save a plant called Oryctes nevadensis, a small annual herb in the tomato family that grows only in a few populations in the Owens Valley of California.
The plant belongs to a family "of supreme economic importance" because its genetic structure is related to tomatoes, potatoes, tobacco and petunias, Dr. Gottlieb said. But the commission turned down his petition and spent its resources on what he said were much less important plants.
At the time of the commission's action in 1989, one member of the panel was quoted by The Sacramento Bee as saying, "Here's a very weedy looking plant, and what I'm really wondering is, why are we worrying about it?' " The paper did not identify the member.
Although Dr. Gottlieb calls for scientists to be selective in deciding which plants to rescue, many say virtually all native plants could be saved.
"It is a lot easier to save plants than it is to save, say, spotted owls," said Bruce MacBryde, a botanist for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
Mr. Falk says he is confident that his goal can be achieved. "Like any good doctor, I should never say never," he said. "But I really think we can pull it off -- that we will not lose a single native plant. We have a system now we believe will enable us to prevent anything from slipping through the cracks."
 
Zizania texana
 
Texas wild rice, which grows in a single stream in Texas, tolerates heat and dryness and could extend the growing range of wild rice.
 
Dicerandra christmanii
 
Found three years ago, this scrub mint grows only in three places in one Florida county. Drought-tolerant and menthol-scented, it is being cultivated.
 
Polygala smallii
 
Tiny polygala, an herb with small yellow-green flowers, grows in open sandy spots in the coastal pinelands of Florida. Only a few individual plants exist.
 
Stephanomeria malheurensis
 
Malheur wire lettuce became extinct
in the wild; it was propagated from saved seeds.
 
Torreya taxifolia
 
Once an abundant tree up to 60 feet tall, the Florida torreya has resinous wood widely used for fence posts. Only seedlings remain in the wild; it is being cultivated.

Lebanese Split on Potential for Peace

BYLINE: By ALI JABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Nov. 12

 BODY:
This country long riven by factional and sectarian strife is now torn between hope and pessimism as militia fighters withdraw from the capital and the Government moves ahead with a plan to restore peace.
The country's legacy of failed cease-fires and peace plans has left its people so wary that many are not even bothering to remove sandbags from their homes and shops. 
 "We have seen the militias pull out before," said Mustapha Inja, a 56-year-old retired pilot. "In 1983 all crossing points were opened and even the devastated downtown district was restored. But at the slightest sign of trouble the militiamen popped up from nowhere, closed all passageways in no time and started fighting again.
"There are no guarantees this will not happen again," he said.
 
Best Chance in Years
 Despite such gloomy assessments, many politicians and analysts believe that Lebanon has its best chance in years to achieve a lasting peace.
"No one can stop spring from coming to Lebanon," said Ghassan Tweini, the publisher of the newspaper an Nahar.
Ahmad Ayash, a columnist at the paper, pointed to global developments, particularly the end of the cold war, as a major source of hope for Lebanon.
"Syria has shifted alliances and is now in the same ditch with the Americans in the gulf," he said, referring to the American led effort against Iraq. "The Palestine Liberation Organization is no longer a player in Lebanon's political game and, for the first time since the war started 15 years ago, the Christians agreed to give concessions to the Muslims.
"These factors alone form serious bases for a lasting solution here," he concluded.
 
Assault on Aoun Opened a Path
 The focus of the optimism and doubts is the progress that President Elias Hrawi has made toward peace since Oct. 13. On that day Syria, the dominant force with 40,000 troops in this country, decided to launch an all-out assault on the East Beirut stronghold of the Christian Gen. Michel Aoun. The general's two-year rebellion against the Government had prevented the carrying out of a comprehensive political settlement giving the country's growing Muslim population a greater share of power at the expense of the long-favored Christians.
More than 750 people died in the Syrian assault, and General Aoun was forced to flee to refuge in the French Embassy from the presidential palace he had occupied in Baabda.
In the aftermath of the assault, President Hrawi has ordered all militias to leave Beirut by Monday and offered to set aside Cabinet seats for the heads of the country's six main factions. The Government's goal is to establish a zone in and around the capital controlled by the Lebanese Army so that it can revive institutions and services and stabilize the economy.
It has a long way to go toward convincing many Lebanese that it can succeed. Most people here have little or no time to think about peace. They are too busy struggling to secure bread and butter and other basic needs as prices for food and gasoline soar and telephones, electricity and water remain cut off.
 
The Pessimists' View
 Ziad Kamal, a sociologist, described the situation as "hopeless." He said the war has bred a hateful generation accustomed to violence.
"The compromise that militiamen have accepted today may be rejected by their sons tomorrow," he said.
Akram Zuheiri, a close aide to the Druse militia chief, Walid Jumblat, said peace is still out of reach.
"They may kick out the militias from Beirut today, but their plan stops right there," he said. "They cannot force Israel to pull out from south Lebanon, therefore giving Syria the pretext to remain where it is now."
The Government's plan has been drawn from the comprehensive peace accord reached between Christian and Muslim members of Parliament last year in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
 
Phased Syrian Withdrawal
 The accord calls for the disbanding of all militias within four months and a phased Syrian troop withdrawal from Beirut beginning in September 1992.
So far about half of the estimated 10,000 Shiite militiamen under the mainstream Amal organization have left the capital with their weapons. The rest, according to Amal officials, stayed in Beirut but disarmed and returned to civilian life.
Druse sources said that as many as 7,000 Druse militiamen have been dismissed. About 1,000 were kept under arms, they said, but they are preparing to join the police force or army.
The hard-line Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, which fought Muslim, Syrian and Palestinian forces throughout the civil war, began on Sunday to gather fighters and armor at in its headquarters in East Beirut in preparation for a move north.
 
Party of God Won't Disarm
 The Party of God, the Shiite Muslim fundamentalist group, has reportedly transferred its heavy arms and fighters and the 13 foreigners it has held hostage here to remote areas in eastern and southern Lebanon. Their spokesman said they would fight Israel from bases in the south, but he claimed his group had no intention of dissolving its military forces.
Already the plan to get the militias out of Beirut has begun to run into obstacles. Samir Geagea, the commander of the Lebanese Forces, told reporters that he would insist on control of a third the seats in the Cabinet. He said that since his militia was the only Christian militia invited to join the new Cabinet, the four main Muslim factions would otherwise have too much power.
In addition, the Party of God, the Shiite fundametalist organization linked to the kidnapping of Westerners, has indicated through its mentor, Sheik Mohamad Hussein Fadlallah, that it would not join the Cabinet. He said his group prefers to remain in the opposition.
Despite the deep pessimism born of years of dashed prospects for peace, the Government's current progress has encouraged many here to revive the once-famous landmarks of pre-war Lebanon.
 
Commercial District Patrolled
 Beirut's tumultuous Hamra commercial district, whose chic sidewalk cafes were often frequented by Arab intellectuals, during the war years became a dirty habitat for refugees and beggars.
Today, a police force maintaining round-the-clock surveillance of the street have removed vegetable vendors blocking the windows of haute couture shops and turned away beggers disturbing shoppers.
Elsewhere grimmer realities intrude and dampen expectations. Probably the most accurate indicator of stability here is the price of Lebanese pound against foreign currencies. The current value of the dollar, more than 700 Lebanese pounds, hardly indicates that peace is at hand. Its value before the civil war erupted in 1975 was a little less than three pounds.
Beirut has been living under a total blackout since January. Electricity from generators set up by entrepreneurs costs at least $60 a month, about half the monthly income of the average Lebanese.
 
'Accepting Terms of Surrender'
 Other Christians living in sectors of central Lebanon conquered by the Syrian forces on Oct. 13 are experiencing another kind of anxiety.
The once-bustling villages of Brummana and Beit-Meri east of Beirut have become virtually deserted, except for Syrian soldiers on patrols. Residents lock themselves indoors as soon as they come from work in the afternoon. "You cannot label what is going on as a peace plan," said Joseph Haddad,a 30-year-old businessman. "The Christians were simply defeated and are now accepting terms of surrender of their victorious rivals, the Muslims and Syrians," he said.
Still other Lebanese have arrived at what they call a realistic medium between the optimists' euphoria and the pessimists' depression.
Dalal Aoud, a 30-year-old journalist, said, "Enjoy peace while it lasts."

HEADLINE: $18.2 Million for a Renoir From the Ford Collection

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Renoir's "Cup of Chocolate," from 1878, was sold last night for $18.2 million -- the highest price in Sotheby's auction of artworks from the family and the estate of Henry Ford 2d. The sale brought many disappointments for the auction house: of the 36 works offered, 23 were sold for a total of $48.6 million, well below Sotheby's presale estimate of $66 million to $85.8 million.
"It looks as if they had a bit of a bath," said Desmond Corcoran, a London dealer. 
 Julian Agnew, another London dealer, said: "I think it went more or less as predicted. This market has still a way to go on the way down."
The room was packed with an international gathering of dealers and collectors as impressive as any seen at a sale in recent years. But most of those in attendance were spectators.
"It does show a change in the market," said David Nash, head of fine-art sales at Sotheby's. "More than anything, it is slightly confusing. Some things sold well; some things sold that we didn't expect would sell, and some things we expected to sell did not.
"There is no doubt that the events on the international scene, combined with the rather worrying economic predictions, have made people more cautious. Despite all this, there are people who really want to buy paintings at very strong prices and will compete for them."
The price paid by the unidentified Japanese collector who bought the Renoir was the second highest at auction for a painting by the artist, exceeded only by "At the Moulin de la Galette," which was sold in May in the same room for $78.1 million to the Japanese paper industrialist Ryoei Saito.
 
The 20th Century Sells
 Among the paintings sold by the Ford' estate was Paul Cezanne's 1880's painting of the Provence estate of the artist's father, Louis-Auguste Cezanne, for $7.2 million to an unidentified buyer. The price paid was within the house estimate and considerably more than Mr. Ford paid for it in 1966 at a New York City auction where it brought $350,000. Modigliani's 1918 portrait of the American artist Morgan Russell, which had been expected to bring $8 million to $10 million, did not sell.
Mr. Corcoran said the sale also showed that "what was selling the best were the 20th-century works." He left shortly after the sale of Picasso's sculpture "Glass of Absinthe," from 1914, for $2.53 million and Matisse's painting "Pewter Pot, Lemon and Armchair," from 1939, for $3.9 million. Those prices were among the highest prices in the sale.
Mr. Ford, who died in 1987, inherited the Renoir from his mother in 1976 and gave it to his three children -- Edsel, Charlotte Ford Downe and Anne Ford Scarborough -- who were the sellers last night.
Several dealers were critical of Sotheby's guarantee -- an agreed-upon price between the auction house and the seller -- on the 35 artworks from the Ford estate, which did not include the Renoir. The guarantee figure was not disclosed. Sotheby's became the owner of the 13 unsold lots.
"There is still a lot of sorting out in this market," Mr. Agnew said. "The massive influx of credit into this market since 1986 and 1987 has now gone into reverse. We have a sort of credit crunch, and banks are very nervous about making loans into fine arts and other markets.
"Maybe we have to go back to the prices of before 1987, to 1986, before van Gogh's 'Irises' was sold on credit. Maybe the auction houses will reconsider their policies on guarantees. The guarantee tonight was about $58 million, and last night they sold about $32 million for the estate."

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The President's Mistake

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
President Bush made one profound mistake immediately after Iraq conquered Kuwait. Every day it becomes more important that he correct it before United States ground forces go into action against Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Bush failed to state the single most important reason for going to war against Iraq -- or even for organizing the worldwide embargo. That is to eliminate Saddam Hussein's power to cause more death and destruction. Other reasons do not justify the deaths of Americans -- or placing them in deadly jeopardy. 
 Perhaps Mr. Bush himself was reluctant to face it in the beginning. Certainly Presidential candor was not a happy prospect for Administration officials who designed and pushed the failed, disgraced policy of strengthening Saddam Hussein and appeasing him almost up to the hour of invasion.
If they really wanted to convince Saddam Hussein of American determination to oppose him at last, the resignation of Secretary of State James Baker and some of his top Middle East hands would have been one inexpensive, bloodless way of showing it.
Whatever the reason, Mr. Bush came up with war goals that simply do not satisfy a large part of the American public. The public support needed by the President and every soldier depends not so much on the length of a war but whether it sits well in the American stomach.
Mr. Bush told the country that one goal was to turn back aggression. Every American intelligent enough to fight is intelligent enough to know that the United States did not feel compelled to go into battle against other aggressions -- China against Tibet, the Soviet Union against the world of Eastern Europe, and Arab against Arab time and again. Why was was this one so important?
Americans were told that another objective was to restore the royal family of Kuwait. Name one American you know who thinks that is worth dying for, or even facing the possibility of death. Just one.
And Americans were told that the country could not allow a dictator with a proven taste for power and blood to stand astride much of the world's oil supply. That is an economic and political reality. But it is not convincing enough to Americans who know that there are steps the U.S. has not yet taken to preserve its oil independence. Among them: tougher conservation, higher gas taxes, real attempts to break the OPEC cartel with a Western Hemisphere consortium benefiting us and our neighbors.
So, with American men and women facing combat in the desert, the U.S. debates why they are there. Mr. Bush has done well preparing the country militarily for the possibility of war, but has failed to prepare it politically and spiritually.
He has not said the bone truth: Left in power, Saddam Hussein will use his missiles and chemical arsenal in the future as he has in the past. And if Israeli destruction of his nuclear plant in 1981 had not set him back a decade or so, Iraq would be a nuclear power today.
Does anybody truly believe that when he acquires them, Saddam Hussein will not use nuclear weapons as blackmail? Or never slip a few to some of his terrorist gangs and allies like Libya? Does anybody truly believe that he would not use nuclear power as a first resort or certainly a last if he ever again faces a strong coalition that threatens his rule?
Stop this man before he can kill millions. That is the only war goal worth putting before American soldiers as a reason for risking their lives. And it is the reason that U.S. and allied air power should have been used to destroy his arsenals before American armies were shipped abroad. It is the reason that air power should still be tried before they are sent into combat. The country and the President need matters of heart from each other -- trust, confidence and respect. But on the edge of war, he wasted his dignity and dwindling time by running around fighting local political battles.
When he decides he must send more hundreds of thousands of Americans into danger, he breaks the news to reporters at the White House, instead of telling the parents himself, in their living rooms.
He talks almost every day, but always gives the impression that he talks to be heard only by Saddam Hussein or the U.N. In the timetable of the Mideast crisis, the date that counts most is when the American President decides to address the American people in full openness -- rectifying the error he made, telling them that the reason to confront the power of Saddam Hussein is to end the power of Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Son's Killing Leaves Family An Angry, Painful Legacy

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
On Thursday, Kimson Russell was supposed to celebrate his 17th birthday. His unemployed mother had even scratched together enough money to buy him a much wanted new coat with the Los Angeles Raiders football team logo stitched across the back.
"I have the money hidden in a suitcase," she said yesterday.
But instead of celebrating on Thursday, Mr. Russell's family and friends will gather for his funeral. Any extra money will cover burial expenses. 
 The teen-ager, who dreamed of becoming a professional football player, was shot to death on Saturday night on a street corner in the East New York section of Brooklyn, about a block from his home in the Cypress Hills public houses.
He had been returning home from an errand for his grandmother.
"When they lifted him up to take him to the morgue, he was lying on the bread I sent him just thought he was going for bread. That's all, bread."
Why the teen-ager was killed was uncertain late yesterday. "As far as we know, we don't have a motive," said a police spokesman, Officer Ralph Saint Just. "He's just a victim at this part of the investigation."
His mother, Veberly, said yesterday that she was determined not to let her son becomejust another statistic, just another brief story about a poor boy gunned down in a struggling and neglected neighborhood.
By yesterday, Ms. Russell's tears had turned to resolve.
"I want my son's death to make a difference," she said. "I can't sit up here crying. I have to do something about these kids killing each other."
Tomorrow night, she hopes to hold a memorial for her son at a nearby community center and turn the mourning into what she called an "anti-violence teach-in" for the neighborhood's teen-agers and their parents.
 
'They're Just Frustrated'
 "There are tons of hard-working people around here," Ms. Russell said. "They want to do something. They're just frustrated. There are a whole lot of families who are suffering because their children died like Kimson."
She is trying to recruit radio and television hosts to speak at her son's memorial to help convince the young people that the path so many are following leads to death and unbearable heartache for those left behind.
"I want the kids to know, we're destroying ourselves," she said. "Nobody takes the time to talk to the kids. That's part of the problem. I'm not saying I'm going to change their minds. I just hope we stir them up, to make them start thinking about what they're doing."
As she talked, her brother, Renaldo Russell, a 31-year-old accountant for Merrill Lynch, sat across the living room shaking his head.
"Depending on where you walk around here, you take your life in your hands," he said. "The kids with guns aren't kids anymore. They're murderers."
"They are still kids, Renaldo," Ms. Russell, 41, said. "You are very bitter." "I'm not bitter," Mr. Russell said. "I'm realistic."
Later, looking over his nephew's baby pictures, Mr. Russell admitted, "Yes, I'm bitter."
"I'm bitter that I have to call here every day to make sure that they're all right," he said. "I'm bitter that it's always on my mind. I'm bitter that I have to tell my mother to be careful when she goes to the store and not to go out at night. Yeah, I'm bitter."
For years, Mr. Russell has been trying to convince his mother and sister to leave the Cypress Hill Houses, their home for almost 20 years.
He only visits the project on weekends and during the day. "When it starts getting dark, I leave," he said. "Whenever I'm over here, I hear pop, pop coming from the street."
Gunfire was more than just a sound on the street for the Russell family even before Saturday night. In April, Ms. Russell's daughter, Ronelle, 21, was shot when a teen-ager shooting at another youth hit her by mistake as she ran into a building in the project. She lost her left kidney.
"I was lucky," she said yesterday.
 
Many Are Shot and Live
 In September, 12-year-old Laykama Taylor, who also lived in the project, was not lucky. She was shot and killed while in a playground braiding a friend's hair. Ms. Russell said she knows of at least a half-dozen young people who have been slain in the area in the last two years.
"And if you ask how many kids were shot and lived, the number is about 40," she said.
Her brother said he believed that his nephew had been gunned down by drug-gang members trying to intimidate the neighborhood by killing someone, anyone who came along.
"I went to the morgue today to identify Kimson," Mr. Russell said. "It's hard, real hard. I used to change his diapers."
The police said the teen-ager was shot twice by someone in a car as it drove past 1260 Sutter Avenue shortly after 9 P.M. Another teen-age boy with him was shot and wounded in the leg.
 
'I Used to Tease Him'
 Kimson Russell's family and friends said he had avoided the rougher elements in the neighborhood. He still sucked his thumb, his uncle said.
"I used to tease him about that," Mr. Russell said.
The teen-ager played video games and football and looked for girls, said his best friends, Infinite Berry, 14, and Anthony Rosa, 15.
"If he was here, we'd be outside playing right now," Mr. Berry said.
"There ain't no bringing him back," Mr. Rosa said. "I'm going to miss him going to practice with me."
 
'She Doesn't See His Face'
 Kimson Russell had a baby daughter with his girlfriend, Melissa Gibbons, 17. Yesterday, as his family's apartment filled with relatives and friends, the baby, Christina, who will be 1 on Christmas, played with a rattle and crawled from one sad-faced adult to another.
"She must wonder where Kimson is," said her aunt, "because she doesn't see his face."
The telephone in the apartment rang constantly yesterday, and several callers pleaded with Ms. Russell to pack up and leave East New York.
She said, "I won't be run out of here."
"I really love East New York," she said. "I believe I can make a difference. I just had no idea I was going to lose my son."

Little Whispers, the Big Lie and China's Future

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 12

 BODY:
For Americans, the campaigning and the mud-slinging are over for a while. For Chinese, they never end.
For most of the last four decades China has been embroiled in campaigns: to wipe out prostitution, to kill sparrows, to make steel in backyard furnaces, to attack "stinking" intellectuals, to denounce Deng Xiaoping, to hail Deng Xiaoping. 
 Those were one-sided campaigns, but now a bitterly contested one -- not entirely different from the campaign Americans have just endured -- is under way for the future of China.
This campaign will not end in an election; indeed, no one is sure how it will end. But all sides seem to believe that public opinion will matter, at some point, in some degree, particularly after the death of the octogenarians like Mr. Deng who are now in charge. That is why the leadership is not relying on force alone, but is also trying desperately to cultivate popular support.
"Everything here seems like one long campaign," said a Western diplomat in Beijing. "It's the way they do business. It's the only way they have to energize their vast apparatus."
 
Incumbency Helps
 The hard-liners have the enormous advantage of incumbency, which is an even greater benefit here than in the United States. In China, incumbents not only sling mud at their opponents, they also imprison them, or send them into internal exile, as the Government has done with Liu Qing, an advocate of democratic change who was expelled from Beijing to distant Shaanxi Province.
Moreover, the Communist Party treats all the nation's newspapers and television broadcasts as advertising space to celebrate the glories of Communism.
But critics of the Government have come up with their own makeshift campaign techniques, like rumors, to discredit the Government. It helps that the opposition has millions of "precinct workers": ordinary men and women who were outraged at the military crackdown on the democracy movement, as well as by corruption and economic mismanagement, and who are glad to pass on gossip about the leaders' reported Swiss bank accounts.
"Do you know about the Asian Games insignia?" a disgruntled young Chinese worker asked a foreign friend the other day. "It was designed so that if you look at its mirror image, it's a spot of blood and a 6 and a 4" -- an allusion to the 6-4 incident, as the killing of protesters on June 4, 1989, is known.
The insignia arguably does include a backward 6 and 4 and a red glob, so many young Chinese gleefully assert that the design is evidence of continuing resistance. There is no evidence that this is true, but if enough people believe it then it succeeds in making the Government look foolish.
 
Whispers About an Earthquake
 To foreigners, it sometimes seems a battle between the Big Lie and Little Whisper techniques, in which each side is constrained only by the limits of its imagination. One of the Little Whispers now going around is that a big earthquake will strike China in December, showing what the heavens think of Communism.
So who is winning the campaign? Conversations with a variety of Chinese as well as with foreign diplomats suggest mixed results.
The Government seems to be winning some support among older and middle-aged cadres, who have already devoted their lives to the Communist Party and are reluctant to believe ill of it. The Government's campaign theme -- that China needs stability above all -- also has some appeal in this constituency, which has bitter memories of the Cultural Revolution or even of the pre-Communist era.
The leadership also appears to be doing well in some rural areas, particularly those with television but no alternative source of information. In cities, people rely on rumors and on Voice of America.
Even in the cities, the overwhelming repetition of the official version of events has some effect. A woman who grew up in China but now lives abroad said that when she returned for a visit recently, she was surprised that several of her former neighbors in Beijing were skeptical about whether there really had been much killing during the crackdown.
"They asked if it was really true that students were killed, and whether I had seen videos of it with my own eyes," she said. And a worker in her 40's, who is fundamentally hostile to the Government, said she now believed that the student demonstrators had been used and misled by a small group of anti-Government conspirators.
 
Contempt for Propaganda
 But over all, the Government is losing ground, diplomats and many Chinese say. Particularly among intellectuals and younger people -- the three-quarters of the population who were born after the Communist revolution -- propaganda arouses mostly contempt, and there is a deepening desire "to throw the rascals out."
Pocket-book issues are still most important, although continuing irritation with family planning restrictions is a major issue in rural areas. Chinese are worried by the economic slump in which they find themselves and embittered by the general inefficiency and poverty in which they live, especially compared with the affluence that they know exists in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
The public's bitterness has been compounded lately by increases in the fixed prices for daily necessities like sugar, coal and gas for cooking. Economists say the increases are necessary, but they go over about as well as a tax increase does with American voters.
The Government has tried to win support with a widely publicized drive against corruption, with hagiographies of particularly dedicated Communist cadres and exposes of the problems in Taiwan and the United States.
"In Washington and New York, you see beggers and homeless vagabonds," Beijing Evening News reported in a recent front-page article. "With their sons and daughters in tow, they spread their old and dirty clothes on the ground and lie down to sleep."
Such articles seem to have minimal effect, however, because few Chinese read the newspapers these days and even fewer seem to believe what they read.

China seems to always be embroiled in a campaign, though no one ever votes. "Everything here seems like one long campaign," said a Western diplomat in Beijing. (Fumiyo Asahi for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Investigates Groups of Zealots Who Praise Kahane Slaying

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
The Federal Bureu of Investigation is scrambling to investigate the Muslim groups associated with the Masjid al-Salam mosque in Jersey City, where El Sayyid A. Nosair, the man accused of killing Rabbi Meir Kahane, worshiped, according to high-level law-enforcement officials.
Although the New York City police say they believe Mr. Nosair acted alone, one law-enforcement official said the investigation into Rabbi Kahane's death had opened "a window" into several radical fundamentalist groups. Besides looking at possible links between these groups and the shooting of Rabbi Kahane last week at a Manhattan hotel, the F.B.I. fears that these groups may be capable of terrorist activities at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East, thehigh-level officials said. 
 One group under investigation, the officials said, is the Muslim Brotherhood, an Egyptian-based group that has engaged in violent campaigns against the Egyptian Government and has given rise to many radical splinter groups that have taken responsibility for political assassinations and terrorist attacks. The officials said Mr. Nosair had contacts through the mosque withthe brotherhood and other radical groups, which they did not identify.
Officials at the mosque yesterday praised the killing of Rabbi Kahane, a leader of a far-right political group that called for the expulsion of Arabs from the occupied territories in Israel. But they denied any connection to the murder and said the mosque, at 2824 Kennedy Boulevard, was only a place of worship.
 
A Largely Hidden World
 Mr. Nosair, who is now recovering in the Bellevue Hospital Center from a gunshot wound received after the Kahane slaying, rose from this insular world of radical Muslims who have established storefront mosques and schools in Brooklyn and Jersey City.
It is a hermetic world, distrustful of outsiders and rooted in the belief that Islam is the absolute truth in an alien and godless society. It is a world largely unknown to authorities, composed not only of operatives for the Palestine Liberation Organization, but also Muslim fundamentalists who sanction violence to further the cause of Islam.
These Muslims decry the moral degeneration of Americans and Western society. They have attracted disenfranchised Americans and Arab immigrants. And as these people suffer economic deprivation and often social ostracism, they cling to their religious tenets like shipwrecked sailors to a raft.
It was out of this world that Mr. Nosair, a 34-year-old maintenance worker at the Criminal Courts Building, at 111 Centre Street, rose to shoot Rabbi Kahane as he addressed a group of followers last week in a midtown hotel, the police say.
One of the 300 to 400 worshipers at the mosque is Sultan Ibraham El Gawli, an Egyptian-born travel agent and grocery store owner, who was convicted of attempting to smuggle 150 pounds of explosives, 100 blasting caps, remote detonators and a 9-mm automatic weapon silencer to the P.L.O. for use in Israel.
Mr. El Gawli and Mr. Nosair both come from Port Said in Egypt and have close family ties, according to several people who know the two men.
 
Killing Viewed as Legal
 Imam Shaker El Sayed, the principal of the Al-Ghazly Islamic School in Jersey City, where Mr. Nosair sent his children until the beginning of 1989, and many Muslims argue that the killing of Rabbi Kahane was not in violation of Islamic law.
The rabbi founded the Jewish Defense League in New York and led the far-right political Kach Party in Israel until it was banned for racism. He often sanctioned violent attacks against Arabs, and his followers were accused of carrying out several violent attacks in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
Discussing how some Muslims view the killing of the rabbi, Imam Shaker said: "It was not a violation, in the sense that Kahane adopted a position against all Arab and Muslims. He put himself in that category."
In the third-story mosque in Jersey City, Mr. Nosair, described as a quiet, introspective man, has become a hero.
 
Slaying 'a Great Thing'
 "He has done a great thing," said an Arab-American, who would not give his name but who said he managed a fast-food outlet. "If I had had the chance, I would have killed Kahane, too."
Debra Ragab, an American convert who lives in Jersey City at 143 Highland Avenue, where Mr. Nosair and his family once lived, said, "Our job now is to take care of his family."
Mrs. Ragab, 39, like many of the converts who refer to themselves as reverts, arguing that every child is born a Muslim, sees in Islam moral and ethical certainty. She said she became a Muslim after reading about Islam. Her conversion led her to seek an Muslim husband, to cover her head and to raise her three children in an Islamic household.
"I turned to Islam first, then I met my husband," she said. "I was interested in the religion first."
 
Religious Law Followed
 The world of devout Muslims is ruled by Islamic law, in much the same way Hasidic Jews rigorously follow precepts drawn up by Talmudic scholars for their daily affairs. The imam, during a recent conversation, for example, refused to shake the hand of a woman who was visiting. Alcohol is forbidden, and everyone must pray five times a day, a practice Mr. Nosair carried out in the Criminal Courts Building, according to fellow workers.
Many followers who feel powerless and alienated in American society come to believe that they, as devout Muslims, are carrying out the will of God.
"We are His agents," said a teacher at the Jersey City Islamic school. "We must implement and carry out His mission because we will be asked about it."
"Our short-term role is to introduce Islam," said this bearded teacher. "In the long term, we must save American society. Allah will ask me why I did not speak about Islam, because this piece of land is Allah's property."
When asked about the religion, Mrs. Ragab said, "Islam is truth."
 
Coptic Christians Concerned
 The large community of Coptic Christians who live in Jersey City, many with small, blue indigo crosses tattooed on their hands or wrists, are wary of the radical Muslims.
"They want to destroy America," said one Coptic shopkeeper from Egypt as he looked out a window toward the mosque. "They are a bad group."
Imam Shaker sees it differently. "Islam offers a comprehensive vision and understanding of life, death and suffering," he said. "The problematic paradoxes of life have answers that are convincing and simple."
"Compare," he said, "the American reality to the Islamic dream."

HEADLINE: After the Cold War: Frozen Chaos?

 BODY:
Food. Fuel for heat. Pharmaceuticals. Boots. Winter winds have just started blowing across the steppes but some necessities are already in short supply in Soviet cities. Unless the Soviet people get help from abroad, they could take to the streets of Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk in protest.
Chaos won't advance the prospects for democratic and economic reform -- a matter of grave concern for the U.S. as well as the Soviet Union. Simple humanity, as well as prudence, argues that the U.S. prepare and coordinate Western emergency aid efforts now, before it's too late to help. 
 The reasons for Soviet shortages are many. An economy that had trouble delivering the goods in the best of times is breaking down. Bumper crops rot in the fields as farmers, with few incentives to bring goods to market, ignore orders from above. Strikers disrupt mining and oilfields.
Meanwhile factory managers hoard, waiting for new and higher prices sure to come. Neither the Soviet leadership nor public seem able to cope with the confusion and contradictions of an economy in limbo between state control and functioning markets. Road and rail networks, never adequate, have been deliberately disrupted. Reportedly, angry nationalists blockade some trucks and trains and hijack others. Republics, farmers and managers withhold goods from the market -- and Communism begins to look like the shortest road from industrial revolution back to feudalism.
The temptation is to blame the victim. That's not only inhumane; it's dangerous. Americans have a huge stake in nurturing stable Soviet change. As the Soviets move to markets and as democratic forces gather strength, it's important not to starve these heartening developments. Just as Europeans have never forgotten what U.S. help meant to their war-devastated countries, so the Soviet people will remember that Americans helped them through hard times with food, fuel and other necessities.
Washington needs to prepare now. A high-level fact-finding team can be dispatched to determine what the Soviet people need and how best to supply it. Meeting with Moscow is essential to expedite aid shipments and avoid undermining its reformist leadership. The visitors would do well also to meet with local authorities, who can assure that aid reaches those who most need it.
The U.S. cannot and should not try on its own to meet Soviet emergency needs. Other Western countries can participate, in ways that use aid shipments to promote the development of private enterprise in Soviet retailing, transportation and food processing. Together, outside powers can help take the edge off the winter wind, and show the desperate Soviet people that they have the heart, and head, to help.

HEADLINE: Job Fair Is Bleak Portrait of Economic Mood

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Armed with resumes, years of experience and tenuous hopes for employment, thousands of people stood for three hours or more yesterday, waiting to enter a job fair and gain the attention of receptive industry recruiters.
As a sign of the current economic climate, the event, which was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan by a private job fair organizer called National Career Centers-USA Inc., offered a bleak snapshot of New York City's economic mood. Recent college graduates rubbed elbows with jaded longtime jobholders who had either been laid off or who feared the prospect was imminent. Along a line that snaked around four city blocks from Madison to Vanderbilt Avenues on East 45th and 46th Streets, well-dressed people carrying attache cases talked of recesssion, of months without income, of dreams scaled down. Billing the event as a minority professional recruiting center, advertisements said the focus would be on "women, African-American, Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, over-40, veteran and disabled professionals," and indeed the crowd seemed diverse, although there seemed to be few people over 50 years old in attendance. 
 Once they gained entrance to a second-floor exhibition room inside the hotel -- where tables had been set up by three dozen companies, including I.B.M., Campbell Soup, Home Box Office, Bear Stearns, Colgate-Palmolive, Xerox, Continental Grain, Brooklyn Union Gas and Walt Disney Imagineering, as well as the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Planned Parenthood Federation -- the job seekers found more lines and, in some cases, no positions in the specialties they were pursuing. Recruiters acknowedged that some of the positions were "in the proposal stage" and not yet established. But though many people expressed qualms about the way the fair was run, they left their resumes, hopeful that someone would single them out of the pile.
"This is an unusually large crowd," said Rob Imlay, regional director of the company that organized the fair, who estimated that 8,000 people would attend by the day's end. "It has to do in part with the fact that more companies are being more aggressive about affirmative action, and in part with the downsizing going on in New York. A lot of people here don't know what the future of the job they now hold is."
Entrants to the fair did not have to pay admission. It was subsidized by fees charged to the companies participating, but neither Mr. Imlay nor officers at his company's headquarters in Fayetteville, N.C., would divulge how much those fees were.
 
'It's Human Nature'
 One of the advertisements cited the possibility of "Salaries/Compensation to $250,000," but many people leaving the fair complained that the jobs seemed limited to sales and did not include other categories of work suggested in the advertisment. Mr. Imlay denied this was true.
"Just look at the brochure," he said, leafing through the fair's guide, which listed acounting, finance, information, services, consulting and administration among the possibilities. He dismissed the disatisfaction, saying, "It's human nature to complain if you don't get a job on the spot."
Still, even as people outside on the line learned of the complaints, few, if any, gave up, nor were they dissuaded by the length of the wait. "I'm not surprised by the line, I was prepared for it," said Raymond Robinson, a Jersey City resident who took the day off from his job on Wall Street as a retail securities and commodities broker.
"The retail brokerage business is lousy and I want to get into institutional brokerage," he said. "My entire career has been on Wall Street, and that is scary, so I would stand here another week if I had to. When Wall Street stops, everything else does, too."
 
'Means Nonemployed'
 Waiting behind Mr. Robinson, an architect who would not give his name said, "I have been self-employed, which means nonemployed, because I work in the luxury area, designing residences on Long Island." Business evaporated, he said, adding that "people are not doing the $150,000 renovations on the $1 million houses anymore."
Several teachers were in the crowd, among them Michael Prince of Manhattan, an elementary school mathematics teacher. "I'm fearful about the layoffs of teachers in the city, so I am trying to switch into sales," he said.
Masud Ahmed, who came to Astoria, Queens, from Bangladesh and is a graduate student in environmental science at Staten Island College, said he had been selected by the city for an assistant geologist position, and then that job was frozen. "So I'm here looking for something in hazardous waste," he said from his vantage point at the rear of the line.
"Sure I'm nervous, this is a recession," said Vasunder Bhashyam of Bronxville, N.Y., a father of two children who said he was laid off after 10 years as a computer engineer with a photocopy company in Stamford, Conn. "Twenty percent of the company was let go."
 
Sharing War Stories
 Most people seemed resigned to the travails of unemployment and were sharing war stories. But Yanick Dominijanni of Forest Hills, Queens, was angry as she looked across the street at the office of her former employer, the Manufacturers Hanover.
"They started laying off people on Oct. 18," she said. "As I was the oldest one there -- 49 -- and had 10 years on the job in liaison in corporate banking operations, I should have had seniority. But I was told I didn't fit the company and was forced to resign. How could I not fit after 10 years? I am a single parent; I have a son in his freshman year of premedical studies at New York University. I'm here to save my son from being kicked out of school and because of the need to support myself."
In direct contrast was the equanimity expressed by Mihaeli Mihai, a mechanical engineer who came to New York from Bucharest a year ago. She had stood in line for more than two hours.
"This is nothing, she said. "In Romania, you stand in line longer for food."

HEADLINE: No Wonder Fewer and Fewer Want to Accept Public Office

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your disingenuous, innuendo-laden report on "a computerized study conducted by The New York Times of the approximately $20 million in contributions" received by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York (Nov. 1) takes outrageous liberties with several case studies -- including mine. 
 Offering no evidence (because there is none), you hint that as a result of my contributions to Governor Cuomo's campaigns, I had bought myself a coveted government position, in which I award lucrative contracts to others. Absolutely wrong on both counts.
For one thing, I never contributed with an eye toward joining public service. I was happy and successful in private life, and joined the administration only after being invited by the Governor. I do love my work -- and I think I've made a difference -- but to suggest I longed for the chance to forfeit millions of dollars in potential income in return for my job title would make me laugh if the mere thought of it didn't move me to tears.
As for the "contracts" I allegedly dangle in front of others, no chairman of the Urban Development Corporation, including me, is empowered to make such decisions alone. Contracts are considered at monthly meetings open to the public and voted in public by a seven-member board. I couldn't make large contract awards if I wanted to.
Besides, what are these "contracts"? Clearly, you have tried to suggest something tawdry. Do you mean contracts to establish day-care centers at companies we help attract to or expand in New York? Contracts to increase productivity and retrain workers in aging plants? Contracts to incubate high-tech industries?
Or do you use the word loosely to include the incentive programs we created to lure companies to New York from other states -- to attract foreign investment and open foreign markets -- or to establish opportunity zones in the state's most distressed areas?
We hardly need apologize for the programs or the results: more than a million new jobs in seven years and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in poorer communities.
Citizens who justifiably demand that their governments hire the best and the brightest shouldn't be surprised to learn that fewer and fewer are willing to give up the opportunities of private enterprise to share a goldfish bowl with the piranha of a biased press.
I contribute my time (I donate my entire salary to charity) because I admire and respect Mario Cuomo -- because I think he makes a difference. I contribute to his campaigns because I believe in him, because I can afford to and because the system under which we elect leaders today makes ridiculous financial demands on all candidates. As the Governor likes to say, any jackass can kick down a barn. It takes good people to build one.

HEADLINE: Big-City Mayors Focus On Problems and Goals

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Joined by his counterparts from nearly three dozen big cities around the nation, Mayor David N. Dinkins played host yesterday to an "urban summit" in which they conferred, conversed and otherwise hobnobbed on how best to make their cities' case to Washington and the world.
"Today we come from many different types of cities to step back, to reflect, to discuss and to set goals," Mr. Dinkins told the group, which arrived on Sunday for two days of mostly private sessions that are to end today. "Because, as we all well know, if our cities do not survive, our country cannot survive." 
 While mayors meet regularly in a number of national organizations, Mr. Dinkins proposed this conference last spring as a way for the leaders of cities with more than 200,000 people each to talk about their particular problems and to plan alliances to lobby for more Federal aid, international trade and public support for urban needs.
Just how well the mayors' requests will fare amid a competing horus of national demands remains to be seen. Yesterday, the 35 of them, including Mr. Dinkins, conducted their business in private, holding closed seminars at the Sheraton Centre hotel in Manhattan on topics from "Fiscal Challenges" to "The Global Economy."
 
'The Important Thing'
 "The important thing for me so far is the opportunity to meet and talk and strategize with some 30-odd people who have probably the most unique job in American politics," Mayor Art Agnos of San Francisco said in a break between sessions. In other mayors' meetings, which include leaders from small towns to huge cities, he said, "there isn't the opportunity to focus with this kind of intensity."
Mayor Sidney Barthelemy of New Orleans said one goal was to make a statement to national leaders and residents of rural and suburban areas: "Guess what? Cities are important to your survival and my survival, and you and I need them."
Whatever else it was, yesterday's gathering was a splendid junket, an opportunity for the mayors to bask in radio and television coverage in the country's media capital, and, in some cases, coverage by hometown journalists who followed them here. On an icy clear fall evening, they dined at Windows on the World in lower Manhattan.
 
Gun Control and Housing
 It was also a chance for Mr. Dinkins, who has had his share of troubles lately, to forget them for a moment, or at least to compare them with others grappling with crime, drugs and fiscal headaches. Mr. Dinkins, who persuaded various local businesses to donate hotel rooms and other services, pressed issues dear to his heart, from stricter national gun control to more Federal funds for housing.
"Cities are the engines that drive every one of the regional economies in the nation," said Mayor Bob Bolen of Fort Worth.
"We are the best that America has to offer" in commerce, culture and social commitment, Mr. Bolen said. But, he added, cities must fight harder to get their share of Federal aid.

HEADLINE: Chevron Turned Down On Tankers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12

 BODY:
County officials in Santa Barbara, Calif., voted today to deny permission to a consortium led by the Chevron Corporation to use tankers to ship oil from a large field off the Southern California coast to three Los Angeles area refineries.
The decision by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors means a longstanding dispute between the Chevron group and government officials in California will continue to simmer. For nearly three years, Chevron and 17 partners have been ready to begin extracting oil from the Santa Maria basin off Point Arguello. But the companies have been stymied by local and state opposition to the $2.5 billion project, which remains in mothballs. Santa Barbara officials have wanted Chevron to use a pipeline instead of tankers because they view that method of transporting oil as safer, but the two sides have been unable to agree on a plan.
 
Issue in Larger Debate
 The dispute over oil transporation in Santa Barbara has become the focus of national debate over the correct balance between energy needs and environmental concerns. The issue has become more prominent only since the Persian Gulf crisis erupted in August and questions about the nation's reliance on foreign oil have been asked more frequently. 
 The decision, a 4-to-1 vote by the Board of Supervisors, followed a recommendation from the Energy Division of the Santa Barbara County Resource Management Department that said an existing pipeline system that reaches from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles is a viable alternative. Chevron has strongly disagreed, saying that given the low quality of the Arguello crude, such an alternative is economically and technically impractical.
The permit would have allowed Chevron to use double-hull tankers for four years to move oil to three Los Angeles area refineries while it built a new pipeline. Chevron has conducted preliminary studies on building a $200 million underground pipeline along land owned by the Southern Pacific railroad.
G. Michael Marcy, a Chevron spokesman, said that the company would consider appealing the decision and taking legal action.
 
300 Million Barrels
 Today's vote was the latest in a string of victories for environmentalists and disappointments for Chevron, which has been waiting since December 1987 for permission to tap into what is the largest domestic oil field to be discovered since Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 1969. Oil experts say the field, with more than 300 million barrels of recoverable reserves, could produce nearly 100,000 barrels a day.
Chevron originally tried to build a pipeline to Los Angeles but gave up in 1987 because of political opposition from Los Angeles and other cities along the pipeline route. The company then asked Santa Barbara County for an interim permit to move oil by tanker. That was approved in May 1989 but was revoked on appeal by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency, on the ground that the oil companies involved in the Point Arguello project had not made adequate precautions to clean up any spills.
The Board of Supervisors had supported Chevron's permit last year on the basis that Chevron would have switched to a pipeline within a short time.

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Shows Caution In Spending Sudden Profits

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The American oil industry's response to the surge in oil prices in recent months is to sit tight and hope prices do not crash after the crisis in the Persian Gulf ends.
Chief executives of several oil companies, here for the annual meeting of the American Petroleum Institute, said in separate sessions today that higher prices were giving some of them a windfall. But these gains cannot be turned into huge investments to find more oil, they said, because money spent on exploration and production is slow to earn a return, and the higher prices are unlikely to last. In fact, several experts said, prices may plunge with a vengeance. 
 "This is a long-term business," said Lawrence G. Rawl, the chairman of the Exxon Corporation. "You don't turn the money on because the oil price spikes, and turn it off because the price goes down. Every time someone clears his throat in the Middle East or elsewhere, the price goes up and down."
Exxon's capital budget this year is $8.5 billion, Mr. Rawl said, and next year's will be higher, "but not by a whole lot."
As he emerged from the institute's board meeting here, Mr. Rawl told reporters that making investment decisions was difficult amid the uncertainty. "When prices go up and down like a window shade, it creates problems, not just for you, but for anybody in a long-term business," he said.
Executives of other companies made similar comments. Texaco Inc. will raise its capital budget to $3.1 billion in 1991, from $2.9 billion, said James W. Kinnear, president and chief executive officer. But, he added, "we try not to run up and down with the morning newspaper."
The price of oil has fallen in recent days, to $31.87 a barrel. But it closed over $40 in mid-October, and is still nearly 40 percent higher than the level at which it was trading when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The expectation that prices will plunge from this level is in marked contrast to the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, said Thomas A. Petrie of Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver brokerage that specializes in oil stocks. "There is no excess of optimism or expectation," he said. "It is important to maintain a sober attitude, but not to block well-crafted reinvestment plans for the cash flows now being generated."
Mr. Petrie said the stock market shares an assessment that high prices cannot last. When Iraq invaded Kuwait and the price of crude oil took off from the low $20's it was trading at then, oil company stocks outperformed the market. But when the price got above $30 a barrel at the end of August, the market soured on the stocks. Stock prices of five of the six biggest international oil companies have since fallen, as have 10 of the 11 big domestic companies, while one is unchanged.
Independent oil producers are not burdened with refining or marketing operations that can become unprofitable in times of rising crude prices, but even among that group the stocks of 21 of 30 companies have declined.
The market's reading, Mr. Petrie said, is that "this is too much of a good thing, and in fact could be described as a bad thing."
 
Potential for a Glut
 The potential has emerged for a glut of oil once the Persian Gulf crisis ends, with any post-embargo exports by Iraq and Kuwait likely to end up as a surplus on the world market.
"If production from Iraq and Kuwait comes back, which is a real possibility, OPEC will be back in the problems very similar to what they had early this year, except there has been a change in OPEC," said John B. Boatwright, an economist with Exxon.
Oil analysts presume that after the crisis ends, Iraq will no longer be in a position to enforce production limits by bullying its neighbors. As a result, Mr. Boatwright said, "a future production agreement would be even more difficult."
 
Finely Balanced Market
 Even without an end to the standoff over Kuwait, production will eventually outstrip demand, experts here said. Several described the current market as finely balanced, with oil production and especially refining capacity strained to the limit. But Mr. Boatwright said that by next summer "demand will be 1.5 million barrels a day less than OPEC capacity."
"You can make your own conclusion about what that will do to prices," he added.
James H. Ross, the president and chief executive of BP America Inc., the United States subsidiary of the British Petroleum Company P.L.C., said demand for OPEC oil in the first quarter of next year would run 20.5 million barrels a day, while production is now 22.5 million barrels a day and Saudi Arabia is planning to pump even more. Prices will stay high while there is a fear of war, he said, but if the perception took hold that the price would plunge, that is exactly what would come to pass, because purchasers would delay buying to wait for a bargain, demand would fall and prices would drop in response. "OPEC needs to get its act together, whoever OPEC is," Mr. Ross said.
 
The Role of Iraq
 The chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, Theodore Eck, said, "Everyone knows Iraq's going to come back into the market, and clearly Saudi Arabia's going to make a place for them, but how it fits together I don't know."
Discussing the difficulty of predicting future market conditions, an executive of one big oil company said that every year he presents his board with a proposal for capital spending, prefacing his remarks by saying, "We face an uncertain situation." This year, he said, he would say the same thing but would pound the table as he said it.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars; Cut by Fed Is Expected

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
A relaxation of war nerves coupled with expectations that a reduction in interest rates could come as quickly as today or tomorrow helped push stock prices sharply higher yesterday for the second straight session.
Trading on higher ground for most of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,540.35, up 51.74 points, in a fairly busy session. With Friday's increase of 44.80, the Dow has gained more than 96 points in just the two days.
 
 The surge led some analysts to forecast further gains -- particularly because a cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve is now viewed as practically a sure thing.
 
Blocks of New Money
 Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, the Wall Street research firm, said that $343 million in new money came into the stock exchange yesterday in big blocks of 10,000 shares or more and that $195 million entered in smaller trades.
That means, he said, that "the little guy, the big guy, the institutions, they were all active."
Asked what helped the market, Philip J. Roth, chief market technician for Dean Witter Reynolds, said, "It was obvious today: lower oil prices and the expectation of lower interest rates by the Fed."
With the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf fading into the coming year, oil tumbled again. After falling $1.64 on Friday, prices fell $2.02 a barrel yesterday, to $31.87. [Page D8.]
 
Debate on Move to War
 A national debate has begun to unfold in the last few days among political and government leaders and prominent academics over whether the United States has been moving too quickly down the road to war. And yesterday, seeking to calm the critics, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, "We don't want to go to war." Like many Congressman, President Bush, he added, prefers to "be cautious."
As for the rate cut, Mr. Roth noted that under Alan Greenspan as chairman, the Fed's policy had been to cut rates a quarter-point at a time. A new cut, prompted by mounting evidence that the economy may have slipped into a recession, is expected shortly after the Fed's Open Market Committee discusses monetary policy today,
The New York Stock Exchange, which intervenes whenever the index moves 50 points or more in either direction, stepped in yesterday at 3:41 P.M. after the average had risen that far. For the remainder of the session, to help stabilize prices, orders by index arbitragers to buy stocks could not be executed at prices higher than the previous sale price. Index arbitrage is a form of program trading in which traders try to profit from the difference between the prices of stock index futures contracts and the underlying stocks.
Program traders were a big factor in the market's advance, Mr. Birinyi said, with three waves of buying lifting the Dow more than 19 points.
Activity rose to a relatively strong 161.4 million shares, from 145.2 million shares on Friday. The new money helped 1,163 stocks advance, while only 381 declined; 14 rose to new highs while 38 fell to new lows.
The sharp rise in stock prices, which raised the Dow blue chips a little more than 2 percent, also spilled over into the smaller over-the-counter stocks, with the Nasdaq composite index rising close to 3 percent. The Amex market value index, representing other small stocks, trailed the blue chips.
Traders took heart in the strong leadership of I.B.M., the Joe Montana of the stock market. I.B.M. rose 2 3/4 on Friday, to crash through $110, and yesterday jumped another 2 3/4, to 113. It topped the Big Board's most-active list, with 3.5 million shares changing hands.
Other high-tech stocks that followed its lead were Motorola, up 2, to 57 5/8; Compaq Computer, up 2 1/4, to 51 3/8; Honeywell, up 1 3/4, to 91 3/8, and Digital Equipment, up 1 7/8, to 51 1/4.
Noting that financial stocks were exceptionally strong, Mr. Birinyi said that that suggested "rates really are going to be cut."
American Express, the second-most-active Big Board stock, rose 2, to 21 5/8, on nearly 3 million shares; Fannie Mae rose 1 1/2, to 32, on 2.6 million; BankAmerica climbed 1 1/2, to 23 3/4; Citicorp rose 1, to 13 1/4, and General Electric gained 1 5/8, to 55 3/8.
Airlines yesterday were a big beneficiary of the oil-price slide. The Dow transportation index jumped nearly 4 percent, led by AMR, up 1 7/8, to 48 1/8; Delta Air Lines 2, to 57 3/8, and UAL 4 5/8, to 100 1/4, although part of the UAL rise seemed related to takeover developments. UAL agreed earlier to buy Pan Am's London-New York routes.
 
Tokyo Stocks Climb
TOKYO, Tuesday, Nov. 13 (REUTERS) -- Stocks in Tokyo were sharply higher at midday today, helped by a stronger yen and weaker oil prices. At the end of the morning session, the 225-share Nikkei index was up 773.04 points, or 3.4 percent, to 23,704.84.

HEADLINE: FREE-TRADE TALKS IMPERILED BY FIGHT ON FARM SUBSIDIES

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Talks to liberalize world trade were threatened with collapse today in an impasse over the subsidies that the European Community gives its farmers.
The community made an offer to reduce those subsidies, but the United States, Australia and other countries that depend on farm exports said the proposal was too meager to talk about. These nations contend that for domestic political reasons, Germany and France in particular subsidize inefficient small farms and encourage them to dump their products on world markets and preserve home markets for themselves. 
 Trade officials in Geneva, where the talks are taking place, said the four-year round of negotiations had reached a standstill and that plans to complete the talks early next month were in jeopardy.
 
Situation Called Grave
 "We are now in a very grave situation," said Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the Geneva-based organization overseeing the talks. "Until and unless some major political decisions are taken, the negotiations will not move forward."
The deadlock could torpedo the whole round of negotiations, which seek to set liberal new rules in 15 sectors with trade totaling $1.5 trillion. The talks are intended to write new rules for sectors that are increasingly important in today's economy: investment, intellectual property and services, including banking, telecommunications and aviation.
If the talks succeed it could enable the United States and other low-cost food producers like Argentina to export more of their farm products. It would also make it easier for American banks to open branches and for publishers to have copyrights honored worldwide. Failure of the talks could result in more unilateral protective moves by many countries.
 
'Need Something to Change'
 Many countries that export farm goods asserted that the European Community's offer to cut agricultural subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years was too modest even to discuss. Rufus Yerxa, a United States deputy trade representative in Geneva, said in a telephone interview that the talks were "near collapse."
"We're in a very serious situation," he added, "and we need something to change to bring us out of it."
The final phase of the 105-nation talks, which are known as the Uruguay Round because they began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 1986, is scheduled to take place in Brussels Dec. 3 to 7.
After repeated failures to reach a common position, the 12 community nations agreed last week to propose the 30 percent cut over 10 years, dating from 1986. But the United States and the Cairns Group have proposed cutting farm supports by 75 percent over 10 years, with export subsidies cut 90 percent.
The Cairns Group of 14 nations that are exporters of farm goods is headed by Australia and includes Argentina, Brazil and Canada, which are seeking far deeper cuts in farm protection than those proposed by the Community. The group, whose other members are Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay, takes its name from the town in Queensland, Australia, where their representatives organized in 1986 in preparation for the Uruguay Round.
 
 Markets Viewed as Stolen
 Farm trade, which is not now covered by international trade rules, has become the linchpin of the talks since many nations that export farm goods have said they would not sign an overall accord without large cuts in farm protection like export subsidies, which they say steals their markets.
Today, about 2,000 French farmers blocked highways to protest the community's proposal. On Tuesday some 10,000 farmers are expected to demonstrate in Geneva.
 Trade officials hope there will be some narrowing of differences between Washington and Brussels on Tuesday when President Bush meets in Washington with Jacques Delors, the president of the community's executive commission, and Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, which holds the community's six-month chairmanship.
 
 Threat of Walkout
 Officials from many countries that export farm goods say the talks could be doomed if the community treats its offer as final. Argentina and several other nations have even threatened to walk out unless the community agrees to consider deeper cuts in farm protection.
"Their offer falls far short of the mark," Julius Katz, a United States deputy trade representative, said in a telephone interview. "It is not yet clear that the community is prepared to go beyond its initial offer."
In a statement issued today in Geneva, Mr. Dunkel, who is the chairman of the talks, said that unless there were "some basic changes in present postions in the next few hours or at most the next few days I do not see how we will be able" to have a successful outcome next month.
He added that in the view of a number of participants the community's offer "does not constitute an adequate basis on which to conduct substantive negotations."
 
Lag on Services Criticized
 In his statement, Mr. Dunkel also criticized a lack of progress on liberalizing trade in services. The members of the European Community and other countries criticize Washington for dragging its feet on agreeing to a liberalization in shipping, aviation and telecommunications.
Because of the snags in negotiations over farm supports, some officials say the final phase of the talks may have to be postponed, a prospect American officials strongly oppose because of a deadline imposed by Congress.
Raymond MacSharry, the community's farm commissioner, today denied that the talks were falling apart because of the community's offer. He predicted that the negotiations would have a successful outcome once other countries "stop accusing the community of being the sinner."
"We've all been supporting agriculture," he said.
 
Cost of $250 Billion Seen
 The United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina and many third world countries argue that their farms produce at lower cost than the small farms of Europe. They add that cuts in agricultural protection would allow their farmers to capture a larger share of world farm trade. Economists say farm protectio costs the industrial world $250 billion a year in extra taxes and inflated food prices.
"We can't have a package without an agreement in agriculture," said one GATT official. "People say to the GATT secretariat, 'Wave a magic wand. There must be some magical way of doing this.' Well there isn't."
Last Tuesday, in their eighth attempt to adopt a common negotiating position, community ministers proposed cutting farm supports by 30 percent. But the community's proposal was ambiguous about making cuts in export subsidies, which Washington says are particularly insidious in distorting trade.
 
'Ridiculous and Incompetent'
 When the community's executive commission originally proposed a 30 percent cut, France and Germany opposed it as going too far. Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands were the only community nations pushing vigorously for less farm protection, with the British Agriculture Minister, John Gummer, saying that French and German opposition was making the community seem "ridiculous and incompetent."
The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl opposes big cuts partly because, with elections set for Dec. 2, it is eager not to displease Germany's farmers. France, the community's leading exporter of farm goods, is hesitant to cut farm supports because the Government faced mass protests last summer in which many of its two million farmers demanded more aid to help them cope with drought and plunging beef prices.
The community's 10 million farmers, a potent political force, contend that the group's proposal goes too far, making it difficult for the organization to agree to greater cuts.
 
Reasons for German Assent
 European officials said Germany finally agreed to the executive commission's proposal for 30 percent cuts for two reasons: Germany is Europe's largest exporting nation, and it feared that it would be hurt in many non-farm sectors if the Uruguay Round fell apart over agriculture. Second, Germany won commitments that any income losses its farmers suffered because of reduced farm supports would be offset by, for example, direct income grants. Washington officials say grants would be preferable to price supports and export subsidies because they do not inflate production or distort trade flows.
Getting France to agree to the executive commission's proposal for 30 percent cuts was more difficult. France insisted on changes that American officials say have watered down the proposal, which most countries already said was inadequate.
Louis Mermaz, the French Agriculture Minister, insisted on omitting a paragraph that called for reducing the community barriers to imports of cheap food by 30 percent. The French also insisted on and won changes to make the language in the community's proposal far more ambiguous about how fast export subsidies should be reduced. Paris also had the community rule out making export subsidies a separate subject in the negotiations.

Chip Indicator Is Unchanged

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Orders for computer chips rose slightly in the United States while shipments declined in October, but the semiconductor industry's leading indicator remained unchanged from September, a trade group reported today.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, based in San Jose, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95 for the three-month period that ended in October, unchanged from September and down from a revised figure of 1 in August.
The book-to-bill ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 0.95 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $95 was ordered, indicating that demand has declined.
At $1.19 billion, three-month orders for October were up slightly from the period that ended in September, and 5.1 percent higher than the comparable figure last year, which was $1.14 billion.
Three-month average shipments for October totaled $1.26 billion, up seven-tenths of 1 percent from September at $1.25 billion. At $1.18 billion, United States market shipments for the month of October were down 13.8 percent from September's $1.37 billion.

HEADLINE: London Betting on Itself And on Canary Wharf

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
When Olympia & York Developments Ltd. decided in 1987 to undertake Canary Wharf, the biggest real estate development project in Europe, Paul Reichmann, the president of the family-owned company, said he was prepared to live through at least two downturns in the real estate market here.
The Toronto-based developer, which is staking nearly 4 billion ($7.86 billion) on Canary Wharf, is now going through the first slump -- and without too much difficulty considering that London is in the grips of the worst real estate downturn since the mid-1970's. 
 As the complex of buildings at Canary Wharf steadily rises above the Isle of Dogs, 2.5 miles to the east of London's financial district, rents are falling and vacancies are climbing in central London. Several developers have filed for bankruptcy protection or have liquidated. Others are believed to be on the ropes.
There is more at stake here than the performance of Olympia & York, one of the largest developers of commercial real estate in New York. How the project fares will largely determine the merits of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's ambitious plan to revive the Docklands, the derelict area surrounding the wharf that in the heyday of the British empire was the home port for much of the country's vast merchant fleet.
Mr. Reichmann remains optimistic about Canary Wharf and the assumption on which it was built. He is still betting that London will remain the dominant financial center of Europe after the end of 1992, when the European Community plans to have eliminated trade and commercial barriers among its 12 member nations.
For now, Olympia & York is trying to line up tenants for the 4.5 million square feet of office space in the nine buildings that make up the first phase of Canary Wharf. In an effort to lay off some of its risks to banks, the company is also trying to refinance the first phase of the project.
When completed in 1997 or so, the 71-acre site will include 26 buildings, with 10 million square feet of office space; up to 500,000 square feet of stores, restaurants and other leisure facilities; a 400-bedroom hotel, and parking for 6,500 cars.
Eight of the nine buildings in the first phase, including an 800-foot tower that will be the tallest building in Britain, will be largely completed by mid-1991. Olympia & York says it has pre-leased 54 percent of the office space.
While "obviously I would be happier if 75 to 80 percent were pre-let, I'm hopefu it will be at that level next summer," said Michael Dennis, the Canadian who is chief executive of Olympia & York Canary Wharf Ltd.
Smaller tenants will begin to move in next summer. The first major one, Morgan Stanley, will follow in the fall. And Texaco plans to take up residence in the ninth building in mid-1992.
 
A Change of Heart
 Others that have signed leases include Credit Suisse First Boston, American Express, Manufacturers Hanover, London Wall Holdings, a big British insurer; Ogilvy & Mather, the ad agency, and The Daily Telegraph, the British newspaper.
Real estate experts are impressed with the leasing effort. "They are doing remarkably well," said Roger Nield, an executive at Chesterton, a major real estate agency.
But Olympia & York has also suffered some setbacks. Two big prospective tenants -- Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd. and Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising giant -- changed their minds about Canary Wharf. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Economic Development, which is being created to finance the rebuilding of Eastern Europe, is not even considering Canary Wharf for its headquarters.
Olympia & York executives acknowledge having to offer juicy enticements to attract tenants. Analysts say these include assuming tenants' existing leases. Olympia & York even bought The Daily Telegraph's building in the South Quay section of the Docklands.
While Olympia & York did not get burned when it used similar tactics to woo companies to New York's World Financial Center in the 1980's, the moves increase its bet on the London market. Besides Canary Wharf, the company has joint ventures in other areas of the Docklands and owns sizable minority stakes in two big London developers, Stanhope Properties P.L.C. and Rosehaugh P.L.C.
 
Disclosure on U.S. Portfolio
 The first phase of Canary Wharf is expected to cost 1.4 billion ($2.75 billion). So far, Olympia & York has invested more than 800 million ($1.57 billion) from internal funds, bank credit lines or money borrowed against its North American properties.
Now, the company is negotiating with banks to replace that with money secured by Canary Wharf buildings. Mr. Dennis said Olympia & York was on the verge of completing a 500 million ($982 million) general-project-financing deal and was beginning discussions about a 600 million ($1.18 billion) loan secured by the tower.
The refinancing efforts, and the disclosure last month that Olympia & York was peddling a 20 percent stake in its United States real estate portfolio to outside investors, touched off speculation that the company needed cash for Canary Wharf. But Mr. Dennis insisted that Canary Wharf had no cash problems and said that the refinancing followed a timetable announced at the beginning of the project in 1987.
While banks have become more skittish about real estate lending, Mr. Dennis said they should lend to the project "given the extent of the equity we have in the project, the fact it is nearing completion and the extent of the leasing accomplished."
But Mr. Dennis said he will worry if Britain's interest rates do not drop sharply in the next few months.
 
Vacancy Rate Up Sharply
 The British Government cut its base interest rate in October to 14 percent from 15 percent. But further easing is unlikely soon.
As a result, real estate experts do not expect the London market to begin recovering before the end of 1991. And their forecast assumes that the Persian Gulf crisis does not result in a major disruption in oil supplies and a significant deepening of the shallow recession that economists believe Britain is entering.
The vacancy rate in the City, as the financial district is known, has risen to about 12 percent, from about 2 percent in 1986, and is expected to hit 15 percent or more this year or next.
Meanwhile, rents for new leases in central London have dropped by 8 to 15 percent this year. Those for new buildings in prime locations in the City have fallen to about 55 ($108.05) a square foot, from about 64 last year, said Simon P. Ward, a partner at Jones Lang Wootton, the real estate appraisers and brokers. "Significant growth in rents, by which I mean a 5 to 10 percent annual rate, is unlikely before 1993 at the earliest," he said.
Whether the slump seriously hurts Canary Wharf remains to be seen. The economic slowdown could provide an incentive for cost-conscious companies to move there. Thanks to low land costs and Government tax breaks, Olympia & York can charge rents of 27 to 30 ($53.04 to $58.95) a square foot -- about two-thirds the typical rent in the City.
 
Modern Quarters
 In addition, Canary Wharf's buildings will be state of the art in everything from air-conditioing to their capability to house computer and telecommunications systems. The same cannot be said about much of the office space in central London: 45 percent predates World War II, 31 percent was built between the war and 1979 and 24 percent after that, according to Jones Lang Wootton.
This lack of modern office space was a major reason Paul Reichmann and his two brothers were willing to undertake a project as big as Canary Wharf. With a unified Europe bringing increasing competition and opportunities to the area, Mr. Reichmann argues, companies will become increasingly willing to move out of central London into these kind of quarters.
But the Reichmanns also decided that for Canary Wharf to compete with central London, it had to be a stand-alone business center.
In addition to the shops, offices and hotels, the plan calls for Canary Wharf to offer a transportation system that is vastly superior to London's, with roads, subways, a light railway, a catamaran river bus service on the Thames and proximity to two nearby airports. Olympia & York is contributing at least 500 million ($982 million) to help pay for all this. And the British Government has pledged 3 billion ($5.89 billion).
Real estate experts say that once these plans are completed, Canary Wharf -- and the Docklands -- will flourish. But that may not be until the mid- to late 1990's. In the meantime, Olympia & York faces the formidable task of wooing corporations to an area that looks more like a construction site than a place of work and that can be a nightmare to reach.
 
No Rush to the Top
 Although the first trees will be planted next month, many of the basic improvements and the expansions of the transportation system will not be completed until the end of 1992 or early 1993. And Olympia & York does not expect the extension of London's subway to Canary Wharf to be completed before the first half of 1996.
"Obviously we moved faster than the Government agencies working on various transportation improvements, who are trailing us by about a year," Mr. Dennis said.
Despite the challenges, he does not sound worried. Indeed, he seems in no rush to rent the top floors of the tower. While most of the deals in the tower have averaged about 30 (58.95) a square foot, he says the top section should command at least 10 ($19.65) more. "If we opened and had the top quarter of the tower left, it wouldn't dismay me at all," he said.
Nor does he consider the pullouts by Merrill Lynch and Saatchi & Saatchi to be a bad omen. Analysts agree, noting that both have suffered financial setbacks and are retrenching.
Yet even those real estate experts who are impressed by progress say it is not clear whether Olympia & York will make money on Canary Wharf. "It's far too early to tell," said John J. S. Coventry, a partner at Hillier Parker May & Rowden, a property agent and consulting firm.
Mr. Dennis says he has no doubts. "We expect the first phase to be a financial success and not to have to wait 10 years as some have suggested," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Treasury Securities Up Abroad

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prospects of a further easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board pushed prices of Treasury securities higher yesterday in Europe.
Because of the Veterans Day holiday, trading did not take place in the United States. And financial markets were closed in Tokyo as Emperor Akihito was enthroned. 
 Speculation that the Fed may decide to push a key short-term interest rate down another notch has heightened in advance of today's meeting of the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee.
Despite lingering concerns about inflation, most credit market analysts said that signs of deepening economic weakness would prompt members of the committee to approve a quarter-point cut in the overnight Federal funds rate, to 7.50 percent from 7.75 percent.
"The Fed could move this week, or they could put it off for a few more days," said James Fralick, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Dealers certainly anticipate another ease in policy, and are willing to hold the securities they bought at last week's Treasury refunding auctions."
 
Futures Prices in Bonds
 Prices of Treasury securities of all maturities advanced in London, with the biggest gains recorded among longer-dated notes and bonds. Bond futures prices posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade.
In the cash market, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 7/32 in London yesterday, up 27/32, to yield 8.54 percent. Late Friday in New York, the Treasury's benchmark bond was offered at a price to yield 8.61 percent.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 21/32 in London, up 12/32, to yield 8.40 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 101 3/8, up 3/32, to yield 7.53 percent.
Rates of short-term Treasury bills dipped slightly.
During London trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.03 percent, down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.01 percent.
Because of the Veterans Day holiday, the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, normally held on Mondays, was scheduled for today.
In Chicago, the nearby Treasury bond contract rose by 29/32, to 93 14/ 32. Trading volume in bond contracts at the Board of Trade was heavy.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds was extremely light. Dealers said prices of widely quoted issues were little changed.

HEADLINE: Survey Sees Recession

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The majority of top economists in a monthly survey believe a recession will begin before the end of the year, but most predict it will be brief and relatively mild, a prominent economic newsletter reports.
The publication, Blue Chip Economic Indicators, said in its latest report that 80 percent of the 55 economists in its survey thought a downturn would start before the end of 1990. Another 5 percent said the slump would start in 1991.
"It now seems very likely that America's longest peacetime expansion is about to come to an end," wrote the Blue Chip editor, Robert J. Eggert of Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. in Sedona, Ariz.
The Blue Chip survey found three-fourths of the respondents expected any downturn to last no more than two or three quarters. "An even larger majority -- 82 percent -- anticipate that the recession will be relatively mild," the newsletter said.
The survey participants represent many of the nation's top banks, brokerage companies, corporations, economic forecasting organizations and universities.

HEADLINE: Debate on Persian Gulf Enlivens Bishops' Meeting

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops, gathered here for their fall meeting, strongly backed an appeal today for American restraint in the Persian Gulf.
The gulf question injected a surprise into what had promised to be a rather routine meeting, more concerned with institutional housekeeping than any of the conflicts sharply dividing Catholics. 
 By a vote of 249 to 14, the bishops supported a letter that Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, chairman of the bishops' international policy committee, sent last week to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Outside the Omni Shoreham Hotel, people who favor admitting women to the prieshood blessed varieties of bread, from sourdough loaves to saltines and bran muffins, and drink in what they called a women's eucharist.
 
Dissent on Other Issues
 A group of lay people calling for democratic changes in the church held a parallel conference in Silver Spring, Md. And conservative Catholics complained that the bishops were departing from church teaching by considering a document authorizing sex education in Catholic classrooms.
The letter on the gulf outlined the limits that Catholic teaching considers essential for warfare to be considered moral, including a just cause, the exhaustion of peaceful alternatives and discrimination between military targets and civilian centers. While not ruling out military action, Archbishop Mahony suggested that there was a great danger of gravely violating these limits if war broke out.
The uneasiness among the bishops over the Bush Administration's policy in the gulf was further indicated by the debate in what was almost the first order of business at the meeting, which will run through Thursday.
Even the endorsement of Archbishop Mahony's letter left many of the prelates unsatisfied that they had sufficiently addressed the gulf question, and what might what might have been a routine vote turned into a full-scale discussion.
 
More Discussion Is Set
 Bishop Michael H. Kenny of Juneau, Alaska, protested that the bishops "would discredit our credibility" if they did not offer Catholics specific "moral directions" on the gulf crisis.
"It seems to me that we don't hesitate to tell people what to do in regard to abortion or in regard to use of a condom," he said. "Are we willing to be so clear in reference to weapons of incalculable destruction?"
The bishops then voted by more than two-thirds to revise their agenda so that the gulf policy could be discussed more fully at a closed session on Wednesday afternoon. Archbishop Mahony expressed disappointment at the decision to discuss the gulf crisis in closed session. "I think this kind of discussion is better held in open forum," he said later.
 
Statement by O'Connor
 This morning's debate and vote showed that concern about recent American steps in the gulf extended well beyond those bishops who are frequent critics of American diplomacy and military policy.
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York said he felt "anxieties even apart from the dangers of war." He raised the question of expenditures overseas at a time of economic hardship in the United States.
Apart from the gulf discussion, the mood in the conference was one of business as usual. The bishops listened calmly to reports on the recent synod in Rome dealing with the training of priests, on Vatican finances, on ministry among Hispanic Catholics and on new guidelines for approving biblical translations, religious educational materials and sex-education programs.
"It looks like a tame meeting," said Bishop John S. Cummins of Oakland, Calif.

HEADLINE: Encinitas Journal;
Accident of Geography Prompts Local Protest

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENCINITAS, Calif., Nov. 10

 BODY:
The bill to the Fed eral Government, for $225,356.20, covers items like the policing of migrants' campsites and the establishment of a hiring hall for day laborers. But as much as anything it is a cry of protest over an undeniable fact of geography.
Because the citizens of this small, affluent city live just 38 miles from the Mexican border, they face a daily reminder, in the presence of the migrant workers, of the poverty in which many of this country's neighbors live. 
 "It sort of pricks their conscience," said Ozzie Venzor, an advocate for immigrants rights, speaking of the city's residents. "If you just put these guys on balloons after work and they just disappeared so people would not have to see them, then the problem would go away."
But Mr. Venzor said he agreed with the contention of Mayor Pam Slater, who sent the bill to Washington, that because Encinitas is at the end of the first leg of the immigrants' journey, the city is left to deal with what is in essence a Federal problem.
"My feeling is that we have been dumped on by the Federal Government," Mrs. Slater said. "They've said, 'O.K., we're not going to enforce the border and we are not going to take charge of immigration, but it's up to your local hospitals, your local schools, your local social service agencies to provide for the needs of these indigent people.' "
 The bill, which was sent to Washington on Sept. 27, is the latest protest by communities in San Diego County over a border situation that has left the communities to deal with a growing influx of both legal and illegal migrants.
All sides generally agree that after an initial slowdown soon after the passage of the 1986 immigration law, which provided amnesty to some illegal aliens, illegal immigration has again surged.
There have been continuing complaints from local communities that increasing proportions of their budgets for law enforcement, health care and other services go to cover the needs of migrants.
The residents do not always deal with the situation well, and there are constant reports of harassment and violence against the migrants. Advocates like Mr. Venzor, who heads a group called Friends of the Immigrant Workers, say protests like the Encinitas bill to Washington carry a taint of racism.
Other such protests have included the declaration by Encinitas of a "local emergency" in which the City Council discussed its complaints about migrant workers.
Mrs. Slater's bill, which was addressed to the Comptroller General in Washington, warned of an escalation in "the problems of illegal encampments, open fires, increase in crime, exploitation of workers and increased community tensions."
The Mayor said she had not received an answer from the Federal Government. But she added that even without reimbursement the bill served a purpose in calling attention to the problem. "This is one more attempt on our part to ask for Federal assistance in dealing with what is a national and international problem far beyond the capacity of a city of 55,000 people to deal with," she said.
 The bill was accompanied by a copy of the emergency declaration of last April, which detailed some of the city's concerns.
According to that statement, more than 350,000 people were detained and later deported by the Border Patrol in the San Diego region in the fiscal year 1989. Some 13,250 illegal immigrants were arrested last year in Encinitas, it said.
The city says the number of homeless migrants here ranges from 800 to 1,500, of whom are 150 legal aliens registered with the job center. Mr. Venzor said he believed the figure to be considerably smaller.
The city's statement also estimated that $175,000 in public money had been spent last year to control and keep clean about 20 illegal campsites, and another $30,000 to run its jobs center.
But more than the costs themselves, it seemed that the very presence of the migrants was taking its toll on the residents of Encinitas.
"A lot of retired people have chosen to live here," Mrs. Slater said. "And now suddenly all those senior citizens are looking out their windows and seeing people going across their property and using their water and performing all their bodily functions right out there. It's caused a tremendous problem."

Guests at the Ritz-Carlton, one of New York City's more traditional hotels, can have bacon and eggs for breakfast in the Jockey Club restaurant for $14.50. Or they can have miso soup, grilled fish and rice for $18.
While New York has always catered to foreign travelers, the addition of the customary Japanese fare to the breakfast menu at the Ritz and other New York hotels reflects the increasing importance of foreigners to the city's tourist industry. 
 The number of Americans visiting New York City dropped 5 percent in 1989, compared with 1988, but the number of foreigners staying at least one night increased 9 percent, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. In fact, the bureau estimates that almost a third of the city's 16 million annual tourists are foreign.
 
Dollar Falls, Visits Rise
 The boom in foreign tourism has been spurred by the precipitous fall in the value of the dollar compared with foreign currencies in the last few years, which makes the United States a bargain for prosperous Western Europeans, Japanese and others. As a result, for the first time, foreign tourists spent more in the United States last year than Americans spent abroad, and the spending gap is expected to increase, according to the United States Travel and Tourism Administration.
"A few years ago, the dollar was worth 10 francs, and now it's five," said Sylvain Macrez, of Lille, France, who returned to New York recently for the first time since he was a student in America 24 years ago. "So things don't seem so expensive."
Erika Kloapfar, a first-time visitor from Vienna who came for a 10-day vacation, said: "We heard that New York was dirty and dangerous, but it's really not so bad. And with the dollar so low, it's good for us to shop."
A German tourist coming to New York last November would have had to spend about 1,470 marks for four nights in a $200-a-night hotel room. But that same tourist arriving this week would find that those 1,470 marks would now buy five nights in the same hotel.
One-quarter of the foreign tourists in New York in 1989 were Canadians, and a third were from Britain, Japan, Germany, France or Italy. But other, non-European countries like Brazil, Australia and South Korea are also sending increasing numbers here.
The United States Travel and Tourism Administration has not yet compiled statistics for foreign visitors to New York this year, but it has projected that overall foreign tourism to the United States will rise 11 percent in 1990, to 40.6 million.
By all indications, foreign tourism to New York has continued to increase this year. Tourism and hotel officials say that the number of visitors from abroad has shot up even in recent months.
In the first six months of this year, the number of international travelers arriving at all three New York area airports went up 5.2 percent over the first half of 1989, to 10.6 million, said Amos Ilan, an economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Although this includes Americans returning from abroad and foreigners passing through New York, it nonetheless strongly reflects an increase in foreign visitors coming to the city, he said.
The influx of foreign travelers has been one of the few bright spots in the region's troubled economy. Although the increase from abroad has not completely offset the decline in domestic tourists, it has at least reduced the impact of that decline for New York businesses that depend on tourist dollars.
While foreign tourists this year will account for nearly one in every nine tourist dollars spent in the United States, in New York, one-third of the $10 billion in tourist expenditures is by foreigners, according to Ruth Nadler, a market research analyst for the Convention and Visitors Bureau. The proportion of foreigners patronizing various New York attractions ranges from about 10 percent of Lincoln Center and Broadway concert- and theatergoers, to 30 percent of visitors to the Museum of Modern Art and 50 percent of tourists at the Statue of Liberty.
 
'The Hub of America'
 "Foreigners are especially interested in coming to New York, because it's perceived around the world as the hub of America," said Daniela Marino, the regional tourism director for the New York State Department of Economic Development.
Leaders of New York's hotel, restaurant, retailing and tourist industries say that sharply increased revenues from foreign tourism have helped at a time when overall spending is down. They also have stepped up efforts to attract foreign tourists with new overseas marketing efforts, and by introducing a range of new services.
New York State has begun selling itself abroad in conjunction with Pan Am and Japan Airlines, and many hotels have established their own international sales offices from Frankfurt to Hong Kong.
With occupancy rates dropping for New York's 65,000 hotel rooms, hoteliers are competing for the lucrative foreign market. Hotels like the Marriott Marquis, Parker Meridien and Ritz-Carlton have hired more multilingual employees. They have added traditional Japanese dishes to their menus, and their newsstands feature Le Monde, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Yomuri Shinbun and Corriere Della Sera.
"In the past, only English was spoken in hotels, with maybe a sprinkling of Spanish and French," said Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, "but now many hotels have Japanese signs and can accommodate most major languages."
Museums, sightseeing attractions and other tourist businesses are also beginning to cater to visitors from abroad. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which draws nearly one-third of its four million annual visitors from abroad, began offering brochures in Japanese, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Chinese last year, and Central Park is about to follow suit with its first multilingual map.
City Guide, a weekly publication distributed in hotels, began a 40,000-copy Japanese-language edition two years ago. Tiffany's claims to have employees who can help customers in 50 languages, and Gray Line has increased its city bus tours in German, French, Spanish, Italian and Japanese.
 
Obstacles Remain
 Such efforts are particularly noteworthy since the United States has traditionally done less to cater to foreigners than most European countries.
Many attractions still lack even rudimentary services for non-English-speaking tourists. At the Empire State Building, where half of the 2.5 million annual visitors are foreign, there are no foreign-language brochures.
Compared with other countries, there are fewer foreign-language hotel concierges, tours and brochures in the United States, and tourist-information centers and places to exchange money are comparatively rare.
 
Informed but Not Scared
 Another obstacle to tourism is the impression of the United States, and New York in particular, as dangerous.
Nonetheless, many tourists, like Wolfgang Grollmuss, from Hildesheim, Germany, are not deterred by news stories about New York crime. "Crime may be going up, but I'm not afraid," he said. "New York sometimes seems decadent and dirty, but it also has more culture and is more fun than other American cities."
And many tourists say that they would visit regardless of crime rates or currency-exchange rates. Guy Lemaire, a dentist and former deputy mayor of Cannes, France, brought his two grandchildren to New York "so they know about life in America not only from TV and the movies," he said.
"With the dollar so low, it's an added benefit, but I would have come at any cost," he added.

When to Threaten Iraq?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
To critics who ask why the United States should not wait a year or more to see if economic sanctions force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, Administration officials say they have valid reasons for threatening a war this winter.
 President Bush's decision last week to nearly double the American military force in the Persian Gulf and to cancel troop-rotation plans, they say, was based on the assumption that only the threat of early war can persuade President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. 
 In addition, said a senior Administration official who would not be further identified, the White House is worried that keeping a large number of American soldiers in the Persian Gulf region for a prolonged period may provide a political target for Arab nationalists and contribute to the destabilization of Saudi society.
American soldiers might also lose their fighting edge if the crisis went on too long, and some specialists note that the coming winter are better fighting weather than the broiling summer.
 
No War Decision at This Time
 In the end, the President can turn away from a military confrontation and look for other ways to end the crisis. His aides say Mr. Bush has not decided whether to go to war. But they acknowledge that it will be difficult to sustain the large deployment of American forces in the Persian Gulf for a longperiod and would be politically embarrassing to withdraw them without having achieved the Administration's objectives.
Mr. Bush's troop decision has led to the first serious challenge to his policy from some leaders in the political mainstream, like Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the Armed Services Committee. They say that the White House is moving too quickly toward the use of force.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, asserted today that the Bush Administration was poised to go to war without either a genuine effort to see if the economic sanctions would be effective or to provide a thorough explanation to the American public.
"Why not stay the course we started?" Senator Moyhihan asked. "If ever a blockade might work, it's here."
Mr. Bush is "not preparing Americans for what's happening," he declared.
Mr. Moynihan, speaking on the ABC television program, "Good Morning America," added: "He will wreck our military; he will wreck his Administration, and he'll spoil a chance to get a collective security system working. It breaks your heart."
 
Lugar Moving on His Own
 Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, is expected to recommend on Tuesday that President Bush call Congress back into session to debate a declaration of war, acccording to an offical familiar with the Senator's thinking. Mr. Lugar has scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning, but is not among the bipartisan Congressional leadership group that will meet President Bush to discuss the Persian Gulf.
The official said that Mr. Lugar was acting on his own and had not sought a consensus of Republican leaders.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has discussed with President Bush the possibility of calling Congress back into session, but according to a senior Dole aide, the Senator is not prepared to recommend that such a session be used to debate a declaration of war. The aide said that Mr. Dole's chief concern at the moment is that lawmakers have been able to criticize Mr. Bush's strategy in the gulf without having to formally break with the President.
Mr. Dole, who is scheduled to have lunch with the President on Tuesday, has told Mr. Bush that Congress should be forced to commit itself, through votes rather than speeches, on a position for or against the additional troop deployments the President announced earlier this week.
Senator Nunn, reflecting the wariness of some American military commanders, says that war in the Persian Gulf would be bloodier than Bush Administration policy makers seem to anticipate and that economic sanctions may work, dispensing with the need to put American servicemen and women at risk.
Seeking to contain the growing debate, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today: "We don't want to go to war. President Bush will say the same things these Congressmen are saying -- be cautious, follow the policy, support the U.N. resolutions, consult with Congress."
But Mr. Fitzwater's statements, while apparently aimed at quieting the critics, did not provide a public explanation for the Administration's speeded-up timetable for resolving the gulf crisis.
A senior Administration official in private did not hesitate to explain that the White House has put its political and military campaign to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait on a fast track.
"There is some doubt as to how long we keep our forces there. This is not Germany," the official said, suggesting that the longer American forces remain in Saudi Arabia, the greater the possibility that the foreign presence might undermine the conservative traditions of Saudi society and even lead to instability.
 
How Vulnerable?
 He said the presence of large numbers of American troops in Saudi Arabia "is a point of vulnerability" for the Saudi leadership that Iraq has tried to exploit. "How much of a vulnerability we do not know," he added.
The senior Administration official also said that "American troops are out there in the most forbidding terrain and may loss their edge," a concern that must be balanced by the apparent desire of some senior military commanders to avoid a rush to war.
The senior official argued further that Eastern Europe nations and other countries were being seriously hurt by the oil-price rises, adding to the need to resolve the gulf crisis soon.
Finally, the official explained, the White House was concerned that Mr. Hussein was simply not taking the United States seriously because Iraq had continued to build up its forces in Kuwait and was continuing to plunder the country. Mr. Hussein, this official said, was still trying to drive a wedge through the alliance and appeared to believe that time is on his side.
 
Achieving the New Order
 Critics have raised other important questions:
Is the "new world order" that Mr. Bush seeks best established by a decisive defeat of the invading Iraqi forces at the hands of the American military, or by waiting to see if economic sanctions take their toll?
Is the threat of war this winter a shrewd application of shock therapy against a recalitrant Saddam Hussein, or does it reflect a lack of confidence in the multinational coalition to hang together in its opposition to Iraq's taking of Kuwait?
The developing debate is a far cry from August, when the Bush Administration decided to send American forces to Saudi Arabia to defend the West's oil supply against an Iraqi attack. The stated mission of the American military at that time was to "deter and defend," a mission that has since been accomplished, and the Administration received broad backing from members of both parties.
 
And Now, a Milestone
 President Bush also stated at the time that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would not stand, and pointedly noted that no military options had been excluded. But the Administration emphasized that it was relying primarily on worldwide economic sanctions to persuade Mr. Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait. Echoing this line, Administration officials repeatedly argued that time was on Washington's side.
President Bush's decision to send more than 150,000 fresh troops to the gulf area, bringing the total to nearly 400,000 by early next year, marked a milestone in the Administration's handling of the gulf crisis because it appeared to be based on the calculation that either economic sanctions would not force Mr. Hussein to withdraw or that Washington could not afford to wait to see if they did.
Making a comprehensive public case for its decision to accelerate the timetable for resolution of the crisis may not be easy for the White House, which clearly does not want to highlight concerns it may have over the endurance of the multinational coalition or Saudi sensitivities to a long-term American troop presence there.

HEADLINE: Latin Meeting on Oil Policy

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Spurred by the Persian Gulf crisis, ministers from 24 Latin American and Caribbean nations met today to formulate a joint energy strategy that could help save the region's shaky economies from another oil shock.
Although Latin America contains the world's biggest reserves of crude oil outside the Middle East as well as immense gas, coal and hydroelectric resources, the wealth is spread unevenly.
Big importers like Brazil are unhappy at having to depend on volatile Middle Eastern nations for crude oil supplies while leading exporters in the region like Mexico and Venezuela sell their crude to the United States and Europe.
"It is no longer right that Latin America, which is so rich in energy, should see its development compromised by external factors over which it has no control," Brazil's Infrastructure Minister, Ozires Silva, said at the opening of the conference.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Slow Trading On Expectation of Fed Move

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell broadly in sleepy trading on world currency markets yesterday, largely on the expectation that the Federal Reserve would move this week to lower interest rates.
Trading was extremely light with many bank trading floors closed in observation of Veterans Day. Lack of news indicating increased volatility in the Middle East kept investors focused on what the Fed might do after today's meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee. 
 Lower interest rates generally diminish the value of the dollar.
"With the war specter off the horizon and with rumors that the Fed will drop rates by tomorrow, there's nothing positive for the dollar at the moment," said Michael McGuinness, a vice president of the Harris Trust and Savings Bank.
 
Aided by Oil Slide
 Also driving down the dollar's value against foreign currencies was a slide in prices of oil futures. Traders were discouraged by a $2.02 drop in the December contract for crude oil, to $31.87 a barrel.
The oil drop added strength to the yen because traders read it as a favorable sign for Japan's oil-dependent economy. The dollar fell against the yen in New York, closing at 128.30 yen, down from Friday's 129.70. In overnight trading in Tokyo, the dollar traded at 130.50 yen, unchanged from Friday's close, and in London, it fell to 128.80 yen.
The British pound also strengthened, to $1.9660, from $1.9655 late Friday. In earlier London trading, the pound traded at $1.9627, compared with $1.9670 late Friday.
Against the German mark, the dollar fell one pfennig, to another postwar low, at 1.4770 marks, from 1.4870. It has been steadily declining against the mark since the beginning of the summer.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late rates, included: 1.2468 Swiss francs, down from 1.2499; 4.9700 French francs, down from 4.9940; 1,113.00 Italian lire, down from 1119.00, and 1.1664 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1683.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday: 1.4805 German marks, down from 1.4875; 1.2500 Swiss francs, up from 1.2495; 4.9755 French francs, down from 4.9940; 1.6700 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6775; 1,113.25 Italian lire, down from 1,119.50, and 1.1665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1698.

HEADLINE: Pan Am's Fight to Survive on Its Own

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The Pan Am Corporation has sold off its Park Avenue headquarters building, its Inter-Continental Hotel chain, its routes across the Pacific and now, in a deal on which final agreement could be reached tomorrow, its routes between New York and London. But despite years of trying, the company that used to symbolize the prestige of aviation has never succeeded in selling off itself.
So Pan Am is falling back on an alternative strategy: survival as an independent carrier. 
 Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman and chief executive, envisions building up Pan Am's Latin American operations, which have proved profitable, and regrouping the carrier's European flights around a large new hub, in Frankfurt. From there he hopes Pan Am can reap the new business that will come from German reunification and increased travel to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Plaskett is also counting on higher traffic because of a marketing agreement, also up for approval tomorrow, under which Pan Am and United Airlines would coordinate schedules and reciprocate on their frequent-flier plans. And he is planning to increase the airline's fleet of fuel-efficient smaller planes and phase out many 747's.
On Sunday, Trans World Airlines Inc. and its chairman, Carl C. Icahn, offered to buy Pan Am, paying $100 million on Dec. 31 to keep it afloat while regulatory approval is sought. But Pan Am views the proposal as only a backup in case the deal to sell its Atlantic routes to United Airlines for $400 million fails. [Page D6.]
One way or another, Pan Am needs a lot of cash to survive another winter, a season when traffic is weak. In the first nine months of the year, Pan Am lost $268 million, and the airline has reported losses for years.
The New York-based carrier is reaching the limit on being able to bail itself out by selling assets. The only large asset left that could be disposed of readily is the East Coast shuttle that files to New York, Boston and Washington. While the company could also sell its routes to Latin America or Europe, it would shrink to the extent that it would be too small to compete against other big carriers.
 
One Analyst's Caution
 Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., said Pan Am had shown a remarkable ability to survive crisis after crisis and thus its strategy could not be dismissed lightly.
"One should be very careful about saying it doesn't have a chance," he said, "because airlines are basically generators of cah and can quickly sell assets."
Pan Am, and the rest of the industry, must first get through the current problems caused by high fuel costs, a weak economy and the threat of war in the Middle East. "The airline industry is in a depression," Mr. Plaskett said in an interview.
He warned that the huge increases in the cost of jet fuel would lead to staggering losses for the airline industry and that some carriers could fail next year. If Pan Am and other airlines can pull through, he said, then Pan Am's strategy has a chance.
 
United Deal Is Critical
 Important to Pan Am's ability to go it alone, he said, is the marketing agreement with United included in the route-sale deal. Fliers from either airline could credit miles on each other's frequent-flier program. The route systems of the airlines barely overlap, and United fliers could cash in for trips to Europe on Pan Am while Pan Am fliers could get free trips on United to the Pacific.
Other alliances have shown they can generate traffic, including Continental Airlines' ties with the Scandinavian Airlines System.
United and Pan Am would also coordinate their flights at hubs like Miami to feed Pan Am's flights to Latin America.
Pan Am's Latin American routes are a bright spot, earning $10 million last year. Mr. Plaskett expects the routes, which generate 20 percent of the carrier's revenues, to do as well this year. Pan Am generates 12 to 13 cents a mile in revenues on the routes, compared with about 10 cents a mile on the more competitive trans-Atlantic routes.
"Miami is becoming the financial gateway to South America," Mr. Plaskett said, explaining the potential of Pan Am's Latin American operations. "A lot of South American companies have their local headquarters in Miami. There's a lot more business travel, rather than vacation people coming from New York."
 
Europe's Potential
 In Europe, Mr. Plaskett thinks a reunified Germany and sweeping changes in Eastern Europe will make Germany the economic center of Europe. He said Pan Am would build up flights to Frankfurt, offering nonstop 747 service from Los Angeles and San Francisco next year, and would increase service from Miami.
The carrier will also increase service from such hubs as Dulles International Airport outside Washington, where United now has about 125 flights.
Meanwhile, Pan Am will eliminate most of its feeder flights. Such flights do not pay for themselves. Mr. Plaskett said, for example, that the airline received only about $30 a passenger in revenues on its daily flight from Cincinnati to Kennedy International Airport in New York.
He said Pan would phase out many of its 747's, with five being retired this fall alone, because they were less fuel-efficient and held more passengers than was needed on many Pan Am routes.
 
Lighter Planes
 At the same time, the carrier will try to build up its fleet of Airbus A310's, which have two engines, are more fuel-efficient and are flown by two crew members. Also, the planes carry about 196 passengers, a number more appropriate for Pan Am's European destinations than the 747's, which can carry up to 412.
Pan Am now has 21 A310's, with 2 more scheduled to be delivered next year, and is looking for more.
As part of his offer made on Sunday, Mr. Icahn wants Pan Am to end its agreement with United, which Pan Am said it would not do. If Mr. Plaskett broke the United agreement and accepted Mr. Icahn's bid, their overlapping routes across the Atlantic would raise antitrust concerns at the Transportation Department.
But the department might approve a combination if the carriers convinced the agency that they needed it to survive.

HEADLINE: FAVORITISM FOUND IN SAVINGS CASES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Senior officials in Washington knew as long ago as 1988 that preferential treatment was being given to some troubled savings and loans whose senior executives also served on Government regulatory boards, newly disclosed documents show.
Congressional investigators said the failure to make such conflicts of interest public, along with other serious regulatory lapses, discouraged local examiners from being more aggressive. This in turn slowed recognition of difficulties at savings and loans, adding billions of dollars to the costs of bailing out the industry.

 In one case a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas who was also a savings executive received a $1.5 million mortgage loan from a troubled institution at the same time that local examiners were being "influenced improperly by senior officials" of the home loan bank. 
 In another instance, local examiners removed one auditor who questioned a senior executive at an Arkansas institution who was also a director of the Home Loan Bank in Dallas and who had been accused of defrauding the institution's shareholders. Rather than remove the official, the documents show, "the F.H.L.B. of Dallas had been more interested in helping a fellow director."
The newly disclosed documents -- reviews conducted from 1986 to 1989 by outside Government examiners at 10 districts of the Federal Home Loan Bank system -- show that senior regulators at the bank board knew that in three of the larger districts "losses were deliberately concealed by the thrifts with the approval" of local examiners.
The home loan banks had a dual role: they both lent money to savings institutions and were charged with overseeing them. The Federal bailout put into place last year transferred the regulatory functions of the home loan banks to the Office of Thrift Supervision.
"People have debated whether it was ascertainable in 1988 to know the extent of the savings and loan problem," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, "The reviews show that officials knew the real extent of the problem and there was a deliberate effort to conceal that information."
Mr. Schumer is the chairman of the House Task Force on Urgent Fiscal Matters, whose staff investigators discovered the reviews of local examiners' activities and reports, conducted by examiners from other districts. This procedure was set up in 1986 to keep the cost of savings failure under control. It was to provide Washington officials with a "detailed independent report of the currenct effectiveness" of the home loan banks. The investigators provided summaries of some of the reviews to The New York Times on the eve of a Congressional hearing about the documents. The contents of the reviews were confirmed by interviews with people who were officials when the reviews were prepared.
"The peer review team vigorously contested the rationalization that the failing economy had caused all the problems and pointed to incompetence, poor lending practices, insider abuse, inadequate supervision and oversight, and fraud," the Congressional summary of the Dallas review said.
 
 Rewards for Losers
 The findings include instances in which local regulators approved enormous compensation to savings executives managing institutions that were losing large sums of money.
One example cited a $5 million bonus and a commitment of more than $8.5 million that was given to an executive of an institution reporting an annual loss of $4.5 million. At the request of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the institution was not identified because it is still in private hands.
M. Danny Wall, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board at the time the reviews were prepared, today strongly defended the decision not to publicize the internal reviews, insisting that much of the information had already been generally known.
Mr. Wall said in an interview that he and other senior bank board officials had used the reviews to seek significant changes in 1988 and 1989 in the way institutions were being supervised at the local levels. Allegations of conflicts of interest had been investigated, he said, and directors of the home loan banks in some districts had been forced to step down.
 
 Cost Exceeded Estimates
 The documents and interviews with regulators make clear that as early as 1988 Home Loan Bank Board staff gave officials in Washington estimates that the cost of the bailout could greatly exceed the $15 billion that officials were assuring Congress and the public would be adequate. In two instances alone, the documents show, those involving the Lamar Savings Association and the Sunbelt Savings Association, the local examiners had failed to account for additional losses of $1 billion.
The most conservative estimates now are that the bailout will cost taxpayers $130 billion, excluding interest, while some have put the ultimate cost at more than $500 billion. Most industry experts now agree that hewing to the $15 billion figure delayed a comprehensive cleanup of the largest financial scandal in the nation's history, and so drastically increased its cost.
Mr. Wall said that it was only in hindsight that the higher estimates of the cost of the bailout proved accurate. He attributed the rise in the cost to the continuing decline in the economy and regional real estate markets. "What we did not have at any time was any better sense of the numbers," he said.
But Mr. Schumer said the documents and testimony from officials demonstrated that Mr. Wall had "clearly been told that the magnitude of the problem was much greater than what he had told Congress."
 
 Political Motives Seen
 Inestigators on Mr. Schumer's task force said the decision not to make the findings public was a political one, saying that since 1988 was a Presidential election year, the regulators had decided not to paint too alarming a picture.
The hearing on Tuesday is expected to address these questions. Regulators scheduled to testify include George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas; Darrel W. Dochow, former executive director of the bank board's Office of Regulatory Activities and now head of the Seattle branch of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and five home loan bank board examiners who prepared reviews.
In large part, the regulatory lapses described in the reviews were the result of the dual role that the home loan banks played in the late 1980's as both regulators of the industry and its business partner, providing loans and other assistance to hundreds of institutions. In 1985, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman, Edwin Gray, transferred most of the examination functions away from Washington and to the district banks, increasing the salaries of many examiners, but also increasing the numbers of conflicts.
In the case of Lamar Savings of Austin, Tex., for instance, the review concluded that the supervising regulators had knowingly failed to recognize $500 million in losses because that would mean that Lamar would lose its rights to service loans by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and because recognition of the losses would require the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas to advance further funds, a course it was unwilling to take. At the time, according to the peer review, the institution had a negative net worth of $797 million.
 
 Suit Against a Director
 Among the directors of Lamar was Robert Mettlen, who was also a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas. Local examiners had recommended that Mr. Mettlen be dismissed from the home loan bank's board because of a civil lawsuit brought against him and other Lamar officials by shareholders alleging fraud, negligence and breach of fiduciary duties. He was ultimately not reappointed, but only because of the peer review, Congressional investigators said.
Lamar failed in 1988 and it ultimately cost taxpayers $805 million to bail out. The institution is also on the Justice Department's list of 100 priority cases for investigation into possible fraud.
The review team in Dallas also concluded that shareholders in the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Little Rock, Ark., might have been defrauded by senior management during a stock conversion. But the review concluded that the Home Loan Bank turned a blind eye because its directors included M. R. Godwin, chairman of First Federal. First Federal Savings was seized by the Government in August 1989 and had a negative net worth of $471 million.

HEADLINE: Judge in Eastern Case to Face Difficult Choices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Efforts by the judge overseeing the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case to keep the carrier flying will be severely tested tomorrow. The airline's unsecured creditors, including airplane and engine makers, banks and unions, are losing patience and are resisting attempts by Eastern to tap anew into its cash reserves.
Eastern's attempts to persuade the creditors to support a new infusion of cash have been unsucccessful, a person involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
 
Some Progress to Be Cited
 In seeking permission from Judge Burton R. Lifland to withdraw $30 million now and $40 million next month from the escrow fund established after Eastern first sought bankruptcy last year, the airline's lawyers are expected to argue that Eastern is making headway and may begin to generate enough cash by February so it will not have to come back for more. 
 Eastern is optimistic because after it doubled the amount of first-class seats on its planes on Oct. 1 and then offered them to customers who paid full price for a coach seat, the number of passengers paying full-coach fare increased by 4.3 per flight. Eastern has been run by a court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., since April.
Attorneys for the unsecured creditors are expected to contend that they have had enough of upbeat projections that have proved wrong. They believe it is time to save what money is left, shut down the airline and sell off the assets. Withdrawing more money would only shrink the amount they would get for what is owed them. The airline is losing more than $1 million a day.
Judge Lifland will have to decide whether -- with all the uncertainties about the future cost of aviation fuel, the response of leading competitors and the onset of a recession -- Mr. Shugrue should be given the chance to see whether his strategy will hold up.
The judge is running out of options to win back the creditors' support.
Last April, creditor groups had become fed up with the attempts by management, led by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent company, now called Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., to turn around the Miami-based carrier. Judge Lifland, who is the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, ended the crisis by ordering that the airline be turned over to Mr. Shugrue rather than be liquidated.
A court-appointed examiner, David I. Shapiro, persuaded creditors that pressing for liquidation could jeopardize Government approval of the sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to American Airlines for $304 million.
For a time, the unsecured creditors were open to Mr. Shugrue's efforts to revive Eastern. A former vice chairman at Pan American World Airways Inc. and president of Continental Airlines, Mr. Shugrue was not tainted by the legacy of labor strife associated with Mr. Lorenzo's management.
With the support of the creditors, Judge Lifland authorized $80 million from the escrow account for Mr. Shugrue to revive a slimmer Eastern.
Mr. Shugrue featured himself in an advertising campaign seeking to reassure customers about Eastern's safety and service. The airline began attracting more customers with fares lower than those of its primary rivals. But Eastern made little headway in attracting the business traveler.
Nevertheless, the unsecured creditors supported the withdrawal since April of $150 million more from the escrow fund.
According to Eastern's current motion to withdraw more money, about $257 million is left in the fund. Since Eastern filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on March 9, 1989, about $550 million has been withdrawn from the fund and approved by the unsecured creditors.
Of the $257 million remaining, about $30 million must be paid to the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation, a Federal agency, in January in a settlement to secure Eastern's pension funds. About $50 million has been designated by the court for a program that would reimburse ticket holders if Eastern had to stop flying.
The unsecured creditors could benefit further from sales of Eastern assets, including gates and operations at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta.
But liquidation, if it comes to that, could also be costly and could further deplete what is left. Liquidation costs could run as high as $500 million to $600 million, a person involved in the proceedings said.
Eastern would have to keep on many employees as it is liquidated, pay severance to many others and pay to keep many operations going until they are sold.
Mr. Shugrue, therefore, hopes that Judge Lifland will be convinced that the airline should have more time to see whether it can win back more business fliers.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Helping Women Abroad Get Started in Business

BYLINE: By Daniel F. Cuff

 BODY:
Women's World Banking, an unusual global group that helps women get started in business, has a new president, Nancy Barry.
Ms. Barry, 41, took over the post in September from the founder, Michaela Walsh. She left a career at the World Bank to head the 10-year-old group, which operates in 40 countries with some 50 independent affiliates. She was back in New York yesterday, after a trip to visit affiliates, and explained how the organization works. "The business we are in," Ms. Barry said, "is to provide various products and services that increase access by women to credit." 
 So far, she said, 70,000 loans have been made, virtually all in developing countries. And most of these have been for what she called microbusinesses, anything from bicycle repair to buying a cow, with loans starting as low as $50.
The group guarantees half the loan, while the local affiliate takes responsbility for an additional 25 percent and the commercial bank making the loan takes a 25 percent risk. So far, Ms. Barry said, women have proved good risks. The rate of arrears is less than 5 percent and writeoffs less than 1 percent, she said. The not-for-profit group, registered in the Netherlands and with headquarters in New York, receives financing from the Canadian, Norwegian, Dutch and United States Governments, while foundations, banks and corporations also contribute.
A graduate of Stanford and the Harvard Business School, Ms. Barry started her career working for the Peruvian Government as an economist specializing in small-business development.
While at Harvard, she worked in the summer for the Tanzanian Government on rural industry development. In 1975, Ms. Barry joined the World Bank and pioneered loans for small and medium enterprises. When she left, she was division chief for industry, trade and finance. She got involved with Women's World Banking in 1981 as a trustee and the last three years she has been its vice chairman.
During her tenure, Ms. Barry said she hopes to improve access to credit, increase the average loan size and introduce venture capital funds.
The growth of the group, she said, has been "fairly miraculous," adding: "There's something so powerful about the idea itself, the simple idea of women and credit, and credit as the link to business development. It just caught on as the ultimate international word of mouth."

HEADLINE: Rise in Oil Production Fails to Blunt Price Increase

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Global oil production is running 200,000 barrels a day higher now than it was before the Kuwaiti crisis began, but even so, prices will not fall until there is an easing of tension in the Middle East, W. Henson Moore, the Deputy Secretary of Energy, said at the American Petoleum Institute's annual convention here this morning.
When calm returns, he said, prices will drop to the low $20's, roughly what they were before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
 Mr. Moore, the second-ranking official of the Department of Energy, also said Government and industry figures alike showed that domestic oil deliveries in October were down about 5 percent from October 1989. The reasons, experts say, are conservation induced by higher prices and an economic slowdown.
Mr. Moore addressed the closing session of a convention that attracted 1,600 industry executives, many of them in an uncertain and defensive mood.
 
 'Witch Hunt Expected'
 Allen E. Murray, the chairman of the institute and president and chief executive of the Mobil Corporation, cited attempts in Washington to begin a new "witch hunt" against the industry because of price increases. Speaking at the Chicago Hilton, he argued that the public should appreciate the industry. "We helped Americans achieve a standard of living second to none," Mr. Murray said. "We helped make America the major military and economic power in the world."
But listing the moratoriums approved by Congress on coastal drilling and the refusal to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as the decision not to operate the Shoreham nuclear reactor in New York, he said, "Our politicians, it seems, still pay more heed to the extremist Greens than to the Saddam Husseins of the world."
Mr. Moore said his department planned to send a list of policy options to the White House next month in an effort to reconsider those decisions.
 
 Rise in Imports Seen
 Without a change in government policy, Mr. Moore said, oil imports, which now stand at about 50 percent of consumption, would rise to 80 percent by 2030. Oil's share of total energy used would decline from the current 40 percent to about 36 percent in the same period, he said.
He added that the package of oil tax changes approved in the budget compromise would cost the Treasury about $2.5 billion over the next five years, while increasing domestic production about 175,000 barrels a day. By 2000, he said, tax breaks to encourage "enhanced recovery" of oil from fields from which no more can be extracted by standard pumping would produce and extra 320,000 extra barrels a day.
Production was 7.2 million barrels a day in September, down about 3 percent from September 1989, and for all of 1990 the decline is likely to be steeper.
 
 Looking at Legislation
 Besides prices, one cause of concern to the executives here is the Clean Air Act. Mr. Murray, the Mobil chief, said: "The environment cannot be preserved in a vacuum. It even takes energy to build and install pollution control devices, manufacture catalytic converters and refine reformulated gasoline."
Experts here said the first data from a $16 million emission study by the three major domestic auto producers and the major oil companies would be available next month. The study is seeking to determine which combination of cars, fuel and additives produces the best results.
Speaking of the new standards, Constantine S. Nicandros, the chairman of Conoco, a subsidiary of E. I. du Pont de Nemours, said, "Nobody is quite sure what exactly we're going to have to meet."
Separately, the institute released a study that said the price of gasoline in mid-October was about 60 cents a gallon lower than it was at its peak, 1981, when inflation is taken into account.

HEADLINE: Singapore to Allow Greater U.S. Military Presence

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 13

 BODY:
In a modest but symbolic expansion of the American military presence in Southeast Asia, the United States and Singapore agreed today for Singapore to serve as a base for increased American training missions, visiting warships and Air Force and Navy personnel.
An accord carrying out the agreement was signed this afternoon by Vice President Dan Quayle and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, as part of a flurry of diplomatic activity after the enthronement of Emperor Akihito of Japan on Monday.The agreement followed an offer by Mr. Lee last August to permit increased American use of Singapore's military sites because of the likelihood of United States troop withdrawals from the Philippines. 
 Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama of Japan also carried out 35 meetings with visiting heads of state and dignitaries from among the 158 countries represented at the enthronement.
Few matters of substance were the subject of any agreements, although Japanese officials said that much of the talk centered on requests for increased economic aid from Tokyo. Thiswas especially true, they said, in a meeting with President Corazon C. Aquino of the Philippines.
Japanese officials also said that the Presidents of both Pakistan and Bangladesh appealed for aid, citing sharp increases in their oil prices, and that similar appeals came from President Ion Iliescu of Romania, President Arpad Goncz of Hungary and others from Eastern Europe.
Still other similar appeals were made by leaders of Latin American countries, but Japanese news reports indicated that only Peru, whose President, Alberto Fujimori, is of Japanese descent, came away with a pledge ofnew assistance.
The Singapore-Washington agreement had been worked out in negotiations over the last several months, with virtually no involvement by Mr. Quayle or his staff, but officials said they thought that the presence of the two leaders here marked a good opportunity to highlight its importance.
The agreement would permit the United States to send aircraft to Singapore "several times each year on training deployments of several weeks each" and for the Navy to increase the duration and number of its ship visits.
In addition, the United States intends to increase the number of its military personnel to about 95, with another 75 Air Force men and women visiting with each training deployment.
An issue blocking the accord in recent weeks was Singapore's request forpayments, which the United States rejected in principle. An American statement said that while no rent of fees are contemplated, the United States would pay for housing, supplies and services supplied by Singapore.
Another issue was the United States' worry about Singapore's severe penalties, including execution, for convictions on possession of small amounts of marijuana and other drugs. In its statement today, the United States said that it had "fully briefed" American personnel on Singapore laws, and that the accord "recognizes the sovereignty of Singaporean law."
Prime Minister Lee, who is retiring at the end of this month after serving in office since 1959, has been an ardent champion of the United States' remaining in the region, especially because of the increasing possibility of withdrawal of American forces from the Philippines.
Some Asian nations are worried that if the United States withdraws military forces from Asia, other countries -- including China, Japan, Vietnam and India -- could try to fill the vacuum.
The United States and the Philippines are negotiating the future of the American military bases there, with the United States announcing last week that it would withdraw fighter planes from Clark Air Base and take other steps to reduce its troop strength.
In Singapore, the United States issued a statement saying that the Singapore increase would be "modest" and that it "enhances existing military arrangements" between the two countries, since American naval vessels have been docking in Singapore for more than 25 years.

Dollar Mixed in Quiet Day; Gold Prices Rise Moderately

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar registered a mixed performance in quiet trading yesterday, influenced by economic forces that drove key foreign currencies in different directions.
Gold rose moderately. Traders bought aggressively amid a jump of $1.25 a barrel in the price of oil, to $33.12, in the December contract. Considered a safe-haven investment against this sign of heightened Persian Gulf instability, gold rose $3.70 a troy ounce, to $386, on the New York Commodity Exchange. At the Republic National Bank, the late bid for gold was $384.95 a troy ounce, up $3.45 from Monday's close. 
 Traders said the dollar rose against the Japanese yen amid indications of cracks in Japan's economy, where several bankruptcies were announced last week. That combined with higher interest rates in Japan to discourage investment in the yen.
Conversely, investors said the German mark was strengthened on signs of German's growing economy.
"You have a tug-a-war with the mark getting stronger and the yen getting weaker," said Robert Ryan, vice president in charge of foreign exchange at the Bank of New York.
Trading was light, as participants generally awaited an expected move by the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates in a bid to stimulate the sluggish economy. Lower interest rates can dampen demand for United States investments and potentially diminish the dollar's value against foreign currencies.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen in New York, closing at 129.65 yen, up from Monday's 128.30. In overnight trading in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 128.77 yen from 130.50 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.65 yen.
In New York, the British pound also weakened, to $1.9635, from $1.9660 late Monday. But in earlier London trading, sterling cost $1.9640, more expensive than late Monday's $1.9627.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.4782 German marks, up from 1.4770; 1.2510 Swiss francs, up from 1.2468; 4.9735 French francs, up from 4.9700; 1,112.00 Italian lire, down from 1,113.00, and 1.1662 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1664.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $383.25 a troy ounce, up from the $382.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $383.50, up from $381 late Monday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid of $383.61, unchanged from Monday.
On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.212 a troy ounce, up 2.2 cents from Monday's closing price. In London, silver fell to a late bid price of $4.20, down from $4.24 bid late Monday.

Morocco's Call for Arab Meeting On the Gulf Has Diplomats Astir

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The call by King Hassan II of Morocco for an emergency Arab summit meeting to avert a war in the Persian Gulf has set off a flurry of diplomatic contacts, including the dispatch of an Iraqi envoy to the Moroccan capital, but Arab reaction to the appeal has been extremely cautious.
Only the Sudan, Mauritania and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, readily expressed willingness to attend such a session, which the King proposed on Sunday. But even Mr. Arafat, who arrived here today from Baghdad, told associates privately that he was skeptical that such a gathering would produce the much hoped for "Arab solution" to the gulf crisis, which is now more than three months old. 
 Arab countries aligned with the United States and those opposed to the presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia are known to have reservations about convening an emergency summit meeting.
A senior Jordanian official said that Jordan, Yemen and Algeria were concerned that the session might be used as a pretext for reaffirming the condemnation of Iraq issued by a previous summit meeting in Cairo in early August, or worse, for sanctioning the use of military force to drive Iraq from Kuwait, should diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions fail.
 
Baghdad's Hostage Releases
 Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states, all of which support the presence of American forces in the region, are known to fear that Iraq might try to use a summit meeting to water down the position adopted by the Arab League at the Cairo meeting.
As diplomatic efforts continued today, former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark said after a visit to Baghdad that the Iraqi Government had promised to release four more American hostages. Mr. Clark, who has criticized the American deployment of forces in the gulf, spoke here after concluding his independent mission to Baghdad. The Danish radio said Iraq had also agreed today to release some of the 38 Danish hostages held in Baghdad.
Iraq, holding more than 2,000 Western and Japanese men, has freed small groups in the past after visits by elder statesmen, legislators and other dignitaries.
The First Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, Taha Yassin Ramadan, arrived in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, tonight after Baghdad suggested that it might attend an emergency Arab summit meeting. Mr. Ramadan said just before leaving Baghdad that the Iraqi Government supported "any serious Arab action at any level that would serve the Arab nation," the official Iraqi press agency said.
 
Iraqi Meets With Qaddafi
 Iraq had initially criticized King Hassan's call for a summit, noting that it had not previously been consulted.
Another senior Iraqi envoy, Saadun Hamadi, Iraq's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime minister, held talks today with the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia.
Mr. Arafat consulted briefly here today with King Hussein of Jordan, who has not stated his position on the summit. Jordanian officials, who attempted last month to work with King Hassan and President Chadli Benjedid of Algeria to begin an Arab mediation process with Baghdad, were disappointed by the results. A senior Jordanian official said that Morocco had not consulted Jordan before issuing its call for the emergency meeting.
"In addition," the official continued, "it would be difficult for the main party in this conflict -- Saddam Hussein -- to attend a summit outside of Baghdad with other Arab leaders. He just can't go there."
 
Trip by 2 Soviet Officials
 President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made an unexpected trip to Libya today for talks with Colonel Qaddafi. No details of the meeting were made public.
The Soviet Union sent two envoys to the region for consultations on the summit, according to the Government newspaper Izvestia. Neither of the two Deputy Prime Ministers, Alexander Belonogov and Vladimir Petrovsky, are scheduled to visit Baghdad during their Middle East tour.
 In London today, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain believed Iraq had biological weapons and was close to acquiring nuclear arms.
"Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons both in war and on his own people, the Kurds," Reuters quoted Mrs. Thatcher as telling a member of Parliament during questioning. "He also, we believe, has at his disposal biological weapons. It is contrary to the law to make them, let alone use them."
 
'Critical Point' in Gulf
 "And we also believe he is not far from having nuclear weapons," she continued without further elaboration.
In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said today that the gulf crisis was approaching a "critical point." Calling on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait now, Mr. Mitterrand said, "It is absolutely necessary that Iraq drop its policy of rejection if it wishes to avoid a resolution that would authorize intervention by force."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Kay Deal Hurts Shares of Ratners

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
GERALD RATNER has wrought a revolution in the British retail jewelry market, and now he is trying to prosper in the American market with a company that was on the verge of financial failure before he took it over. Share buyers in both London and New York are dubious.
Ratners Group, by far the largest jewelry retailer in Britain, has completed the acquisition of Kay Jewelers Inc., this country's second-largest chain of jewelry stores after the Zale Corporation.
But Kay was encountering growing financial problems before the acquisition. To succeed, Ratners must accomplish the tricky goals of sharply raising Kay's profit margins and sales while toughening its credit terms. 
 Doubts that it can be done, especially with the United States economy close to, if not in, a recession, help explain the battering the shares of Ratners have taken in London, falling 33 percent since the deal was announced at the end of June.
"Some people say we overpaid," said Gary O'Brien, the company's group finance director. But he noted that, on a per store basis, the Kay acquisition came in at a lower price than many of the company's previous acquisitions, and voiced confidence that Kay can be turned around.
Ratners, which says it has a 25 percent share of the British jewelry market, has prospered with what Mr. O'Brien calls a "down-market, value-based" approach, dominating the market under the trade names H. Samuel, Salisbury and Zales, as well as Ratners. Zales is not related to the American Zale chain.Convinced that it could not grow much more in its home market, Ratners turned to the United States in 1987, starting with the Sterling Inc. chain, and had become the third-largest jewelry retailer in this country. The Kay acquisition doubled the size of the American operations, giving the company 900 stores, operating under such names as Belden, Weisfield's, Hudson Goodman, LeRoy's, Osterman's and Shaws, as well as Kay. Over all, they now have about 4.5 percent of the United States market.
"There was a never a question as to whether we would acquire Kay," Mr. O'Brien said, explaining that the company felt it needed to make a big acquisition in this country and that Kay was the only such operation available.
 With Kay overleveraged and in danger of losing some credit lines, Mr. O'Brien said he considered delaying until Kay "entered Chapter 11," but he felt the filing would have damaged the business and delayed an acquisition, even if it produced a lower price.
To improve Kay, Ratners has brought in new inventories for Christmas that it says reflect a more efficient buying operation. Mr. O'Brien said Kay would have lower prices than before as a result, but higher margins. The advertising slogan, "It's okay to owe Kay," has been retired, he added. Bad debts were one of the problems that plagued Kay.
In the acquisition Kay shareholders received one Ratners convertible preferred share for each Kayshare they owned. Those shares, which traded as high as $12.125 in late October, fell 12.5 cents, to $10.875, in Nasdaq trading yesterday.
Mr. O'Brien suggests that the current price may reflect a lack of understanding of the shares by American investors, and he may be right. Complicated by international tax rules, there is not even a simple answer to how large a dividend they will pay. American tax-exempt holders, such as pension funds, will collect a $1.06 annual payout, but the payout to individual American investors will be $1.20 a year, for a current yield of 11 percent. Such a holder will report dividends of $1.34 a year, but will then be able to take a tax credit of 14 cents, against tax withheld in Britain. That tax break raises the effective yield.
The shares are convertible into three Ratners shares, or into one American depository receipt for a similar number of shares. Yesterday, the A.D.R., traded on Nasdaq, fell 12.5 cents, to $10.625.
The aggressive growth of Ratners in Britain was accomplished through acquisitions and determined marketing, aimed at persuading working class people to buy inexpensive gold jewelry.
The acquisitions were financed largely by selling new shares, as was the cash needed to pay off holders of Kay bonds. Consequently, the company is not overleveraged, even if the economic downturns in both Britain and the United States are not going to produce a merry Christmas for most retailers.
Not that Ratners is prepared to admit that a recession will bother it. Its operations in both countries have grown more rapidly than those of competitors, and Mr. Ratner, the 40-year-old chairman who greatly expanded the family business over the last six years, remains confident, with Mr. O'Brien quoting his boss as having said: "We've decided that we're not going to participate in this recession."

U.S. Jobs at Stake in Gulf, Baker Says

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMILTON, Bermuda, Nov. 13

 BODY:
With the domestic consensus for the Administration's policy on the Persian Gulf beginning to fracture, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d declared today that a primary reason the United States must confront Iraq is to save American jobs.
Speaking with reporters after a hastily arranged meeting here with Canada's External Affairs Secretary, Joe Clark, Mr. Baker dispensed with some of the more abstract explanations for the Administration's gulf policy and focused on the fate of the American worker. 
 "The economic lifeline of the industrial world runs from the gulf and we cannot permit a dictator such as this to sit astride that economic lifeline," Mr. Baker said, referring to the Persian Gulf's oil reserves. "To bring it down to the level of the average American citizen, let me say that means jobs. If you want to sum it up in one word, it's jobs.
"Because," he continued, "an economic recesssion worldwide, caused by the control by one nation -- one dictator if you will -- of the West's economic lifeline, will result in the loss of jobs for American citizens."
 
Selling an Idea
 Mr. Baker, Mr. Bush's former campaign chairman, is said to have grown exasperated with White House speech writers' inability to present the President's gulf policy in a simple, coherent and compelling fashion so that it will have the sustained support of the American public.
Since the start of the gulf crisis in August, the President's justifications for sending troops have included everything from "vital interests" being at stake, to the American "way of life" being at stake, to the principle that aggression should not be allowed to pay, to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq being worse than Hitler.
Beginning last Friday in Moscow, Mr. Baker first began to say that what was at stake in the gulf was the "pocketbook" and "standard of living" of every American.
It has become apparent to Administration officials that the eroding support for the Administration's gulf policy, if not stemmed, is going to nullify its entire gulf strategy. Mr. Bush, officials explain, is trying to make President Hussein believe that he has only two choices: stay in Kuwait and face destruction of his army and Government, or withdraw and survive.
 
Message to Iraqi
 That is the meaning of the offensive buildup in American forces in the gulf. Officials believe that until the Iraqi leader is convinced that these are his only two choices, he will never consider unconditional, or even conditional, withdrawal.
The problem, though, is that in making the threat credible to the Iraqi leader, the President has also made the prospect of war more credible to the American people, and thereby set in motion a debate on the value of such a war. That debate, officials fear, could be read in Baghdad as limiting the President's room for maneuver and thereby undermining the credibility of his now-intensified military threat.
Mr. Baker, for his part, again declined to commit the Bush Administration to seek United Nations authorization before any military operation to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait. But the Secretary said that the Bush Administration would probably make a decision on this issue in "a week or 10 days, but don't hold me to a time frame."

New Flock for Moon Church: The Changing Soviet Student

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Unification Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon has extended its proselytizing efforts to the Soviet Union. Hundreds of Soviet college and graduate students have been brought to America for an all-expenses-paid immersion in the ways and beliefs of the church, which suggest that Mr. Moon may be the new messiah.
The visits, billed as educational excursions, are but one of a broad range of church-sponsored activities in the Soviet Union. In April, Mr. Moon met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and expressed support for the political and economic transformations under way in the Soviet Union. Church-affiliated groups like the World Media Association have sponsored conferences in Moscow and discussions were begun on possible joint ventures in fields like computers and ballet. 
 Recruiting for the educational trips started this summer, and three groups have already visited America under the joint sponsorship of the church-affiliated International Leadership Conference and Novosti, the Soviet press feature syndicate. The goals, church officials say, are the same as those of many other current Soviet-American endeavors: peace, mutual understanding, "closeness to your neighbor."
 
'Learning a Lot of History'
 "We're learning a lot of history," said Aleksei, a 28-year-old graduate student at Moscow's Institute of Physical Culture, said, recalling the lectures attended at the Ramada Inn outside of Hagerstown, Md., on this, his first visit to America. "They talked about how the history of Israel is connected with Christianity. How Christ was the Messiah.
"Then it seems as if there is going to be another messiah. In our time. They have shown us how the texts show that Korea is the country where he will appear. Then it seems as if he may be here. Then it seems he may be Sun Myung Moon."
Another of those attending, Irina Treibich, a student at the Institute of Management in Moscow, was enthusiastic about the experience in an essay she wrote in English for her hosts after she and about 200 others, with ages ranging from 20 to 28, spent five days sightseeing and five days in intensive lectures and seminars at the conference in Hagerstown.
 
Lectures and Discussions
 "To my mind it is a very good idea what Soviet students took part in such conference, because it help to unification of whole world," Miss Treibich wrote. "Unification of all peoples, of whole countries, I think, it's only way which save all people."
At the conference, according to the Soviet students attending, lectures alternated with small-group discussions, at which attendance was strictly enforced. Curfews were enforced by polite, insistent proctors, and the schedule and setting insured only fleeting contact with outsiders. The format, according to an expert on the Unification Church, strongly resembles the church's introductory sessions with people the church regards as potential converts.
Sponsors of the exchange, both Soviet officials and American members of the Unification Church movement, say mutual understanding and not conversion, is the objective of the exercise. The students and their hosts, however, had slightly different memories of what was discussed.
 
'Framework of Religion'
 "They are having lectures on economics," said Tony Devine, an official of the International Leadership Conference.
Aleksei said, "Mostly it's about religion."
Natasha Boldareva, a 23-year-old graduate student at the Physical Culture Institute in Moscow sat by the swimming pool at the Ramada Inn and said, "This is delightful." When asked the topic of the lectures, she answered: "Many different things. Economics. History. But everything is seen through the framework of religion."
Aleksandr Borisov, a dean of Moscow's Institute for International Relations, who accompanied the students, said: "We are trying to increase the spiritual basis of our politics. We are trying to understand problems through the prism of religious tolerance."
 
'I'm a Materialist'
 Some of the students were more practical. "No, I don't agree with what they're telling us; I'm a materialist," said one young man, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. "But how else am I going to see America?"
"They're getting to see American democracy," Mr. Devine said. But none of six students interviewed at the Ramada Inn on Nov. 5 knew that the American elections were being held the next day. Televisions had been removed from the students' rooms "so that they wouldn't stay up all night watching during the conference," Mr. Devine said.
Many of the recent visitors were clearly impressed with the trappings of American life and with the warmth of their hosts. "Almost everything about this is positive," said Aleksei, though he compared the "pressure to conform" with his Soviet Army experience.
Two other students expressed puzzlement at their inability to meet with American students other than those who were part of the lectures and discussion groups and the organized sing-alongs that opened each day's activities. Others were taken aback when a discussion group leader said the church had chosen a wife for him. One or two students were openly skeptical about their hosts.
 
'They Are Sweet With Us'
 "They are sweet with us; sweet, sweet, sweet -- too sweet," said Igor Garilsky, 25, a student at the Institute for International Relations, who said he had read a book on the church before he came. As he spoke in a hall after midnight, his hosts patrolled the corridors of the Ramada Inn with walkie-talkies on their hips, enforcing the curfew by insistent requests that students retire for the night. One occasionally put his ear to the door of a room, apparently to hear who was inside. The two sexes were forbidden to mingle after curfew.
The Unification Church traces its roots from the Christian tradition and focuses on a belief in the imminent arrival of a new messiah. The Soviet visits come as the church, which has tax-free status as a bonafide religion, has changed its public image. The organization whose members once sold flowers at airports has now spawned affiliate organizations that underwrite film projects, have assembled parcels of real estate in Manhattan and publish newspapers including The Washington Times, The New York Tribune and Noticias del Mundo.
But Mr. Moon still selects spouses for his followers, who are then married by the thousands at mass ceremonies. The charges of brainwashing that came from former church members and their families are still heard, and the California Supreme Court last year upheld the right of two Californians -- who claim they were brainwashed -- to sue the church for fraud.
 
Appealing to the Unsettled
 Marc Galanter, a professor of psychiatry at New York University and author of the book "Cults: Faith, Healing and Coercion" (Oxford University Press, 1989) said the Unification Church had great appeal to people living in unsettled times. The students taking part in these exchanges grew up when Communism and cynicism were the twin faiths of everyday life, and arrived at adulthood to find most ideological, economic and political verities shredded in a national orgy of disillusionment.
"A large part of the reason the cult movements had the success they did in the late 1960's and 1970's was that the society was in turmoil," Mr. Galanter said. "There was the Vietnam war, all the civil turmoil. Youth had lost faith in the ideologies they had been offered.
"I think there's a definite parallel" with the situation of Soviet youth today, he added. Dr. Galanter, when told of the conference at the Ramada Inn, said it resembled some of the introductory sessions offered by the Unification Church in the United States.
Igor Drobyshev, a representative of Novosti who accompanied the students from Moscow, disagreed. "They don't try to indoctrinate the student," he said. "They wanted the students to get acquainted with this religious trend in the world. The activities of this church are based on human values, and the idea of those values is very popular right now in the Soviet Union."
But Mr. Garilsky agreed with Dr. Galanter, saying: "They see this as their chance to drive a wedge into the Soviet Union, and this is their wedge. Maybe only a few people here will become convinced. But that's fine for them. They can go back and, as we say, 'scatter flowers.' "

HEADLINE: Dropout Fight Is Retooled for Grade Schools

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT

 BODY:
The boy seemed a loose tangle of arms and legs as he spoke of spending many of his school days last year at home watching cartoons or outside riding his bicycle. Whenever he rode, graffiti and urban decay whisked by as he pedaled along in his New York City neighborhood, flattening spent crack vials with as little alarm as if they were fallen leaves.
For months, while school was in, this fifth-grader was out. 
 At the age of 11, Louis N., who wants to be a motorcycle racer when he grows up, came dangerously close to joining the growing ranks of youngsters chronically absent from school, whom some urban eductors call "elementary school dropouts."
He said he stayed away from Public School 57 in East Harlem because he was convinced that his teacher disliked him.
"She screamed at me and called me stupid," said Louis, whose mother permitted him to be interviewed only if he was not fully identified.
Advocates for children say increasing numbers of very young pupils in troubled neighborhoods are staying home from school more frequently and for longer periods than ever before. Even first- and second-graders are doing so, crippling their chances of adapting to the demands of school and society and increasing their likelihood of dropping out for good.
"We have elementary school drop-outs," said Annie Hodge, who is a New York City district director for a nationwide dropout prevention program, Cities in Schools, a nonprofit group op- erating in 50 cities. "We have kinder- garten dropouts. They come in and don't like what they see. Depending on the homes they come from, a lot of them find too much structure in schools and stay home."
Many of these children come from single-parent households headed by women in urban areas ravaged by chronic unemployment, teen-age pregnancy, illegal drugs, violence and crime. Many receive little supervision at home, she said. Some, even before they were born, were exposed to drugs like crack, which can make them oblivious to classwork and prone to misbehave.
"So, a lot of them just don't come to school," Ms. Hodge said. "And nobody at home is making them come."
Urban school officials across the country say traditional measures, like truant officers and teacher-parent conferences, are too overburdened to work.
"The caseload per capita is so high that it is impossible to imagine the truant officer system being able to keep track of so many kids," said Charles Schultz, director of educational studies at Trinity College in Hartford. "So many are falling through the cracks that there isn't much of an official means of recapturing them."
Cities in Schools, which helped Louis N. return to classes, not only counsels the troubled student, but its workers also act as if they are part of the child's extended family and offer other support.
"I have a social worker who goes to a child's home at 7 A.M. and takes the child to school," said Deidre Meyerson, executive director of Cities in Schools in New York City. "We never penalize the parents. We try to work with them."
There are no statistics on precisely how many elementary pupils are regularly missing school, Federal education officials said. But officials of Cities in Schools say the number of elementary students who need their help has risen 25 percent to 30 percent in the last five years. Before that time, said the group's national president, William E. Milliken, the program's emphasis was almost exclusively on high school students.
"We are just beginning to move down into that age group," Mr. Milliken said of the grade school pupils who are chronically absent from school. "The attention has moved, and we realize we have to get to these kids earlier and earlier."
He said that New York was one of the first places the phenomenon had surfaced, but that similar problems have been identified in California, Florida, Texas and other states with troubled urban areas.
About four million Americans 16 to 24 years old, or 12.6 percent of the people in this age group, were out of school without a high school diploma in 1989, according to a study released this fall by the United States Department of Education. An average of 429,000 students in grades 10 through 12 drop out of school each year, which is 4.5 percent of the students enrolled in those grades, according to the same study.
The problem is most acute among Hispanic and black students, Federal education officials said. In 1989, 33 percent of Hispanic youths 16 to 24 were not enrolled in school and did not have a high school diploma; for blacks the figure was 13.8 percent.
 
Parents Aren't Doing Well
 Leslie Rescorla, a clinical psychologist at the Child Study Institute at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and an assistant professor of human development there, said trouble begins early for many who end up dropping out of school. Increasing numbers of low-income families are falling victim to an array of problems that are affecting their children at pre-school and elementary school ages, she said.
"A lot of kids in high drug areas have parents who aren't functioning well," she said. "Many are either not home or are basically preoccupied with their own drug or alcohol problems. It is not likely that they are going to get up early and get their kids off to school."
Another reason more young children are staying home is a lack of a family culture that supports education, said Tom Lasley, chairman of the education department of the University of Dayton in Ohio. Also, for children in many of the country's most devastated neighborhoods, he said, the example of what is achieved by those who stayed in school is often not an inspiring one.
"They look at older kids who stayed in schools and see them still walking the streets or working at MacDonald's," Dr. Lasley said. "They just don't see anything great happening to these people."
 
The Earlier the Better
 But to give these children from troubled families a chance at an education and to help them learn its value means reaching them earlier and earlier.
"When you start in high school when the child is a teen-ager, he is basically set in his mind," Ms. Hodge said. "How much intervention can you do then?"
Cities in Schools tries to help children take better advantage of a city's existing youth services, said Mr. Milliken, who founded Cities in Schools in 1977.
In most places, he said, troubled pupils are asked to navigate a maze of career counselors, health and child care officials and drug counselors, who are often scattered around the city. The Cities in Schools approach coordinates social and educational services, getting them all in a child's school.
For example, at Public School 57, also known as James Weldon Johnson School on East 115th Street in East Harlem, an education specialist, a recreation specialist and a social worker see about 45 students a week in a small classroom on the third floor. Through counseling, home visits with the parents, after-school classes and field trips, pupils are guided back into feeling they are part of their schools, Ms. Meyerson said.
Working with Cities in Schools counselors and attending after-school reading courses administered by the program, Louis N. improved his reading skills as well as his relationships with teachers. So far this year, his first year back on a full-time basis, he has only missed one day of classes.
Maria Meriles, a city social worker assigned to work with Cities in Schools, also at Public School 57, said she has watched troubled students become well adjusted when someone takes the time to listen to their problems and help them work them out.
For example, Eric I. Rosales, a plump, extroverted 12-year-old, was often late to class despite the fact that he lived across the street from school. Recently, Mrs. Meriles made a home visit with him, riding the cramped elevator to the 12th-floor apartment Eric shares with his parents and grandmother.
 
Fear of the Streets
 "I'm a little nervous, but I'm happy she's coming," he said as he escorted the social worker to his apartment's metal door. Inside, Mrs. Meriles spoke in Spanish with Eric's mother, Rosa Rosales, encouraging the family to help Eric keep up his improved record of punctuality. Eric's father, a washing machine repairman, stood nearby.
Mrs. Meriles also urged the mother, a native of Guatemala, to let her son out of the house more often. Mrs. Rosales said she feared for her son in the dangerous streets surrounding the high-rise public housing project. Mrs. Meriles said that she understood, but that Eric needed a chance to work off energy and play with other children.
After about 30 minutes, Mrs. Meriles helped Mrs. Rosales complete forms to help the family get dental care for Eric. Then she left.
While Mrs. Rosales seemed willing to cooperate in meeting her son's needs, only time will tell if she would.
Martino Black, Eric's principal, said Cities in Schools has certainly made a difference in his school in an era of shrinking budgets. The program, which is based in Washington, is in 15 New York City schools.
"Through the program, we now have the people to do the footwork and find out why that child isn't coming to school on a regular basis, why that child isn't doing as well as he can," Mr. Black said. "Their sole job is to address these kinds of concerns and deal with the potential dropout. They do it well."

HEADLINE: Journal to Close Philadelphia News Bureau

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
The Wall Street Journal announced yesterday that it would close its bureau in Philadelphia at the end of the year as an economy move and that some of the 10 reporters and editors there would be dismissed.
Roger B. May, a Journal spokesman, said that to his knowledge it was the first time The Journal had laid off news personnel, and certainly the first time in many years. 
 In October, the paper's top executives informed their management staff that the severe slump in financial advertising created by the depressed economy would require cost savings that would include the news operation.
Although there have been layoffs in other departments, the company had avoided reducing the news staff through layoffs as potentially damaging to the paper's image as a high-quality news organization.
Ron Chen, president of the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, the union representing Journal employees, said that five reporters and one editorial assistant would lose their jobs and that two other reporters and two management people at the bureau would be transfered to other positions.
"There's lots of anxiety around here," Mr. Chen said from the paper's newsroom in New York. It is widely believed that the paper's 500-member news staff will be reduced by 25 to 40 people through attrition, buyouts and layoffs, he added.
 
 Cuts Called 'Painful'
 Mr. May said he knew of no specific goals for reducing the staff.
Norman Pearlstine, the managing editor, in a message announcing the layoffs, described the cuts as "painful."
"But the economic conditions affecting The Journal require that this news department join the companywide effort to cut costs," he added.
News of the layoffs sent shockwaves through The Journal's newsroom, despite recent management statements that news operations would not be protected from cost-cutting as they had been in the past.
In the October memo, the news-related economies involved such steps as reducing the number of special reports, shrinking the space devoted to news and eliminating the cost of relocating people by stopping most transfers.
Mr. Chen said that the paper had apparently been trying to reduce newsroom jobs by offering buyouts to some senior employees and through attrition, but that the tough economic times had made employees even more determined than usual to hold on to their jobs if at all possible.

HEADLINE: Stocks Ease, With Dow Off by 4.95 Points

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Yesterday was a choppy one on Wall Street with stock prices dropping slightly. Trading was brisk and oil prices edged $1.25 a barrel higher, to $33.12. Program trading was heavy and small stocks picked up a bit.
Nervous investors cashed in their chips after the Federal Reserve, which was widely expected to trim interest rates as soon as yesterday or today took no immediate action. 
 By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue- chip stocks gave up 4.95 points to close at 2,535.40. The American Stock Exchange's market value index and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks edged ahead.
Some analysts expect an upturn in the broad market before many days, largely because the Fed's widely heralded rate cut is still believed to be on the way -- particularly because of growing concern that the economy is faltering badly.
Activity dropped to 160.2 million shares, from 161.4 million on Tuesday, with 836 stocks rising and 731 falling. And 18 reached new highs while 39 fell to new lows.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors program trading, said that heavy selling sliced nearly 11 points off the Dow.
In a sign that many of the smaller stocks on the Amex and on Nasdaq were gradually gaining momentum, the Value Line index also rose a little.
Traders said that second- and third-tier stocks were such big bargains that institutions and individual investors had already begun end-of-the year buying a month ahead of schedule.
Explaining yesterday's drop in the Dow, David B. Bostian, chief economist for Jesup, Josepththal & Company, said: "You had heightened expectation of a Fed cut immediately following its Open Market Committee meeting today. And since there was no immediate evidence that it did, you had some profit taking."
Some of the big market favorites slipped. Among the leaders in the high-tech group, I.B.M. slid 1, to 112, in heavy trading; Honeywell 1 3/4, to 89 5/8, and Hewlett-Packard 1 3/4, to 26 5/8. Cray Research rose 1 1/8, to 28, after Yokogawa Electric of Japan said it was negotiating with Cray on a 50-50 plan to market minisupercomputers in Japan.
 
 Tokyo Stocks Lower
 TOKYO, Nov. 14 (Reuters) -- Stocks in Tokyo closed slightly lower today. The 225-share Nikkei index was off 36.23, or 0.15 percent, to 23,937.44.

HEADLINE: News Strikers Ask Abrams to Step In

BYLINE: By DAVID E. PITT

 BODY:
The leaders of striking Daily News unions said yesterday that they would ask the New York State Attorney General to look into a series of actions by the newspaper that they claim may be violations of state law.
The leaders said they would ask Attorney General Robert Abrams to look into whether The News had encouraged its out-of-state security guards to attack strikers, and whether The News had violated laws governing the licensing of security guards, state antitrust laws or organized-crime statutes. 
 Mr. Abrams appeared yesterday at a union-sponsored breakfast briefing attended by about 30 other elected officials, and said he would look into any claims union leaders made, but he declined to say what areas of possible wrongdoing he might focus on.
"We are going to see if there are laws being violated here," Mr. Abrams said at the briefing. He added later through a spokesman that he would study "any allegations of wrongdoing on either side of the strike"
 
Paper Also Charges Violence
 He also said that there might be many areas that would more properly fall under the jurisdiction of the police and local district attorneys.
Asked about Mr. Abrams's remarks, a spokeswoman for The News, Lisa G. Robinson, said the Attorney General "should really be focusing on controlling union leaders," whom management has accused of directing violence and harassment aimed at crippling the paper's circulation.
"Any investigation," Ms. Robinson added, "will undoubtedly lead to the union strikers."
The unions' principal adviser, Theodore W. Kheel, said that he intended to meet with Mr. Abrams later in the week, and would cite possible violations in connection with what he said was violence against strikers by the News's out-of-state security guards.
 
Out-of-State Guards Scrutinized
 "I am not sufficently expert to tell the Attorney General what areas are in his jurisdiction," Mr. Kheel said. "But there may be possible violations of the state's organized-crime statutes in connection with the violence."
Union members, including Juan Gonzalez, a striking columnist who spoke at the breakfast meeting on behalf of the Newspaper Guild, said they believed management may have run afoul of laws governing use and licensing of out-of-state security guards.
The General Business Law, for example, prohibits a company involved in a labor dispute from offering or furnishing guards or other employees with "any arms, munitions, tear-gas implements, or any other weapons."
Although management says its security force -- partly composed of out-of-state employees -- is unarmed, some members of those forces have told reporters in recent days that they have been licensed to carry firearms.
 
Officials at Union Breakfast
 The News pressed efforts to enlist other news organizations in a public campaign to condemn the violence and what it insisted was the unions' role in organizing it. Yesterday, management was reported to have asked other companies in New York, including at least one weekly news magazine, to lend their names to full-page newspaper advertisements.
The breakfast yesterday, at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan, featured strong expressions of support for the unions by many of the 31 elected officials or their spokesmen who attended. They included three Congressmen -- Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan; Ted Weiss of Manattan, and Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx; four state senators, 17 assemblymen, and six City Councilmen, including the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein.
Many officials later signed a huge cardboard petition urging The News to "end the economic violence against the employees and their families," and either negotiate "a fair and equitable settlement" or sell the paper.
In Garden City, L.I., The News said as many as 30 to 40 men smashed windows in a company bus early yesterday as it pulled out of a motel parking lot carrying nonunion drivers to the printing plant nearby. No arrests were reported. The bus operator and one driver suffered minor eye injuries from flying glass in the incident, at the Island Inn Motel, Ms. Robinson said.
She said the attackers -- whom she said had not been identified -- also smashed windows in 11 cars, as well as motel windows and a glass door.
In St. Albans, Queens, a nonunion driver told the police he had been assaulted by five men who waylaid his truck early yesterday. The driver, identified as 21-year-old Alistair Jones, received stitches at Franklin General Hospital.

HEADLINE: U.S. Output Fell 0.8% In October

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
The output of American factories, mines and utilities dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, prompting many analysts to declare that the economy as a whole has now conclusively slipped into recession.
The decline, the first since April and the largest since January, was exceptionally widespread. And it intensified the belief that the Federal Reserve would move soon to cut interest rates again to arrest what could become a rapid economic contraction. 
 "The steep decline in industrial production in October demonstrates that the economy is now entering the free fall stage," said Gordon Richards of the National Association of Manufacturers. "The evidence of recession is now unambiguous."
 
 A Definite Viewpoint
 On Wall Street, economists at the securities firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette said today's figures, compiled by the Federal Reserve Board, "should remove the last vestiges of any doubt as to whether or not the U.S. economy is in a recession." The question now, they added, is its severity and duration.
Today's report, which covers sectors accounting for about a quarter of the economy, was the latest in a long litany of weak economic reports that show among other things a sharp slowdown in real estate construction and sales, a slump in retail purchases and a plunge in consumer confidence.
The report of the decline in industrial production helped sustain a rally in the bond market, where traders, apparently anticipating that the report would prompt the Fed to lower interest rates, pushed up prices of some Treasury securities as much as a point. Long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis began in early August. [Page D13.]
 
 Fed Panel Meets
 The bleak reading of the industrial production index, which is published by the Federal Reserve, came as the central bank's chief policy-making body convened behind closed doors to set a course for monetary policy through mid-December. Most analysts speculated today that the group, the Fed's Open Market Committee, had decided to cut short-term interest rates but that it would be at least a few days until this became evident in the markets.
In the most recent easings, the rate charged on overnight loans to banks was cut one-quarter point in July and then again in late October after an agreement between Congress and the Bush Administration on a five-year package to reduce the Federal budget deficit. A cut in the overnight rate lowers banks' cost of money, allowing them to reduce the interest rates they charge on consumer and business loans.
Despite the latest economic data, a minority of analysts remained unconvinced that the overall economy, as opposed to that in one or more regions, is in recession.
One person holding that view is Charles Renfro of the Alphametrics Corporation near Philadelphia, who said that conditions outside the Northeast were generally stable and that he expected that gross national product would increase in the fourth quarter.
"When I go to New York and Boston, everybody's wringing their hands, but when I go out in the Midwest, everybody's pretty happy," he said. A major positive factor for the economy, he observed, is that exports, aided by a weak dollar, are generally strong, even without much support from the agricultural sector.
 
 A Weak Report on Autos
 Today's report on industrial output showed that a 4.5 percent drop in production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for about one-quarter of last month's overall decline. But production also fell among most of the other main market and industry groups.
Output of consumer goods, business equipment and construction supplies all tumbled by 1 percent or more, the Fed reported.
Production of durable factory goods -- those intended to last at least three years -- skidded 1.3 percent after an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent in September. Nondurables eased two-tenths of 1 percent, a slightly stronger performance than the decline of four-tenths of 1 percent the month before.
Output of both the mining and utility industries slumped, by four-tenths of 1 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively.
 
 Widespread Negative Data
 "Almost everything was negative at the same time," commented Robert F. Dieli, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The breadth of this decline is what some people consider a clinching" argument for recession, he added.
Industrial output is considered a coincident indicator of economic health, neither predicting turns nor lagging behind them. One rule of thumb is that a recession is a decline in gross national product that is sustained for two or more consecutive quarters. But the committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is the official arbiter of the business cycle, looks at many factors before declaring a recession, including the depth and scope of a contraction as well as its duration. The committee often does not define a period as recessionary until months after a downturn has actually started.
The Fed's report today also showed that overall use of industrial capacity fell by a sizable nine-tenths of a percentage point, to 82.6 percent, the lowest level in three years and barely above its average for the period between 1967 and 1989. Capacity usage in manufacturing fell eight-tenths of a point, to 81.7 percent, its lowest since September 1987.
 
 Other Sectors Are Down
 In addition to the drop in production of motor vehicles and parts, there was a 5.4 percent decline in production of televisions and other apppliances, a 1.9 percent decline in carpeting and furniture and 1.7 percent declines for both energy products and clothing, the Fed reported.
Construction supplies dropped sharply for the third straight month, while production of steel had a big decline after showing gains in preceding months.
Excluding the automotive sector, the decline in output was six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent on this basis for September.
The industrial production index now stands at 109.6, which is 1.8 points higher than the level of October 1989.

HEADLINE: British Plan New Phone Decontrol

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The British Government said yesterday that it would pursue wide-ranging deregulation of the nation's telecommunications industry, including erasing most of the legal restrictions separating the telephone and cable television industries.
Britain has led the way in telecommunications deregulation, and its move yesterday is likely to influence policy in other countries, particularly the United States, where similar regulatory issues are under debate. 
 Peter B. Libbey, Britain's Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, told Parliament that the Government intended to allow largely unrestricted access to the local, long-distance and international service markets. Until now, only British Telecommunications P.L.C. and Cable and Wireless P.L.C. have been able to provide these services, with Telecom holding about 96 percent of the $17 billion market.
 
 The Most Open Market
 "That makes the U.K. the most open telecommunications market in the world, including us," said Janice Obuchowski, the United States Assistant Secretary of Commerce for communications and information.
Yesterday's plan was drafted by the Department of Trade and Industry in Britain, and is likely to take effect with some changes after a period of public comment expires on Jan. 14.
The proposal calls for cable companies to be allowed to offer local telephone service, an arrangement banned by many American states. British Telecom and Cable and Wireless would also be allowed to offer cable television and other entertainment over its telephone lines, but not for 7 to 10 years, an interval that British Telecom criticized as excessive.
"In an industry that is moving ahead at a frightening pace, to ossify something for 7 to 10 years is a very cautious approach," said Malcolm Argent, the corporate secretary and a director of British Telecom.
 
 Opposition in U.S.
 The American cable industry has strongly opposed proposals to allow local phone companies in the United States to enter cable television, contending that the phone companies would use profits from their regulated local monopolies to subsidize cable service illegally.
The Department of Trade and Industry also said yesterday that it would seek to impose caps on the unregulated prices that British Telecom charges for international calls. High prices for such calls have drawn criticism from the United States Federal Communications Commission. New technology has sent the cost of providing international service plummeting, but prices to consumers have fallen much more slowly.
What effect the regulatory changes would have on consumers and businesses is unclear. In the United States, political pressures to keep down local rates resulted in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company charging far more than its costs for long-distance service during the 1960's and 1970's and using the profits to subsidize local service. Long-distance rates then fell and local rates rose when competition entered the industry, prompting complaints from consumer groups.
But in Britain, the rate-setting process has been less politicized. Domestic long-distance and international rates, which until recently were paid mostly by businesses, have not subsidized local rates as much. So the effects of increased competition on different groups of ratepayers are ambiguous, other than to reduce the overall price level.
 
 Weighing Restrictions
 Economists say the issue facing the British Government is how much competition is needed to force British Telecom to operate efficiently and reduce rates, and how many restrictions should be put on the company's ability to respond to that competition. Allowing many companies into the telephone industry would increase competition only if British Telecom is not allowed to fight back by cutting prices where it is challenged and keeping prices high elsewhere.
But too many restrictions on British Telecom could also result in inefficient prices, as protected new competitors might not offer the lowest charges possible.
Yesterday's plan calls for British Telecom's local and domestic long-distance telephone prices to remain regulated through 1993.

HEADLINE: U.S., Despite Dispute, Will Go to Trade Talks

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
As the first of a series of high-level meetings leading up to global trade talks was being held today, the Bush Administration sought to quash speculation that it planned to walk out of negotiations on liberalizing trade because of sharp differences with the European Community over agricultural protection.
The assurances that the United States still plans to attend a crucial negotiating session in Brussels next month despite the split over farm trade came as President Bush met with Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, who also holds the community's six-month chairmanship, and Jacques Delors, the president of the community's Executive Commission. 
 At a White House departure ceremony after two hours of meetings, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Andreotti stressed the importance they attached to a successful conclusion of the trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, for the country where the talks started four years ago.
 
 'We Must Succeed'
 "We discussed at length our goals for the Uruguay Round and our strong conviction that we must succeed," Mr. Bush said, standing in a gray topcoat beside the Rose Garden.
Mr. Andreotti, who was instrumental in breaking a recent deadlock within the community over farm trade, said there was a "will to reach a positive conclusion," and warned that if an accord was not reached, it would mean "serious damage in particular to developing countries."
In Geneva today, thousands of angry European farmers, ringing cowbells and riding tractors, protested against reductions in the farm subsidies proposed in the talks.
Today's Washington meeting was the first of those scheduled for the next 10 days in an effort to generate the political will for fostering an agreement in the 105-nation talks. The talks are aimed at setting new liberal rules not only for agriculture, but also for financial services, investments and intellectual property like patents and copyrights. They will move as well along the more traditional negotiating lines of global tariff-cutting.
The Administration had been debating whether to walk out as a signal of displeasure with what was seen as a meager European farm trade offer. The proposal has angered not only Washington but other leading exporters of farm goods. Lately, however, European officials have been telling Washington that the offer is negotiable.
European officials said they understood that Mr. Andreotti and Mr. Delors, both of whom are eager for the talks to succeed, made a similar point in their conversations with President Bush.
 
 Seen by Dutch as Opening Bid
 On Friday, the Dutch trade minister, Yvonne van Rooy, told reporters after meeting with American trade officials that "it's not a final offer, but clearly an opening bid."
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today that she would attend the Dec. 3-7 global trade meeting in Brussels. While attacking the European Community for what she termed its inadequate offer, she stressed at a news conference that "I want to leave no stone unturned."
"I do not want to look back and say that if I had made one more flight, or attended one more meeting, or spent one more overnight maybe it could have come off," she added.
Asked what Mr. Bush would tell Mr. Andreotti and Mr. Delors, Mrs. Hills said she expected the President to stress that "if we are to have a conclusion of the Uruguay Round, which affords the world such a fantastic opportunity for economic gain, for geopolitical harmony and for realizing the economic aspirations of the poorest nations, it won't happen unless the Europeans permit the negotiations to take place in the two areas that they see fit not to permit."
 
 New Cuts of 15 Percent
 For the Uruguay Round, the Europeans have offered to cut internal farm income supports by 30 percent over 10 years, using 1986 as a starting date. Since 15 percent has already been cut since 1986, this would mean new reductions of 15 percent.
The United States and the principal agricultural exporting nations have proposed cuts of 75 percent in farm income over 10 years beginning this year. But a group of exporters of farm goods and the United States are also insisting on action in two other sectors: opening the European farm market and sharp cuts in export subsidies.
The Europeans are expected to spend $12 billion on such subsidies this year, in effect "buying market share abroad," as Mrs. Hills put it. The United States will spend about $280 million on export subsidies this year.
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was concerned about getting approval by Congress if an agreement comes out of the Brussels meeting.
Mr. Bentsen, whose committee oversees trade matters in the Senate, warned that, hard as it might be to achieve, a Uruguay Round agreement would not be approved unless it "gives Americans greater access to markets abroad."
 
 Backed by 37 Senators
 He said at a news conference that he was particularly worried that a resolution, now backed by 37 senators, could jeopardize passage in Congress of the accord, with its delicate balance of concessions from 105 nations.
Under "fast track" authority, which expires next June 1, the Administration would present the entire package to Congress, and members would either vote for it or against it. This, Senator Bentsen said, was the only way such an agreement could win legislative approval. The resolution by the 37 senators would withhold the fast-track authority from the agreement.

HEADLINE: Credit Agency Urges Mayor To Ready More Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A major Wall Street credit rating agency warned yesterday that New York City may have to make deeper service cuts than envisioned in even the worst scenario Mayor David N. Dinkins outlined last week to keep its current budget balanced in the face of a soft economy.
In a statement on the Mayor's budget plan, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said plans to leave more than 5,000 jobs unfilled and to reduce programs in many agencies might not be enough to close a budget gap for the current fiscal year. Mr. Dinkins estimates the gap at $388 million, but the rating agency said it would probably grow. 
 Last week, Mr. Dinkins released not only his plans for closing the $388 million gap, but $40 million in additional cuts that might be needed if economic conditions worsen.
The contingency plan calls for closing six fire companies, in addition to the two already planned to close; reducing the number of garbage pickups in some neighborhoods; cutting financing for senior citizens' centers; delaying bridge inspections and repairs, and delaying maintenance at parks, playgrounds and beaches.
 
A Shared Concern
 But in his statement yesterday, Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, said even those plans might not be enough. Asked whether his comment was simply a statement of fact or a warning, Mr. Grossman said, "A little of both."
"I expect the revenue estimates to get worse over the coming months," he added. "I'm suggesting that when the city says the '91 gap has been closed, I think it's premature to say that. I mean, it's closed as of today, but I don't expect it to stay closed. They've prepared for, hopefully, most of the contingencies, but I'm saying they may need to do a little more."
A spokesman for Mr. Dinkins, Leland T. Jones, said, "The concern they're expressing is a concern that we share." He said that the Mayor had included the contingency plan because conditions might worsen, and that Mr. Dinkins was prepared to do whatever was necessary to keep the budget balanced, and close an estimated gap of more than $1.6 billion for the fiscal year that starts on July 1.
Mr. Grossman's statement praised the city's prudence in addressing its fiscal problems. Last month, in a sign of concern, the agency placed the city's bonds on a "credit watch," warning that it might lower the credit rating, and thus force the city to pay a higher interest rate on bonds.
 
Are New Programs Worthwhile?
 Since October, when the city disclosed its deteriorating fiscal situation, the prices of New York City's bonds have fallen, and yields, or return to investors, have risen significantly -- about seven-tenths of a percent more than the premium they already traded at over bonds of other agencies with similar credit ratings. On Monday, a typical long-term city bond was trading to yield 8.50 percent.
Though Standard & Poor's has rated New York City bonds at A- since 1987, traders say the bonds are trading as if they had been downgraded to BBB, the lowest investment-grade rating given by the agency.
Since Mr. Dinkins released his revised financial plan on Thursday, trading in New York City bonds has been light, and the yields had changed little. Analysts said that suggested that the market had already taken into account the bad news.
Also yesterday, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, a watchdog agency, said that with such vital services as sanitation and education facing reductions, the city might want to reconsider a number of smaller agencies and programs that he called "sacred cows."
Among the agencies cited by the director, Allen J. Proctor, were the Campaign Finance Board, which provides partial matching public funds to candidates for city office who agree to abide by limits on contributions and spending; a new Independent Budget Office, created under the City Charter to provide elected officials and the public with information to challenge the official budget estimates, and new city planners to be hired under the charter.
Mr. Proctor said he was not proposing the elimination of such programs, which typically cost a few million dollars each, or telling the administration what to do, but only suggesting that there should be debate over whether the city could afford them now.
"All I am saying is we are now at a point where the budget director's instructions to agencies are going to lead to reductions in major agencies providing vital services," he said. "And when you look at where the growth is, it's in some of these charter-mandated programs. And while they seemed very worthwhile two years ago, are they as worthwhile as reductions in the other agencies."

HEADLINE: Olivetti Is Said to Plan 7,000 Layoffs in Slump

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Faced with slumping profits and intense foreign competition, Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment giant, is planning to eliminate 7,000 jobs worldwide, or more than 12 percent of its work force, a Government official said today.
The reductions were disclosed in Rome by the Italian Labor Minister, Carlo Donat Cattin, who said they would involve 4,000 layoffs in Italy and 3,000 abroad. But union leaders said they understood that the staff cuts would come through early retirements and inducements for workers to resign.
 
 Company Is Silent
 Ing. C. Olivetti & Company S.p.A., which is controlled by Carlo de Benedetti, declined to comment on the reports until after a meeting with officials in Milan tonight. But there was little question that deep cuts were on the way, however they might be put into effect. 
 As of June 30, the company employed 55,745 people; the number has dropped slowly but steadily in the last few years as earnings slid.
Further reductions for next year were promised by company executives a few weeks ago, but the 7,000 figure was still appreciably higher than many analysts had expected. Even so, early signs suggested that Italy's often feisty unions would support the idea of staff cuts so long as they have a say in how they are carried out.
 
 Other Layoffs Expected
 "We're at the start of another wave of restructuring that will affect all of Italian industry," said Luigi Angeletti, a labor leader in Rome. "Olivetti is the first sensational case, but unfortunately it will not be the last."
These are difficult days for the European computer industry, which has fallen victim to a general economic slowdown and to aggressive competition from titans in the United States and Japan. Enormous losses and resulting job cuts have been announced by Philips N.V. of the Netherlands and Groupe Bull S.A. of France.
Olivetti has not been immune to this trend. It recently said its pretax profits dropped 41 percent in the first half of the year, continuing a decline that is now more than three years old.
 
 De Benedetti Writes Holders
 Mr. de Benedetti told shareholders in a letter sent in late September that the lira's strength against the dollar and the Japanese yen had hurt the company because much of its production costs were in lire, while 60 percent of its sales were in foreign currencies. This made Olivetti's products more expensive abroad and sliced into sales, which nonetheless rose 5.8 percent.
Despite the problems, Mr. de Benedetti has insisted that his company is in better shape than many of its competitors. It has "shown a vitality with few comparisons in the worldwide information-technology industry and a profitability that is exceptional for the European sector," he told shareholders.
 
 Other Effects Seen
 Financial analysts warned that the Olivetti cuts were likely to be repeated in other industries as the Italian economy sagged after years of sustained growth. Fiat S.p.A., for example, has laid off 30,000 auto workers for periods this fall in the face of slackened demand in Europe and a declining market share in Italy.
Confindustria, Italy's leading business group, predicts that industrial output will rise this year by only half a percent, compared with 4 percent in 1989 and 7 percent the year before. Government forecasts of overall economic growth for this year have been scaled back several times, most recently to 2.9 percent, and continued effects from the Persian Gulf crisis may make even that figure look optimistic.

HEADLINE: INVESTORS DECLINE GOVERNMENT DEALS FOR FAILED S.& L.'S

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When Congress passed the savings industry bailout legislation more than a year ago, it had high hopes that new money from private investors would pour in to strengthen the beleaguered industry. But today, even though Wall Street pledged nearly $2 billion for the effort, only a trickle of private money has been invested.
The Government has found it almost impossible to sell failed savings institutions to private investors. As a result, taxpayers are having to shoulder the entire burden of the industry rescue, and those costs are mounting daily. 
 "None of the money has been invested in anything," said Bernard J. Carl, managing partner of Castine Partners, which invests in financial institutions. "Anyone with money or financial talent is gone."
 
Conflicting Interests
 On this point, the Government concurs. "The capital has disappeared," said William H. Roelle, director of the resolutions and operations division of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency established by Congress to oversee the savings industry.
Why so little money has been invested after so much was pledged and raised is a story of conflicting interests, expectations and objectives in Washington and on Wall Street.
Many firms contend that the August 1989 bailout legislation, and later restrictions imposed by the Government, made investing in the savings and loan business unattractive, offering scant profits and high risks. And they say they do not trust the Government as a business partner.
 
Criticism of 1988 Deals
 Federal regulators reply that the restrictions are no more than safeguards to protect taxpayers and that investors cannot expect the Government to sell institutions on the often-generous terms available in late 1988 -- in deals that have since been widely criticized as Government giveaways. In fact, much of the $2 billion earmarked by Wall Street was pledged after the 1988 deals were struck.
To date, the outcome has been an unproductive stalemate.
"This is bad from the vantage point of taxpayer costs," said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "It means that it will be harder to get rid of the junky thrifts and that we will have more liquidations, which are expensive."
The stay-away investors say many of the problems stem from the bailout legislation. They point to provisions that they say make it difficult to earn enough to justify the risk of buying a savings and loan -- for instance, higher deposit-insurance premiums and restrictions stating that 70 percent of an institution's loans must be home mortgages.
But even more frightening to potential investors has been the political fallout from the 1988 deals, with the Government now deciding to try to revise about 100 sales with an eye toward making them less costly for taxpayers -- and less profitable for the investors.
"Congress has sent a signal to the world not to do a deal with the Government because of the uncertainty of a Government contract," said Scott Shay, a managing director at Ranieri, Wilson & Company, which bought a group of Texas savings and loans as part of the 1988 program.
Joseph Jolson, who manages a fund for Montgomery Securities that buys stock in publicly traded savings and loans, said investors had been scared off "because the contract you negotiate could be upset if the political winds change."
He added: "Then you've got to deal with harassment from the regulators for the rest of your life. And all your friends basically think a guy who owns a thrift has robbed people blind.
"It's not a big shocker these entrepreneurs haven't come through. The Government has given no incentives."
 
Taxpayers' Cushion
 Private capital is the taxpayers' cushion. This money is tapped to protect depositors against losses before Government insurance funds step in. Capital allows a savings unit to expand and make loans to help a local economy grow. And the more private investment the Government attracts means fewer institutions will have to be liquidated, ultimately reducing the bailout's cost to taxpayers.
It is impossible to determine the exact amount the Government could save if all $2 billion were invested, but some private investors suggest that as much as $20 billion might be cut from the ultimate cost of the bailout, which some experts estimate at $500 billion.
 
Avoiding Risk
 "Capital is the ultimate protection for taxpayers," said James Barth, a former economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and a professor at Auburn University. "If capital declines instead of increases, your insured liabilities get larger and the taxpayer is exposed to greater risk."
Government officials say private investors are seeking unreasonably low prices on savings and loans.
"They are trying to get as much as they can for as little as they can, and they don't want to take any risk," said Mr. Roelle of Resolution Trust. "We do need private-sector money. But the real issue is profits. We want to do deals where the investor can make an honest profit and the Government can make a good deal for the taxpayers."
That has proved to be elusive. Of the nearly 500 savings and loans that have fallen into Government hands since the bailout legislation was passed, only 17 have been bought by private investors, and the Government concedes that these were small deals. This has brought in some $52 million in capital -- a minuscule amount in terms of the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to repair the industry.
Of the total, 288 savings and loans have been broken up by the Government and either liquidated or sold as "purchase and assumption" arrangements to banks, which take the deposits and pick among the loans. The remaining 195 institutions are still on the block or are working their way through the Government process.
This is in sharp contrast to Wall Street's early hopes. Lured by the lucrative 1988 deals the Government cut with Robert M. Bass, the Fort Worth investor and oilman, and Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon Group, investors were eager to commit money to buyout pools that formed about the time the bailout legislation was moving through Congress.
At that time, at least nine investment banks were seeking to raise some $2 billion to buy savings and loans seized by the Government -- Salomon Brothers alone had gotten commitments for some $300 million. Others came from some of Wall Street's biggest houses, including Shearson Lehman Brothers; Merrill Lynch & Company, Oppenheimer & Company; Montgomery Securities, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Many of these funds have since been disbanded. Others are investing in savings and loans, but only by buying publicly traded shares or acquiring institutions in private deals.
"Prior to the enactment of the legislation, people like us set up funds to recapitalize the industry," said Gerard L. Smith, a managing director at Salomon. "Then when the legislation was passed, it became clear to those of us who can read English that the law essentially forbids investors from making a profit in the industry. And the implication of that is that there isn't going to be a thrift industry if it cannot attract new capital."
Also troubling is what this lack of capital means for banks. As savings and loan deposits are bought by banks, many say the risks of one industry are transferred to another: as banks take on new deposits, their capital is stretched more thinly. "All this does is take the existing capital in the banking sector and spread it over more deposits," said Mr. Carl of Castine Partners. "And that's troubling."
Part of the breakdown between the Government and entrepreneurs is an inability to agree on prices. Well-run savings institutions now earn about a 15 percent return on equity capital. Investors say new buyers who face start-up costs can expect a 10 to 12 percent return -- hardly more than from a less risky investment. Regulators say investors want to bid only at prices that could bring them nearly the 25 percent return on capital of days gone by -- and some say that given the current economic uncertainty investors might want more.
"The regulators have been extremely aggressive in trying to unload problems at prices the market won't take," said Michael J. McClosley, a senior vice president at Paine Webber Inc., which had sought to raise $75 million. "If there is some rational behavior by the Government with regard to pricing of assets, we would go back for capital."
One prominent entreprenuer calculated that the Government would come out ahead even if it sold whole savings and loans at prices that would yield investors a 20 percent return on capital. But this supposes that the Government would protect the buyer from catastrophic real estate losses through devices like yield-maintenance agreements or indemnifications and guarantees. Such devices are politically, if not legally, impossible for the Government to offer.

HEADLINE: Florio Facing Revolt by 4 On Tax Plan

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Four Democratic Assemblymen called today for the repeal of a major aspect of Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax package, in the latest indication of legislators seeking to distance themselves from the Governor's plan.
In a public letter, the four told Assembly Speaker Joseph A. Doria that they planned to introduce a bill when the Legislature reconvenes on Monday to have the state take back responsibility for paying teacher pensions, a major part of the Florio program involving hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Assemblyman Joseph A. Mecca, one of the four legislators, said that if Mr. Doria did not act quickly to move the bill forward, the four Assemblymen might break ranks with their party and join Republicans in the Assembly to pass the bill. Democrats control the house, 43 seats to 37.
"The people have spoken," Mr. Mecca said of Mr. Florio's tax package. "Enough is enough. It is time to reverse this thing."
 
Revenues 'in Big Trouble'
 But a senior member of the Legislature, Senator Laurence S. Weiss, a Democrat who heads the Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee, said he feared that in their desire to escape the wrath of voters and cut taxes, legislators might fail to deal with a problem of revenues, which are running far behind expectation.
Even without revisions to the Florio program, Mr. Weiss said he estimated that the Governor and the Legislature would have to find $800 million in cuts in state programs to make up for revenues that have fallen short this year as a result of a weak economy.
"We are going to be short," he said, "and we are going to be in big trouble."
The repeal move by the four Assemblymen was the latest sign of continuing concern over the Governor's tax package, sentiment that was highlighted in the Nov. 6 election by the unexpectedly weak showing of Senator Bill Bradley, a Democrat. In a highly unusual move a day later, Mr. Florio took responsibility for the electoral setback and promised to consider repealing some parts of his tax and school aid package, which raised sales and income taxes and shifted school aid from more affluent to poorer districts. He agreed to repeal a tax on heavy trucks, which was designed to raise $44 million.
Mr. Mecca said that he and the three other Assemblymen preferred to work with fellow Democrats to repeal the pension measure, which infuriated teachers and school boards around the state. But if the Speaker, Mr. Doria, lets the measure languish, he said, he expects a number of Democrats to break party discipline. The Republicans in the Assembly have already endorsed a similar measure.
"It hurts to say it, but that is the way we would have to go," Mr. Mecca said.
 
Republican Challenges Loom
 Mr. Mecca, of Clifton, along with the three others who signed the letter -- John A. Villapiano and Daniel P. Jacobson, both of Long Branch, and Thomas J. Duch of Garfield -- all face tough challenges from Republicans next year and were among the most resistant to the Governor's program when he pushed it through the Legislature last year. Mr. Mecca, in fact, voted against the Governor's sales tax increases.
Although other troubled Democratic members of the Assembly and the Senate said the four were more volatile in their dissent than the majority of Democrats, their public declaration demonstrated the change in the political atmosphere here from last spring, when Mr. Florio rushed a host of spending programs through the Legislature, including the biggest tax increase in the state's history.
As part of the package passed in June by the Legislature, the cost of teachers' pensions, Social Security and health benefits of retirees were shifted from the state to local school districts

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Senators Asking President To Call Session Over Gulf

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Influential lawmakers from both parties urged President Bush today to convene a special session of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis, as the White House confronted increasing concern about the possibility of war in the Middle East.
But the White House said it opposed a special session, fearing that it would undermine Mr. Bush's strategy, and Congress itself was fundamentally divided. Some Republicans wanted to call lawmakers back to lend clear-cut support for Mr. Bush's policies. 
 Senator Richard G. Lugar, a senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Mr. Bush needed that explicit backing because his decision to nearly double the American military force in the gulf region "has set the United States on a collision course in which Iraq will either withdraw from Kuwait or be forced to do so by military means."
 
Kennedy Deplores Silence
 Some Democrats who favored a special session hoped instead to limit the President's ability to commit American troops to war. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the United States was on a "headlong course toward war" and added, "Silence by Congress now is an abdication of our constitutional responsibility and an acquiescence in war."
George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, gave voice to concerns that have arisen since Mr. Bush last week dramatically increased the American force, saying that the President "has no legal authority, none whatever," to order an offensive against Iraq.
"The Constitution clearly invests that great responsibility in the Congress and the Congress alone," he said.
 
Hesitancy to Call Session
 But Mr. Mitchell said he was reluctant to hold a special session of Congress, which is not scheduled to return until January. There was also hesitancy among leading Republicans. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, supported a special session. But after meeting with Mr. Bush, he appeared to modify his position, suggesting that Congress might wait and see if the United Nations first explicitly endorsed military action against Iraq.
The issue overtook a Republican caucus convened to elect new party leaders in the Senate. Emerging from the meeting, Senator Bob Kasten of Wisconsin said, "There are as many opinions in that room as there are Senators."
That left the prospects for a special session in doubt. The Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees of Congress were expected to hold hearings on the gulf after Thanksgiving, but no date was set because the chairmen of the panels said they were having difficulty getting commitments from top Adminstration officials to testify.
Mr. Bush will discuss the issue with Congressional leaders on Wednesday at the White House. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plan a briefing on Capitol Hill.
 
War Powers Resolution
 The debate turned on complex political, military and constitutional questions. Most fundamentally, lawmakers and Administration officials are coming to grips with the question that has vexed American leaders since at least the Korean War: How much power does the President have to order troops into combat without seeking advance permission from Congress?
Like his predecessors, Mr. Bush believes that as Commander in Chief, he has the power to use the military without a declaration of war if there is a need to act speedily to protect American lives and national interests. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to declare war.
Congress allowed Presidents to bypass a declaration of war in Korea and Vietnam. In the gulf, Congress has not challenged the President on the basis of the War Powers Resolution, which was passed in 1973 after American participation in Vietnam had ended.
The resolution, which Mr. Bush and his predecessors have resisted, requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending troops where "imminent involvement in hostilities" is possible. Mr. Bush has asserted that the law is not relevant in the case of the gulf deployment because the American troops do not face imminent hostilities.
 
Now an Issue in Gulf
 Nevertheless, the issue has arisen because the gulf deployment has taken place over more than three months without overt conflict, and because there is now the suggestion that American forces might be used not just to defend Saudi Arabia but to attack Iraq.
Politically, the discussion underlined how the atmosphere of the gulf crisis has changed since the elections last week, as lawmakers, no longer constrained by fear for their political futures, sought to position themselves before any decision by Mr. Bush to take the offensive against Iraq.
Some Republicans said they wanted to cement public support for the Administration's gulf policy. Some Democrats said they wanted to make clear that Mr. Bush does not have carte blanche and that Congress is opposed to taking the offensive against Iraq before economic sanctions have a chance to work.
The flurry of Congressional activity came in response to Mr. Bush's order last week to nearly double the American troops stationed in the gulf region.
Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a French radio station today that he did not believe war in the gulf was imminent as a result of Mr. Bush's action.
 
Will Troops Be Rotated?
 But the increase in forces heightened concern on Capitol Hill that the Administration was moving quickly toward war, as did Mr. Cheney's remarks on Friday that the Pentagon had dropped its plan to rotate troops in the gulf.
In an apparent effort to quiet that concern, Mr. Cheney told a closed-door meeting of the House Armed Services Committee today that he was not ruling out troop rotation and had not made a final decision, according to Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the committee. But General Powell told the panel that Pentagon planners were not discussing troop rotations, other officials present at the hearing said.
Pentagon officials say that such rotations would be very difficult to arrange in any event. In the case of the Marine Corps, which has two-thirds of its combat troops in or headed to Saudi Arabia, there are not enough Marines left to carry out a rotation.
 
Navy Reserves to Be Called
 Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, announced today that the Marines would conduct an amphibious-assault exercise in Saudi Arabia. The Washington Times reported that the exercise would be held 10 miles from the border of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, within range of Iraq's Silkworm missiles, and quoted American officials as saying that Iraq might consider that "provocative."
A Marine Corps official said the maneuvers would be held more than 35 miles south of the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, specifically outside the range of the Silkworm missiles.
The Pentagon also announced that it had authorized the Navy to increase its callup of reserves to 10,000 from 6,300 and that it will take similar steps for the other services.
 
'A Desire to Know'
 While the White House focused on maintaining support among its international allies, some Republicans argued that Mr. Bush should pay more attention to the domestic side of the gulf crisis by rallying support among lawmakers and the American public.
Senator Lugar, who first proposed the idea of a special session on Monday, said that after talking to his constituents, "I think there is a desire to know why we are there, and that leads me to believe people don't know."
Vexed by these suggestions that Mr. Bush had not made his case, the White House today insisted that popular sentiment favored Mr. Bush. But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, went out of his way to assure the public that the President was still seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis and had not made a decision to go to war.
"There is no war," he said. "We want to do everything to avoid it. We want a peaceful resolution."

HEADLINE: An Ancient Skill, Sewing, Is Revived

BYLINE: By DEBORAH HOFMANN

 BODY:
LONG before it was possible to buy ready-to-wear clothes, generations of women learned to sew, usually at their mother's knee. Long after that era, home-economics teachers and organizations like 4-H clubs helped to spread the practice of sewing at home, mainly to economize on things like curtains or prom dresses.
By the 1970's, fewer people were learning to sew because many high schools had eliminated sewing classes, and many women who became adults in the blooming of the feminist movement hid portable sewing machines in the closet, with cheerleading skirts and Girl Scout sashes. 
 Today, sewing at home is a growing leisure-time activity. The Fortune Magazine 1991 Investor's Guide lists fabric retailing for home seamstresses as one of the seven most promising industries for the coming year, based on a consensus of investment and fabric industry analysts.
Sewing has gained its firmest foothold among working women who learned to thread a bobbin as children. Many use computerized machines that cost $300 to $3,000 and drastically trim the time needed for sewing projects. They select from a growing number of designer patterns to create Christian Dior sheaths, Chanel business suits and Anne Klein blouses, Mario Buatta draperies and Laura Ashley pillow slips.
The woman who sews at home, says the trade organization Sewing Fashion Council, is college-educated, is 25 to 45 years old, often has a child ; her household income is $35,000 to $40,000. "There is a very high correlation between highly advanced education and women who sew," said Caryl Svendsen, a spokeswoman for the Sewing Fashion Council, a consumer-information resource in Manhattan.
Among these women are Daphne Maxwell Reid, a television actress; Florence Griffith Joyner, the Olympic gold medalist; Deborah Norville, the "Today" show anchor, and Kathleen Gregory-Henschel, who manages a department of seven in forecasting budgets and analyzing profits for Chevron International, based in San Francisco.
"Men aren't into sewing -- yet," said Vicki Hastings, the director of marketing and education for the American Home Sewing and Crafts Association, a trade group. "It's still primarily viewed as a female sport: men golf; women sew." To change that perception, the association is considering a program in cooperation with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America to offer sewing classes through the group's 17,000 clubs.
Researchers for a 1989 survey by Mediamark, a New York-based market research organization, said nearly 21 million people now sew at home -- people who are buying up nearly everything associated with sewing. According to the 1987 Census of Business Trade, more than $2.5 million was spent on fabrics, patterns, notions, laces and trims that year. In 1987 sewing machine sales increased about 8 percent over 1986, according to the Sewing Fashion Council.
Today the appeal of home sewing is not necessarily economic. Women who sew at home say they find their mothers' pastime therapeutic; they speak of a necessary counterbalance and creative stimulation in their lives, and of having a stylish wardrobe.
And at the office conversations about buttonholes may be a welcome relief from talk about bottom lines.
In a recollection evocative of "Little Women," Mrs. Henschel told how she and her three sisters learned to sew from their mother, Grace. "How else were we going to clothe four girls?" Mrs. Henschel said.
On weekends, she creates nearly all her own business clothes from designer patterns. For her husband, Peter Henschel, she tailors many business suits, using wool she finds in Scotland. "I tailor them as well as anyone on Regent Street," she said.
Now, she said, in her office compliment one another on their handmade garments. "We all know the Vogue pattern numbers by heart," she said. "It's become like a greeting: 'Hey, that's Vogue pattern Number X -- I made it, too. It looks great on you.' " And, she added, sewing women at top levels of Chevron have made an in-joke of tucking a swatch of leftover silk into their breast pockets.
Ms. Norville began sewing when she was 9 and her mother helped her turn scraps of fabric into a Barbie doll wardrobe. Soon afterward, she dared to make a garment for herself: "a hideous pair of pants -- horizontal stripes of yellow, blue and red -- but all the stripes matched," she said. These days, she makes all her own maternity clothes and all the fabric furnishings for her Manhattan apartment and her country home. "I find it therapeutic," she said. "It gives me time to think."
Ms. Norville said she spends three to four hours most weekends at a kitchen counter, working at her 18-year-old Kenmore sewing machine.
"What has happened in the 90's is that professional women are fed up with being told what they can and can't do," she said. "I don't care if someone thinks that I'm a dope because I sew. I'm proud of every dust ruffle, window cushion and bedspread. They're labors of love. And these days, women stop me to compliment me on my blouse pattern, not to ask me what Willard Scott is like. We share tips on pinning, welts, zippers, markings, selvages."
Ms. Reid, who is married to the actor Tim Reid, was the daughter of a professional seamstress who began Daphne's sewing lessons when she was 9. She began by first sewing for her dolls and, in a couple of years, for herself. Now Ms. Reid tailors most of her suits, coats and gowns, about 30 items a year. A favorite is a gray wool jacket by Donna Karan with pants by Yves St. Laurent , both from Vogue patterns. "According to Donna Karan, such a suit is one-fifth of what her jacket alone, off the rack, would cost," Ms. Reid said.
Between television projects, she retreats to her private sewing studio in her Los Angeles home for days and weeks. If she's having a busy season at her job, she hides on weekends, emerging "at 3 A.M. Monday with a new designer suit," she said.
Judge Carol Higley-Lane of the Houston criminal courts spoke of learning to sew at age 10 in New York State's 4-H program. Her skill earned her prizes at county fairs, helping to pay for her college tuition.
Sewing is now a lucrative sideline; she sells garments and patterns to a growing clientele nationwide and travels around the country to conduct workshops on wearable art. Her designs, with hand-sewn appliques and embroidery inspired by Japanese kimonos, are "as far away from my judicial robe as they can be."
She uses vintage kimonos as the source of her fabric and buys them in Japan. "Sewing gives me a way to relax and to express a more exotic fantasy side," she said in an interview. "And it takes me totally away from my reality: the real world of capital offenses, murders, warrant issues."
While many women who sew concentrate on garments, a big part of the boom is in sewing for the home. The Sewing Fashion Council has reported that retailers across the country are reporting a 30 percent increase in the sale of home-decorating fabric and patterns over last year.
A 1989 survey of readers of the magazine Sew News, based in Peoria, Ill., reported that its average reader stitched seven home-decorating projects a year and spent $308 each year on sewing materials for her home, ranging from bedspreads to drapes. Sew News readers said they also spent an average of $646 a year on apparel-sewing.
In 1973, 44 percent of American households reported buying sewing supplies, according to a Consumer Expenditure Survey of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
By 1986, only 13 percent of the households surveyed reported expenditures on fabrics, patterns and notions. By then many department stores had dismantled their huge fabric and notions departments.
"The industry was flat in the last few years as women went to work," said Allan Feller, president of the Butterick Sales Company, in charge of marketing for Butterick and Vogue patterns, which together account for 39 percent of the market. "They felt they did not have time to sew. But as they've moved upward, in professional circles, they need bigger classic career wardrobes and now sewing's an economically attractive idea, too."
Now, in part because of efforts by the sewing industry to lure top fashion designers to lend their names to patterns (and at the same time investing in sophisticated sewing machines that could give homemade clothes the same finished look as quality ready-to-wear and designer clothes), the industry has tapped the psyche of the professional woman who applies the same high standards to her dressmaking and home-decorating as she does to engineering, medicine or architecture.
Such women welcomed the new sewing machines, supplemented by sergers, machines once available only to designers and manufacturers. The sergers, which cost about $600, help cut construction time in half by performing complex functions like seaming, overcasting and trimming excess fabric in one motion.
"Making clothes became less time-consuming than searching racks for the right outfit," Judge Higley-Lane said. "Creative people applied their 'what-if' instinct to the machines, changing the whole slightly disparaging connotation of 'homemade.' "
The demand for sewing classes has increased. Fabric retailers and makers of sewing machines are trying to fill the void, said Stan Ingraham, vice president for sales and marketing for Viking Sewing Machine Company and White Sewing Machine Company. The Sewing Fashion Council has begun a register of sewing instructors and plans an 800 telephone number next year.
Through classes and in the home, sewing skills are apparently being passed on to a new generation. According to research prepared by Forecast Magazine in 1989, a Scholastic Publication, about 60 percent of American teen-agers, boys and girls, said they knew how to sew by machine, and more than two-thirds said they did it for fun.
When Ms. Reid's son, Christopher Tubbs, 19, recently coveted a pair of pull-on pants like his friend's, she said: "I taught him then and there to sew. He brought the pants over, I showed him how to make the pattern and cut it. We sat at my machine, and he sewed them up.
"I'm trying to get people away from being ashamed to use their sewing machines," she said. "I don't think it was the feminist era that did this. I think memories of Home Ec and making aprons did it. I tell people to make something they're going to wear. Don't sew a scarf. Let's do those same stitches and make bike pants."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
And Then There Were 3

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
A WHO'S WHO of airline executives offered a warning last week to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner: The first casualties in America's war of nerves with Saddam Hussein may be right here at home. Several United States carriers, already enfeebled by heavy debt and slumping passenger demand, could be forced into liquidation or merger by another six months of oil inflation.
The airlines want the White House to talk down the price of jet fuel, which has risen far more than other refinery products in the last few months. But Dan Kasper, an economist at Harbridge House, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., argues that it will take more than a little Presidential jawboning to restore the industry to competitive health. 
 What is needed, Mr. Kasper says, is an infusion of capital from Japanese and European carriers eager to expand. Some foreign airlines, he thinks, want access to the domestic American market so badly that they (and their governments) would be willing to give what American carriers covet: the right to compete within Europe and Asia.
 When airline executives talk darkly of a financial debacle in the making, they may not be exaggerating. It is no secret that Eastern and Pan Am are on the ropes; nor is there any doubt that Continental, T.W.A. and Midway are in deep trouble. Northwest and USAir are in no danger of collapse. But they are unlikely to emerge from the recession with the ambition (or the cash) to conquer new markets.
T.W.A.'s surprise bid for Pan Am stirs the pot but cannot change the basic character of the stew. It is being widely interpeted as a diversionary tactic, intended to delay the sale of Pan Am's transAtlantic routes to United, an airline that would give T.W.A. a tougher run for lucrative European traffic. But even if the merger did go through, the new airline would be short of cash and short of domestic traffic to feed its international routes.
Thus business-as-usual is almost certain to leave American, United and Delta in firm control of the domestic market, with little prospect of a challenge from a new entrant or a regional carrier. Consumers would, of course, pay the price as surviving airlines learned to temper their inclination to compete on price. And even the mighty trio might discover their cartel-like silver cloud had a gray lining: such market concentration would invite calls for re-regulation of the industry.
The quickest fix would be a relaxation of the absolute Congressional prohibition on foreign control of American carriers -- a "failing airline" merger provision, perhaps, parallel to the waiver of antitrust scrutiny in mergers of failing corporations. Pan Am, which is running out of assets to sell to cover its monthly bills, would probably be able to make a foreign match; British Air, KLM and Japan Air Lines have been mentioned as eligible suitors. Cash-hemorrhaging Continental, which is already partly owned by Scandinavian Airlines System, would probably also be able to find a partner to guarantee its survival.
But the better way to insure competition, Mr. Kasper suggests, would be a grand deal that opened the airline markets of America, Europe and the Asian rim to international investment and competition. That would allow American and United, already powerhouses on regulated international routes, to become true multinational carriers. And it would give both USAir and Northwest a chance to merge with foreign partners, which could supply the cash to buy fuel-efficient planes and the international links to feed passengers.
A deal opening the European market would be an easy sell to the dominant American carriers, industry sources say, provided they could sell seats from country to country within Europe. And it would certainly tempt their European counterparts, which will not be permitted to maintain cozy cartel arrangements within an integrated European market and know that their main chance lies in stronger international links.
For workers at failing United States airlines, integration would be an unmixed blessing. It might be possible, moreover, to fashion deals that serve the interests of current employees at stronger carriers -- deals that protect both their tenure and their wages. But such sweeping changes would still be bound to create uncertainties, with unions competing for turf and employees of merged carriers scrapping over seniority.
The collapse of a major carrier might break the "I'm all right Jack" attitudes that have made global integration an impossible dream. But do not bet on it: neither the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Eastern nor the slow-motion dismemberment of Pan Am has led to calls for an international rescue. Meanwhile, the prospects for preserving consumers' gains from deregulation grow dimmer.

HEADLINE: Defense Puts Eagles Into Playoff Picture

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 13

 BODY:
After the Eagles finished 11-5 and reached the playoffs last season, they were projected this season as a Super Bowl contender or at least a major force in the National Conference championship race. Randall Cunningham figured prominently into the Eagles' equation, but their big-bang defense was front and center in the Eagles' promise.
After all, the Eagles' defense led the league with 30 interceptions and 26 recovered fumbles in 1989. Their 56 forced turnovers easily outnumbered their closest challenger (Denver had 43) and doubled the defensive turnovers gained by six National Football League teams. 
 But Philadelphia stumbled to a 1-3 start this year and entered its Monday night encounter here against Washington with a defense that had slipped in nearly every category and one that had not scored a touchdown after getting four last year. The defensive dropoff was a major reason Philadelphia was 4-4.
"I think a lot of what happened was just timing," said William Frizzell, a safety, who started a good thing and saw the rest of his defensive mates join the fray in the Eagles' 28-14 victory over the Redskins.
Frizzell's 30-yard interception return for a touchdown gave Philadelphia a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. The Redskins tied the score in the second and then the Eagles exploded in the third. In the final 3 minutes 50 seconds of the quarter, the Eagles scored three touchdowns, with the defense paving the way. One touchdown came after Clyde Simmons scooped up a fumble caused by Wes Hopkins's nasty sack of Jeff Rutledge and ran 18 yards for a touchdown. Another came after Byron Evans tipped a pass into the hands of Reggie White, who rumbled 33 yards to the Redskins' 9 to set up a touchdown pass by Cunningham and the Eagles' final points.
The Eagles believe that "Buddy Ball" is back.
They are not sure where it went.
"We weren't down on ourselves, but we were doing more talking than playing," Frizzell said. "But this is a group that never loses confidence in itself. We had concentration tonight. We had intensity. When we have that, we get turnovers."
Philadelphia has won three straight games. Cunningham appears more comfortable with the teachings of his new offensive coordinator, Rich Kotite, and the running game is rejuvenated with Heath Sherman, who is the first Eagle to rush for back-to-back 100-yard games since Wilbert Montgomery in 1981. Philadelphia finishes its regular season with a home game against Dallas and then at Phoenix. Its five games preceding those matchups -- at Atlanta, playing host to the Giants, at Buffalo, at Miami and being host to Green Bay -- will tax the Eagles' resurgent mix and decide their playoff chances.
"We're going to the playoffs," Jerome Brown said. "And we ain't stopping once we get there."

 
Minor League Talks

At their meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, the N.F.L. owners will take a long look at its proposed minor league, possibly voting on moving the 1993 Super Bowl from Phoenix and restructuring the league's office would give Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner, greater authority.
The World League of American Football has been a troubling project since its inception last summer. The idea was for a 12-team league in Europe and in the United States from which N.F.L. teams could draw players. From the start, it did not receive complete financial support from the league's 28 owners, with the Chicago Bears and the Phoenix Cardinals abstaining. Tex Schramm, the league's original president, refused to call it a minor league, saying it would compete with the N.F.L. for players and that its span and growth were unlimited. Schamm was let go and replaced by Mike Lynn, the Minnesota Vikings' general manager, and the league was scaled back to a minor league concept.
It is scheduled to begin play next spring, but Tagliabue indicated this week that gloomy economic forecasts both in the United States and abroad might postpone its start and even end the project.
The league still hopes that Arizona will find a way to make the Martin Luther King Holiday on Jan. 15 a statewide paid holiday. Arizona's vote against the holiday last week prompted Tagliabue to recommend that the owners move the 1993 Super Bowl from Phoenix. Norman Braman, the Eagles' owner and chairman of the Super Bowl site committee, said: "With no King holiday, moving the Super Bowl is clearly the right thing to do."
Braman, Hugh Culverhouse, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' owner, and Jack Donlan, director of the managment council, are among league figures whose roles could change if the owners adopt recommendations of a study of the league's hierarchy. Tagliabue has the report that the league commissioned from the New York-based Booz-Allen management firm a year ago that recommends that factions in the league such as N.F.L. Properties, headed by Braman, and the management council, headed by Culverhouse and Donlan, be brought directly under Tagliabue's direction. All three reportedly resist those changes and will fight against the recommendations.

BYLINE: By RON ALEXANDER

 BODY:
A GREEN-THUMBED friend writes:
One morning a few weeks ago when the trees were full and lush a Greenwich Village neighbor phoned me. "A van just sideswiped one of the trees on our block," he said, urgency in his voice. "Part of the tree fell to the sidewalk. Can you come down? It's very sad." 
 Oh, great, I thought. I'm late for work, the cleaning lady hasn't shown up, the Persian Gulf is about to explode and now this guy wants me to look at a tree. I took my time checking it out. When I did I saw a gaping wound in the upper reaches of the trunk and broken limbs blocking the sidewalk. The sudden sadness I felt took me by surprise. I stared at this tree -- an ordinary Callery pear tree on an ordinary New York street -- I had always taken for granted, never even really noticed. Its fate, I'm told, is uncertain. But it is still standing and each time I pass it I'm grateful.
A few days later and barely a block away a New York City recycling truck smashed into another Callery pear tree, the one Vicky and Don Gabay planted in front of their brownstone when their daughter Rachel was born 21 years ago. This time the sight of a large, graceful branch smashed to the ground proved almost too painful for me.
The Gabays and their three children were distraught. Mrs. Gabay said parks department officials had assured her that someone would be sent to cut off a branch on the sidewalk side of the tree to make it less top-heavy. Before that happened, an evening windstorm snapped the wounded tree in half; less than six feet remain of a tree that had stretched proudly to the top of the Gabays' five-story home.
"The quality of life in New York has gotten so difficult, yet through it all we stayed and raised three kids," Mrs. Gabay said. "The irony is that it was a recycling truck that killed a tree that meant so much to us."
As for me, I now look at the neighborhood trees with wonder and affection.

 Overheard by Rita Silverstein in the ladies' room at Entertainment Weekly: "Well, I finally met my first Jewish wide receiver."
 Wendi Weill and Matthew Seiden, nervous new parents from Short Hills, N.J., decided to take an intensive infant first-aid course on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. A dozen or so other mothers and fathers were also there, all looking equally apprehensive. All, that is, except one terrific-looking couple: immaculately dressed, beautifully coiffed, well-rested. Not for them the dark circles that turned up under other eyes.
Three hours into the course, after the instructor had dealt with everything from burns ("Never apply butter or ice") to electrocution ("Never leave an outlet uncovered"), he turned to choking. "Never allow your baby to swallow anything smaller than a grape!" he warned. The parents nodded numbly. The beautiful couple, brows furrowed in unison, seemed especially disturbed by the grape rule.
"But what shall we do?" the woman wailed. "Our nanny's tortellini is the only food our Catherine will eat."

Dear Diary:
 It is just after twilight on Halloween and I am working quietly at home, pausing every few minutes to drop a box of Milk Duds (ah, tradition!) into the eager bags of the imp and gnome passers-by. When Debra, my wife, returns from work, she quizzes me on the Halloween proceedings and informs me that I've been going about things all wrong. It takes only a few moments until the doorbell rings again, providing her with an opportunity to exhibit the approved technique.
At our door we find an aspiring witch, perhaps 8 or 9 years of age, complete with black cape and peaked hat. Without even the customary greeting, the young visitor thrusts a gaping bag of candied loot in our direction. Debra bends down and patiently explains that, when she was a little girl in the Midwest, you had to do something to get your candy: sing, dance, tell a joke.
The witch blinks at this new information and then, imperturbably, thrusts forth her bag again. "Lady, I got this whole block to work," she says.
That, of course, earns two boxes of Milk Duds. -- ROBERT STONE
 Time: About 7:15 P.M. on Halloween. Place: Scarsdale. Cast of characters: A gaggle of trick-or-treaters, 8 or 9 years old, and Michael Cardozo, walking home from the train station, who overhears the following:
"Yes, Daddy, everything's fine. O.K., Daddy, I'll check back with you soon."
There are no other adults in sight, but as he turns, Mr. Cardoza sees a cute young witch return a portable phone to her trick-or-treat bag.

HEADLINE: Desert Sword: Time for Answers

 BODY:
Suddenly, in the wake of President Bush's declaration of possible war against Iraq, members of Congress clamor to be heard. They're acting not merely within their rights but within their responsibilities.
President Bush deserved and won wide support for creating Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia. But now, with hardly a justifying word, he has transformed that policy into Desert Sword. Mr. Bush, who has repeatedly left himself open to criticism for failing to articulate America's interests in the crisis, can now be called to account. 
 Though some members would have preferred a special session of Congress, this purpose can probably be satisfactorily met by the hearings the Senate has now scheduled. It would be folly for the White House to ignore the unease expressed in varying ways by Democratic senators like Sam Nunn, Claiborne Pell and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Republicans like Richard Lugar of Indiana.
What all these voices are saying is that Congress has a rightful constitutional share in war-making decisions. Congress and the public need deliberate discussion of:
* Mr. Bush's abrupt turn from a policy of deter- and-defend to one of offensive capability;
* His sudden impatience with the effectiveness of the international sanctions against Iraq;
* His concept of the alliance arrayed against Iraq, for now and in the future.
Calls for a declaration of war seem premature, as do proposals to invoke the War Powers Act. Congress chose before adjourning to accept Mr. Bush's claim that American forces in Saudi Arabia were in no imminent danger, thereby avoiding the act's 60-day clock.
But the newly announced buildup has stretched to the limit the initial rationale for ducking the war powers argument. Well-wishing senators complain that they have been given little more than generalities at briefings in which even the Secretary of Defense deflects legitimate questions, saying lamely, "That's above my pay grade."
"If ever a blockade might work, it's here," says Senator Moynihan, who has yet to hear a comprehensive appraisal of the effect of United Nations sanctions on Iraq's economy. And there are other questions, like why the new buildup was announced before the U.N. Security Council could adopt a use-of-force resolution.
The unease is heightened by how much Mr. Bush has vacillated in declaring his objectives. He wanted to deter an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia; free Kuwait, uphold world law, defend the American way of life, protect American lives and build a regional security system that would assure access to gulf oil. Now his Secretary of State proclaims that the real purpose is to save American jobs.
As a crisis manager, the President has performed admirably; as a mobilizer of political support, he has veered all over the lot. He may well have a solid case but still hasn't made it. A full-dress televised hearing will offer a proper forum, and test. The questions keep reverberating.

Running Scared

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
Every country in the East has its own post-Communist problems. But they all share the discovery that things had gotten much worse than anyone realized.
Dismantling Communist structures has aggravated economic and social difficulties, demolishing old forms of organization and authority without yet being able to replace them. But the extent of collapse revealed how shaky it all was, how much was stripped away, left to rot from within, emptied of resources. 
 An American with senior government experience remarked recently that it was a massive intelligence failure by the West. He was referring particularly to East Germany, which had been considered the one relatively successful Communist economy, and it too turned out to be a sump pit.
It is hard to fault intelligence, though. There weren't secrets to steal. The leaders didn't know themselves. The most carefully planned, informant-ridden, intrusive regimes knew far less about their own societies than the casual, variegated West does about itself.
Then what were we so worried about? Why did the free world feel so threatened, not only by the Soviet arsenal but also by subversion?
A Western cold-war conspiracy to fight what seemed imminent danger is coming to light in Europe. It is already rocking the Italian Government and will touch many others. There was, it is revealed, an organized underground, provided with hidden arms depots, prepared to launch guerrilla wars and resistance in the event of invasion from the East or overthrow of democratic governments from within.
There were different epic names for the operations -- "Gladio" in Italy (manned by secret gladiators), "Rose in the Wind" in France, "Red Fleece" in Belgium. They were sometimes directed, but generally coordinated, by NATO with participation of the C.I.A. and British secret service.
Former C.I.A. Director William Colby has confirmed some of this in recent interviews with Italian journalists. They also reported that meetings of the clandestine groups were held as recently as a few weeks ago in Brussels, though several governments claim it all ended by the 80's.
The Italian Government has said there were 139 caches of clandestine arms, explosives and communications equipment of which 127 were recovered years ago. They haven't accounted for the rest.
But Rome has been scandalized because a junior judge in Venice, investigating the operations, has issued a subpoena to the President of the Republic, Francesco Cossiga, who had served as Minister of Defense and Minister of Interior. Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been in most governments for the last 40 years, refused opposition demands for a parliamentary commission.
The suspicion in Italy, Belgium and other countries is that the groups were used for domestic political purposes, possibly even terrorism to justify government crackdowns and defense preparedness. We are just hearing the beginnings of this. Sweden and Spain were also affected. No doubt there were Communist offensive conspiracies. But the question now is why democracies felt so weak, or if these were counterplots to undermine democratic governments in the name of anti-Communism.
The "Red menace" was taken deadly seriously by many rational people. One reason perhaps was U.S. demobilization at the end of World War II when Europe was still ravaged and chaotic, while Stalin managed to conceal the weakness of the Soviet Union. He did expect to take over most of Western Europe.
But his real weapon was ideological and intellectual. It is hard now to understand the Communist appeal in the postwar period. The Communists had the allure of early and vigorous anti-Fascism when many had ignored the Nazis or collaborated.
They promised a brave new world after the horrors of the Depression and war, with a moral vision of justice. They preached that money, not Moscow, was the root of all evil, and the frenetic crusade against Moscow only seemed to confirm their argument. Jean-Pierre Chevenement, now French Defense Minister, was among the many who responded proudly, "I am anti-anti-Communism."
All that is gone, dust, like medieval disputes about the sex of angels. What is left? Just money, material well-being? It was never enough, and it isn't the reason the West won the long struggle so dramatically. Freedom, consent were the bulwarks, and they proved their strength. When they are undermined, it is from within. The things we do running scared are what hurt us most.

Bonds Rally on Weak Output Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The rally in the Government bond market continued yesterday, as traders pushed up prices of some Treasury securities as much as a point and long-term interest rates fell to their lowest levels since the Persian Gulf crisis began.
The catalyst behind yesterday's move was a Federal Reserve report that industrial output had dropped eight-tenths of a percent in October, the first decline since April. 
 The drop in the industrial production index was slightly more than had been expected, but economists and bond dealers said the depth of the decline was not as significant as its breadth.
 
 'In a Downturn'
 "Sector after sector, product group after product group, showed declines," said Joseph Liro, a vice president and economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc. "The report shows that the economy is in a downturn with negative growth."
Analysts said the report, which was released just before members of the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee met in Washington, would provide further ammunition to those members of the committee who are arguing for an easing in monetary policy.
"The Open Market Committee is far from united about the need to ease policy, because there is still a lot of concern about the inflation outlook," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh "But with these production figures, it could be that October was the month that the recession started. I think that possibility is enough for the Fed to lower the funds rate by another 25 basis points."
The Fed gave no indication yesterday that it had altered its policy stance. But Mr. Liro and other analysts said the central bank could give a signal as early as today that it is pushing down the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market from 7.75 percent, its current target level.
 
 Short-Term Rates Steady
 An easing by the Fed would be most closely reflected in the price of short-term Treasury securities, and their prices, which have risen strongly in the last week, were little changed yesterday.
The big gains were posted in bonds, and analysts said the rally among long-term securities could continue whether the Federal funds rate is cut quickly or not.
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 3/8, up a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face value, to yield 8.52 percent. That is the lowest level since early August. In London trading on Monday, the issue was offered at a price to yield 8.54 percent. The Government securities market was closed in the United States on Monday in observance of Veterans Day.
"Another test of the 8.50 percent yield level appears likely in the next couple of days regardless of whether or not the Fed signals an easing move on Wednesday," analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, said in their daily market commentary.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 27/32 late yesterday, up 1/2 point, to yield 8.37 percent. But the 7 3/4 percent two-year notes rose by just 1/32, to 100 10/32, to yield 7.57 percent.
 
 Bill Rates Unchanged
 Interest rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday were little changed from their levels a week ago.
At the auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.05 percent, down slightly from an average rate of 7.07 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.02 percent, compared with an average of 7.05 percent rate a week ago.
With the economy losing steam and the supply of new Treasury issues limited to short-term securities for the next month or so, analysts said the rally could be sustained for some time.
"Over the next six months, there is more to go on the upside in price and downside in yield," said Roger Froelich, president of Technical Dimensions, a bond market advisory service in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
Mr. Froelich said he was "optimistic, but not wildly bullish" about the market. He added that during the next six months the rates on three-month Treasury bills could fall by half a percentage point from current levels and that bond yields could decline to 8 1/8 percent.
 
 Corporate Sector Is Active
 The decline in long-term interest rates encouraged a number of corporations to price new debt issues yesterday.
Among the issuers was Hyrdo-Quebec, which offered $500 million of 40-year debentures through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 9 1/2 percent securities, which mature Nov. 15, 2030, were priced at 99.425, to yield 9.556 percent, or 1.03 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In addition, the Pennzoil Company offered $250 million of 15-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Lehman Brothers.
The 10 1/4 percent securities, which mature Nov. 1, 2005, were priced at 99.36 to yield 10.341 percent, or 1.95 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by about 1/8 point to 1/4 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The Wrong Strategy

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
President Bush has adopted exactly the wrong strategy in his decision to send heavy reinforcements to American troops in the Middle East, at the same time canceling plans to rotate home some of the forces already there.
By sending these signals that a war against Iraq is about to be launched, Mr. Bush has turned his back on a harder but perhaps more promising Presidential task -- preparing the American public for what may appear to be a long stalemate in the desert, while the embargo and boycott he has organized actually are squeezing Iraq into a resolution of the Mideast crisis. 
 The President obviously, almost openly, is trying to convince Saddam Hussein that he faces a choice between war and retreat. Unless Mr. Hussein soon backs out of Kuwait, that is, the U.S.-led coalition facing him along the Saudi Arabian border will attack, force his withdrawal and perhaps drive on into Iraq itself.
The trouble with this strategy is that it relies on convincing the Iraqi leader of something inherently improbable, which he is unlikely to accept despite Mr. Bush's signals.
Mr. Hussein knows that a war on Iraq would shatter the anti-Iraq coalition. As Secretary of State Baker learned on his recent tour, the idea of war wins little support among any of the coalition partners except the "front-line" Arab leaders most threatened by Saddam Hussein. And it's not certain that even they could lead their populations into full-scale war against a brother Arab nation. Nor is it clear that U.N. support for the embargo and blockade could be extended to approval of war.
Mr. Hussein can hardly be blind to the fact that the U.S. population is anything but eager for a war with Iraq. Not only is the purpose of such a war unclear -- for oil? to restore the emirate in Kuwait? to resist Iraqi aggression? -- but so is the necessity, the vital interest. Until it is crystal clear that the embargo and blockade are futile, many Americans will be hesitant to accept heavy casualties for any of these goals.
Questions now being openly raised by Senator Sam Nunn, the Democrats' most respected military spokesman, Senator Pat Moynihan and others only emphasize what Mr. Hussein must know already -- that Mr. Bush would not have undivided popular support for a Mideast war, particularly if he launched it soon.
If, moreover, as some statements and events suggest he might, the President undertook that war without either Congressional or U.N. authority, antiwar sentiment would quickly become powerful. But if he did seek such backing, doubts at the U.N. and in Congress would emphasize the opposition; and going to these bodies would destroy the possibility of a surprise attack.
Finally, Mr. Hussein probably is confident that his battle-hardened and desert-bred forces, fighting on the defensive, would make a strong showing -- perhaps even prevail, or force a stalemate, and certainly inflict horrendous casualties. Americans, with their goals unclear, their interest uncertain, their sons ill prepared and ill equipped for desert combat, would not be willing for long to sustain such a war.
So the Iraqi leader will be a "hard sell," no matter how many troops Mr. Bush deploys. The worst threat to Mr. Hussein, in fact, is not necessarily a military attack but the constant and increasing economic pressures of the boycott and the embargo. These weapons, already having some effect, will have even more as the months creep along -- at some point inevitably undermining popular morale, Iraqi fighting capacity and Mr. Hussein himself.
The problem with relying on such pressures, Administration spokesmen and war hawks now assert, is that the U.S. public will grow tired of waiting for them to succeed, and will gradually lose interest in seeing them enforced around the world. Saddam Hussein, in this view, has only to wait to be home free.
It's an odd idea, however, that bloody and destructive war would be more acceptable than peaceful, long-term pressures. If Mr. Bush, instead of threatening that war, would focus his efforts on persuading Americans to sustain those pressures, who can be sure the people would not respond? Has the "bully pulpit" lost its ability to persuade Americans -- in Harry Truman's phrase -- "to do what they ought to do without persuasion"?
President Bush, principally, organized the boycott and blockade and preached their necessity. Did he mean it? Or did he only seek to gain time to prepare for war? And who is it, anyway, that seems most nearly to be losing patience -- the American public or George Bush?

Canadian Bank To Open U.S. Unit

 BODY:
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which has assets of more than $85 billion (United States) and is one of the 10 largest banks in North America, yesterday announced the formation of a group specializing in public finance to be based in New York.
The bank, which has headquarters in Toronto, said the new operation would focus on providing credit enhancements that improve the marketability and distribution of tax-exempt and taxable debt issues of states, municipalities and revenue-based authorities. Besides the traditional tax and revenue-supported bond issues, the bank said it would also work with special issuers of private financing.
Credit enhancements like insurance or letters of credit issued by banks provide an added measure of safety for a bond issue, making it more attractive to investors. Enhancements can also allow the issuer to borrow at lower interest rates.

HEADLINE: MAN IN THE NEWS: WENDELL HAMPTON FORD;
The No. 2 Man for the Democrats in the Senate

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 13

 BODY:
Two years ago, Senator Wendell H. Ford stood up to face his Democratic colleagues and acknowledged that he had lost in his attempt to unseat Senator Alan Cranston as Democratic whip.
 It was an embarrassing concession for the Kentucky Senator, whom many consider to be one of the Senate's consumate insiders and deal makers. He had entered the race late, and miscalculated his chances of unseating Mr. Cranston of California, who had held the No. 2 Senate post since 1977. But before sitting down, Senator Ford announced that as of that date he was running for whip in 1990. 
 Today, with Mr. Cranston having withdrawn from the race because of prostate cancer, the 66-year-old Senator from Kentucky was approved by voice vote.
 
'Like a Birthday'
 "It's like a birthday," he said, adding he had enough commitments to win even if Senator Cranston had stayed in the race.
That will never be known. But almost everyone agreed that the Senate Democrats have added to their leadership a 15-year Senate veteran skilled in the old-style politics of back room deals, quiet negotiations and handshakes. "I believe that politics is the art of compromise," he says.
He is seldom seen giving speeches on the floor of he Senate. "Why make a speech when you can sit down with your colleagues and work something out?" he says.
It is a strikingly different style from the grandiose speeches, public confrontations and histrionics that have sometimes marked Senate debates in recent years. But it has served Mr. Ford and his home state well.
In his last election. in 1986, he received 75 percent of the vote, in part because he is one of the state's most popular politicians and his down-home style appeals to many constituents.
 
Serves His Constituency
 He serves the economic interests of big and small business, including the tobacco, liquor, coal and horsebreeding industries. And he has vigorously opposed excise taxes, export tariffs and Federal funds for competing businesses.
When Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, proposed an amendment to stop export subsidies on tobacco, Senator ord not only stood in the way of the proposal, but also threatened to retaliate against Rhode Island.
Senator Lloyd Bentson, Democrat of Texas, said of his colleague, "He's a deal maker and has very effectively defended the economic interest of his state."
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Ford, who has a leathery complexion, square face and gentle Southern drawl, outlined his approach to politics.
"My daddy told me when you have the votes, let the other guy talk," he said. "And never leave the table without winning at least something."
He defended the need for a strong tobacco and distilled spirits industry in his state, despite the adverse publicity both have been receiving.
 
In Praise of Cash Crops
 "You have a health side to this debate, but we also have an economic side to this debate," he said. "A lot of kids in our state can go to college because they have an acre of tobacco. Spirits, that is an industry that we rely on heavily for employment in our state."
But he said he decided not to fight the excise tax on tobacco and distilled spirits "because it was a done deal."
Once elected today, he quickly fell in line with the the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and declined to give his opinions on the Persian Gulf crisis.
"Senator Mitchell is the party spokesman, and he should speak for us," he said. "In Kentucky we are known for our horses. I plan on being a work horse and not a show horse."
Some say it was the involvement in day-to-day affairs of Senator Mitchell and his predecessor, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, that diminished Senator Cranston's role as whip.
Officially, the post of whip is designed to monitor party sentiment on important issues, count votes and pressure wavering lawmakers. That role should well suit Senator Ford, who owns a love for such details of governing.
As chaimran of the Senate Rules Committee, he has had little to say about geopolitical matters, but he controls things like committee budgets, room assignments, computer systems, parking spaces and expense vouchers -- items that matter little to the public but very much to senators.
 
'A Dumb Country Boy'
 Wendell Hampton Ford, born on Sept. 8, 1924, to Ernest and Irene Ford, likes to couch his stry as one of rags to riches. He has referred to himself as "a dumb country boy with dirt between his toes."
That might be the result of his early experience. Growing up in Thruston, Ky., he graduated from Daviess County High School, attented the University of Kentucky but did not graduate.
He went into his father's insurance brokerage business and by the early 1960's had entered Kentucky politics, getting elected state senator, lieutenant Governor and then Governor in 1971. He has been in the Senate since 1975.
He has been married to his wife, Jean, for 47 years. They have two children and five grandchildren.
Mr. Ford is also an avid angler -- "We just take a stick, string and a cork and throw it into the water" -- as well as a duck hunter. He says he tried to get away duck hunting with his son Steven, "because it gives us a chance to talk without anything around butting in."
And, reflecting a touch of bitterness from his run-in with Senator Cranston two years ago, he says he hopes to rejuvenate the whip post.
"I think there ought to be new life and vision in the post," he said. "Being more visual on the floor, helping senators get their bills and amendments up for votes."

HEADLINE: An Impish Coloratura Who Takes Risks

BYLINE: By ELEANOR BLAU

 BODY:
In the role of Oscar, the impish page in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Verdi's "Ballo in Maschera," Harolyn Blackwell risks perils beyond the coloratura demands of her vocal line, because her character is so active.
"He's a nonstop chatterbox, running around and being the life of the party," said Ms. Blackwell, who will repeat the role at tonight's performance and who has won high praise for her silvery tone and the charm of her portrayal. At times, she faces unexpected problems. 
 For example, in Act I the other evening, the 5-foot-1 soprano tried to snatch a heavy cape off the shoulders of a dignified judge, a piece of stage business worked out for this production, but it wouldn't budge.
Last month, on opening night, the cape yielded all right, but Ms. Blackwell's hat flew off as she twirled around. She picked it up, put it back on and dashed across the stage, where she lost it again. Next scene, another hat of hers dropped and, in Act III, off came her belt. "Oh, she's losing her clothes," people backstage teased her, she recalled.
 
Soaring Above Everyone
 As for the singing, she said, "It's tricky, because the voice is always sparkling and very staccato."
"The first aria is a combination of very staccato and then very legato, back and forth," she continued. "And in the quintet, this long, gorgeous line, you just have to soar above everyone."
"It's a very fulfilling role," she added with a grin.
The soprano, who made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1987, chatted with animation about her role and her career the other day in her sublet apartment near Lincoln Center, a high-rise perch with fantastic street views and sounds of howling winds.
She said she was pleased that the director, Piero Faggioni, had allowed her to make Oscar as mischievous as she had envisioned him.
In previous productions, her portrayal has stressed more of Oscar's "elegant" side, she said. Ms. Blackwell has played the role in Hamburg, Germany, then Chicago and Toronto. The Chicago production, in the 1986-87 season, marked her debut with the Lyric Opera, and, as in the Met production, it starred Luciano Pavarotti as her ill-fated master, the King.
"I adore him," Ms. Blackwell said. He has given her singing tips, she added, and is easy to act with, sometimes giving her a playful nudge onstage, for instance, in the spirit of regal affection.
 
Only Musician in the Family
 She grew up in Washington, where her father, Harold, for whom she was named, was a redevelopment specialist with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and her mother taught physical education and health at the University of the District of Columbia.
Ms. Blackwell, who has three sisters and a brother, is the only musician in her family. She began piano lessons at the age of 10 and, months later, added voice lessons, with Nancy Notargiacomo, who had been her fourth-grade teacher.
That was an early start for a singer, she noted, but her teacher did not push her into arias or other vocalizing inappropriate for a child. Ms. Blackwell learned first to breathe properly, from the diaphragm, she said. She was introduced to that technique at the start of her first lesson, when her teacher instructed her to lie on the floor and pant like a dog.
"I was a very shy child," she recalled, "and my zest for life I attribute to her. I joke with her saying, 'You've created this monster!' "
She performed in musical theater in school and in community theater, but majored in education at the Catholic University of America in Washington and taught in parochial schools for a year. Feeling that "a part of me was not satisfied," she said, she returned to the university while still teaching, and received a graduate degree in music performance.
 
A Finalist in Met Auditions
 Soon she auditioned for a revival of "West Side Story" and found herself on Broadway in 1980, singing "Somewhere" from the orchestra pit and thereby confusing audience members, whom she could see searching for the source of the sound. She was also on stage in the musical, with which she toured the United States and abroad for two and a half years. She then joined an apprenticeship program of the Lyric Opera and in 1983 became a finalist in the Met's national auditions.
She made her Met debut four years later as Pousette in "Manon," then appeared as Xenia in "Boris Godunov," and also made her New York recital debut at Town Hall. Last year at the Met, she performed her first Adele in "Die Fledermaus." She will sing her first Susanna in "Le Nozze di Figaro" at the Met next May, and her first Zerlina in "Don Giovanni" next year.
So for now, she is focusing on "bread and butter roles," she said, and hearing, with some amazement, changes in her voice. "In the last two years, it's become a brighter, larger sound," she said, "and I'm feeling more comfortable with the coloratura."
She had thought of herself as a lyric soprano, and even, briefly, as a mezzo, but discovered in graduate school that her range was greater than she had known.
"My voice teacher said: 'Oh my God, you have all those notes. I think you are a lyric coloratura,' " Ms. Blackwell recounted. "I said I didn't sing above high C. I had never really used this part of my tessitura. And I was singing high G's and A's, unknown territory."
These days, she said, she is getting more into what her current teacher, Shirley Emmons, calls the "core" of her voice. "I'll be on one particular note and not getting it," she said, "that's not it, not it, and then, all of a sudden, the piano strings start to vibrate and I know I'm there."

HEADLINE: Editors Wanted; English Helpful

BYLINE: By Ken Jacobson; Ken Jacobson is editor in chief of Metals Week.

 BODY:
"Enclosed is my resume in response to Sunday's New York Times."
Well, there's a whole stack of applications here. Let's look at another. 
 "Enclosed is my resume in response to my search for an editorial/ creative position."
This is an editor's job we're offering. They can't all be like this.
"My experience in the production of newsletters, magazines, directories and on-line data bases puts me head and shoulders above the crowd of applicants you have no doubtedly been inundated with."
Fortunately, this assessment was wrong. Unfortunately, it was not as far wrong as one might expect -- or hope. The publication I work for received more than 80 applications after advertising in this newspaper; these submissions provided a catalogue of bad grammar, improper word use and plain, old-fashioned sloppiness.
But perhaps "old-fashioned" is, in the present context, itself an improper term. This editor fears that not only the sloppiness but the other shortcomings so frequently found in his small sampling of resumes and cover letters may speak more of the future than of the past.
That reporters and editors -- most of them young, all of them with college degrees -- would express themselves so poorly and show such carelessness while engaged in the solemn business of pursuing their careers raises disturbing questions about America's standards, both educational and professional.
This is not to say that the candidates lacked eagerness. One promised that he could "be compulsively detail oriented at will," another that he would bring to the job "an avowed interest in foreign affairs." Nor were they shy about their accomplishments. "My career," wrote one woman, "has been spent in journalism and the not-for-profit sector with forays in government and television." Another claimed she had "doubled [the] clientele base" of a past employer "from 150 to 400."
Some of the grammatical lapses were particularly ill-timed. "The description of responsibilities for the editor's position," wrote one young man, "correspond greatly with those of my previous job as a legal assistant. Clarity, consistency, and proper grammar are necessities that cannot be overlooked" -- except, apparently, when it comes to the agreement of subject and predicate.
In fact, a question that bubbled up through the resumes was whether those submitting them realized that part of what they were communicating was the amount of thought and care they might be expected to put into their work.
If they had, would they have failed in numerous instances to use the spell checkers on their word processors? Would there have been such self-subverting claims as: "I am able to research, organize information, simplify complex material, write on technical topics for both lay and professional readers, copy edit, proof read . . .?" Or such ironic missteps as: "I belive [sic] I have experience of all the facets needed for your position." Because we have a small staff, I perform many tasks. I serve as the only copy editor."
In a personal sense, I have little to complain about; on the contrary, glaring errors make it easier to sort applications. In a larger sense, however, I am worried. With the information age upon us, English, still the leading international language, has emerged as one of our country's most precious natural resources. But all natural resources require judicious management. The U.S. has already lost its comparative advantage in many sectors of the world economy. It would be a shame to surrender this advantage as well.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Toy Stocks Weak At Crucial Season

BYLINE: By Eben Shapiro

 BODY:
THE toy industry has been surprisingly resistant to hard times. Past recessions proved that parents will give up a lot of things before they will disappoint their children on Christmas.
Nonetheless, the stock market seems largely to be ignoring past trends and focusing more on bleak expectations for the economy and the evaporation of consumer confidence. A number of toy industry stocks are trading close to their 52-week lows.
And there are indeed some indications that this Christmas season may run counter to past trends. Cautious retailers, wary of being left with shelves of unbought goods, are keeping inventories low on all items, including toys. And fewer people are visiting shopping malls. "What the stocks are saying is, 'There might be somewhat more cyclicality here than meets the eye,' " said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.
Analysts and toy company executives say that specific products, along with overall economic conditions, help to determine the health of the $13-billion-a-year industry. "A strong product trend can buck an economic trend," Ms. French said.
Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the recession year of 1982 "was a great year for the toy industry." He added, "Parents know what a slowdown is, but kids don't."
B. J. French, a spokeswoman for the Tonka Corporation, agrees. "Even in the recession of the early 1980's," she said, "toy sales seemed to go up."
Nintendo continues to captivate toy buyers, andthe Japanese machines and their accompanying games, made under license by a number of companies, are again expected to be best sellers. Sales of electronic games are projected at $4 billion this year, more than 20 percent of all toy sales. Still, analysts say the video craze may finally be peaking, a result of boredom and saturation.
In any case, American toy makers largely missed the video boom. Mattel Inc., for instance, was preoccupied with financial problems several years ago and was unable to develop competitive video products. It has since found a way to take advantage of the craze with its Power Glove, which slips over a player's hand, replacing the stick control.
Hasbro Inc. spent millions of dollars developing Nemo, its own electronic video game, but never brought it out.
Going forward, any decline in video games' popularity should free a lot of dollars for other items, to the benefit of traditional toy makers like Hasbro and Mattel.
The Barbie doll by Mattel is experiencing strong sales, and large dolls are also selling well. "You are seeing emotional items doing better," said Mr. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody. Sales are strong again for Cabbage Patch dolls, which have belonged to Hasbro since it acquired Coleco Industries in 1989.
When it comes to individual toy stocks, a mixed picture exists. "I like the two big guys, and I'd avoid everything else," Mr. Jacobson said, referring to Mattel and Hasbro.
Mattel, which has undergone a significant revamping in the last few years, is a favorite of analysts. Its stock price has nearly tripled in two years. Barbie accounted for about half of the company's 1989 sales of $1.23 billion, analysts say. Mattel's stock closed at $19.125 yesterday, down 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts cite Hasbro as a model of diversification, which makes it less dependent on the hit products that typically drive the industry. Nonetheless, investors want the company to develop a substitute for its flagging G.I. Joe and Transformer lines. A share of Hasbro closed at $15 yesterday, up 75 cents on the American Stock Exchange.
Heavy debts or concerns about management have caused analysts to steer away from other companies. "Tonka is at a critical state," Mr. Jacobson said, citing the company's indebtedness, a result of its 1987 acquisition of Kenner Parker.
Lewis Galoob Toys Inc., which makes miniature vehicles known as Micro Machines, is out of favor for its inability to develop a core line of products to sustain the company between hits.
In the short term, toy sales should benefit from changing demographics, Mr. Jacobson said, noting that last year there were nearly four million births in the United States, the most in 30 years. Plenty of money will be spent on these children of the baby-boom generation, he said, because there are more two-income households, more affluent grandparents, and more divorces, which often lead to each parent's spending heavily on toys.
But Mr. Jacobson also says that children are growing up faster and tend to quit playing with toys at a younger age. "Twenty years ago, 12-year-old kids played with dolls and cars," he wrote in a recent report. "Today they are most likely interested in CD's, movies and the opposite sex."

The Hurdles Are Many, but the Reward Is a Child

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Romania

 BODY:
Moved by pictures she had seen of the desperate conditions in Romanian orphanages, Linda Tresgaskis came here from Austin, Tex., for the first time last July to find a year-old child to take home with her.
She recently came through a crash course in the ordeals of Romanian adoption with flying colors -- and a 2-week-old son named Charles Michael. 
 Her friend from Rochester, N.Y., who had come hoping to adopt two or three babies under one year old, is leaving with a 7-year-old daughter, a 2 1/2-year-old son, an infant and prospects for adopting a fourth baby, not yet born.
"It is funny how it works out," said the new mother, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "You cannot predict which ones you will fall in love with."
In the last few months, the adoption of Romanian children by people from the West has been steadily increasing, after a halt last summer as the Bucharest Government established new regulations. Veterans of the process say the new rules, instituting formal court proceedings in the place of President Ion Iliescu's personal signature, are still ragged, and the experience exhausting.
 
Hardships Worth Enduring
 But those who come are prepared to put up with anything so long as they can leave with a healthy child, a prize that is increasingly hard for adoptive parents to find in North America and Western Europe, particularly for single mothers like Ms. Tresgaskis.
The plight of Romania's abandoned children -- offspring of a Communist system that first forbade abortions for most women and then made it economically impossible for them to care for large families -- has opened up new reserves in the worldwide search for children in need of homes.
Under pressure from relief organizations, the Romanian Government is now trying to coordinate aid for the 130,000 children left stranded in 379 institutions, of whom almost half are considered mentally or physically handicapped.
A recent report produced some chilling findings: of the 32 hostels for handicapped children, not one is considered fit for use, and yet the children remain. Calculating the shortages of food, clothes, materials and medicines, the Government estimated it needs $27 million in immediate aid, $100 million for the long term.
Foreign adoptions, properly controlled, are one way to rescue some of the children, although proportionately the numbers are small. No national figure is available, but the flow seems to be steady.
Last summer, 67 families from Canada came here as a group, and left with 130 children. One estimate put the number of adoptions by Americans by September at 160.
 
Fewer Newborns Available
 Since January, when the draconian anti-abortion law was lifted, the number of births in Romania has fallen and the number of abortions has soared. As a result fewer newborns are available for adoption, and some organizations are turning their attention to needier children.
As they tour the orphanages and asylums, the new parents are walked past cribs of children -- often wet, unwashed and with running noses -- and asked which one they want. Older children besiege foreign visitors, calling the women "mama" and asking to be taken away on a plane.
"It feels like shopping for shoes," Ms. Tresgaskis said. "It can be an awful experience, saying no, not this one, not that one. Never in your wildest dreams did you ever think you would be in a situation like that."
At the Hotel President here, a former guest house of the Romanian Communist Party that has become a popular campground for adoptive parents, the war stories told around dinner tables are all about the bureaucratic bungling, petty corruption and 19th-century working conditions that plague the collection of the necessary adoption papers.
The court procedure can take as little as 15 minutes, or as long as five hours. In one rural town, the proceedings ended up including five judges and a full jury, drawn from citizens called in off the street to pass judgment on why one American family that already had four children wanted to adopt two more.
In this baffling maze, the prospective parents have nowhere to turn but to each other. They complain that the United States and other embassies provide conflicting, sometimes inaccurate information and that in many cases their Romanian lawyers know little more than they do.
Those who come to adopt come prepared to stay for weeks, sometimes months. Not knowing how old their child will be, they arrive with clothes and diapers for all ages, and then swap among themselves. Other essentials include dollars and cigarettes, the most acceptable form of currency in Romania's current economic crisis.
"When I came I was handing out candy bars and packs of cigarettes," said one frustrated American. "Now I am up to $20 bills, and by tomorrow it may be 50's."
 
Costs Relatively Low
 Still, the costs are relatively low. Ms. Tregaskis figured that she spent $5,000 for everything, including one round-trip ticket, hotel room, taxis, taxes and various fees. Lawyers' fees, which include a mandatory $606 state tax, can range from $1,000 to $2,500, but after bitter experience many new parents advise doing without lawyers altogether.
To save money, people can also live in private apartments, where they can stay for $20 or less a night. But often they find the hardships of Romanian life more than they bargained for -- sometimes no refrigerator and elevator and now, in parts of Bucharest, water only at certain times of the day.
The misery of ordinary life in Romania, little improved since the revolution last December, when Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and executed, hits the adoptive parents hard.
"I have traveled a lot, I have been in the interior of Mexico, I have seen poor people in our own country," Ms. Tresgaskis said. "But in Europe, you don't expect the ignorance, the lack of basics, this kind of poverty. When you see the homes, you can understand why the mothers had to give the children up."
Getting the legal consent from the biological parents is emotionally draining, although in some cases the parents may not have seen their institutionalized children in years. Some people report cases where the Romanian families have pressed for money or some kind of material help.
But most mothers who give their newborn infants directly to foreigners do so hoping that their child will have a better life. "The only way she could handle it was to block out all emotions," Ms. Tresgaskis said of the 23-year-old woman who gave birth to Charles Michael.
Ms. Tresgaskis, a 40-year-old nursing home administrator, said she wants her son to know where he came from. "I want him to know his heritage," she said. "I want him to know that his country is in the middle of a crisis and that his mother did what she did out of love."

HEADLINE: S.& L. Woes Creep Into California

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14

 BODY:
California has had more than its share of savings and loan fraud and mismanagement. But a robust real estate market has largely spared savings institutions here from the crippling losses suffered by their counterparts in depressed housing markets in Texas, Colorado, Arizona and the Northeast -- at least until now.
No one is predicting a Texas-style collapse in California. But analysts and regulators are increasingly concerned with the potential effect of the recent sharp downturn in housing sales and prices on the state's savings and loans. California is home to nine of the country's ten largest institutions and accounts for nearly a quarter of all savings and loan assets. 
 "Whatever the driving force is, the California housing market may be hitting the wall, and we find it serious and disconcerting," said Eric I. Hemel, a savings and loan analyst at the First Boston Corporation, in a recent research report.
Savings institutions in the state remain confident that the problem will not become severe. Yet some admit to seeing an increase in missed mortgage payments as some sectors of the California economy slow and more homeowners lose jobs. Almost all institutions have been forced to add to their reserves for loan losses to reflect the weakening markets.
The biggest fear among regulators and analysts is that as housing prices fall, the California economy will slip into recession. In the most dire situation, further layoffs in faltering industries like aerospace and construction would leave many homeowners in the state unable to make their mortgage payments and collapsing home prices would leave them with no options but to sell at a loss or walk away from their house and let the lender foreclose.
Even if California's economy holds up, savings institutions will feel the impact of the real estate slowdown in the form of reduced demand for mortgages. That would diminish opportunities for new profits at a time when most of the institutions need additional earnings to help build the higher capital levels and loan-loss reserves now required by Federal regulators.
At the annual conference of the United States League of Savings Institutions in San Francisco this week, Timothy Ryan, the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said regulators had not yet seen signs of major trouble in the state. But he added that regulators were meeting regularly with the managements of the major California savings institutions to monitor the situation. "We're tracking these institutions very closely," Mr. Ryan said in response to a question at a news conference.
 
Sales Down Sharply
 Concerns about California real estate have grown in recent months as the volume of home sales plummeted and price declines became widespread in the state's populous coastal regions. In September, the most recent month for which figures are available, sales of existing homes were down 27 percent from the period a year earlier and down 11 percent from August, according to the California Association of Realtors. It was the slowest month for home sales in California in nearly six years.
The statewide median home price of $190,350 in September was down 4.6 percent from a year earlier, and the price decline in most of the coastal regions was even sharper. In Los Angeles, the median price fell 7.6 percent from the period a year earlier, to $205,000.
"Everything went wrong in September -- sales volumes slid, unsold inventories increased sharply and median prices continued their slow downward trend," said Mr. Hemel, the analyst, in his report.
 
Downturn Called Exaggerated
 It is unclear how long the decline will persist, and industry executives, displaying the stubborn optimism that continues to pervade many sectors of the California economy, object strongly to any suggestion that they are heading for disaster. They say that the downturn has been exaggerated, that it is a normal "correction" after a seven-year boom, and that their companies are sufficiently healthy to weather anything they can see on the horizon.
"We do not have a disaster in California," said Richard H. Deihl, the chairman of H. F. Ahmanson & Company, the parent of Home Savings of America, the nation's largest savings and loan. "If there is considerable unemployment we will have a problem, but you can say that about any place in the world at any time."
To some extent, though, savings institutions in California are already feeling the impact. Fears of a real estate collapse have driven down the stock prices of all the publicly traded companies, including healthy ones like Ahmanson, the Great Western Financial Corporation, the Golden West Financial Corporation and others.
Virtually all California savings and loan companies have also been forced to increase the reserves they set aside for possible losses on loans, in part to reflect the weakening residential real estate markets.
 
Concern About Economy Cited
 CalFed Inc. of Los Angeles, the parent of the California Federal Bank, reported a third-quarter loss of $92.3 million after adding to reserves for possible losses on residential real estate developments in the state. CalFed said its increased reserve reflected in part "the significant decline in the previously strong demand for new residential properties in Riverside, Orange and San Diego Counties during the third quarter as more and more home buyers, uncertain about the economic outlook, chose to defer their purchases." CalFed said it would accelerate its withdrawal from the real estate development business.
The HomeFed Corporation of San Diego, the parent of the HomeFed Bank, reported sharply lower third-quarter profits, primarily because of increasing troubles with commercial real estate and apartment loans, but also because "single-family market conditions in California worsened during the quarter," said Robert F. Adelizzi, HomeFed's chief executive.
Savings and loans in the state may be better off than they might have been without legislation enacted by Congress last year. The legislation, among other things, effectively required them to put more emphasis on residential mortgage lending, forcing many to greatly reduce their activities in commercial real estate, construction lending and real estate development.
 
Commercial Market Weaker
 Analysts and industry executives agree that residential lending is a far more stable business than financing the construction of office buildings and shopping centers. The commercial real estate markets in California are even weaker than the residential market, and analysts think some of the state's big commercial banks, which have lent heavily to developers of commercial properties as well as to homeowners, are even more vulnerable to a downturn than the savings and loans, despite the heavy concentration of savings and loan assets in real estate.
Savings institutions say that more mortgage loans are being paid late, but that so far they have not seen any significant increase in foreclosures on residential mortgages. Moreover, when they have foreclosed, the institutions appear to have resold the homes at prices high enough to avoid losses. Although prices are dropping in many areas of the state, most homes are still worth more than they were even two years ago. Homes purchased earlier than a few years ago have appreciated so much tat it would take a major crash to bring them below their original sales prices.
Home Savings of America, for example, lost money on just one of the seven foreclosed homes it has put on the market in the last two months in California. The loss was just $4,000, Mr. Deihl said, and occurred on the sale of a tiny, rundown house for $22,000 in Fresno. More typical was a house in Imperial Beach, purchased two and a half years ago for $133,000, Mr. Deihl said. When the institution foreclosed in August, the balance due on the loan was $132,000. The house quickly sold for $174,000.
 
Down Payments Increase
 Moreover, savings institutions have increased the down payments required for most home loans in recent years. Home Savings used to make as many as 30 percent of its mortgage loans with a down payment of less than 20 percent. Now only 10 percent of its new loans are made at that level.
Since higher down payments reduce the loan balance relative to the value of a house, they effectively give institutions a greater buffer against losses in the event of foreclosure. Higher down payments also lead homeowners to do more to avoid foreclosure, since they do not want to lose their investment.
Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, made a study earlier this year to assess the effects on several major California savings and loans of a Texas-style collapse in real estate. He determined that Golden West, Ahmanson and Great Western would suffer a reduction in earnings but no losses. CalFed and HomeFed would suffer losses, but would survive without a deep cut into their capital, he found. In all cases, the primary reason for the ability of the institutions to weather a collapse was the relatively low concentration of loans with small down payments.
Still, there are those who think Californa's financial institutions, including savings and loans, continue to be overly optimistic about the prospects for real estate and the state's economy in general, especially given the persistent problems in other parts of the nation.
"The deterioration of real estate in California is far greater than what commercial banks and savings and loans are saying publicly," said R. Dan Brumbaugh Jr., an economist who is a consultant to a House Banking subcommittee. "All of this talk about California somehow being immune, it's just silly."

HEADLINE: Fast Food and Bookstores Top List for Openings in '80's

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
In the last decade, Americans' love for fast food, reading, home electronics and sporting goods helped to cause a boom in specialty stores. But other changes in shopping habits and the population mix have led to only a slight overall gain in the number of retail establishments around the country, according to a new study.
From 1980 to 1990, fast-food restaurants, bookstores, consumer electronics stores, apparel stores and sporting goods outlets led the list of new stores. The largest declines were in automotive stores, gasoline service stations and general merchandise stores. The information was compiled by Audits and Surveys Inc., one of the country's largest marketing research companies. 
 The total number of stores rose only 6 percent, to 1,845,340, in the 1980's. That compares with a population gain of 11 percent and a 43 percent increase in total retail sales, the company said.
 
'Less Demand for Stores'
 "This means that there is now only 1 retail outlet per every 134 people against a ratio of 1 to 129 persons in 1980," said Solomon Dutka, chief executive officer of Audits and Surveys.
"The World War II baby boomers are getting older and their numbers are not being replaced by new births because Americans are having fewer children per household. And there are more single-person households and later marriages. All this, despite a still growing population, means that in many cities there is less demand for stores."
The data are compiled in the New York-based company's annual census of retail distribution, which is based on a nationwide sample of more than 40,000 retail and service stores. The survey was conducted in May and June and each store was visited by an interviewer from Audits and Surveys. The sample has a margin of error of 5 percent.
The number of fast-food stores rose 78 percent in the 10-year period, to 119,880 from 67,290. It was the largest increase of all types of stores, said Audits and Surveys, followed by a 76 percent jump in the number of bookstores, to 17,620 from 10,020.
Other big gainers were consumer electronics stores, up 54 percent, to 30,600 from 19,900, and chain drugstores, up 36 percent, to 18,230 from 13,400. The biggest losers were variety stores, down 38 percent, to 10,720, from 17,400, and gasoline service stations, down 32 percent, to 107,500 from 158,540.
 
Aging Population
 Several important factors influenced store openings and closings, Mr. Dutka said. He mentioned the aging population, the increase in the number of working women, large increases in the population of blacks and Hispanic people, and more double-income families.
With more women working outside the home, the trend of couples and families eating out is growing, as is the popularity of one-stop shopping locations, he said. "The double-income household also is creating a larger market for more expensive merchandise and also provides opportunities for people to spend more money for their leisure-time activities," Mr. Dutka said.
Americans are living longer and leading more active lives, Mr. Dutka said. "This is why the sporting goods are growing so much," he said.
Some kinds of local and neighborhood stores are increasing, in great part because the two fastest-growing population groups are those of Hispanic background and blacks, who prefer to shop locally, he said. "While overall U.S. population grew 11 percent in the decade, the number of Hispanics in the country rose 32 percent and blacks by 15 percent," Mr. Dutka said.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Up 3.2% as Low Demand Continues

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks rose by 3.2 percent in early November, suggesting that sluggish retail demand for vehicles was continuing.
The American automotive industry has suffered from slow sales for more than a year. Analysts today did not regard the slight increase for the Nov. 1-10 period as a hopeful sign, since this year's sales were compared with exceptionally weak sales a year earlier.
 
Big Three's Sales Lower
 Ronald A. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco, described the vehicle sales figures for the period as "a little disappointing." He noted that the foreign auto makers that build cars in American plants posted larger gains than the Big Three auto makers. He also said that the Big Three's latest figures did not include seasonal fleet sales to car-rental companies, which ended recently. 
 Some automotive analysts have been bracing for disastrous vehicle sales in light of recent economic uncertainty connected with the Persian Gulf crisis. While not strong, the latest numbers did not match those gloomy expectations. "It continues to look as if the Middle East crisis and dropping consumer confidence had never happened," said David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research Inc.
"We'll have a better feel in the next few weeks," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company.
Over all, retail sales of American-built vehicles were 241,357, the nine domestic car makers said today, compared with 233,948 a year ago.
Car sales rose by 8 percent, to 154,943 in the period. On a seasonally adjusted basis, that equals an annual rate of 6.5 million. A year earlier, sales totaled 143,467, and the annual rate was 5.9 million.
 
Truck Sales Down
 Sales of light trucks, which are increasingly bought for personal transportation but are generally less fuel-efficient than cars, slipped by 6.4 percent, to 86,414, from 92,283 last year. The main reason was a 33 percent decline in truck sales at the Chrysler Corporation.
Chrysler said the sales of its mini-vans were off by 26 percent; those of its Jeep Cherokees were off by 29 percent, and purchases of its Dakota pickup trucks were off by 44 percent. Shortly after announcing its sales figures, Chrysler said it was increasing cash rebates on many of its 1990 and 1991 light-truck models, including a $1,000 rebate on all remaining 1989 and 1990 mini-vans.
"Clearly, Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee is losing some of its market share in the sport-utility segment to the Ford Explorer," Mr. Heinbach said.
Sales of Chrysler cars dropped by 9.1 percent, to 18,873.
 
Ford and G.M. Gain
 The General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company each posted gains in cars and light trucks. Ford's car sales were 47,106, a gain of 7.5 percent, and light-truck sales rose by 1 percent, to 31,463. G.M. sold 68,895 cars in the period, a gain of 10.1 percent from a year earlier, and 37,744 light trucks, a 2.7 percent gain.
The Honda Motor Company sold 9,609 American-built cars, a gain of 29.3 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 6,028 cars built in the United States, an increase of 7.7 percent. The Nissan Motor Company sold 2,112 domestically built cars, a rise of 17.2 percent.
Car sales for the Mazda Motor Corporation totaled 925, a gain of 74.5 percent, while those for the Mitsubishi Motor Corporation were 1,048, an increase of 6.7 percent. Subaru, the American subsidiary of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., had sales of 347. Last year, Subaru was not producting cars in this country.
 
High Inventories
 Although the overall inventory of unsold vehicles is lower than it was a year ago, the softness in the light-truck segment has meant a ballooning supply. The Big Three are already planning production cuts at many American assembly plants because of what they expect to be continued soft demand.
Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, said the nation had a 67-day supply of unsold cars as of Nov. 1, compared with a 77-day supply a year earlier. There was a 99-day supply of unsold light trucks on Nov. 1, compared with a 91-day supply a year ago, Ward's said.
A 65-day supply is considered average by many auto executives.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Touches Lows Against the Mark for 3d Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar touched new lows in a broad decline against foreign currencies yesterday, dragged down by continued fears that the Federal Reserve might move soon to lower interest rates to stimulate the United States economy.
The dollar hit record lows against the German mark for the third day in a row, with the mark touching 1.4700 before settling at 1.4726, down from Tuesday's 1.4782. 
 "The basic tone is bearish for the dollar because of adverse interest rates and the U.S. economy," said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank. "The mark is strong because of reunification, which is going to keep interest rates there strong."
 
Strength Against Pound
 The dollar showed strength only against the British pound, which sank amid a potential political shake-up in Britain. In New York, it cost $1.9600 to buy one pound, less expensive than Tuesday's $1.9635. In London, sterling weakened to $1.9615, from $1.9640 late Tuesday.
In the biggest threat to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's political survival since she won power more than 11 years ago, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine challenged Mrs. Thatcher for the leadership of the Government and the Conservative Party.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.28 yen, to a closing 129.05 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.52 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to close at 129.09 yen, down from 129.65 yen on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.2470 Swiss francs, down from 1.2510; 4.9670 French francs, down from 4.9735; 1,111 Italian lire, down from 1,112, and 1.1631 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1662.

Leave Kuwait First, Saudis Say of Iraq Talks

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Efforts to convene an Arab summit meeting to avert war in the Persian Gulf appeared to collapse today when Saudi Arabia said it would not attend such a meeting unless Iraq agreed to withdraw from Kuwait.
During a visit to Abu Dhabi, the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said a meeting would be a waste of time unless Iraq agreed in advance to abide by United Nations Security Council and Arab League resolutions calling for its unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of the legitimate government there. 
 "Any Arab meeting will yield no fruit, or result, unless Iraq agrees to abide by the decisions of the Cairo Arab summit and international resolutions, which call for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait," Prince Saud was quoted as saying by the United Arab Emirates News Agency.
At the Cairo meeting on Aug. 10, a narrow majority of Arab League nations voted not only to demand Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of the al-Sabah family, but also to send a pan-Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia.
Prince Saud's statement today reflects Saudi Arabia's unwillingness to reopen the Cairo decision to send Arab, American and other non-Arab forces to Saudi Arabia, which has further split an already divided Arab world.
Iraq made it clear today that it would not attend an Arab meeting unless Arab leaders were willing to cancel the resolutions approved at the Cairo meeting.
Speaking after a meeting in Rabat with Morocco's King Hassan II, Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's First Deputy Prime Minister, was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency as saying that the proposed summit meeting should "wipe off the resolutions of the infamous Cairo summit."
Before leaving Morocco's capital today, Mr. Ramadan reiterated Baghdad's position that any new summit meeting should include on its agenda the underlying problems of the region, which Iraq say include its longstanding border and economic grievances against Kuwait, and also the Palestinian-Israeli dispute.
On Sunday, King Hassan called for the convening of an Arab summit meeting within a week, saying it was "the last chance" to avert a war in the Persian Gulf. But diplomats, Middle East analysts and Arab officials have been skeptical that such a meeting could take place, given the cleavage within the Arab camp and each side's concern that the other might turn such a meeting to its political advantage.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran arrived in Baghdad today for two days of talks. Mr. Velayati is the most senior Iranian official to visit Baghdad since the eight-year Iran-Iraq war began in 1980. Teheran has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but has also denounced the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia by the United States and more than 20 other nations.
Also in Baghdad today, the Government newspaper Al Jumhuriya said that President Hussein had removed his cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid as acting governor of Kuwait. The paper said his successor would be Aziz Saleh al-Nouman, a senior member of the ruling Baath Party. Mr. Majid's removal is the latest in a series of high-level shuffles.
 
IRAQ CRITICIZES MANEUVERS
 BAGHDAD, Iraq, Nov. 14 (Reuters) -- The Iraqi News Agency said today that a planned amphibious-assault exercise by the United States Marines near Kuwait was provocative and proved that Washington was preparing for war.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Posts Heavy Losses As Inflation Worries Ease

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Weak oil prices and a strong stock market combined to send gold prices reeling yesterday. Platinum and silver prices, which have been depressed for some time, posted smaller losses.
Expectations of a decline in a leading inflation barometer, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 basic commodity futures prices, also weighed heavily on the precious metals market all day. Gold has long been considered a hedge against inflation. 
 After the close of the commodity and stock markets, the bureau reported that its index had plunged 2.54 points, to 225.59, its lowest level since Oct. 30, 1989, when it stood at 225.20.
At the close of the Commodity Exchange in New York, the spot price of gold for delivery this month settled at $377.60 an ounce, down $8.40 on the day, while the more active December contract lost $8.50, to $378.50. Spot silver fell 3.4 cents an ounce, to $4.163, with the active December delivery down 3.7 cents, at $4.175.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of the spot November platinum delivery was posted at $417.60 an ounce, while the active January 1991 contract fell $5.90, to $413.90.
"The first signs of weakness in the precious metals was evident in overnight trading in foreign markets, but it was not until the Comex opened that the selling accelerated," said Bette Raptopoulos, metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities.
What prompted the selling, she continued, was the decline in prices of petroleum and byproducts, and sharp declines in basic commodities like grains and oilseeds. Crude oil prices plunged nearly $2 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Ms. Raptopoulos said the downward move in precious metals accelerated yesterday when the commodity funds liquidated gold holdings as the stock market strengthened.
She said that "some market participants interpreted the growing debate over whether Congress should debate the President's Middle East policy as lessening the chances of a shooting war, and this may have caused some gold hoarders to lighten positions."
She said the main sellers of bullion were commodity funds that follow computer trading programs. When gold fell below $381.50, many computer-guided funds were prompted to sell, she said. "And when gold broke through $380, it also caused some more liquidation by the funds," she added.
But the absence of heavy volume in the Comex gold and silver markets and the modest turnover in the New York Merc platinum trading indicated that most market participants were on the sidelines, several Comex brokers said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Stands By Troubled Tax Proposal for Police

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he had not abandoned his proposal for a payroll tax to finance his ambitious anti-crime plan, even though there was virtually no support for it among state legislative leaders whose approval would be needed.
But Mr. Dinkins conceded that the financing was uncertain, that it might not be approved by the end of this year -- which would put his plan to hire thousands of additional police officers behind schedule. He said it was up to legislative leaders to tell him what taxes they preferred if they did not favor his. 
 Asked if he would fight for the payroll tax, Mr. Dinkins, who resists phrasing almost any position in confrontational terms, told reporters at City Hall: "I wouldn't say I'd fight for it. I would try to persuade thosewhose assent is necessary that it is doable."
But elaborating later, the Mayor said he would campaign for his tax proposals by greeting commuters at railroad stations in the city in an effort to persuade them to urge their legislators to support the payroll tax.
The tax would be borne by workers and employers, and the Mayor's aides have said since he proposed the plan six weeks ago that he would make an appeal to commuters. If the legislative leaders do not like hisproposals, Mr. Dinkins said, "then I most respectfully urge that it's incumbent on them to give me alternatives."
But a spokesman for Ralph Marino, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, who opposes any tax on commuters, said, "We don't think it works that way at all."
 
'Payroll Tax Is Not Acceptable'
 "It is incumbent on whatever chief executive is coming up with a plan to come up with a way to carry it through," said the spokesman, William S. Stevens. "We have previously said the payroll tax is not acceptable, because it affects commuters and because it might not be good thing for businesses in the city in this economic climate."
Legislative leaders have said it is unlikely they would consider the plan in a special session this fall. In fact, Mr. Dinkins seemsto have missed a chance in recent weeks to press his $1.8 billion, four-year plan, which he announced on Oct. 2 with fanfare after being pressured for weeks to hire more police officers amid a summer crime wave.
On the day he announced the plan, politicians praised its goals, but the Legislature immediately raised objections to the payroll tax and also expressed reservations about a 25-cent surcharge on lottery tickets, another leg of the plan.
Since then, the Mayor and his aides have been consumed with labor negotiations, deepening fiscal problems and a meeting of big-city mayors from around the nation, and have left the crime plan on the back burner. The City Council, which has been asked to support a mid-year property tax increase in January as the third financing element of the plan, has refused to budge until Albany acts. Council members complain that Mr. Dinkins's plan is too costly and that he has not seriously negotiated with them on a compromise.
Some city and state officials have suggested that Mr. Dinkins proposed such a sweeping plan -- which also includes educational and youth programs aimed at attacking the causes of crime -- in the expectation that it would not gain financing, and thus not force him into a costly program that could limit his spending options in other fields for years.
 
Administration Still Hopeful
 But his chief political aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, said that was not so.
"We're going to work very hard to make it happen," he said. "There has been discussion with the leadership in the Assembly, there has been discussion with the leadership in the City Council, and we still see this thing having some hope."
"We've got to sit down together and work out a financing mechanism for the plan," Mr. Lynch added. "We believe that can be done, either convincing them of the Mayor's plan or coming up with some other plan. I would argue that the ball is in our court in terms of doing the convincing, to build the groundswell of support."
Mr. Lynch said the Mayor had not campaigned more vigorously for the taxes before because he did not want it to be an issue in last week's election. Dinkins aides had hoped the Legislature's opposition to the taxes might soften after the election, but the reverse seems to be true.
 
A Leaner Plan Sought
 Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and Mr. Marino have said the first step is for Mr. Dinkins and the Council to agree on a financing plan, then go to the Legislature. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said yesterday that the anti-crime plan could not be allowed to die but that Mr. Dinkins should scale it back to make it less costly.
The Council supports a plan that would cost about half what Mr. Dinkins's would and that would rely mostly on the lottery surcharge. But legislative leaders have also expressed reluctance to approve the surcharge.
In his budget modification last week, Mr. Dinkins included $26 million to begin hiring police officers and other workers called for in the anti-crime plan.
If the special taxes for the crime plan are not obtained, the city will have to find another way to go forward with it. That will be very difficult, since the city is facing a projected budget gap of more than $1.6 billion for the fiscal year starting next July. As a result, the Dinkins administration has counted on financing the hiring of new officers outside the regular budget.
Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that more officers would be hired one way or another. But he said that "the clamor in some quarters for more police officers perhaps has dimmed a bit as they see that we do have a rational plan" for new hiring and redeployment of officers.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Facing Wider Budget Gap, Weicker Is Warned

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Governor-elect Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut was told by retiring Gov. William A. O'Neill today that the revenue shortfall for the next fiscal year would be far greater than expected -- amounting to almost a third of this year's budget.
It was the bleakest estimate yet of the state's rapidly growing fiscal crisis.
 
 The new projection released by Mr. O'Neill said the state would collect $2.1 billion less than it planned to spend in fiscal 1991-1992 if it kept services at their current levels. Connecticut's operating budget for this year is about $7.1 billion. By state statute, the Governor must present a balanced budget each year, and the General Assembly must pass one.
The new projection includes an estimated $450 million shortfall for the current fiscal year. It is part of a draft of the 1991-92 budget that the O'Neill administration prepared for Mr. Weicker, who takes office on Jan. 9.
Three weeks, ago, the General Assembly's Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that the 1991-92 budget gap would be $1.5 billion. Three months earlier its estimate was $1 billion. The office will release a new estimate on Friday.
Mr. Weicker, who ran as an independent on the Connecticut Party ticket, declined to comment on the projected shortfall, saying he had not yet seen the budget draft.
He added, though, that he was "not taken aback" by the $2.1 billion figure. "It could very well get even worse," he said.
Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat who had decided against seeking a third full term, was more alarmed. "The budget process will be very difficult," he said.
Asked if he thought new or higher taxes would be required to cover the budget gap, Mr. O'Neill said, "I think it will be very difficult, if not impossible, not to have them."
 
Recession Blamed
 Mr. Weicker said the economic downturn had caused the shortfall by holding down state revenues, especially those from the corporation tax.
"I think it's clear that sacrifices will be required in some form," he said.
Connecticut now receives most of its revenue from an 8 percent sales tax, the highest state sales tax in the nation. Revamping the state's tax system to include a more consistent stream of revenue, like a state income tax, has been a divisive issue in the state for decades.
The 8.25 percent sales tax in New York City is composed of a 4 percent state sales tax and a 4.25 percent city sales tax.
During his gubernatorial campaign, Mr. Weicker said he did not support a state income tax but, depending on circumstances, would not rule one out. Speaking to reporters today, he maintained that position. "I think it is a question of having the facts at hand," he said.
The 1991-92 budget projection issued by Governor O'Neill was the first made by his fiscal analysts, the Office of Policy and Management.
 
'Extraordinary Measures'
 A official with the office, Gordon J. Frassinelli, said he could not recall a shortfall projection that represented such a large percentage of the budget. "It would require extraordinary measures," he said.
In New York State, how much of a budget gap to expect next year is a matter of dispute between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Comptroller Edward Regan. Last month, Mr. Regan said the state would face a shortfall of $2 billion to $3 billion in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Mr. Cuomo's budget office said the gap would be $941 million.
In either case, the gap would be a far smaller percentage of the state budget than in Connecticut. The total New York State budget for the next fiscal year is expected to exceed $50 billion.
In Connecticut, the 1991-92 budget draft is expected to be presented to Mr. Weicker today. He is now assembling his administration and is expected to name a replacement for Mr. O'Neill's Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, Anthony V. Milano, by the end of the week.
One person who has often been mentioned as potential replacement is former State Senator Reginald J. Smith of New Hartford, the former Senate minority leader. He was Mr. Weicker's campaign fiscal adviser and, in Mr. Weicker's mold, is considered a liberal Republican.
Another choice might be former State Representative William J. Cibes Jr., a liberal Democrat from New London who ran unsuccessfully for his party's gubernatorial nomination and who campaigned for a state income tax.
Both Mr. Weicker and Mr. O'Neill said they expect a smooth transition over the next few weeks.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican supported mainly by liberals, Democrats and unaffiliated voters, met with reporters in the front yard of the three-story red brick governor's mansion.
Mr. Weicker, standing next to Mr. O'Neill, politely praised the home. Last week, after defeating Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, a Republican, and Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, a Democrat, he hinted that he would spend much time at his Greenwich home, Apple Jack Farm.
He said of the Governor's Mansion: "I think it's a lovely house. I'm sure we will fill up some of the rooms, but we won't be able to fill all of them."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Turkey Wary of Being a 'Second Front' in a War

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 14

 BODY:
The idea is still more an abstraction than a real plan, but Turkey's leaders nonetheless are making it clear that their army will not be used as a "second front" in a war against neighboring Iraq.
President Turgut Ozal, a sturdy pillar in the alliance against Iraq, recently dismissed as "pure fantasy" the notion of a Turkish second front that would attack Iraq from the north while United States and other forces move in from the south. 
 In interviews in Ankara, other officials said that their armed forces are ill equipped for such a role, a point shared by Western military specialists. Turkey has already made costly sacrifices in the Persian Gulf crisis, the officials point out, and some add that they should not abandon their traditional caution in dealing with their Middle Eastern neighbors.
To many Turks it is axiomatic that no good can come of involving themselves in disputes among Arabs.
"We have done more than expected," a senior official said. "We have to live with Iraq. We are fully implementing the Security Council embargo. What else can they expect from us?"
Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has not received a specific request to make its 635,000 soldiers available for possible combat or to allow its territory to be used for strikes against Iraq by other allied armies. The Government has new powers to allow foreign troops to deploy in Turkey, but thus far it has said it would support military action against Iraq only if it is authorized by the United Nations Security Council.
Nevertheless, Turks recognize that a second front is likely to become a tempting option for the American-led alliance if war does come.
Moderate officials say they are worried that Mr. Ozal, despite his objections now, could eventually agree to such a plan to show solidarity with the West.
Although custom dictates that the Turkish presidency is a ceremonial position, Mr. Ozal has taken charge of shaping his country's gulf policy, an active role that has brought applause from Washington but distresses more restrained Government officials and opposition leaders. They complain that he is deciding Turkey's future on his own. Last month, the Foreign and Defense Ministers both resigned over the handling of the crisis.
Even without committing troops to a ground offensive, Turkey has put itself on the front lines against Iraq. As an early and uncompromising participant in the anti-Baghdad embargo, Ankara estimates that it has lost $7 billion in trade, debt repayment, remittances and foreign investment.
Within days of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Turkey closed vital twin pipelines that carried Iraqi oil to a Mediterranean port. Taking advantage of the ruling party's legislative majority, the Government has assumed war powers that normally belong to Parliament, notably the right to send Turkish soldiers abroad and to allow foreign troops here.
The United States has been permitted to keep 14 F-111 fighter bombers at the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey. And the Turkish army has sent up to 100,000 troops to the mountainous border with Iraq, where they are defensively deployed but are pinning down a similar number of Iraqi soldiers.
 
 Open-Minded on Use of Base
 It is widely assumed that the Turks would say yes to a request from Washington to use the Incirlik base. Publicly, Defense Minister Husnu Dogan has declined to commit himself.
On the second-front issue, Turkish and foreign military experts both note that Turkey's army is not as well equipped or as well trained as many Westerners believe, especially if they must fight battle-hardened Iraqis.
"Turkish troops deployed at the Iraqi border are not there for attack but for defense," a Western specialist said. "They are not properly armed, they don't have war experience and the terrain is not suitable for a large mechanized operation."
Some officials admit they are worried about Iraqi chemical attacks. Others complain that except for $300 million contributed by Kuwaitis the anti-Iraq coalition has yet to deliver large amounts of promised aid to compensate Turkey for its losses.
But a few officials, probably a minority, argue that if Turkey wants a significant role in postwar talks on the Middle East's future shape, it must first get involved militarily.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Planning to Close 9 Real Estate Lending Units

 BODY:
Following through with its previously announced plans to reduce expenses and cut back its real estate lending, Citicorp is closing 9 of the 16 commercial real estate lending offices it has in the United States, a spokesman for the banking company said yesterday.
The number of jobs lost in the move was not disclosed. Citicorp officials have said they plan to cut more than 2,000 jobs, mostly in the corporate and commercial real estate lending activities in the global banking group, which handles corporate finance in North America, Japan and Europe. 
 "The type of real estate lending we do is overbuilt," the spokesman said. "A lot of business has stopped."
 
Offices Listed
 The offices to be closed are in Seattle, Phoenix, San Diego, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Houston, Boston, Philadelphia and Miami. The remaining commercial real estate lending offices are in New York, Washington, Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Like many other American banks, Citicorp has been hurt by bad real estate loans. In its third quarter, problem real estate loans rose by $573 million, to $2.2 billion, while real estate owned because of foreclosure rose $336 million, to $1.04 billion.
Citicorp stock rose 62.5 cents yesterday, to close at $14 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has recently traded as low as $10.75 a share.
 
Auction Brings 11.5% Rate
 Meanwhile, at bids yesterday at Citicorp's auction of a $75 million issue of 49-day money market preferred stock, produced a rate of 11.5 percent, up sharply from the last auction of such securities.
The company, which has more preferred stock outstanding than most issuers, is paying higher rates because of its troubled real estate investments.
The lead manager, Lehman Government Securities Inc., said the rate was up from 10.75 percent for a 49-day series auctioned on Friday.
The rate was sharply higher largely because the securities auctioned yesterday will not mature until early in 1991. To justify holding the Citicorp securities through the end of the year, investors demanded a higher interest rate.
 
Republic Rates Are Reset
 In contrast, rates on 49-day money market preferred stock issued by the the Republic New York Corporation, another New York banking company, were reset yesterday at 7.125 percent, from 6.60 percent at a previous auction.
The Citicorp rate had fallen to 7.48 percent on an auctioned series on Nov. 7, after the bank holding company announced it would call $275 million of its preferred stock and leave $675 million outstanding. The less stock outstanding, the greater the value of the stock and the lower the yield.

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER

 BODY:
The Daily News has hired unemployed veterans and other jobless men through a Kentucky security company to drive delivery trucks and collect money from news dealers. But two men who say they quit the job in disgust say the real object was to videotape them and other security personnel being beaten by strikers as evidence to use in court against the drivers' union.
"We were bait," said Jim McCully of Clarksville, Tenn. "The bottom line was that we were supposed to be cheese for the rats." 
 A 21-year-old Army veteran from the Lexington, Ky., area said: "I felt that we were being used as meat, so I got out of there. I think they did us dirty."
 Their stories were provided in separate telephone interviews in which they presented almost identical accounts. A number of details were independently corroborated.
The accounts provide one of the first glimpses inside the Daily News management's multimillion-dollar effort to defeat the striking newspaper unions, including the services of at least three private security companies.
 
'Because of Violence'
 Asked about the security operation, Lisa G. Robinson, the spokeswoman for The News, said: "I really won't speak to specifics of our security. We have security because of violence."
The men are being recruited from areas around military bases in the South -- Fort Campbell, Ky., in this case, home of the 101st Airborne Division -- where the local economies are being hard hit by the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia.
They say they responded to advertisements in local newspapers offering "a prestigious security position" and were under the impression that the job involved guarding company property or standing on the loading docks watching over the trucks.
But soon after they arrived at their base of operations at a Ramada Inn in Fairfield, N.J., they say, they were told the job was to go out in pairs driving the delivery trucks and collecting from vendors with one man carrying a videotape camera. There were also supposed to be "follow cars" equipped with video and still cameras, they say.
Mr. McCully said that at their orientation session on Nov. 3, Bill Mills, the operations director for Securex, the Kentucky security company that hired them, told them: "Your job is to get documentation on film of union members breaking your necks. We need the evidence so we can go to court and freeze the assets of the union."
 
No Money for Bus Tickets
 "They stressed nonviolence," said the Kentucky veteran, a former military policeman who asked that his name not be used to avoid any possible legal problems. "At the briefing, basically they were telling us, if a guy steps in front of your car, stop and make no attempt to get away. They wanted us to go down in the subways making collections. I had a vision of my head on a piece of concrete and 20 pairs of boots kicking it."
The two men said others wanted to leave the job too, but were stuck because they did not have enough money for bus tickets home.
When pressed on whether The Daily News had hired Securex and whether the workers were to be targets, Ms. Robinson, the paper's spokeswoman, called back several hours later to say: "We have hired vendors from places around the country. They are licensed to do business in New York. We told them to avoid confrontation, not to carry weapons."
The former military policeman, reading from a business card, provided a telephone number in London, Ky., for Securex and said one of its main officials was a lawyer named Crabtree.
The telephone was answered by a man who identified himself as Bill Crabtree, an attorney.
Asked if the Securex concern was working for The Daily News, Mr. Crabtree at first said: "I won't speak for Securex. That company was not working up there."
Then he said he was the general counsel for Securex, adding that "I am not at liberty to comment on any of my client's activities."
Mr. Crabtree said the telephone number was not that of Securex but of his direct office line.
It was the same number given by directory assistance for Securex.
 
'Asked for Our Help'
 At the Tennessee state employment agency, Job Services, in Clarksville, Rogelio Salinas, said the agency had referred about 20 people to Securex.
"Securex came to us and asked for our help," Mr. Salinas said. "We provided the assistance. From then on, we don't know about it. They're from London, Ky. They recruit from around bases -- Fort Knox, Fort Bragg -- to get ex-military people. They take them to New York to secure areas where they go on strike. We had a couple come back -- maybe they got beat up there.
"They came a week before last and last week also. They said, 'Roy, we need more people right away.' "
"Unemployment's so high here it ain't funny," Mr. Salinas added. "We got Fort Campbell, and the 101st went to Saudi. When a division leaves with 25,000 troops, that puts a hurting on everybody."
Mr. Salinas identified the Securex representative he dealt with as Robert C. Storm, a name also provided as a top operations official for the company by both men who quit.
 
A Sketchy Outline
 The two men said they were taken by bus from London in Kentucky to the Ramada Inn in Fairfield after brief interviews and a sketchy outline of a job as a security guard.
"They were misrepresenting themselves up front," Mr. McCully said. "They were real vague and evasive until you got there and by then it's generally too late. The picture they painted was we would be standing on the docks of the plant with picketers yelling outside."
As proof of his employment, Mr. McCully sent a facsimile of an instruction sheet saying that cars and vans could be fueled at the newspaper's expense at an Amoco service station in Secaucus; a checkout statement from the Fairfield Ramada Inn and a laminated identity card issued on Nov. 11 under the name of Delta Transportation, which he said was one of the "covert style" names used in the operation.
The pay, he said, was to be roughly $700 a week, working 12 hours on, 12 off for an 84-hour week. The job was to last for 120 days, with a $1,500 bonus to anyone completing the full tour, he said.
 
'A Chase Car'
 "They had us equipped with camcorders and 35-millimeter cameras," Mr. McCully said. "Along with that they had a chase car that was supposed to follow the trucks. In the chase cars, too, were camcorders and 35-millimeter cameras. The bottom line was they were going to get some documentation on film of union members beating up on the heads of these guys so they could take them to court and freeze their assets. We were put there as bait.
"They pretty much came out and said it the second day of the orientation. They didn't use the word 'scab' until the third day. I didn't relish getting out there for $700 to have my head cracked by a gang of irate, understandably irate, strikers."
Mr. McCully managed to get enough money together to go home after his third day on the job. The Kentucky veteran said his wife sent him a money order so he could leave.
But, the two men said, many of the other recruits at the Ramada Inn did not have enough money to leave. The workers were promised $150 advances but were given only $50 when they arrived in New Jersey. The hotel rooms are being paid for, but the men must buy their own food. Mr. McCully said the room telephones had been removed.
 
'Like Hostages'
 "When they get you there, they pretty much know you are broke," said Mr. McCully, who described the men left behind as "like hostages."
"They had already established that you were destitute," he said. "They couldn't afford to go home on their own. They're losing people. Some guys are hitchhiking home."
At the Ramada Inn, two lanky men in work clothes sitting in the bar acknowledged in Southern drawls that they were working for Securex but said they could not talk about it.
"We've had plenty of trouble, but we can't discuss it," said one of them. "We signed a contract."
In the front lobby, a man in a gray suit sitting at a table had been seen giving instructions to the same men earlier. When asked, he denied knowledge of either Securex or The Daily News.
On the table in front of him were log sheets listing the names of the men and the hours they worked.

No Talk of Glory, but of Blood on Sand

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLES TOWN, W. Va., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Richard Weese, a beefy man chewing on a tiny stub of a cigar, insists he is no liberal. "I don't believe in the do-gooders who say we should go home and stick our heads in the sand," he said the other day, settling into a seat at the Sadler Cafe.
But Mr. Weese, a retired air controller, is not sure that he could support a war in the Persian Gulf either. "It's kind of hard to say you're fighting for democracy," he said, "when you know the Kuwaitis don't have one." 
 A few hundred miles to the north, in North Adams, Mass., Howard D'Amico stood amid the clutter of his bargain outlet store, expressing frustration that, at 65, he was too old to go to Saudi Arabia himself. "Let the wimps step aside," he said. "I'll go in their place."
Mr. D'Amico called himself "a strong supporter of our stand in the Persian Gulf." But when pressed, he acknowledged that he was unsure just what that stand was. "That's something I would like to know," he said. "What are we fighting about?"
As more than 150,000 United States troops prepare to head for the Persian Gulf, adding to the 230,000 already there, and as Washington talks of a possible offensive strike, the display of unity among Americans is starting to show signs of wear.
In scores of conversations from Vermont to West Virginia, Americans of all ages and walks of life expressed not just a growing fear of war, but also an increasing ambivalence about the United States' involvement and a growing frustration that President Bush had not given the nation what they thought was a satisfactory explanation for mobilizing the armed forces.
While many of those interviewed -- farmers and nurses and lawyers and soldiers -- said they would support whatever path President Bush chose to pursue in the gulf, many others said they were beginning to wonder whethe they could still back the President once the killing started. And as Americans confront the possibility of another war, history seems to present a troubling multiple-choice question: Would this be another World War II, or another Vietnam?
 
'No One Drew a Line'
 "I'm old enough to have lived through Hitler's early years, when no one drew a line," Joseph Schaaf, a musician, said the other day over breakfast in Bennington, Vt. "And I don't think someone like Saddam Hussein should be allowed to build up that degree of power."
"This is not World War II," Mr. Schaaf's breakfast companion, Adelaide Fine, objected. "This is like Vietnam. What you have is no declaration of war, and a chief executive hellbent on fighting. I can't understand why there isn't more outcry."
Ambivalence in the face of war is as old, undoubtedly, as war itself, and mistrust of those in power is probably just as ancient. But what marks the reaction to the current crisis is the way Americans are talking openly about the President's inability to "sell" war to a wary populace.
A common complaint among those interviewed was that the Bush Administration seemed unable to come up with a consistent -- and compelling -- account of what the United States was preparing to fight for. Was it to protect oil sources, they wanted to know, or to prevent further aggression, or simply to maintain the status quo?
"What I don't like is the fact that we can't get any straight answers," said Doreena Wimberly, a secretary from Rome, N.Y. "Just watching the news on TV and trying to explain to my kids why are we over there, I can't give them a justifiable reason. I just say, 'The world is crazy, I guess.' "
 
WILKES-BARRE, PA.: Portents Haunt Veterans Day
 The Veterans Day Parade is always a good show in Wilkes-Barre, the kind of event that draws people a few hours early to stake out good seats and stomp around in the cold.
Linda Garrison, who has two nephews in Saudi Arabia and a husband who could get called up any minute, thought the parade was a good opportunity to rally support for the troops abroad. She brought several hundred little yellow bows in a big plastic bag, and pretty soon there wasn't an empty lapel in sight.
Mrs. Garrison said she understood that a lot of people in the crowd had mixed feelings about going to war in the Persian Gulf. But she did not think that would affect her campaign.
"We're not asking people to believe we should be over there," she said, slipping a ribbon into the buttonhole of a reporter's jacket. "We're just asking them to believe in the people who are over there. I don't want the reception for those men to be like it was after Vietnam."
 
 Plans Are Disrupted
 The possibility of an impending war gave the Veterans Day parade this year a portentous aspect. Who knew whether there would be more veterans to mourn next year, or whether some of the men and women in the parade would soon be called up to fight?
For Specialist Robert Storz, a member of the National Guard who was getting ready to march in the parade with his field-artillery unit, the possibility of war presented itself as nothing less than a disruption of an entire life's plans.
Mr. Storz, a 19-year-old freshman at Pennsylvania State University's Wilkes-Barre campus, joined the National Guard, as he put it, "to get money for college." In return, he spent one weekend a month training with the Guard. Now there were rumors that his unit would be called to Germany to replace forces there that had been called to the gulf. He could only hope, he said, that Europe was as far as he would have to go.
"I wish they had gotten the whole thing over with already," he said dejectedly.
 
 Oil 'Not Worth It'
 Arthur Watkins, Mr. Storz's friend and fellow Guard member, said, "My parents are threatening to break my foot or my arm so I can't go."
Mr. Watkins, a 23-year-old junior at Wilkes-Barre's King's College, said he was not sure why the United States was preparing for war, but he thought it was either an effort to bring down oil prices or to punish aggression. "If they're fighting for oil, then it's not worth it," he said.
Both men, dressed in camouflage uniforms, said they were disturbed that American forces were bearing the bulk of the burden in the gulf, even though the crisis had obvious implications for other countries as well. "It's as if all the other countries were paying us to use our men," Mr. Storz said. "It's like we're mercenaries or something."
Farther down the road, Michael Basta, a Korean War veteran who was also preparing to march in the parade, expressed similar disgust for America's allies.
 
 Flying the Flag
 "Multilateral is a lot of bunk," Mr. Basta said. "You don't have to be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to see the writing on the wall. Unfortunately, it is our men who are going to do the fighting."
Still, Mr. Basta said he had no doubt that the President was pursuing the right course. "We went to Korea to protect people, and there are people in Kuwait who need to be protected, too," he said.
Tom Gaylets, another Korean War veteran, interrupted to say: "I hope and pray every American is supporting our boys. The American flag should be flying in front of every house."
Mr. Basta nodded gravely. "I hope we don't have any more Jane Fondas," he said.
 
BENNINGTON, VT.: Skepticism On a Campus
 The last time the United States was involved in a full-scale war, Celene Colburn war 4 years old. Yet she does not believe, she says, that peace is the primary objective of the American Government.
"The whole history of U.S. intervention in South America shows that our involvement is really relative to our economic interests," she said. "And yet it's always played out like it's a moral or an ethical thing."
On a recent slate-gray afternoon, Ms. Colburn and several of her friends were gathered over what passed for lunch -- a few apples -- in the Bennington College student lounge. When a reporter pulled up a chair and steered the conversation toward the Persian Gulf, the jovial mood of the group suddently turned sullen.
"I feel very skeptical about the information that's available to us," said Ms. Colburn, a 21-year-old dance major, drawing her legs up to her chest. "We as a nation make choices about when to get involved, and it seems to me that those decisions always have to do with the interests of big corporations."
 
 Not Just Right or Wrong
 "You can't say it's a matter of right or wrong," said Roy Kortick, a 22-year-old art-and-literature major. "We've been giving the Iraqis arms for years."
To go by the polls, college-age Americans, brought up on a vision of "morning in America," are supposed to be more gung-ho about their country these days, more apt to support patriotic causes and conservative ideals. That message, however, has apparently not yet reached Bennington, one of the country's most exclusive, and expensive, colleges. Indeed, most Bennington students seem to dismiss the notion of a high-minded American war as hopelessly naive and out-of-date, like physics before Einstein.
"The Middle east is a region that has reached this point because of other countries' involvement," Bart Arnold, a 20-year-old music major, said. "This really isn't going to do anything positive for solving the problems in the area. And I think it's really disgusting that they've gotten the U.N. involved. It's all over oil, cheap oil."
 
 At the Legion Post
 Down the hill at Bennington's American Legion post, Larry Holcomb, a Vietnam veteran, was having a mid-afternoon beer after finishing his rounds as a water- and sewer-supply salesman. He dismissed the college students' views as so much pacifist cant. But he agreed that at the heart of the matter lay a vast pool of oil.
"A dinky little country like that telling us what to do, it's ridiculous," he said. "I don't think we should leave, mainly because I can't afford what they want for gasoline."
 
ROME, N.Y.: Rumbles Felt In the Home
 Rome, the home of Griffiss Air Force Base, is a straight-talking town whose fortunes, quite simply, rise and fall with the military's. And while other towns may be starting to grow jittery at the thought of war, Rome is already shuddering.
Dawn Glasgow's husband, Eddie, who is stationed at Griffiss, headed for the gulf in August, part of the 416th Organizational Maintenance Squadron. When he left, their second child, Sean, was just 6 months old.
"I'll admit we never expected something like this to happen," Mrs. Glasgow said, sitting on the floor of her living room with Sean in her lap. "It's tough, you know, raising two kids on your own."
Mrs. Glasgow said she worried all the time about her husband, and wrote him almost every day. But, she said sighing, she knew he had no choice. "It's his job," she said. "He joined the service for a purpose. And now's his time to go over there to defend us."
"Eddie loves his job," she said. "And if he can't find another, he can't help but re-enlist."
 
 Dreading January
 Mrs. Glasgow's neighbor, Denice Weil, does not herself have relatives in the gulf but, she said, with so many local men and women over in Saudi Arabia and the holidays coming up, "It's pretty depressing around here."
"We all have a terrible feeling of dread that come January, we're going to have an all-out war," she said. "There are a lot of lonely wives around, a lot of children who don't know if they're going to see their dads again."
Residents of Rome always believed that their town, with its air base and its arsenals, would be a prime target if hostilities broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union. Last year, when the Berlin wall was chopped up into souvenirs and relations between the superpowers thawed, people in Rome felt measurably safer. But now, Ms. Weil said, they were beginning to wonder again.
"I guess we were living pretty high on the hog," she said. "We saw the Soviet Union doing things we never thought possible. And then this had to happen."
 
 Gloom in a Tavern
 Over at Walt's, a tavern in the seedier part of town that caters to servicemen, an early-evening crowd was gathering under a cardboard sign that read "No Tabs." The consensus around the bar was that the civilian population did not really know how terrible a war would be.
"I think the military is aware of how high the casualties would be," said Willie Fletcher, who spent four years in Air Force and now works part time at Walt's. "The rest of the people are not. Anybody who knows anything about what's going on, they're really concerned."
Mr. Fletcher said he had a 17-year-old son who until recently wanted to be a marine. Now he was reconsidering. "Who am I to tell him to join the Marines and go off to get killed?" Mr. Fletcher said.
Sgt. 1st Class Richard Foster, who was having a drink at the horseshoe-shaped bar, said: "I believe the casualties are going to be quite high. And if it lasts any more than five or six weeks, it is going to last for quite a long time."
"Some of the young guys, they don't know what to expect," Sergeant Foster, a member of the 82d Airborne Division who has spent 20 years in the army, continued. "There's a lot of joking at the base. I guess they do it out of fear."
As to the odds of war, Sergeant Foster said: "It's going to happen, that's all I can say. And if it doesn't happen, somebody's going to be very lucky."
 
CHARLES TOWN, W.VA.: Sense of History Adds to Alarm
 Charles Town was founded by George Washington's half-brother, Charles, more than 200 years ago, so people in the town think they have a pretty good sense of American history. When they look at the future, many Charles Town residents say, they are alarmed by the parallels.
J. Michael Cassell, a public prosecutor, said that what disturbed him was the way the country seemed to be repeating its mistakes. "I don't think the Administration has expressed clearly enough what the purpose of this is," he said, pausing at the luncheonette on his way to work.
Despite their reservations about war, many in Charles Town said theirs is a patriotic state (West Virginia, one of the nation's poorest states, has one of the highest ratios of military-to-civilian populations in the country) and would support war.
"I hate to see our guys get hurt, but I don't like the other guy neither," said Myron Gregory, a fruit-stand operator. "I wouldn't even hesitate to use the big bomb -- whatever's necessary to get the job done."
 
 Oil Is Seen as Cause
 "People will accept it and support it, although they will not like it," said Ed Dockeney, associate editor of the local weekly newspaper.
In the agricultural areas around Charles Town, several farmers said that while they were unhappy at the thought of war, they would support just about anything that would end the climb in oil prices, which has eaten heavily into their profits.
"They say it's not over the price of oil, but it is over the price of oil," said Robert Funk, climbing down from his combine. "I've got a nephew in the service, and I don't like to see it, but I can't take much more of this."
Mr. Cassell said it was crucial that the country know the reasons for its sacrifices: "Unless they understand exactly what we are there for, the American people are going to turn against this, once large number of people start coming home in body bags."
Mr. Cassell's friend, Rick Pekar, agreed. "There are a lot of young boys in this country who have never seen war," he said. "And once they do see it, this is not gong to be quite so popular. I grew up during Vietnam, too, and it was a very sad time."

HEADLINE: Trump Shifts And Talks To Creditors

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Only a few hours after declaring on Tuesday that he had broken off negotiations with holders of the "junk bonds" of his Taj Mahal casino, Donald J. Trump reopened the talks yesterday to try to avoid an involuntary bankruptcy filing on the Atlantic City property.
Mr. Trump has until midnight tonight to make a $47.3 million interest payment on the $675 million in bonds he sold to build the casino. If he fails to make the payment, he faces the possibility that bondholders could try to force the Taj Mahal to file for bankruptcy protection. 
 The New York developer has said he does not have enough money to make the payment. If a settlement is reached before a bankruptcy is forced, people close to the negotiations have said, the bondholders will receive significantly more than half of the casino's equity, as well as other concessions.
 
Previous Offer Rejected
 For many weeks, Mr. Trump has been in talks with a group of bondholders who hold approximately 85 percent of the face value of the Taj Mahal bonds. He made an offer last month to give the bondholders 19.9 percent of the casino if they would substantially reduce the interest rates on the bonds, extend the maturity and accept new bonds in lieu of cash for interest payments. The offer was roundly rejected.
Any settlement would include a reduction of the interest rate on the bonds, which were set at 14 percent when they were issued. The amount of the reduction, how long the rate would remain at a lower level, and the amount of equity that would be given in exchange for the reduction are crucial concerns in the talks.
If no settlement is reached by midnight and Mr. Trump fails to make the payment, lawyers for the bondholders' committee believe there is a way to get around the 30-day grace period provided in the contract should Mr. Trump default.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Chairman's Ambitions For United

BYLINE: By Eric N. Berg

DATELINE: ELK GROVE, Ill.

 BODY:
IT is as if all of the stress of repeated buyout offers, incessant criticism from union leaders and a much-publicized plan to oust him as chairman and chief executive of the UAL Corporation has had no effect on Stephen M. Wolf.
Since Oct. 9, when an employee-led bid for UAL, the parent of United Airlines, collapsed, Mr. Wolf has emerged with a series of deals aimed at making United the first truly global airline. And he indicated in a recent interview that he was not planning to take a breather. United is in negotiations with a number of carriers, he said, to buy additional assets. 
 Mr. Wolf has had a busy month. On Oct. 15, less than a week after the protracted buyout effort fell through, he announced the largest aircraft order ever -- a $22 billion purchase of wide-body jets from the Boeing Company. The same day, he announced that United had been chosen by the Transportation Department over its archrival, American Airlines, to fly between Chicago and Tokyo.
Eight days later, Mr. Wolf held another news conference to announce plans to acquire Pan American World Airways' routes to London for $400 million.
In the interview, at UAL's headquarters in this suburb of Chicago, Mr. Wolf declined to give details of the company's current negotiations. But he said United was talking with a number of financially weak carriers, which would probably include Eastern, Trans World and Continental. While giving no indication that a purchase was near, Mr. Wolf said United was eager to do more deals.
"I don't envision anything bigger than what we are doing with Pan Am," he said, but he added, "We will continue to listen to airline managements that want to dispose of assets."
Mr. Wolf said United was building cash reserves to prepare for the financial pain of a recession. United strategists see a slowdown coming, and they predict that the revenues of all airlines will suffer.
But United also wants to raise cash to pay for "significant corporate transactions," Mr. Wolf said.
Wall Street analysts have viewed the purchase of the aircraft, as well as the acquisition of the Pan Am routes, as part of a grand plan by Mr. Wolf. That plan, the analysts say, involves establishing United as a force in North America, Europe and Asia, the most important continents for business travel.
United already has the largest presence in Asia; its North American operation is only slightly smaller than that of American Airlines, the leader, and the new Pan Am routes will make United a close second to American in trans-Atlantic travel. Indeed, analysts have said Mr. Wolf wants to give United an important presence around the world, and the United chief acknowledged as much.
"Ultimately, our objective is to be a very comprehensive worldwide carrier," he said.
To achieve that, United must establish labor peace with its three main unions -- the flight attendants, the machinists and the pilots -- all of which are currently in contract talks. Many analysts have predicted long and difficult negotiations, saying the unions will take a tough stance after failing to win control of the airline. Mr. Wolf expressed hope that new labor contracts could be reached, but he repeated an earlier offer to submit any lingering disputes in the contract talks to binding arbitration.
But even if United can win new labor accords, other obstacles remain to Mr. Wolf's plan. The chairman acknowledged that although United was scheduled to take delivery of about one new wide-body Boeing jet a week over the next four years, the airline would still be short of aircraft.
He also noted that all airlines remained vulnerable to the spike in fuel prices. Mr. Wolf said United had decided not to sign contracts locking in a price on later purchases of fuel, because it did not want to be bound to a high price if fuel prices fell suddenly.
The 49-year-old Mr. Wolf, who is 6 foot 6 and looked trim and rested, has been such a blur of motion lately that some analysts have expressed concern that he might be acting too hastily. In particular, they wonder whether United should be expanding so quickly, given the possibility of a steep drop in demand for air travel in the United States during a recession.
But Mr. Wolf said that some of United's Asian routes were growing at an annual rate of 20 percent or more and that he was confident the airline would not feel a cash pinch. Indeed, he said it was unlikely that two years from now United's balance sheet would look much different from how it appears today. And even if the balance sheet deteriorated, United's finances would still compare favorably to rivals, Mr. Wolf predicted.
United's calculations put its total debt, including lease obligations, at about $4.4 billion, compared with $7.9 billion at American and $4.6 billion at Delta. United calculates its cash reserves at $1.6 billion, compared with $720 million at American and $68 million at Delta.
"We think we will maintain a strong relative financial position, no matter what happens to the world economy," Mr. Wolf said.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up Only 0.1% In October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Retail sales growth slowed to a barely perceptible one-tenth of 1 percent in October, the Government said today, prompting analysts to predict a big cutback in holiday gift-buying.
"I think holiday sales are going to be pretty lousy," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. "Compared to Christmases past, it's just not going to look very good." 
 Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington, agreed, pointing to two months of declining sales at department and clothing stores -- often gauges of consumer sentiment.
 
'Less Money to Spend'
 "Consumers have a limited budget," she said. "With the rapid deterioration of the job market and more inflation, consumers just simply have less money to spend."
The Commerce Department said retail sales -- which cover sales at department stores, as well as auto dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $152.3 billion, up from $152.1 billion in September. But like the previous two months, sales were inflated by high gasoline prices, not volume.
In fact, the department said sales actually fell one-tenth of 1 percent in October when gasoline purchases were excluded. The price of gasoline has climbed about 35 percent since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait disrupted world oil markets.
The September figure on retail sales was revised yesterday to a gain of 1.3 percent, up from a previously reported strong increase of 1.1 percent. That had been the biggest advance in four months, but economists said when it was released last month that surging gasoline prices, along with a rebound in automobile purchases, helped mask an otherwise weak report.
Analysts saw the October sales data as further evidence of weakness in an economy that many believe is in a recession. Retail sales represent about half of all consumer spending, which itself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Ms. Shaber predicted a repeat of last year's holiday season, when many retailers cut prices and offered other promotions to lure consumers to their salesrooms. "It's really a very, very promotional Christmas already," she said. "We have too many stores and too many malls now being aggravated by the erosion of household purchasing power."
Retailers depend on the holiday shopping season for about half of their sales and profits.
Automobiles, which represent about 20 percent of retail sales, slowed to a seven-tenths of 1 percent gain, from a 2.9 percent increase in September. But Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said unit sales were down in October, suggesting the increase represented higher prices for new-model-year cars.
Excluding the auto category, retail sales were unchanged from the previous month.
Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items expected to last more than three years, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, just half of their 1.4 percent gain a month earlier.
Purchases of building materials rebounded 1.5 percent after a 1.5 percent drop in September, but sales of furniture and other home furnishings fell three-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Labor Leaders Rally to Support The News Strike

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
In a show of solidarity with Daily News strikers, the country's top union officials led a rally of demonstrators yesterday and pledged almost $300,000 in aid.
One of the officials, Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, told the cheering crowd, "You have the support of the entire labor movement behind you." 
 Flanking him were Owen Bieber of the 1.5-million-member United Automobile Workers, Morton Bahr of the Communications Workers of America, Jay Mazur of the International Ladies Garment Workers, Jack Sheinkman of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, Gerald McEntee of the 1.2-million member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and other union chiefs.
Other speakers included Edward J. Cleary, president of the New York State AFL-CIO, and Thomas Van Arsdale, president of the New York City Central Labor Council and Peter Brennan, a building trades official and former United States Secretary of Labor.
 
Check for $55,000
 Many of the union leaders ended their speeches with pledges of money for the strikers. Most pledged $25,000, and the largest contribution was a $55,000 check from Local 1199, of Hospital Workers Union.
The peaceful but spirited rally was held in front of the Daily News's headquarters on East 42d Street. Police estimated the crowd at 2,700, but organizers said the number was at least double that. Among the banners and signs were the emblems of carpentry, electrical, transportation, retail and workers unions.
The strike at The Daily News began three weeks ago after months of fruitless negotiations and increasing bitterness. The newspaper has continued to publish using nonunion help, but most of its circulation has been cut off by the widespread refusal of newsstands to sell the paper, and its advertising is also down.
Both sides have accused each other of attacks and harassment, and both union members and Daily News security guards have been arrested, some in melees near where papers were being distributed.
"Who brought the bully boys to New York -- who hired the thugs?" Mr. Kirkland said. He accused the company of "the economic violence of stealing people's jobs -- that's the root of anything that might be called violence."

McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council. (William E. Sauro/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Van Gogh Drawing Sets a Record at $8.4 Million

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
The ups and downs in art auctions continued last night at Christie's sale of Impressionist and modern works that saw a painting by Vincent van Gogh go unsold and a drawing soar to record levels.
Van Gogh's boldly drawn "Garden of Flowers," from 1888, in brown and black ink over pencil, brought $8.4 million, a record at auction for any drawing. It was bought by William Acquavella, a Manhattan dealer. But van Gogh's painting "Vase With Cornflowers and Poppies," from 1890, was bid to about $9 million -- well below the price the owner would accept. The house estimate was $12 million to $16 million. 
 The previous record for a drawing was $4.8 million paid for Raphael's chalk drawing "A Man's Head and Hands," from before 1520, which was auctioned at Christie's in London in 1984 in the sale of Old Master drawings from Duke of Devonshire's collection at Chatsworth in Derbyshire.
The total in Christie's auction of 47 offerings, of which 32 were sold, was $92.4 million, considerably less than the house estimate of $129 million to $158.6 million.
The van Gogh drawing was one of six works sold for prices above the high estimates of the auction house. Fourteen other works brought prices within the estimates, and 12 were sold for less than the low estimate.
"The average of what has sold has been at the low end of these estimates," said Richard Gray, a Chicago dealer. "One thing is certain: the market has not collapsed. The best works sold, and for top prices. The average works were discounted 20 0r 30 percent, and the mediocre works did not sell but probably will again when the market adjusts."
When asked what these lower prices and unsold lots mean for future sales, Michael Findlay, who heads Christie's Impressionist and modern art sales, said: "In the next four months, my colleagues and I will be gathering works for the spring sales. We are going to appraise paintings and objects in accordance with these results. If somebody brings us a Monet 'Waterlilies' that has some relationship to the $4.4 million one we sold tonight, we are not going to put an estimate on it of $6 million to $8 million," the estimate on "Water lilies." Mr. Findlay added, "The estimates will be taken down another notch."
 
Leger Brings Highest Price
 The highest price paid last night was $9.9 million, for Fernand Leger's abstract landscape "Houses Beneath the Trees," from 1913. The buyer was an unidentified American dealer.
Mr. Findlay said American buyers were more active last night than he expected. He said about one-third of the artworks went to American buyers, one-third to Europeans and one third to Japanese buyers. Among the European buyers was Thomas Ammann of Zurich, who bought Giacometti's "Standing Woman No. 1" for $3.9 million, just under the estimate of $4 million to $6 million.
Kazuo Fujii of the Fujii Gallery in Tokyo, said as he left the sale last night: "Reason has returned to the market." Mr. Fujii bought Picasso's "Head of a Woman," from 1921, for $2 million, the high estimate.
Ernst Beyeler, a Geneva dealer, who bought Edouard Manet's "Flowers in a Crystal Vase" for $3.7 million, a price within the house estimate, said: "The sale was quite strong. I think the auction houses will be more cautious in the future, giving guarantees, and that will make the estimates lower and will loosen the situation somewhat. It is not a crash. It is different from other situations in the economy. Good paintings still remain rare, and unless there is a catastrophe, there will always be money around to buy them."

Scenes From Family Life: Always More of the Same

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
In David Storey's novel "Pasmore," the title character is troubled by a recurrent dream. Running in a race, he finds himself overtaken by everyone, even the "idlers and dullards." Suddenly awakening, he feels an "undiminished sense of terror."
That fear -- that life itself has passed one by -- shadows Mr. Storey's new play, "The March on Russia," a seemingly becalmed but quietly turbulent drama about Colin Pasmore, a university lecturer and author, and his family. For the Pasmores, fulfillment is no longer even a wishful fantasy. All that the characters can see on the horizon is more of the same, followed by "full stop."
The play was first presented last year at the Royal National Theater in London, in a production reuniting the playwright with his symbiotic director, Lindsay Anderson. In May, Josephine Abady staged it with an American company at the Cleveland Play House, and that production opened this week at Chelsea Stage.
Though one would never suggest that the American actors could duplicate the authenticity, especially the Yorkshire accents, of their English predecessors, Ms. Abady's production is exactingly shaded and subtle in its delineation of these regional characters. Led by John Carpenter and Bethel Leslie as the father and mother, the actors capture the underlying humor as well as the sadness. The uncredited scenic design is overly spare, but the production achieves a greater intimacy on the small stage at the Hudson Guild Theater than it did on a vast stage at the National.
Each of the three younger actors, Carol Locatell and Susan Browning as the daughters and Sean Griffin as Colin, is sensitive to the disparities as well as the similarities of these siblings. Together the five actors evoke a moving family portrait.
In more hopeful times, there were happier dreams. The father recalls, with poignancy, his youthful military service invading the Crimea around the time of the Russian Revolution (his march on Russia). It was a moment of adventure, followed immediately by marriage and 45 years of work in a Yorkshire coal mine. The father's life has been more forcefully circumscribed than the lives of his wife and children, but each one has been trapped within a self-limiting world.
Family rivalries become family rituals. Which child was loved most? To the audience, it should be clear that each was equally unloved, despite signs of occasional favoritism, and that the elder Pasmores have moved past their own despair to a kind of barely controlled disharmony.
At least for the first act, the story may seem deceptively light as the three adult offspring arrive separately at the parents' retirement cottage to help them celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary. There are no character revelations, as in Mr. Storey's "In Celebration," which deals with a related family situation 20 years earlier. But "The March on Russia" is suffused with sorrow and understanding as the characters find themselves unable to achieve a sense of kinship or of mutual support.
The play becomes elegiac, a longing for lost times that never were, except perhaps for the father's "march on Russia," and even that story seems to be disappearing from his memory. At the end of the play, his wife has to prod him to remember the facts (and perhaps the fiction) of his tale, the thought of which has become as important to her as it is for him.
In his plays and novels, Mr. Storey has tellingly explored the nature of families, especially those with working-class backgrounds, in which the offspring are educated and elevated to a higher social and economic level. The generational chasm between a father who has worked with his hands as a collier and a son who works with his mind cannot be bridged. People in Storey plays may embrace, but they are unable to touch one another emotionally. Instead, they either repress their feelings (like the mother) or suffer breakdowns (like Colin).
For Mr. Storey, "The March on Russia" is a return to an earlier mode. After "In Celebration," he moved on to the poetic symbolism of "The Contractor" and "Home," and in more recent years he has concentrated on fiction. Some may regard the new work as overly traditional, but family plays are always viable when they are as deeply felt as this one and when they are written with such lyrical understatement. Though the Pasmores are definably from Yorkshire, they are recognizable wherever sons and daughters are encouraged to excel and then do not realize their own ambitions and the expectations of their parents.

HEADLINE: The Right Response to Recession

 BODY:
The pertinent economic question for America is not whether a recession has arrived but what to do about it.
While it is true that conditions in some parts of the country are better than a year ago, over all they are dicey, and distinctly gloomy in the Northeast. 
 Most forecasters say a national recession is under way. But there is no concurrence over how deep or how long. Given the uncertainties, the proper policy for Washington is to not do too much too soon, to stay alert but cautious.
A recession is popularly defined as a drop in the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, in two consecutive quarters. The real G.N.P. was still growing in the July-September quarter, just before and after the start of the Kuwait confrontation and the sharp runup in oil prices. The annual growth rate in those months was an unexpectedly strong 1.8 percent.
But monthly statistics through October have been decidedly softer. Factory output was down 0.8 percent in October, and cutbacks were exceptionally widespread. Unemployment held steady at 5.7 percent last month, and there are 30 cities where it is more than a percentage point lower than a year ago. Even so, the national average is expected to rise soon; non-farm jobs dropped by 58,000 in September and by 98,000 more in October, and there has been a surge in unemployment benefit claims.
Statistics apart, the news is full of reports of layoffs, and consumer confidence has been sinking. The whole country is not in trouble yet. While the Northeast is in a pronounced slump, the Northwest is still expanding, the Midwest and Southwest are so-so, and the oil patch is beginning to recover from the oil price plunges of the 1980's. But after a record eight-year expansion, the economy has been slowing down for months; the jump in oil prices last summer may have been the final straw.
Because hard statistics only come after the fact, the Government's policy makers cannot know what conditions prevail right now, much less what's to come. The biggest imponderable is how the Persian Gulf crisis ends. Meanwhile, high oil prices are an economic drag.
Despite this uncertainty, there are some certain facts. Most significant, the current inflation rate of about 6 percent is less than half what it was when the Federal Reserve slammed on the brakes and brought on the 1981-82 recession. That being so, there are some clear principles for policy makers to follow at this stage of a business cycle:
There is no call for panic if the budget deficit grows; it always does in a recession, as tax collections fall and safety net outlays rise. With a plan in place for long-term deficit reduction, President Bush's renewed hankering for a capital gains tax cut is pure mischief.
Lower interest rates are needed, but only modestly so for now, as the Federal Reserve has already recognized. Structural problems need attention -- weakness in banking and insurance and the unemployment compensation system. And protectionist pressure for more barriers to trade must be resisted at all costs; the best hope for trade expansion is a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
Tough times are here, but they're not so tough that they justify rash or harsh moves. It is a time to be alert.

New World at War

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
When the police arrived they found the three children alone. They were wearing dirty clothes because they hadn't figured out how to do the laundry, and their father had tacked a note to the wall, telling them how to get cash with his automatic teller card. They were 8, 12 and 13, and they were hungry. There was no food in the house. Their father had been gone a week.
He'd left for the Persian Gulf. 
 The case of Staff Sgt. Faagalo Savaiki is a worst-case scenario, an extreme illustration of the collision between a changing American way of life and the demands of war. He is divorced, his ex-wife lives in Hawaii, and she couldn't manage to pay the airfare to Tennessee, which is where the children live with their father. He's back in the states now, charged with child abuse; the children are in foster homes, and the 101st Airborne Division, to which Sergeant Savaiki belongs, is still in the Middle East.
The world has changed since this country was last at war. It's not simply the shifting sands of geopolitics. In the waning years of Vietnam we were approaching our 200th birthday, an adolescent country still devoted to muscling any comers aside and being the undisputed champion of the world. We've grown up since. And there is nothing quite so sobering as becoming adult and discovering the real world.
The if of war in the Middle East has turned in many of our minds to a when. We know that once upon a time there were formal declarations of such things, but that seems so idealistic now. We remember, too, that once we believed we fought wars for reasons straight from the side of some marble monument. We are realistic about this conflict as only a grown-up, slightly world-weary country can be. We are going to war for oil, and, by extension, for the economy. The President trots out his Hitler similes to convince us otherwise.
The military is as changed as the rest of us. A support group in California reports that many of the soldiers writing home ask about public opinion, about whether we're for them or against them. They remember Vietnam; they know that uncomplicated patriotism is no longer our style. Eleven percent of our armed forces personnel are female today, more than a tenfold increase over 20 years ago. If heavy fighting begins, a significant number of the casualties will be women. People who yearn for the good old days are sure that women in body bags will convince us that women have overstepped their bounds.
For those of us who believe sons are as precious as daughters, it will simply provide further illustration that war is hell.
There are still plenty of military families with a "Best Years of Our Lives" quality, the mother waiting with the children for Daddy to come home from the gulf. But the number of single parents in America has doubled in the last 20 years, and 55,000 of them are in the service, along with an undetermined number of two-soldier couples. When they joined up, they were told that they had to assign guardianship for their children; there is no blanket combat exemption in an all-volunteer army for someone with babies to care for, or someone raising children alone.
Most have found temporary homes for their children with relatives. But at least two mothers ordered to the Mideast have left the Army, one because her children would not stop fighting with the cousins with whom they were bunking, and another because her parents became too ill to care for her baby daughter. Both women are fighting to be given honorable discharges.
The military is providing more counseling for its families than ever before. The relatives left at home are tying yellow ribbons around trees and telephone poles from Staten Island to Seattle. This will be a different war, in some ways, than any we have fought before, because this is a different kind of country. Our reality has outstripped the traditional stories of brave men going out to fight and die for a great cause while their women wait staunchly at home and provide security and normalcy for the children.
We have become more complicated than the scripts of old movies. Now we have brave women going out to fight and die for a cause none of us are sure about while their children struggle to feel secure with grandparents or aunts or uncles. Or a father who instructs the children in how to use his bank card and then leaves for Saudi Arabia. There is neither the kind of acceptance that lulled many of us at the beginning of Vietnam, nor the rage and betrayal that lit up the end. There is a quiet disillusionment: ah, this again. And for what?

HEADLINE: Bush Has the Cards, So Why Bluff?

BYLINE: By Bill Bradley; Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
All at once, President Bush has lost key allies in the international coalition he assembled so skillfully to deter Saddam Hussein's aggression in the Persian Gulf. His approach to the crisis has lost the support of nearly half the American people, polls show.
To continue to hold the support of Congress for any military action, he must come before us in a special session and explain why he has prematurely discarded his promising first strategy for a strategy of needless, high-stakes bluffing. 
 Without hearing a convincing explanation of that change, and with the cost of Operation Desert Shield now heading toward $30 billion, Congress should authorize no expenditures for a land invasion of Kuwait or Iraq.
 By supplementing the potent military force already in Saudi Arabia with a vast new Army and Navy presence that supposedly will provide an offensive capability, President Bush evidently hopes Saddam Hussein will appreciate the dimensions of the buildup, take U.S. intentions more seriously, recalculate his options and pull out of Kuwait.
But at this moment, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Hussein will respond to U.S. threats with anything but a renewed determination to dig in further around the ruins of Kuwait City. He may see more troops facing him, but he also sees Egypt declaring that it will not participate in an offensive action; he sees the Soviet Union urging a diplomatic settlement; he sees the sudden creation of valid dissent and doubt in the U.S.; he sees major questions being raised about restoring a monarch in Kuwait instead of installing a democratically elected ruler, and he sees the U.S. committing so many troops at one time that we cannot rotate them and they may not be in top fighting trim.
Before the new buildup, the economic sanctions coupled with a troop presence in Saudi Arabia were beginning to work. The strict boycott and embargo imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council told Saddam Hussein that the world would wait as long as it took for him to get out of Kuwait, and the troops told him not to take one step further toward domination of the Middle East oil supply.
The sanctions were just beginning to pinch Iraq's food and industrial supplies. Saddam Hussein had shown signs of anxiety, abruptly firing his Oil Minister and army Chief of Staff. We knew that even if sanctions ultimately failed, we still would have overwhelming air power to achieve our objectives. Time, we knew, was on our side. Then President Bush decided to give up on time and gamble on brute strength. He decided on an empty, costly show of force that is either bluff or prelude to war.
If Saddam Hussein ultimately decides to abandon Kuwait, or to negotiate seriously, it will not be because he perceives an attack as imminent. It will be because he perceives war with the U.S. as unwinnable. In six to nine months, under boycott pressure, his military machine will begin to crumble as food, fuel, spare parts and morale dwindle. Iraq's remarkable economic development will be endangered. To Mr. Hussein, the prospect of losing power and position is a greater threat than that of losing an already decimated Kuwait.
With a slowly growing contingent of rested, properly rotated U.S. troops still waiting him out across the Saudi border, Mr. Hussein would certainly have realized that war with the U.S. was a lost cause and that withdrawal from Kuwait was the only possible path to preserve the gains of his rule. But now, with more troops but less unity, more tanks but less patience, we all but invite him to call our bluff.
While declaring that the new buildup is intended to give us the capacity to launch an invasion of Kuwait or Iraq, President Bush has not explained why this should be our objective now when it was not our objective in August. He has not even demonstrated that the new troops would provide an offensive capacity that had been lacking up to now. The land-based air forces currently in Saudi Arabia could take out all known strategic sites in Iraq, and none of the three additional carrier groups or the heavy Army corps units would add much to such an air campaign.
The most visible effects of the buildup will be to involve the Army and the Navy more deeply in Desert Shield (is inter-service rivalry once again driving military decisions?) and to double the cost of the operation, from $15 billion to $30 billion in the 1991 fiscal year.
When Congress passed the Defense Department appropriations bill this fall and exempted the costs of Desert Shield from budget limits, it created a perverse incentive for the military to find every excuse possible to push costs into this unlimited category. If that is happening here, then of all the misguided policies engendered by this year's budget process we have now created the most self-destructive imaginable -- one that will cost American lives.
In refusing to acknowledge the constraints of the War Powers Resolution, the Reagan and Bush Administrations have argued that seeking Congressional consent to go to war makes U.S. foreign policy unpredictable and inconsistent. But members of Congress have been unanimously supportive for months -- and the President's foreign policy has still become unpredictable and inconsistent.
Congressional oversight is necessary for just such situations as this, to hold us back from decisions that are clearly unwise. We do not have to wait to let history judge. We do not have to wait to let President Bush explain to the parents of soldiers killed in the Persian Gulf why he abandoned a policy that was working for a policy of high-stakes bluffing. He should explain it to Congress, and if he cannot persuade us that it makes sense, then we should make sure that any special supplemental appropriation does not contain one dollar for a land invasion of Kuwait or Iraq.

HEADLINE: REVIEW/PHOTOGRAPHY;
Another Facet of Mexico's Artistic Achievement

BYLINE: By ANDY GRUNDBERG

 BODY:
Judging from the evidence now on view in Manhattan, Mexican photographers are currently of two minds. They remain indebted to the country's leading practitioner, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who for nearly 70 years has taken pictures that combine modernist clarity, Surrealist mystery and Mexico's own cultural heritage. At the same time, they have reached beyond Mr. Alvarez Bravo's influential synthesis to adopt postwar European and American styles -- notably those descended from Henri Cartier-Bresson.
Whether Mexican photographers feel a conflict between their indigenous tradition and the need for innovation, this outside observer cannot say. But the photographs that appear as part of this fall's diverse celebration of Mexican culture certainly suggest it. Two shows in particular provide telling glimpses into a vital esthetic arena of American art that remains largely unknown in the United States. 
 The shows are "Between Worlds: Contemporary Mexican Photography," an exhibition of more than 100 photographs, which opens Sunday at the International Center of Photography's uptown headquarters, and "Women in Mexico," at the National Academy of Design. "Women in Mexico" is a show of painting and sculpture as well as photographs, but the combination helps illuminate the context in which Mexican photographers work.
"Between Worlds," which was organized by Trisha Ziff, an English curator now living in Mexico City, features the pictures of 10 photographers between the ages of 26 and 65, as well as images from a group documentary project called "Megalopolis." Although its premise is that photography in Mexico remains distinct for cultural and economic reasons, the work on the walls presents no problems in terms of comprehensibility. Most of it is in the form of sociologically oriented, personally inflected photo essays that will seem familiar to anyone acquainted with the Magnum style of photojournalism.
Topics range from migrant workers -- Mexicans in southern California, Guatemalans in southern Mexico -- to life in remote villages. Bilingual text panels describe the significance of the subjects. But the groups of 6 to 10 pictures each are not photo essays in a traditional sense, for they have no clear beginning, middle and end. Instead, they are showcases for the photographers' compositional talents. They also tend to emphasize ritual and mystery instead of exposition.
Mariana Yampolsky, the show's senior figure, is represented by a series of pictures purporting to show the life of Mazahua women, whose men have left their villages for jobs in big cities. But her two most intriguing photographs, of cactus leaves and a dust storm, have little to do with conventional documentation. The same could be said of Flor Garduno's "Bestiarium," which at its best seems like a rerun of Mr. Alvarez Bravo's old Surrealist themes.
Surrealism came to Mexico in a big way with the 1940 international Surrealist exhibition in Mexico City, and its shadow hangs over even the most resolutely photojournalistic work on view. Jose Hernandez Claire's study of blindness includes an image of an eye operation that is as chilling as the opening of the classic film "Un Chien Andalou." The part of the show devoted to the theme "Megalopolis," which is intended to document Mexico City, includes such unlikely scenes as Marco Antonio Cruz's view of an Easter celebration, in which human feet inexplicably hang from the sky, and Pablo Ortiz Monasterio's image of two boys practicing matador moves beside an elevated highway.
The odd photographer out is also the youngest, Ruben Ortiz. In addition to being one of the two artists in the show to use color, he provides the only evidence that art photography of the last 15 years has had an impact in Mexico. His colors are bright, splashy and often enhanced with flash, and he is not afraid to fabricate reality in the studio, as he does in a picture of a shirtless man wearing a crown of neon tubing.
 The Surrealist influence that echoes through the documentary pictures in "Between Worlds" is even more in evidence in the photographs in "Women in Mexico," which includes work as early as 1927 (Tina Modotti's close-up of sugar cane, inspired by Edward Weston) and as recent as 1989 (Laura Cohen's strange pairings of plants and geometric figures). Like such painters as Frida Kahlo, Maria Izquierdo, Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington, Mexico's female photographers seem most interested in creating dream scapes in which fantasy and reality are conflated.
The camera is not always the greatest ally of fantasy, however, so some of the efforts of Lola Alvarez Bravo, Kati Horna, Flor Garduno and Graciela Iturbide can seem forced. But when they succeed -- as in Ms. Iturbide's 1979 "Angel Woman," which shows a woman holding a portable radio and facing a forbiddingly empty desert -- the photographs resonate with the tensions between nature and culture, tribal and industrial, and life and death.
Ms. Cohen and Eugenia Rendon de Olazabal, two of the exhibition's younger photographers, seem to accept such contradictory aspects of Mexican life as a given, referencing their work as much to recent photography in the United States as to Surrealism and the indigenous example of Mr. Alvarez Bravo. This is not surprising, since the two countries share more than a border, but it suggests that any assumption about a uniquely Mexican style of photography remains open to question. At the same time, "Women in Mexico" makes clear that Mexican photographers have created and continue to create images of a high order.
 "Between Worlds: Contemporary Mexican Photography" was organized by the Impressions Gallery in York, England, and is traveling under the auspices of Curatorial Assistance Inc. of Los Angeles. It remains at the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 3. "Women in Mexico," organized by the Centro Cultural/ Arte Contemporaneo of Mexico City, remains at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, through Dec. 2.
 
'Portraits of Frida Kahlo and Friends'
Carla Stellweg
87 East Houston Street
Through Nov. 22
Frida Kahlo's painted self-portraits are hard to top, but that never stopped photographers from trying to record her essence on film. The 50 black-and-white prints gathered here constitute a fascinating compendium of her many guises. There is Kahlo, the young beauty, on a train; Kahlo in front of a fresco of Lenin with her husband, Diego Rivera; Kahlo at work dressed in a formal, floor-length dress; Kahlo, haggard and infirm, wearing a ring on each of her elegant fingers.
The best portraits of her seem to have been taken by other women, notably her friends Lola Alvarez Bravo and Lucienne Bloch. The star image of the show is a straightforward print by Imogen Cunningham, taken in 1930, on which the painter drew cartoon-style tears that stream down her cheeks. Kahlo seems always to have insisted on controlling her own representation; even when she did not directly intervene in the image, she styled herself and her surroundings with great care. The result is a theater of the self that often resembles a costume party.

HEADLINE: A Spirited Thatcher Defense To Attack on Her Leadership

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher made a spirited rejection of Michael Heseltine's challenge to her leadership of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons today.
"After three general election victories leading the only party with clear policies, resolutely carried out, I intend to continue," she said, to cheers from the Conservative benches and jeers from the Labor opposition. 
 As Mr. Heseltine officially filed his candidacy to oust Mrs. Thatcher, a poll of the 240 of the 372 Tory legislators by the Press Association news service showed only 19.2 percent saying they would vote for him in the secret ballot next Tuesday, against 53.3 percent for Mrs. Thatcher.
Though the survey was carried out in strict confidence, the Press Association said, 27.5 percent refused to say how they would vote. Robert M. Worcester, a professional pollster who runs the Market and Opinion Research International organization here, said he had decided against a survey of legislators this week, partly because he did not trust the answers so long before the actual vote.
 
Voting Intentions Secret
 All but the most committed supporters of the two leadership candidates want to be able to live with the winner, whoever it is, and are reluctant to disclose their voting intentions publicly. Even if there are many abstentions, the winner must have at least 187 votes, and also a margin of at least 56, to win on the first ballot under the party rules. A runoff, if there is one, would be held the following Tuesday.
Mr. Heseltine has had the Prime Minister in his sights since he walked out of her Cabinet as Defense Minister in protest in January 1986, after losing a battle over whether the Westland helicopter company should be taken over by a European consortium instead of the American Sikorsky company, as Mrs. Thatcher wanted.
She has never been a comfortable person to have as a boss. Sir Geoffrey Howe, who resigned two weeks ago as her nominal deputy, was the last serving member of her first 1979 Cabinet. She had dismissed him as Foreign Secretary in mid-1989 after he and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, threaten to resign if she did not give a firm commitment that Britain would tie the pound closely to the European currency system. Mr. Lawson resigned in frustration a few months later, saying his advice was not being heeded.
 
Bitter Speech by Ex-Aide
 In a bitter speech on Tuesday, Sir Geoffrey called for her replacement as party leader because of what he called her negative attitude toward the European Community. But his secretary said today that he would not discuss how he was going to vote on Tuesday. "It's a private ballot," she said. Mr. Lawson also would not discuss his vote, an aide said.
Mrs. Thatcher's campaign is being run by George Younger, who replaced Mr. Heseltine as Defense Minister until leaving the Cabinet for personal reasons in 1989, and by three other men who have also been ministers in her Cabinet. They are Norman Tebbit, one of Mrs. Thatcher's closest friends and also former Conservative Party chairman; Michael Jopling, a former Agriculture Minister, and John Moore, who held three different Cabinet posts.
Mr. Heseltine's nomination, submitted today to the backbench Conservative Members' Committee that runs the leadership election, was proposed by a former sports minister, Sir Neil Macfarlane, and seconded by Sir Peter Tapsell, a frequent critic of Mrs. Thatcher.
 
Would Change 'Poll Tax'
 The challenger was busy giving radio and television interviews today, telling BBC radio how he would move to change the unpopular "poll tax" system, a per-capita payment plan Mrs. Thatcher has imposed for municipal government services.
He said he would "find a way of making the poll tax reflect a person's ability to pay," instead of leaving it the same for everybody in each local government district, and, as a fall-back position, would have the central Government instead of the local municipalities pay for education, to reduce the payment. The "community charge," as it is officially called, went into effect in England and Wales this spring at an average of 363, or $726, a person.
This evening Mr. Heseltine was campaigning for Conservative candidates in two special elections being held in Scotland on Nov. 29 to fill vacancies in Parliament.
Aside from sitting Cabinet ministers whose jobs depend on Mrs. Thatcher, few other M.P.'s have announced their positions.
 
Ridley Backs Thatcher
 Former Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley, who had to leave the Cabinet last summer because of the furor over an interview he gave The Spectator magazine that took Germany to task, urged his colleagues today to support Mrs. Thatcher "through thick and thin," rather than surrender to "Eurocrats" who were "close to getting control of our economy."
Barney Hayhoe, another M.P., said "It is becoming increasingly difficult to envisage how the party could truly unite behind Margaret Thatcher, although I am absolutely convinced that unity will be achieved under a new leader."
Sir Philip Goodhart, a highly visible backbencher, said he thought Mr. Heseltine had about 100 committed supporters, as his supporters Michael Mates and Keith Hampson contended.
"I think there will be a second ballot," Sir Philip said. "I went to a meeting of senior backbenchers, more center than left, last night, and only one was going to vote for Maggie. There was an assumption that there'd be a second ballot, and about a third said they would switch to Douglas Hurd then."
Mr. Hurd, Mrs. Thatcher's Foreign Secretary, is the most likely candidate to succeed her if she became incapacitated, according to an official at 10 Downing Street.

HEADLINE: The Hungry Drift Across the Sudan Amid Ominous Signs of a New Famine

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL OBEID, the Sudan

 BODY:
On a parched, dusty plain on the outskirts of this busy commercial city, nearly 10,000 destitute herders and farmers have pitched shanties, leaving behind their drought-ridden lands and dead crops. They have come searching for food and water.
Zamzam Osman, a 27-year-old pregnant mother, said she and her family left Shershar, 75 miles north of here, two months ago, their crop of gum arabic lost for lack of rain. "We tried a crop but the soil is no good and it failed," said Mrs. Osman, waiting for her husband and two boys to return from their begging trip to the city. 
 Mrs. Osman is one of tens of thousands of northern Sudanese from the Kordofan region who have migrated to either El Obeid or the national capital, Khartoum, as part of what international food experts are calling the "early signs of famine."
The Sudan is facing its third famine in six years. Experts from the United Nations and the United States say the impending disaster, complicated by a civil war and a hopeless economy, could be as bad as in 1984-85, when several hundred thousand people died of starvation; there is no more precise estimate of the death toll.
 
The Heart of the Dryness
 Again, the heart of the dryness seems to be here in Kordofan, a mostly roadless region as large as France with a population of 3.25 million people. The drought bodes ill not only for the people of Kordofan but for the shattered Sudanese economy. About 70 percent of the Sudan's exports of camels and sheep, among the country's few foreign exchange earners, come from Kordofan.
Other areas of the Sudan that are severely affected, according to early-warning bulletins issued by the Government's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, are the Darfur region, particularly the northern sector, and the Red Sea Hills area on the eastern edge of the country.
A 400,000-acre delta area in the east whose water is replenished by an annual flash flood from Ethiopia has not been planted for the first time in 96 years, said Trevor Page, the head of the United Nations World Food Program in the Sudan. This year, the flash flood did not materialize, and Bejar nomads from the Red Sea Hills, without sustenance for their camels and themselves, are beginning to come to Tokar, the main town of the delta.
In the southern Sudan, where civil war continues between the Arab and Muslim north and rebels from the African and animist and Christian south, the rains appear to have been more plentiful, according to the early-warning bulletins.
But war curtailed planting, leaving many normally productive farmers dependent on relief food in crowded camps around the southern cities. Workers with the International Committee of the Red Cross, which stopped its relief flights in early October because of obstruction by the Khartoum Government, say food stocks have virtually run out in Malakal, a major Government-held town in the south. The Government seeks to prevent relief supplies from helping the rebels or their sympathizers.
 
U.S. Diverts a Shipment
 This November is a difficult month all over the Sudan. Last season's food has been all but used up. In areas where the crops have not completely failed, farmers are beginning to harvest what meager produce there might be -- in pockets of southern Kordofan; the Gazira, an irrigation project south of Khartoum on the Nile, and around Gedaref, southeast of the capital.
But the coming crop is expected to be so thin that the United States Agency for International Development predicts that the Sudan will need as much as one million tons in food aid.
The United States has indicated that it is prepared to provide 100,000 tons of food aid, but wants guarantees from the Sudanese Government that the food will be fairly distributed. In October, the United States diverted a shipment of wheat in protest over what it called Khartoum's blockage of distribution, particularly to people in the south.
So far, the Government in Khartoum has declined to acknowledge a dramatic food shortage, arguing that the irrigated areas like the Gazira will yield higher quantities than in the past. The Americans and some Sudanese agricultural experts dispute this.
Here in El Obeid, the capital of Northern Kordofan, there is no reluctance by desperate regional authorities to admit the scope of the shortages.
"We need 326,000 tons for Kordofan," said the Deputy Governor, Abdul Wahap Hassan Hussein. "In Northern Kordofan it is very, very bad. No rain. We request aid."
 
Plant Is a Bad Omen
 On the track north to the town of Bara, once-arable land is intermittently covered with six-inch-high dried stumps of millet. But a reed-like plant called marikh pokes tall and green out of the golden soil. The plant is a bad omen: it is a sign of desertification, which in this case is the moving southward of the Sahara largely because of human foraging for wood.
In the small villages around Bara and farther north at Sodiri, the nongovernmental American agency Care has started to distribute 4,000 tons of American- and European-donated grain in an attempt to halt the influx of people like Mrs. Osman into the cities.
The coordinator of the distribution, Bashir Yusif, received a note from one of his monitors overseeing the grain handouts in remote villages. "I have covered 16 to 17 village councils," the note said. "You may think I am very fast, but people are so hungry they come at night as well as day" asking for food.
On the outskirts of Khartoum, truckloads of people from Kordofan arrive daily, their belongings crammed into bundles. But getting enough food is a daily enurance test even for the residents of Khartoum who have official ration cards. The new arrivals from Kordofan and the displaced from the south, 30,000 of whom were forcibly moved out of the capital by the army at the end of October, are not entitled to ration cards. They must try to find odd jobs in the standstill economy so they can buy extravagantly expensive food or hope to get handouts from humanitarian agencies.
 
Animals Sold for Food
 As bad as the conditions are in Khartoum, they are better than in Kordofan, said Fatima Adam Hamid, a 60-year-old widow who sat on a straw mat on the dirt floor of her reed shack in Souk Libya, one of the 27 camps, where she settled in early October.
"We had nothing but haboobs," Mrs. Hamid said, referring to the searing dust storms at her home in Shershar.
The family, unable to grow their traditional crop of sorghum, sold their animals to get money for food.
"When we sell the goats we have something to eat," she said. "But we sold all the goats. In two years, we sold 20 cows and 40 goats. When there was nothing left, I came."

HEADLINE: U.S. Legislators Warn Kenya Rights Record Endangers Aid

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Three United States Senators have told the Kenyan Government, once one of Washington's favorite aid recipients in Africa, that because of its poor human rights record it would not receive its usual military aid next year.
In another sign of displeasure, the Senators made clear during their visit here this week that unlike some other African countries, Kenya would not share in the more than $200 million in increased economic development aid that Congress made available for the continent in the foreign aid bill adopted this month. 
 Despite warnings from Western donors and the World Bank that aid to Africa would be increasingly tied to liberalization, Kenya, under the leadership of President Daniel arap Moi, has remained steadfastly opposed to political pluralism.
Three well-known advocates of a multiparty system have been imprisoned and kept in solitary confinement without charges since July. More than 80 people have been charged with sedition for the possession of political cassettes and publications, and about 50 people have been charged "with breach of the peace" since the political crackdown. Four people were charged with treason last month.
 
Four Conditions Set
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's foreign operations subcommittee, said here that under the terms of the foreign aid bill President Bush had to certify that Kenya was meeting four conditions to receive $15 million in military aid.
The conditions were these: to charge and try or release all prisoners, including political detainees; to stop mistreatment of prisoners; to restore the independence of the judiciary, and to restore freedom of expression.
The other members of the visiting delegation were Senators Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, and Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland.
Apparently in a gesture to donors, Mr. Moi said last week that his Government would introduce a bill in Parliament to restore the tenure of judges, the Attorney General and the Auditor General. The independence of the judiciary, which had been part of the Kenya Constitution since 1963, was removed in 1988, the same time that the secret ballot in primary elections was dispensed with.
 
Freedom for Detainees
 From the tone of the message Mr. Leahy delivered at a news conference and comments by officials at the United States Embassy here, it seemed unlikely that the restoration of an independent judiciary alone would be sufficient. Implicit was the expectation that the Kenyan authorities would have to release or charge the three political detainees, Kenneth Matiba, Charles Rubia and Raila Odinga.
President Moi was in Japan, the biggest donor of aid to Kenya, during the Congressional visit but the reaction of the Vice President and Finance Minister, George Saitoti, was a version of what Mr. Moi has been saying for the last several months: that Kenya will not change its ways because donors demand it.
"Kenyans will not allow themselves to be dictated as to what changes to undertake," Mr. Saitoti said in Parliament to the stamping of feet in approval. "We shall not do anything to appease anybody."
Last year, Kenya was appropriated $15 million in American military aid but received only $10 million because the remaining $5 million was canceled after the imprisonment of the three politicians in July. Congress approved $25 million for economic development aid and $14 million for food aid for the coming year, about the same amounts as Kenya received in 1990.
Other African countries, notably Mozambique and newly independent Namibia, received increases in their aid, not only because of obvious need from war and famine, but also as rewards for introducing measures permitting a multiparty system.
Increasingly economically strapped because it is entirely dependent on imported oil, Kenya lost $20 million in aid from Norway when President Moi cut off diplomatic relations last month in a dispute over a Kenyan exile arrested on treason charges. The Danish Government has announced it will cut its aid of $35 million by one quarter because of unhappiness with Kenya's rights record.

HEADLINE: In Court, U.S. Blames Drexel For Much of the S.& L. Crisis

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
The Government asserted yesterday that a principal culprit in the savings and loan debacle that is costing taxpayers billions of dollars was Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the "junk bond" market that it developed.
In arguing this case in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the Government entered a new legal frontier in its attempt to recover some of the billions of dollars lost at failed savings institutions. 
 For the first time, it disclosed in considerable detail what it had already found about the investment firm's role in the collapse of 48 savings institutions and in the difficulties of one that is struggling to survive, the Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif.
Drexel accomplished its dominance of the junk bond market, the Government contends, by bribing savings executives, raising more money than necessary from one savings institution to enable it to invest in more Drexel junk bonds, and manipulating the prices of bonds, often by trading them between institutions. Among the institutions cited with which Drexel arranged deals were Centrust Savings of Miami; Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
Drexel and its other creditors assert that the Government's claims are an attempt to squeeze as much as possible from the remains of Drexel, while shifting the blame away from regulators who failed to act quickly enough throughout the 1980's in the face of economic problems like bad real estate loans.
"The Government is clearly trying to stir up a lot of dust, but if it hadn't fallen asleep at the switch in the first place, then the S.& L.'s wouldn't be in the position that they are now," said Harrison J. Goldin, the former comptroller of New York City who is representing a committee of Drexel's unsecured creditors. "These claims have little merit."
Alan Miller, Drexel's main lawyer, said, "What they are trying to do is make Drexel a convenient scapegoat to deflect criticism that the regulators were inadequate." The true causes of the savings industry collapse, he maintained, had little or nothing to do with Drexel but were precipitated by a host of regulatory and economic failures including bad real estate loans.
Even if the Government prevails in its argument, it will be impossible to recover the $11 billion it is seeking because Drexel's estate is estimated at $3 billion, and the firm faces other large Government claims, included a claim expected to be filed next week by the Internal Revenue Service for about $1 billion. But the cases provide important road maps for other actions that the Government has said it will file against lawyers, accountants, savings and loan executives and their insurance companies.
 
Disclosures on Criminal Cases
 The new findings also added substantially to what Federal prosecutors had already disclosed in the criminal cases against Drexel and other leading Wall Street figures. Much of the earlier findings had been sealed because of settlements reached on those cases.
The Government's theory is that Drexel's phenomenal success throughout the last decade until its collapse earlier this year was attributable largely to its ability to tap into enormous pools of federally insured money held at scores of savings and loan associations.
"Drexel and its co-conspirators sought to create an illusion of value in junk bonds," the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation said in their court papers. "They set out to convince the investing public that junk bonds could be bought and sold in a liquid trading market and that the focus on junk bonds should not be the high risk but rather the 'high yield.' In fact, the 'yield' was often infinitesimal or nonexistent because the securities turned out to b worthless."
 
Bribe Charge at Centrust
 In one instance, according to the Government, Drexel raised $262 million for Centrust Savings of Miami and sold it $1 billion worth of unrated private placements at the same time that it was selling highly profitable warrants underwritten by Drexel to the institution's chief executive, David L. Paul, in effect bribing him for the business that he provided.
The Government also charges that Centrust secretly held stock owned by Drexel to avoid regulatory requirements, a crime known as stock parking. The institution was seized earlier this year by the Government, and its bailout is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 billion.
In another case, the Government contends that Drexel manipulated the price of securities to permit the Gibraltar Savings Association, to which it had sold many junk bonds, to conceal the actual losses in its portfolio. Gibraltar's chief executive, Herbert Young, received warrants of a Drexel-underwritten security to enable him to make a $100,000 profit three weeks later, the Government charges. Gibraltar ultimately suffered a $44 million loss from its sale of Drexel bonds.
 
Keating Named in Lincoln Case
 At a third institution, the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, regulators said that Drexel provided kickbacks to Charles H. Keating Jr. and helped him carry out several fraudulent schemes so that Lincoln would both invest heavily in junk bonds and use Drexel as an underwriter.
The decision by the Federal regulators to pursue claims of more than $11 billion against Drexel in effect makes the bankruptcy proceeding an unusual forum in which the Government and Drexel's other creditors will explore the contributions of both the investment house and the regulators into the failures of the savings and loan industry.
Altogether, regulators are seeking $6.8 billion on behalf of 48 institutions that failed and fell into Government hands, along with $4.5 billion from Columbia Savings and Loan, which the Government may seize if Columbia is unable to turn around its unprofitable track record.
Late yesterday evening, the Federal bankruptcy judge overseeing the case delivered a setback to the Government's attempts to expand its Drexel proceeding to other savings institutions not mentioned in its court papers. The judge, Francis Conrad, refused to extend Thursday's deadline for filing new claims, arguing that the regulators had "dragged on long enough" with their investigations.
Among the institutions that the Government's lawyers told the judge they had hoped to include were the Empire Savings Bank of Buffalo and the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association, the Denver institution where President Bush's son, Neil, sat as a director.
 
View of Drexel Spokesman
 A spokesman for Drexel, Steven S. Anreder, suggested that one motive for the high dollar amount of the claims was that the Government's local counsel in the case, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, is receiving its fee partially based on the amount of money it recovers.
"Regardless of the numbers of zeroes and the claims of the Government, which has a contingency fee arrangement with its lawyers, Drexel intends to vigorously defend against them in the bankruptcy proceeding," Mr. Anreder said.
The Government's lead lawyer in the case is Thomas D. Barr, a senior partner at Cravath who became well known in legal circles for his successful defense in the Government's antitrust case against the International Business Machines Corporation.
More recently, Mr. Barr represented Chemical Bank, the trustees for the bondholders in the enormous and complex legal proceedings of the Washington Public Power Supply System. He was also the chief lawyer for Time magazine when it successfully defended itself against a libel suit brought by Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli Defense Minister.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
SOVIET AIDE URGES DELAY OF U.N. MOVE ON FORCE IN GULF

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Soviet Union's chief Middle East negotiator called today for a delay in introduction of a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq to give time for a final negotiating effort that would give President Saddam Hussein a "face-saving" reason to give up Kuwait peacefully.
But the official, Yevgeny M. Primakov, who has served as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's special envoy in the Persian Gulf crisis, said in an interview at the Hotel Inter-Continental in New York that if such an initiative fails, not only should a Security Council resolution authorizing force be approved, but military action should also be taken almost immediately against Iraq. 
 He said that while a negotiating initiative was under way, the United Nations Security Council should not be rushed into approving new resolutions authorizing the use of military force against Iraq.
 
U.S. Opposes Negotiations
 The United States, which holds the Council's rotating presidency this month, would like to secure such a resolution by the end of November, although it does not appear likely that military action would be taken, if at all, before next year. The United States has also opposed negotiations with Mr. Hussein.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived in Brussels tonight for talks on a resolution. [Page A12.]
The Soviet diplomat said he expected these Soviet ideas to come up in talks this weekend in Paris between Mr. Baker and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, and also between President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, who will take part in the meeting of leaders of the 34 nations in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which begins on Monday.
 
Award for Soviet Official
 Mr. Primakov was in New York to receive the Citizen Exchange Council's George P. Kennan Award for promoting better Soviet-American relations.
If the Security Council decides the current economic sanctions against Iraq have failed and no negotiated solution is achieved, he said that a resolution authorizing force should be adopted, followed by an immediate attack on Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
"We should use up all possibilities for a political solution before force," Mr. Primakov said, speaking in English with occasional help from an interpreter. But he added: "If there is to be a Security Council resolution on military force, then you should act immediately. If you adopt it without action you send the wrong signal. I'm not for bluffing with dangerous things."
Bush Administration officials in Washington said that Mr. Primakov's comments were familiar to them and that they did not believe he was speaking for either Mr. Gorbachev or Mr. Shevardnadze.
 
No Reward, U.S. Says
 "Our position has always been one that Saddam Hussein cannot be rewarded for his aggression," one official said. "This is something that Primakov himself has been told. Secretary Baker had an extremely good round of discussions with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze on this subject in his recent meeting and we expect the President will likewise have a very good discussion with President Gorbachev in France."
Mr. Primakov said the five countries with permanent Security Council seats -- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union -- should join with the Arab League countries to send an envoy to Baghdad to present President Hussein with what he called "a face-saving package."
Such a package, he went on, would "draw together" all the ideas that have been suggested for linking a resolution of the gulf crisis with an overall Middle East settlement which would include a resolution of the Palestinian problem.
 
'Face-Saving Package'
 "We should gather up all the things that have been said in the United Nations and the Arab League about negotiating Iraq's dispute with Kuwait and settling the Palestinian problem and give them to him in one big face-saving package," he said.
Mr. Primakov, who made two trips to Baghdad on Mr. Gorbachev's behalf last month, insisted that Iraq must withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait, as the Security Council demands, and that Mr. Hussein should not be allowed to reap any tangible rewards from his invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
But he said President Hussein might still be persuaded to give up Kuwait peacefully if the permanent Security Council members and Arab League countries can convince him this will lead to withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf, a resolution of the Palestinian problem and the establishment of a new security structure designed to stabilize the whole region, guaranteeing the safety of both Israel and its Arab neighbors.
 
European Security Talks
 Mr. Primakov said the idea of a new, and perhaps final, attempt to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the crisis is likely to be raised in Paris on the sidelines of the meeting of the 34 members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe next week.
This meeting will bring together the heads of state or government of four of the five permanent Security Council members, though not of China.
Western diplomats who had questions about Mr. Primakov's statements recalled that after Mr Primakov's second visit to Baghdad, which ended Oct. 28, President Gorbachev said his envoy had detected signs that "Iraq's leadership might at last heed the voice of the United Nations."
But later official pronouncements from Baghdad suggested otherwise.
 
New Mideast Effort
 President Bush, President Francois Mitterrand of France and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain all said in addresses to the General Assembly this year that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait should lead to a new effort to resolve the whole Middle East question, including an agreement on Israel's boundaries, suggesting that President Hussein has a chance to present a withdrawal from Kuwait as a move that opened the door to a national homeland for Palestinians.
President Hussein has also hinted that he might be prepared to surrender Kuwait in return for the withdrawal of foreign forces from the gulf and settlement to the Palestinian and other Middle East issues.
Western diplomats say they are concerned that the Soviet Union wants to forge an unrealistically close link between the crisis in the gulf and the Palestinian problem.
 
A Shift Is Noted
 Mr. Primakov admitted that there has been little sign so far that the Iraqi leader is preparing to cooperate with the Security Council demand to withdraw from Kuwait. But he said he had seen "an evolution of his position" between his two visits to Baghdad.
During his first visit on Oct. 5, Mr. Primakov said the Iraqi leader spent much of their time together arguing his claim that Kuwait is an integral part of Iraq that was artificially separated from it by Britain in colonial days.
But when he returned to Baghdad on Oct. 28, Mr. Hussein no longer appeared interested in defending the takeover. Instead, he wondered how the Security Council could guarantee a resolution of the Palestinian issue if he gave up Kuwait. He also worried about his personal safety, recalling several plots against him after he agreedto a cease-fire with Iran two years ago. And he asked for guarantees that Iraq would not be attacked.

HEADLINE: C'est le Bronx? Ou Sont les Maisons Abandonnes?

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
It didn't rate three abandoned cars in the Guide Michelin, but a new chapter in Bronx tourism history may have been opened yesterday, when a busload of French architects rolled up the Grand Concourse to survey monuments to the borough's rebirth.
Bronx tours have been big at least since 1977, when President Jimmy Carter stopped on a rubble-strewn lot on Charlotte Street, decried the blight and promised the renewal that has followed in fits and starts. But that was what the Bronx-born tour guide, a real-estate developer named Jeffrey F. Silber, was worried about. 
 "They'll definitely feel cheated if they don't feel squalor," he said.
As he paced the foyer of the Bronx Museum of the Arts yesterday morning, waiting and waiting for the 40 architects and urban planners from L'Ecole d'Architecture de Grenoble, Mr. Silber drew his lower lip nervously over his greying, Chaplinesque mustache. He seemed to be perspiring. Bronx tours probably were easier, he said, in the days of burning trash cans, burning cars and burning buildings.
"Real battlefront action," he said.
It was, anyway, the Bronx for which the French had prepared. Over a week of visits to skyscrapers, museums and fancy architectural firms, almost all in Manhattan, many of them had caught glimpses of what they took to be demimonde: a service at a Baptist church in Harlem, a night at a sleazy Chelsea disco, a subway shuttle between Times Square and Grand Central Station.
"Le Bronx," coughed one woman from inside a thick jacket of fake fur. "There were no references to its architecture."
But in "Le Guide du Routard," a French-language backpacker's guide to America, there was a paragraph entitled "Le Bronx." It began: "Symbol of the most extreme poverty, contains nonetheless one of the biggest zoos in the world."
 
More Art Deco than Miami
 "We know of the Bronx from the movies -- the police movies," said Francois Bregnac, an architect who dragged on his cigarettes like a detective in one of them.
Mr. Silber began his slide show. Ghostly skeletons of burned-out apartment buildings flashed on the screen. Then the images changed.
"The Bronx is very green," he intoned over bright photographs.
"Vert?!" exclaimed several, in apparent disbelief.
John F. Kennedy once lived in the Bronx (in Riverdale), Mr. Silber said, having obviously hit on a crowd favorite. "Not a lot of people know that." And there are more Art Deco buildings than in Miami, he said. And forget about landscape in Brooklyn, he advised: "Flat as a crepe."
"Flat as a grape?" several in the back pondered aloud.
Finally the huge red bus lumbered north up the Concourse. Mr. Silber asked if it looked anything like the Champs-Elysees.
"It looks like Moscow," said Jean Luc Cornet, Grenoble's city planner.
The bus lurched to a halt at 180th Street in the University Heights section. Prefabricated houses were rising everywhere. The French descended in a cloud of pink cheeks, blue jeans and black leather.
Inside a red-brick two-family unit, debate over insulation ensued.
"I believe the lack of phonic isolation from one apartment to another is a source of the social problems among neighbors," said Odile Goddard, "particularly among the lower classes, which don't have sufficient culture." (She meant that prefabs were noisy.)
It was not until lunch at a Dominican restaurant on Kingsbridge Road, "El Rey del Bistec," -- "the King of Beefsteak" -- that Mr. Silber seemed to win over his charges entirely.
 
Winner: Le Roi de Bifteck
 "It's better than a hamburger," Sophie Garrel, a real-estate agent, said, chomping on a plantain chip.
But then lunch ended, and a new tour bus did not arrive. Mr. Silber finally concluded that this was no problem. "Gypsy cabs," he said.
"What do these cabs look like?" a woman asked. Battered four-door vehicles began circling the crowd. The woman looked nervous.
But 10 cabs were found, and only one had an accident on the two-mile trip to the Bronx office of the City Planning Department. And there, one of the borough's urban designers was waiting with a surprise that seemed to calm all of their nerves.
His name was Yves Trillon. And he was French.

HEADLINE: Drastic Measures Urged to Ease Two Budget Gaps;
Florio Tells Agencies 8% Cuts Are Needed This Year, Not Next

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Nov. 15

 BODY:
With his fiscal advisers preparing a report that shows the New Jersey economy worsening rapidly, Gov. Jim Florio said today that he had told his commissioners to start cutting their agencies' budgets by up to 8 percent.
Mr. Florio had previously ordered budget reductions of 8 percent in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. But today -- joining a chorus of budget-cutting by state and local governments throughout the region -- the Governor said he had told his commissioners to speed up that process. 
 The cuts are needed now, he said, to help close a growing budget gap that some officials expect will exceed $350 million by the end of the current fiscal year.
The shape and the depth of this year's cuts remain uncertain. But Mr. Florio said that some of the state's more than 80,000 employees might be laid off.
 
Not Getting Their Money's Worth
 "We need to start saving money right away, and not just be talking about it," the Governor told about 200 delegates to the 75th annual convention of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities.
Mr. Florio said there was more than an economic downturn behind his call for government cuts. He said voters in the Nov. 6 elections were sending a message "to me and, I suspect to other people, that they don't think they're getting their money's worth for their tax dollar."
Mr. Florio said the public was right and that he had ordered a study to see if some of the state's 19 departments can be combined to produce staff cuts and program economies. And, he added, additional cuts will be announced in the coming days.
Although the entire state budget totals about $12 billion, roughly two-thirds of that money is state aid and is therefore untouchable. The Governor is hoping that the 8 percent agency cuts will save more than $100 million from the remaining third during the current year and more than $300 million next year.
 
Cuts in New York and Connecticut
 By comparison, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York has asked his agencies to cut up to 7 percent from their budgets, and Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York City, has ordered most of his commissioners to cut 4 percent; some must cut only half that. Connecticut's Governor-elect, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., will have to deal with a shortfall that has been estimated at nearly a third of the state's $7.1 billion budget.
The 13,000 elected and appointed government officials who came to this gaming and ocean resort for their annual four-day convention often talked more about the recent election and the role Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax program played in the balloting, than they did the housing, environment and planning problems they were here to discuss.
The increased taxes, which are to be used for state aid to public schools and to provide property tax relief, helped raise voter disenchantment with government and inspired a protest at the polls that nearly upset the re-election of some incumbents, including Senator Bill Bradley.
After the election, Mr. Florio said his failure to build a consensus for his program before pushing it through the State Legislature was responsible for much of the voter resentment.
His speech today drew little reaction from the audience, except for some laughter when he said, "I'm well aware that people feel I sometimes moved too fast without listening to others."
 
No Vote, Just a Door in the Face
 There was no laughter on Wednesday, however, when Linda D. Stender, the council president in Fanwood and a Democrat, confronted the Assembly Speaker, Joseph V. Doria, Democrat of Bayonne, to complain that the party's state leadership did not do enough to help her and other Democratic candidates in local races.
Mrs. Stender said she and her running mate both lost, despite Fanwood's having the lowest municipal tax increase in Union County last year.
"People were slamming the door in my face," she said, "And one person said, 'I'm not voting for any Democrat this year after what your Governor did to this state.'
"I'm part of the Florio backlash," Mrs. Stender said. "I'm one of the messengers."
In his remarks today, Mr. Florio said reductions in state spending would have to be matched by similar cuts on the local level.
 
'Much More to Do'
 He said property taxes had more than doubled in the last decade and suggested that towns regionalize services wherever possible. He said some already shared police and fire communications services, libraries, recycling programs and health inspections.
"But there's much more to do," Mr. Florio said. "We still have 481 local police departments and 588 school districts, more school districts than Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware combined."
The Governor called the rise in property taxes "intolerable," and said, "It destroys communities and drives people out of the neighborhoods that they helped to build."
Some of those officials who listened to his speech said it struck the right tone in times of financial problems, but offered little in the way of real help for hard-pressed cities.
Mayor Robert H. Grasmere of Maplewood, a Republican and a past president of the league, said: "Consolidation certainly makes sense, but it by no means will solve the problems of municipal finances. We need greater support from the state."
Earlier today a dozen of the state's urban mayors met to discuss ways to make the public aware of the increased school aid and property tax relief included in Mr. Florio's program. They said those parts of the package have been overlooked in the talk of repealing the increases won by Mr. Florio in both the state sales and income taxes.
"We have to make sure we don't lose the increased aid," said Mayor Robert Menendez of Union City, who is also a State Assemblyman. "If we do, some municipalities could go belly up, and we can't allow that."

HEADLINE: New York's Transit Facing Grim Steps in Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Officials of the New York City Transit Authority said yesterday that to close a $272 million deficit for 1991, they could be forced to take such drastic steps as raising the fare again, eliminating all subway and bus service in early-morning hours or closing some stations and token booths.
The officials said that while they planned to offset about $170 million of the deficit through other cuts, they were still scrambling to come up with the remaining $102 million. Without additional state subsidies, which seem unlikely, the officials said they would have to take Draconian measures. 
 The figures, which represent the grimmest estimate yet of the Transit Authority's deteriorating fiscal health, were released yesterday as part of the agency's budget for the fiscal year starting Jan. 1. Transit officials presented the budget to the finance committee of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Transit Authority's parent agency.
 
A Decline in Riders
 The development comes as a weakening regional economy has already forced the authority and the metropolitan area's commuter railroads to cut service or consider doing so. The authority has also been hurt by declining ridership and rampant fare-beating.
To achieve $170 million in cuts, transit officials said they planned to reduce subway and bus service during evenings and weekends, eliminate 1,406 jobs through attrition and retraining, limit overtime, continue a hiring freeze and adopt a variety of operating efficiencies.
To meet the remaining $102 million, the officials said they had offered three options to the M.T.A. board: a fare increase, higher state subsidies or drastic cuts in service and maintenance. The board is expected to decide by the end of December what action the Transit Authority will take.
"I would rather not implement many of these more Draconian measures," said Alan F. Kiepper, the Transit Authority's president, "but these are very tough times, and you sometimes have to do things that you don't want to do."
 
4 Hours Without Service?
 Perhaps the most alarming of the options is eliminating subway and bus service between 1 and 5 A.M. -- a proposal that mass-transit advocates said was intended mainly to get the attention of legislators in Albany.
Beverly Dolinsky, a spokeswoman for the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a consumer transit advocacy group, said: "New York is a 24-hour city. It's just not cost-effective to close the trains late at night. What are you going to do for the people who have to get around at night?"
She said the Transit Authority was using the threat of cutting early-morning train service to get the state government to consider supplementing its subsidies.
Joseph Rappaport, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, another advocacy group, said: "Their proposal to close the system at night is idiotic and would lose them money rather than save it. It shows just how divorced from reality they are."
 
'Logistical Nightmare' Projected
 Mr. Rappaport said closing the subway system during the early morning would be a "logistical nightmare" for the agency, because subway stations would have to be secured, new yards would have to be built to park all the trains and elaborate new work schedules would have to be devised to accommodate the new hours.
Still, some transit officials said that discontinuing early-morning subway and bus service was a feasible option, because only 39,000 riders, or fewer than 2 percent of the daily total, use the system from 1 to 5 A.M. The Transit Authority projected that it would save about $11.2 million in 1991 by discontinuing subway and bus service during these hours.
Other possible actions to close the budget gap, authority officials told the M.T.A. yesterday, are trimming training and programs for the overhauling of buses, the painting of stations and the cleaning of vehicles and stations.
In addition transit officials told the board that more could be saved by closing 10 stations permanently and 25 at night, closing the Transit Museum, reducing the number of subway maps distributed to the public by half and eliminating the station-manager program, which puts trouble-shooters at the stations.
 
A Matter of Options
 "The board asked for options, and we gave them a host from which to choose," said Jared Lebow, a Transit Authority spokesman. "Some are more palatable than others."
Mr. Kiepper, the Transit Authority's president, said that while the agency was citing reductions in bus maintenance as an option, he did not recommend such a move. It would "be a setback to the system," he said, "and is the sort of cutback that got the system in trouble during the 1960's and 1970's."
In their presentation to the M.T.A. board, transit officials said a fare increase could also be used to offset some of the $102 million budget gap. A 10-cent fare rise, they noted, would produce about $10 million a month in additional revenues.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Still No Clear Signal on Fed Policy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market participants who sought an unambiguous signal that the Federal Reserve Board had eased monetary policy were disappointed again yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities dipped slightly and interest rates inched higher.
The Fed has been a primary focus of the fixed-income market since Tuesday, when the central bank's policy-making Open Market Committee held a meeting in Washington. 
 Many analysts said that to combat the apparent weakness in the economy the committee probably moved to lower its target for the Federal funds rate, the rate the central bank most closely controls and uses to signal a change in its interest-rate policy.
 
 More Reserves Are Added
 Yesterday, for the second day in a row, the Fed added reserves to the banking system, a move that under other circumstances might be seen as a clear indication that it wished the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans, to move lower.
As on Wednesday, however, the Federal funds rate was trading above the 7 3/4 percent level, which is widely seen as the Fed's target. At the time the Fed entered the market yesterday, Federal funds were trading at 7 7/8 percent.
"I don't think the Fed eased," said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyd's Bank. "If they had wanted to signal an easing, they would have done it unambiguously. The fact that funds traded firmly all day suggests that they didn't ease."
The Federal funds rate, which traded as high as 8 1/8 percent yesterday, never moved below the 7 7/8 percent level.
 
 Waiting on Consumer Prices
 Mr. Chandross and others said the Fed might be waiting until the consumer price report for October was released by the Government this morning.
"A bad consumer price report, one which showed that the index rose by half a percentage point or more excluding food and energy, would make it tough for the Fed to ease immediately," he said. "But if the C.P.I. is respectable, they will feel much more comfortable to make the move."
And Jeffrey Leeds, chief economist at Chemical Bank, said, "I would think we will get a conclusive signal from the Fed on Friday or early next week."
Although prices of Treasury securities dipped yesterday, most dealers said the declines reflected concern over today's inflation report rather than disappointment with the Fed.
 
 30-Year Bonds Drop
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 102 3/8, down 6/32, to yield 8.52 percent, compared with 8.50 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 7/8, down 3/32, to yield 8.36 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9/32, down 2/32, to yield 7.58 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly. By late in the day, three-month Treasury bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.08 percent, up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. And six-month bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.04 percent.
At yesterday's auction of $11.8 billion worth of one-year Treasury bills, bids on the securities produced an average discount rate of 6.81 percent, down from an average rate of 7.01 percent at the last one-year bill auction, on Oct. 26. It is the lowest rate on a one-year bill since the May 5, 1988, auction.
 
 Strong Gains for 'Junk Bonds'
 In other markets, prices of high-yield "junk bonds" posted strong gains yesterday, with most high-yield issues rising by about 2 points.
"A combination of continued buying by collateralized bond obligations and some equity infusions that are being proposed for some issues are helping the market," said Robert Long, head of high-yield research at the First Boston Corporation. "So too is a fundamental realization that the pessimism that drove the market down was probably overdone."
Among the positive developments yesterday was a disclosure by Fort Howard Paper that it was seeking an infusion of $250 million and had more than half of the total already in hand. The news helped to push up prices of its outstanding issues by as much as 10 points.
Market participants said the rise in junk-bond prices had little or nothing to do with the $6.8 billion suit filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
 
 'No New News Here'
 The Federal regulators asserted that more than 40 failed savings and loan associations had lost as much as $2 billion because of Drexel's manipulation of the junk-bond market.
"There is no new news here," said Mariel Clemenson, director of high-yield research at Citicorp Investment Bank. "If anything, it shows that some of the product created in the late 1980's is of dubious quality. But we have so many other problems to worry about that it is basically immaterial to the market."
Along with other securities, junk bonds have taken a pounding since the onset of the Persian Gulf crisis. The rally has helped, but, as Ms. Clemenson suggested, prices in the high-yield market remain very depressed.
As of late yesterday, an index of the most actively traded high-yield issues, compiled by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, showed the securities were yielding 20.58 percent. That level is an improvement from Oct. 31, when the index was at 21.30 percent. But it is still far above the 15.36 percent level recorded on Aug. 2, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait.
 
 Flood of Corporate New Issues
 Elsewhere, in the investment-grade corporate bond market, the flood of new issues continued yesterday, as six more companies priced debt offerings.
Among the issuers was the Unocal Corporation, which offered $250 million of 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9.75 percent notes were priced at $99.56 to yield 9.82 percent, 1.45 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8.50 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Separately, late yesterday the Federal Reserve Board reported that the two largest measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended Nov. 5. But M1, the nation's basic money supply, rose by $2.4 billion during the period.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Bush Says Recession Is Possible

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
President Bush conceded for the first time tonight that the country might face a recession, but he said his economic advisers did not believe a long and severe one was in the offing.
In an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network, the President said, "Most seem to feel that if we have a recession, it will not be deep and that we'll come out of it relatively soon, six months at most, and I'd like to think that is true." 
 Most economists are saying that the economy, if not in a recession now, is on the verge of one.
Mr. Bush seemed determined to present an optimistic view. "I'd like to be a little reassuring on this economy," he said. "I am concerned about the slowdown. I worry about anybody that wants a job and doesn't have one. But I am not a gloom and doom person on where the American economy will be before long. And yet I don't want to mislead you, because I am concerned that we're in a downturn here."
 
 Keeping 1992 in Mind
 If the President and his advisers hav made any important decisions on economic policy, they are not letting on, either in meetings or in interviews.
The weakness of the economy is now a clear political debit for the President and is one factor that led to his recent decline in popularity. His political advisers say that if the President is seen as holding a firm grip on economic policy and if the economy regains strength next year, he will be well positioned for his re-election race in 1992.
The CNN interview came after the President heard a gloomy assessment of the economy this morning from a group of business executives. It was the most recent of a series of meetings that the White House said was meant to help him plan economic policy for the next year.
Mr. Bush said on the broadcast that one executive told him, "It doesn't hurt to shake things out."
"Sometimes," the President said, "you have to pay for excesses, and we had a kind of go-go lending policy in some of our financial institutions."
But when Mr. Bush was asked whether he blamed the excesses on the Reagan Administration, he said he did not.
If Mr. Bush wanted a forthright appraisal of the state of the economy, he apparently got it from the executives this morning.
John G. Medlin Jr., chairman of the First Wachovia Corporation, a bank holding company in North Carolina, said in an interview he had told Mr. Bush that the economy seemed to be "tilting toward a modest downturn."
 
 Input from Different Regions
 Compared with the other nine executives at the meeting, Mr. Medlin said, "I was probably on the optimistic side."
This was the third meeting on the economy Mr. Bush has called in less than a week during an interlude between the November elections and his weeklong trip beginning Friday evening to Europe, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. A fourth meeting with 10 more executives is scheduled for Friday morning.
"The idea is for Bush to get input on the economy from different regions of the country and different components of the economic system -- bankers, industrialists and so on," a White House official said.
On the condition that they not be identified, some Administration economists said they believed the country might already be in a recession but they did not expect it to be a deep or especially long one. These economists said they did not know if the President shared their view.
At his news conference on Nov. 8, Mr. Bush said he was "concerned about an economic slowdown."
 
 Not on the Schedule
 The President went on to say, "I want to be sure that, to the degree a President can do something to soften the blow or to stimulate economic growth, that he tries to do it."
Mr. Bush said at the time that he planned to call in outsiders for advice.
Today's meeting was not on the President's official schedule, and the White House refused to release a list of those who attended. One person who was there in addition to Mr. Medlin, George H. Weyerhaeuser, chairman of the Wayerhaeuser Corporation, could not be reached afterward.
Administration officials at the session included Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and John H. Sununu, the President's chief of staff.
Mr. Medlin said that neither the President nor his advisers had spoken out at the meeting. "He didn't tell us anything," Mr. Medlin said. "He went around the room, and it was sincerely a meeting where he wanted to hear the views of a variety of people about the present state of and the outlook for the economy."
 
 An Internal Split
 The meeting, around a conference table in the Roosevelt Room, lasted an hour and 40 minutes, which was 40 minutes longer than planned, the White House said.
Last weekend, Mr. Bush met at Camp David with his economic advisers, and Wednesday he met with the Government's top banking regulators.
Officials said the Wednesday meeting was called because Mr. Bush wanted to hear both sides of a disagreement that has developed within the Administration over the extent to which banking regulations have led to tight credit.
Mr. Sununu and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher were said to take the position that the regulators have become overly zealous and are hurting the economy in general and small businesses in particular by making banks reluctant to make loans.
But Mr. Brady and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, are said to argue that market forces are the main reason that credit is less available now than in the past.
 
 No Quick Decision Expected
 "Given the savings and loan debacle and the overbuilding in many parts of the country, it's not surprising that banks are being more careful, especially in the real estate area," an Administration economist said, reflecting the Brady and Boskin views.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has agreed with the Brady and Boskin position in public testimony and presumably in private meetings with the President. But Mr. Bush has not divulged where he stands on the matter.
Administration officials said that with the President abroad next week, firm decisions on economic policy would probably not be made until next month and might not be announced until his State of the Union Message and budget presentation in January.
Other Presidents, when the economy turned sour, have looked to tax cuts or job programs to hasten recovery. But the budget deficit, which is expected to approach $300 billion in this fiscal year even without a recession, gives this Administration little leeway.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
The Gulf Crisis: Its Effect on U.S.

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WHAT will be the impact on the American economy of the Persian Gulf crisis? The first problem economists face in trying to answer that is what assumptions to make about how the conflict with Iraq will play out, and what effect different results will have on the price of oil.
Soon after Iraq invaded Kuwait, economists at the World Bank spelled out four possibilities: rapid return to normalcy, short-term uncertainty, prolonged uncertainty and war. The first might now be relabeled successful Bush threat/ rapid Hussein retreat. President Bush's plan to double American forces in the gulf to about 500,000 is regarded as a threat aimed at scaring Mr. Hussein out, although the threat would not be credible if it did not include the possibility of war. 
 Many military experts see little likelihood that the Iraqi President can be bluffed out of Kuwait. But if the threat worked, the effect on the oil price might be about what the World Bank's first possibility, rapid return to normalcy, predicted: that the price would come down fast and average $17 to $18 a barrel through 1991 and 1992, not much above the $16.40 average in the first half of this year.
The World Bank's short-term uncertainty model, which assumed no resolution of the crisis for a year to 18 months, forecast an average oil price of $31 to $32 a barrel in the second half of 1990. That prediction now looks reasonable. On Wednesday, the price tumbled to $31.16 a barrel, within the projected World Bank range, and yesterday slipped a bit more, to $31.12. For next year, that model predicts an average price of $29, coming down to $25 to $26 in 1992.
The long-term uncertainty option, which assumes that the crisis in the gulf will last several years, predicts that crude oil will average $29 a barrel for five years. But in real terms, the bank predicts, oil prices will decline steadily as a result of gradual increases in world supply and a slowdown in the growth of world demand.
The fourth World Bank option, war, assumes that the destruction of Iraqi, Kuwaiti and Saudi oilfields will remove as much as 10 million barrels a day from supply and drive the price to $65. Other experts put this figure down as an optimistic guess. After the war ends, says the World Bank script, oil prices will come down to $30 to $40 and stay there for about five years.
More hawkish strategists argue, however, that as costly as war would be, the alternative of letting Iraq establish itself as the hegemon of the Middle East and master of the oil cartel would be even costlier for the West. It would mean, they say, not only a much higher price of oil but living with, or dying with, a ruthless enemy possessing nuclear as well as chemical and biological weapons.
Other economists have other scripts. Adam E.Sieminski of the Washington Analysis Corporation lays out four:
*United States out/Iraqi hegemony: probability now, 10 percent; probability in 1991, 5 percent; oil price, $30 a barrel, 1990 through 1992.
*Hussein out/Saudi dominance: probability now, 25 percent; probability in 1991, 20 percent; oil price, $18 to $20 a barrel in 1990-91; $21 in 1992.
*Continuing stalemate: probability now, 40 percent, probability in 1991, 20 percent; oil price, $25 to $40 in 1990-91; $25, 1991-92.
*United Nations negotiated settlement: probability now, 25 percent; probability in 1991, 35 percent; oil price $22 to $24 in 1990-91; $23 in 1991-92.
The weighted average of those options is $23 to $30 a barrel for 1990-91 and $23 for 1991-92. The implication is that the oil shock this time will not have as severe an impact on the United States and world economy as did the two oil shocks of the 1970's. But this calculation does not include the effect on oil and the world economy of a protracted war.
If there is no war, the retreat of the oil price may help offset recessionary forces in the economy. Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, predicts that a rally in the bond market will be set off "either by a resolution of the Mideast crisis or a recognition by the markets that the bond risks are far less today than during the two earlier periods of oil price increases in 1973-74 and in 1978-79."
The actual increase in oil prices this time, he notes, has been only a fraction of the spikes in prices in the earlier oil shocks. The ratio of energy used per dollar of gross national product has fallen throughout the industrial world. American industry is now more experienced at substituting other energy sources, especially natural gas, for oil, the main economic weapon of Middle East aggressors.
In helping to arrest inflation and cut interest rates, declining oil prices would ease the painful readjustment the American economy must now undergo after the scandalous excesses of the 1980's.

HEADLINE: Prediction by Moody's: More Pain for Wall St.

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Moody's expects Wall Street in the 1990's to be marked by "rapacious competition" that will lead to greater consolidation of the industry, the bond rating agency said in a report yesterday.
As a result, the report said, a number of firms that are not prepared for the global competition of the next decade are likely to be driven into mergers, undergo big realignments or fail. 
 The changes will bring with them a good deal of pain, the report said. Through much of the early 1990's, Moody's Investor Service expects the large securities firms to continue to cut back on staff even more than they have to date, and to drop numerous business lines.
 
 Survivors to Be Strong
 "Ultimately, there may be few, if any, large independent securities firms," said John J. Kriz, the author of the report and a vice president at Moody's. "But by and large, these companies will be innovative, market-oriented firms with well-developed skill bases."
Despite all this upheaval, Moody's expects the Wall Street firms, which are generally well-rated, to be able to maintain their current bond ratings for the next three to five years, primarily because the changes will make the firms healthier institutions.
The Moody's report is one of the strongest signs to date that the Wall Street of the 1990's will be vastly different from that of previous decades. Because of the influence it bears on the cost of financings for firms, the Moody's report carries greater weight than some other outside analyses, primarily because a downgrading by the service can create large uncertainties in the marketplace about a firm's possibility for survival.
Indeed, the threats of potential downgrades by Moody's were one of the largest forces behind the purchase of Shearson Lehman Brothers by the American Express Company earlier this year, as well as this week's decision by executives at Credit Suisse to assume control of CS First Boston by injecting $300 million into the international securities firm.
 
 Detail on Businesses
 The Moody's report provides great detail about the businesses the rating agency expects to be the most profitable for the securities industry in the 1990's, including workouts for troubled transactions and asset management.
But it also raises some important red flags about potential credit risks at holding companies for securities firms, as Washington moves toward efforts to regulate such bodies more closely. In addition, Moody's expressed some concern that management at Wall Street firms might enter into risky transactions in desperate efforts to earn money and delay the huge restructurings that are necessary.
The problems on Wall Street are laid out starkly in the report. The cost of overhead, such as staff compensation and real estate, has quadrupled for securities firms since 1980, after roughly doubling before the 1987 market crash. That expense put pressure on the firms, with pre-tax earnings in 1989 slightly lower than in 1989.

Chapter 11 Filing By a Van Maker

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SOUTH BEND, Ind., Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Starcraft Corporation, a maker of recreational vehicles, filed for protection from creditors in Federal Bankruptcy Court, blaming high gasoline prices, the threat of war in the Middle East and a weakening economy. The company's chairman, J. Michael Bell, said he expected Starcraft and its units would pay off their debts and emerge from court-directed reorganization "in a healthy condition."
Van conversions, an important part of Starcraft's business, shrank at least 30 percent in September, a month after Iraq invaded Kuwait and gasoline prices began rising, according to the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation, the largest suppliers of van chassis to the conversion industry. Last month, Starcraft laid off 30 employees at its offices. The company employs about 400 people in Goshen, Ind., and about 300 in Topeka, Ind.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Murdoch Plans to Sell $1 Billion in News Assets

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
After cutting costs by consolidating his Sky Television with British Satellite Broadcasting, Rupert Murdoch said this week that the News Corporation, which he controls, wanted to go a step further and sell roughly $1 billion in assets over the next three years.
Mr. Murdoch said he would sell the assets if bankers agree to defer interest payments on much of the company's bank debt, which now stands at $8.1 billion (American), or $10.3 billion (Australian). 
 He refused to specify what assets would be sold, but one high-level publishing executive at the company's United States operations said the word was that none of the American properties -- magazines, television stations, a television network, newspapers and movie businesses -- would be put on the market. But the executive added, "Murdoch will do what needs to be done."
A spokesman for the company confirmed that Mr. Murdoch did leave open the possibility of selling the company's 50 percent stake in Ansett Airlines, the Australian domestic carrier.
 
 Earnings Advance
 The News Corporation also said yesterday that net income rose almost 54 percent to $44.1 million, or 34 cents for each American depository receipt, from $28.7 million, or 23 cents, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Revenues jumped 49 percent, to $2.24 billion, from $1.5 billion a year earlier. But income before extraordinary items fell 27 percent, to $20.9 million, from $28.7 million for the period last year.
The price of the A.D.R.'s fell 12.5 cents each yesterday, to $8.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.
A spokesman for the company said that the extraordinary items included the sale of several regional newspapers in Victoria, Australia.
The News Corporation added that profits in the United States rose to $212.7 million, from $126.3 million. It said the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation made a good start for the year and that Fox Broadcasting continued to be encouraging, although the company did not break out any figures.
On its properties in Britain, the company reported a loss of $16.9 million, compared with a gain of $50.8 million a year earlier. It attributed the loss to start up costs associated with Sky Television and said that without those costs, profits would have been up 71 percent. The company said that as a result of the merger with British Satellite Television, it expected to return to profitability for the balance of this year.
The company said its newspapers in Britain were operating in a difficult economic environment but were maintaining market share. Recent cover price increases for both The Sun and The News of the World will improve newspaper profits for the balance of the year.
Profits in Australia and the Pacific Basin dropped marginally to $73.7 million. The company said the results for newspapers, magazines and commercial printing were less than 3 percent below the prior period.
 For the quarter, the company's interest expense rose to $304.7 million, from $236.1 million in the quarter last year. The company attributed the increase in interest expense to the acquisition of the HarperCollins Book Publishing Group, which became a wholly owned subsidiary in June.
A company spokesman said Mr. Murdoch was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
John Reidy, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said the surprise was that there was a loss in Britain. "We had expected a profit despite start up costs because the U.K. newspapers are still generating substantial profits," he said.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Plunges

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 15

 BODY:
Consumer confidence had the sharpest three-month decline posted in 44 years as fears about the economy mounted, a University of Michigan study showed today.
Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's consumer survey group, said the university's index of consumer sentiment plummeted 24.3 points, to 63.9 percent, between July and October. In October alone, the monthly survey fell 30 points from year-earlier levels. The index is a percentage measured against the consumer sentiment level of 100 established in February 1966.
The university's index, which is a component of the Government's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, has been tracking consumer confidence since 1946.
Economists closely watch the university's data, since a sharp drop in confidence could lead consumers to rein in spending, igniting a recession. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the gross national product.
"The increase in gasoline prices following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has transformed changes in global oil markets into hometown concerns," Mr. Curtin said. "This came at a time when consumer confidence was already weakened, and the actions in the Middle East reinforced and accelerated that downward momentum."

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Are Flat on Lack of News From Gulf

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Oil prices closed nearly unchanged yesterday as war-sensitive traders stayed on the sidelines, waiting for news from the Persian Gulf.
"We're just bouncing around in a range, and there's no real news or headlines to give us direction," said Brian Tagler of Lehman Brothers. 
 Crude oil for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange ended down 4 cents, at $31.12 a barrel, after trading in a range of $30.15 to $31.85.
Analysts said a lack of news from the Middle East prompted important traders to stand aside. Some squared their books ahead of the weekend and next week's holiday-shortened trading period.
"We broke through some key support levels with a lack of tensions in the Mideast and with people concentrating on bearish fundamentals," said Peter Beutel of Pegasus Econometric.
Analysts said the selling was not overwhelming, indicating the market was possibly oversold after losing nearly $2 a barrel Wednesday on news that President Bush had assured Congress the new military buildup in the Persian Gulf did not mean war with Iraq was imminent.
The American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, reported on Tuesday that the nation's oil inventories increased by 878,000 barrels in the latest week to 345 million barrels, a sign that oil supplies are adequate.
Among refined oil products, December gasoline prices fell 0.23 cent, to 80.16 cents a gallon, and heating oil gained 0.03 cent, to 86.67 cents a gallon.
 
 
 Pipeline Plan Cleared
 WASHINGTON, Nov. 15 (Reuters) -- The Energy Department approved a proposal today by the Iroquois Gas Transmission System to import nearly 400 million cubic feet a day of Canadian natural gas.
The action follows Wednesday's approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the system's proposal to build the pipeline.
The Energy Department's approval will allow 18 companies to import gas through Iroquois to six Northeastern states. The Energy Department said construction of the Iroquois pipeline is scheduled to begin next month. The proposed route begins at the Canadian border near Iroquois, Ontario, and runs through eastern New York, western Connecticut and across Long Island Sound to Long Island.
The Iroquois pipeline will be able to deliver as much as 576 million cubic feet of gas a day.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Revamping at Ayer Includes 30 Layoffs

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Ayer, one of the country's oldest agencies, said yesterday that it had completed a long-expected series of changes in its senior management.
Executives at the agency also said a number of employees had been laid off. Ayer reportedly let go of about 30 employees, including some senior executives, as part of a cost-cutting effort. 
 Ayer executives said that while the agency is still profitable, revenues have been shrinking in part as a result of the overall industry slowdown and because the agency had lost two big clients, Burger King last year and Continental Airlines earlier this year.
Dominick F. Rossi Jr., the president of Ayer/New York, said the agency had reduced the number of executives overseeing the account management department in an effort to "streamline the organization and make sure that its clients' accounts are well managed."
The agency now has three managing directors who will have responsibility for account management. In the past, the department had been managed by a larger group of executives.
Janet Keeler, a senior vice president at Ayer, was made a managing director in charge of the A.T.& T., Gillette and NBC/Pay-Per-View accounts. Warren Albright and Dave Gantman, executive vice presidents who were already managing directors, are responsibile for the remaining accounts in the New York office.
Mr. Warren will have the additional duty of being the administrative chief of the entire account management department in New York.
The changes come just a week after the agency shuffled some of the senior executives in its creative department. At that time, Ayer also hired Sue Read, a top creative executive at Lintas New York, to be co-creative director along with Keith Gould.
Industry analysts welcomed the changes; Ayer had been seen as a conservative, sleepy agency that was not well equipped to compete in today's rougher advertising environment.
"The perception had been that the agency was lagging behind the times," said Arthur Anderson, a principal at Morgan, Anderson & Company, a marketing and management consulting firm. "This improves them greatly and makes them an aggressive player."
The transition at Ayer is widely regarded in the industry as the handiwork of Jerry J. Siano, the chairman and chief executive, who in January replaced Louis T. Hagopian, long-time head of the agency.
Analysts said Mr. Siano has given the agency a new spirit, in large part because he comes from the creative side of the business. "I'm very impressed with him because he leads with his head and his heart," Mr. Anderson said. "His understanding of what it takes to create advertising also inspires the staff and helps to attract top outside talent."
Perhaps the most significant change at Ayer is the addition of Ms. Read as a co-creative director. She is widely regarded as one of the more innovative creative executives in the industry, and analysts said it was a coup for Ayer to lure her away from Lintas. At Lintas she was primarily responsible for creating the Diet Coke advertising.
Patrick Cunningham, the agency's chief creative officer, said he brought in Ms. Read to shake up the creative department. "She'll bring a new style and enthusiasm," Mr. Cunningham said. "She'll motivate people because she's a real ball of fire. Creative people have to be constantly challenged. Otherwise they go stale."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Light Trading; Gold Rebounds in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar inched higher on world currency markets yesterday in cautious, choppy trading. Gold prices fell overseas but advanced in New York.
Traders said the market was thin, with most investors focusing on currencies other than the dollar. "A lot of people were selling yen and buying marks," said Gilbert Cisneros, a trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York. 
 He said many traders were confused and not willing to bet on the dollar's direction.
 
 Waiting for the Fed
 The financial markets continue to wait for signs that the Federal Reserve has nudged interest rates lower in an effort to stimulate a weakening United States economy. Lower interest rates are generally negative for the dollar because they erode the value of dollar-denominated securities.
Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA, said that once the Fed makes its move, traders would begin looking ahead for another easing of interest rates, probably shortly after year-end.
Some dealers are looking for today's report on the September trade deficit to rekindle interest in the dollar. With the United States currency trading at depressed levels, most economists expect some improvement from the $9.3 billion deficit registered in the previous month.
Also today, the Labor Department is scheduled to report on the Consumer Price Index for October.
 
 Dollar Rises in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 129.30 yen, from 129.05 at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it fell to 129.15 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 129.69 yen, up from 129.09 on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9590, from $1.9615 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9575 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.9600.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates included: 1.4755 German marks, up from 1.4726; 1.2518 Swiss francs, up from 1.2470; 4.9850 French francs, up from 4.9670; 1,113.25 Italian lire, up from 1,111, and 1.1624 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1631.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold plunged $8.40 an ounce in the previous session, the metal gained $1.50 an ounce to settle at $379.10. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold at $378.75 an ounce, up $1.15.

HEADLINE: Inventories Rose 0.5% In September

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Business inventories grew five-tenths of 1 percent in September while sales suffered their biggest decline in five months, the Government said today, leading some analysts to express concern that the situation could lead to further production cuts and job losses.
"It's consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into a recession and growth will be negative in the fourth quarter," said Evelina Tainer, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. She noted that industrial production in October had already dropped eight-tenths of 1 percent, its sharpest cutback in nine months. 
 Analysts said the inventory level itself had not reached a dangerous level, although continued vigilance was needed to prevent an even deeper reduction in output.
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and backlots in September totaled a seasonally adjusted $811.5 billion, up from $807.5 billion the previous month.
But the accumulation slowed from a gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent in both July and August, which had been the largest increases since an advance of eight-tenths of 1 percent in July 1989.
 
 First Sales Dip Since July
 Business sales dipped five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $548.7 billion, down from $551.5 billion a month earlier.
It was the first decline in sales since a drop of four-tenths of 1 percent in July and the largest since a 1 percent decrease last April. August sales had jumped 2.1 percent.
The ratio of inventories to sales edged up to 1.48, from 1.46 in August. The ratio means it would take 1.48 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the September sales pace.
Still, the ratio was down from its recent peak of 1.54 in July 1989, and Michael P. Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said businesses are now able to react more rapidly to economic developments and avoid serious buildups.
The ratio reached a high of 1.74 in January 1982 during the last recession.
"I think you'll see inventories coming down, but coming down coincident with a slowdown in sales," Mr. Niemira said, noting that retail purchases last month slowed to an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent from a 1.3 percent advance in September.
In both months, however, the sales gains were led by high gasoline prices, rather than volume. When the gasoline component was excluded, retail sales fell one-tenth of 1 percent last month while rising just nine-tenths in September.
All categories posted inventory gains, with manufacturers up six-tenths of 1 percent, and wholesalers and retailers up four-tenths of 1 percent each.
At the same time, manufacturers' sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, while wholesalers posted a 1.8 percent decline.
Sales at the retail level jumped 1.3 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Much at Risk if World Trade Talks Fail

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Should the 105-nation talks about liberalizing trade break down because of the impasse over farm subsidies, trade wars are likely to break out and put recessionary pressure on the United States, many government and private economists predict.
"Obviously it will be a tougher world if the talks fail," said Canada's Ambassador to the United States, Derek H. Burney. "And if there's an economic downturn to boot, things will be really difficult." 
 Because exports have become the main source of American economic strength, the United States has a lot at risk if the 105-nation talks scheduled to end in Geneva next month make no progress.
 
 Serious Repercussions Loom
 "This is important to the country, to its taxpayers," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, whose members generate a $3 billion-a-year foreign trade surplus for the United States. If the talks succeed, that surplus could vastly increase. Protecting intellectual property rights is one of the main goals of the talks. The movie industry now loses billions of dollars through the piracy of its films in foreign markets.
A failure of the talks could also have serious political and economic repercussions, particularly in Eastern Europe, putting pressure on the new democracies, and in the Persian Gulf, where economic rifts might develop between the United States and its allies.
The chief goals of the talks, which began four years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and are known as the Uruguay Round, are to lower tariffs, set guidelines for exchanges of financial and other services and provide better safeguards for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property.
 
 Worry at A.T.&T.
 Lewis M. Chakrin, director of policy and planning for international communications services at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said the worldwide market for telecommunications is worth $500 billion a year, and American companies serve about 20 percent of that market.
"A failure of the Uruguay Round means that American firms will have less of a chance to compete in these markets," he said at a conference in Washington sponsored by the Conference Board and the American Foreign Service Association.
The stumbling block in the talks, which are being conducted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is that the United States and a number of other food-exporting countries, including Canada, Australia and Argentina, have demanded a sharp reduction in government subsidies to farmers. They argue that such subsidies distort the market in agricultural trade and cost farmers in their nations billions of dollars annually.
 
 French and German Farm Power
 But in a number of European nations, notably France and Germany, it is politically difficult to end farm subsidies because the many small farmers are a potent political force. The European Community recently proposed a gradual 30 percent reduction in subsidies, but the United States and other nations have termed that proposal inadequate.
A failure to agree on farm subsidies would doom the talks, and cast aside progress that has been made on numerous other fronts. Agriculture is the linchpin. Developing countries are unwilling to open their economies for banking, telecommunications and other services and offer greater protection of intellectual property without getting access to the markets of industrial countries for their food exports. A failure of the talks would also mean more trade conflicts, many analysts agree.
Retaliation and countermoves would almost certainly cause exports to contract at a time when Washington is counting on export growth to offset the declining economy and the impact of budget cuts.
 
 Economic Importance of Exports
 Since 1986 exports have accounted for more than a third of American economic growth, according to a study by the National Association of Manufacturers. In the first half of 1990, exports accounted for more than 80 percent of the growth.
"If the Uruguay Round aborts, then export potential is going to lag because we will be in lots of trade squabbles," said William R. Cline, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "With the economy the way it is, this is a pretty bad time now to be stultifying export prospects."
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said a number of lingering trade disputes that were set aside pending the outcome of the broader talks will come to the forefront.
 
 U.S.-Japan Disputes
 She cited a dispute with Japan over access to its $35-billion-a-year market in rice, which is closed to foreigners. Rice in Japan sells at seven times the price in the United States, and American rice growers have petitioned Washington to press Japan for access.
In addition to rice, the United States has complaints against Japanese barriers in supercomputers, optical fibers, semiconductors, public works construction and many other sectors.
A similar set of problems exists with Europe. The Bush Administration, the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation complain of British, French and German subsidies for Airbus Industrie. Meat packers are unhappy with European bans on American meat, imposed because slaughterhouse standards are different in Europe; telecommunications companies complain that many European markets are closed.
 
 'Only Losers, No Winners'
 If trade disputes flare up, "there will be only losers, no winners," said Yvonne van Rooy, the Netherlands' trade minister. She made her comments to several reporters on Friday after seeing Bush Administration officials. The Dutch are traditionally among the strongest free traders in Europe and are anxious to see the global talks succeed.
Many of Eastern Europe's new democracies are counting on exports to help them deliver on domestic economic promises. The market-oriented changes taking place throughout the world can be "cemented only by their incorporation into the liberal, open world economy," a group of political and business leaders known as the Eminent Persons Group on World Trade said recently after meeting in Frankfurt.
Congress is likely to offer lots of advice to the Administration on how to handle trade disputes. Many analysts expect enormous Congressional pressure to retaliate against the European Community for its farm protection.
"If Congress takes strong measures, you can expect other countries to take strong measures as well," Mrs. Hills said. "You could have a lot of legislative bodies come up with different measures that are bound to lead to trade contraction."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
Hope and Fear as Wife Plans Trip to Iraq

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ODESSA, Tex., Nov. 13

 BODY:
Her trip to Iraq has not even begun and already Donnita Cole is trying to block the images of how it will probably end.
After she travels 8,000 miles to Baghdad against the advice of her Government and after she sees her 61-year-old husband, John, who is being held by the Iraqis, there will come the wrenching moment when she must leave. 
 She tries not to think of that moment as she applies for a visa, wrests promises from the Iraqi Embassy in Washington and shops for the shoes, cards and other items her husband has asked her to bring. She tries, but she fails.
 
Doing 'the Hardest Thing'
 Kissing her husband goodbye and then boarding the plane "will be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do in my whole life," Mrs. Cole said, the defiance momentarily gone from her West Texas twang. "But I've made my decision. For me, going and leaving again sure beats not seeing him at all."
When President Saddam Hussein of Iraq recently invited the families of his hostages to visit Baghdad for Christmas, he presented each family with agonizing choices: To go and risk becoming hostages themselves, or to stay home and feel the guilt of abandoning loved ones. To go and become a pawn in Mr. Hussein's public opinion game, or to stay home and watch helplessly if, as part of that game, he suddenly frees those whose relatives visited. To spend more than $5,000 on a trip when, for most families, money is tight because the primary breadwinner has become a hostage or to squander what might be the last chance to see a loved one.
The State Department has advised families to stay home, saying travel to Iraq is too dangerous. But it has also said that the United States would not try to stop any family member who chooses to make the trip.
Most of the relatives of the 1,000 Americans still being held in Iraq and Kuwait seem to be following the Government's advice.
But a few, including 10 members of the support group Coming Home, which was founded within days of the invasion to counsel and provide information to families of Americans in Iraq and Kuwait, have decided to make the trip. They will leave from Washington on Dec. 2.
 
Messages on the Wrists
 "I don't care if they're using me as a propaganda ploy," Mrs. Cole said in an interview in her one-story frame house on a dusty side street here. "I don't care if I'm going against my Government. I just want to go to Baghdad and see my husband."
Mrs. Cole, a 48-year-old woman with a booming voice, a constant laugh, a strong opinion on almost every subject and four earrings in each ear, is particularly torn by the conflict in the Persian Gulf. On her right wrist is a silver-colored bracelet inscribed "My Johnny, My Baby, Us Together Again," a tribute to her husband that she says she will wear until he is released. On her left wrist is a gold-colored bracelet with the name of her son, Specialist John Edward Cole of the United States Army, who is stationed in Saudi Arabia as part of the American buildup there. Another son and her son-in-law are also in the military, awaiting orders to leave for the gulf region.
When President Hussein issued his invitation at the begining of November, Mrs. Cole initially decided not to accept, because her husband had told her not to. She received her first telephone call from Mr. Cole several days after Mr. Hussein's offer.
"What are you doing, babe?" asked the man she had not heard from in three months or seen since April, when he left to begin a two-year oil drilling job, expecting her to join him in Kuwait in August.
"Nothing," she replied. "Just standing around waiting for your phone call."
Her words, she said, sounded calmer than she felt. "I know it's physically impossible for your heart to leap into your throat," said Mrs. Cole, who teaches cardiopulmonary resuscitation to paramedics. "But, honey, I don't care what all my medical books say, my heart was in my throat."
 
A Change in Plans
 During the eight-minute call, Mrs. Cole asked if she should visit Iraq and was told not to.
"You may be stepping into a world of trouble," Mrs. Cole quoted her husband as saying, adding that had cleaned up his language so it could be printed. She said he told her that he not only feared for her safety but that he also did not want her to see his living conditions.
"They have six hostages and six guards in a four bedroom building," Mrs. Cole said. "They must be packed in like sardines."
Like many other families of hostages, Mrs. Cole began hearing from her husband regularly after that first call. He phoned the next day and they talked about how to repair a leak in their ceiling. The next day he called again, and she again asked if she should go to Baghdad. This time he said to come.
Shortly after that call, Mrs. Cole spoke to Kim Edwards, who had just returned from a week in Iraq to visit her husband, Tony, who had been employed there as a planning consultant. Mrs. Edwards's visit was made before Mr. Hussein's invitation, and Mrs. Cole and other members of Coming Home were eager to hear about her trip.
 
Keeping a Phone Line Busy
 Mrs. Cole and the others talked to Mrs. Edwards on a conference party line that the U S Sprint Communications Company donated to Coming Home. Relatives of hostages can call at any hour and talk to anyone else who may be on the line.
Mrs. Edwards, who plans to return to Iraq in December, was soon holding daily sessions on the line, sometimes with as many as 30 people. Questions from others considering a trip to Iraq concerned things like costs, visas and appropriate clothing for a Muslim country. Mrs. Cole also wanted to know whether her two-inch red fingernails, which she has vowed not to cut until her husband can see them, would offend Iraqi officials.
Callers also discussed whether they would be held in violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from interfering in foreign policy. They decided they would not be, and a State Department spokesman, in an interview, said there were no plans to enforce the act in these circumstances.
They also discussed whether they would could be charged with violating the economic embargo against Iraq by spending money on food and lodging there and learned that the Treasury Department might grant waivers if their trip was ruled to be for humanitarian purposes.
 
Fears of a War
 At first callers were concerned that visitors to Iraq might not be allowed to leave, but that fear is now expressed less frequently, say several people who use the line daily. "The feeling now is why would the Iraqis let 500 women and children go out then invite 10 in and keep them?" said Michael Saba, founder of Coming Home, who was in Iraq on business and escaped soon after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
The newer concern is that a war could break out during their visit. "There is danger, but not from the Iraqis" Mrs. Cole said. "There's a very large danger my Government is going to attack while I'm there."
But that has not deterred Mrs. Cole. Once she decided to go, she contacted the Iraqi Ambassador to the United States and asked if the visitors would be able to meet with President Hussein. "He said he would fax the request that day and he thought it could be accomplished," Mrs. Cole said.
 
Shopping and Raising Money
 She also began shopping. With each phone call, her husband adds to the list of things he wants: size 12 shoes, playing cards and instruction manuals for bridge so he can teach his fellow hostages how to play, socks, underwear, T-shirts, a jogging outfit, paperbacks and family photographs, especially some of the youngest of his seven grandchildren, a boy who was born one month after Mr. Cole left for the gulf and who carries his name.
The rest of Mrs. Cole's time is spent raising money for her trip. Her economy-class air fare of $1,600 is being paid by an Iraqi-born doctor in South Texas who has lived in this country for 30 years but whose mother, sister and brother still live in Iraq. He has asked her not to divulge his name.
Mrs. Cole estimates she will need $4,000 for hotels and food. Mrs. Edwards spent $2,000 in her one week in Baghdad, and Mrs. Cole hopes to stay for two. The first week, she hopes, will be filled with meetings with Iraqi officials as she begs for the hostages' release. The second week, she says firmly, will be spent only with her husband.
In a recent call on the party line, the talk turned to the cost of Baghdad hotel rooms. since the Iraqi Embassy has indicated that the hostages who are being kept at strategic military sites around the country will be moved to hotels while their families are in Iraq. Mrs. Edwards said the rooms would probably cost $135 a night.
One caller, preparing to visit his son, was startled by that price and suggested that some of the families "double up" to save money.
Mrs. Cole broke in with a laugh. "You bet I'm gonna double up, honey," she said, "but it ain't gonna be with you."

HEADLINE: Arizona Struggles Anew to Erase Its Negative Image

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Once again Arizona has been plunged into political and racial turmoil, its leaders forced to protest that the state is not as narrow-minded and backward as it might seem to some outsiders.
And once again, the issue is a paid state holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The issue has reappeared more than two years after Evan Mecham, the Governor who rescinded the holiday, was impeached and ousted from office for misuse of state money. 
 On Nov. 6 Arizona voters rejected a proposal to add a holiday for the slain civil rights leader by a margin of 17,226 votes, less than 1 percent of the total votes cast. Since then the daily cascade of bad news has been topic A from Flagstaff to Tombstone.
Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner of the National Football League, recommended that Super Bowl XXVII, scheduled to be held in nearby Tempe in 1983, be played elsewhere. Hopes that Phoenix would gain a National League baseball franchise all but evaporated. The National League of Cities considered shifting its planned 1991 convention out of Phoenix. And entertainment officials predicted another round of boycotts of the state by top musical groups.
 
An Image Problem
 For years Arizona has suffered from an image of being a center of right-wing extremism and fast-buck operators. That image was not improved by the Mecham episode nor by the fact that both of the state's United States Senators, Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat, and John McCain, a Republican, face Senate ethics charges that they improperly intervened with Federal regulators to help a prominent financier, Charles H. Keating Jr., who has been accused of looting a savings and loan association. Many business and legislative leaders had hoped that the King holiday vote would clear away at least that issue.
"I feel a numbness -- after Keating and Mecham, this gives us a lot of negative impact around the world," said Bill Shover, public affairs director for Phoenix Newspapers Inc., who led the campaign to gain the Super Bowl and helped lead the effort to save the King holiday.
"This situation is not acceptable," said Richard Lehmann, chairman of Arizona's largest bank, the Valley National Bank. "We absolutely must fix this."
That will not be so easy. Allegations since Election Day that Dr. King had plagiarized portions of his doctoral dissertation have stiffened opposition.
 
'The Tip of the Iceberg'
 At a small office in Scottsdale, a suburb of Phoenix, Robert O. Rose, an accountant who led the campaign against the holiday, threatened to start recall drives against any legislator who voted anew for the holiday. "This plagiarism was just the tip of the iceberg," he said. "We honestly don't believe our kids and grandkids should revere him as a national hero."
Mr. Rose dismissed the economic threats as overblown. Backers have said the Super Bowl would inject $225 million in the Phoenix area's economy; Mr. Rose said hotels were normally fully booked anyway in January, the high season here, and that the bowl would only result in price "gouging."
For blacks, who make up about 3 percent of Arizona's population, the voters' rejection of the King holiday proposal was a deep disappointment, said the Rev. Warren Stewart, pastor of the First Institutional Baptist Church, the largest black congregation in Phoenix.
Mr. Stewart, who described Arizonans as "narrow minded, myopic," said he held the business establishment partly to blame for not working soon enough on behalf of the King holiday proposal.
 
New Plan Being Considered
 A group of community, political and religious leaders met at the church on Wednesday to devise a new plan. A consensus is emerging that the holiday measure might pass if it is modeled after the Federal plan, under which the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln were combined, thereby not creating another paid holiday for government employees.
Gov. Rose Mofford said she would put a King bill on the docket at a special session of the Legislature that has been called to set rules for a runoff in the governor's race, but only if more than two-thirds of the members of both houses supported it, thus allowing it to go into effect immediately as an "emergency measure." (Complicating Arizona's problems is that it has no governor-elect, since neither Terry Goddard, the Democratic candidate, nor J. Fife Symington, the Republican, won more than 50 percent of the vote.)
But lawmakers find little support for the emergency vote. "There is a lot of hostility out there," said Jane Hull, a Phoenix Republican who is Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives. "It will be revisited, but not in this Legislature. I am telling people, 'Take it easy, cool down, go find something else to do.' "
Meanwhile, business leaders are trying to show that voters did not really reject the concept of a King holiday. A poll commissioned by the business-supported MLK Better America Committee found that about 60,000 voters switched to 'no' after a report on CBS Sports the Sunday before the election that the National Football League would move the Super Bowl if the holiday proposal failed.
 
'Rugged Individualists'
 "Arizonans are rugged individualists -- they do not like being told what to do," said Bruce D. Merrill, director of the Media Research Program at Arizona State University in Tempe.
Edward and Trudy Egan were among the defiant. The couple retired from Northfield, Ill., 11 years ago and moved to Sun City, about 15 miles west of Phoenix. "I think he should be entitled to a holiday," Mr. Egan said of Dr. King. "But I don't like it when everybody starts threatening you."
The ballot actually had two King holiday measures on it,presenting something of a puzzle for voters. Newspapers tried to solve the puzzle with graphics that looked like chromosome charts, showing what different combinations of votes would do. In the end, Mr. Merrill said, 63 percent voted for one holiday proposasl or the other, but both measures failed.
Local officials told out-of-state sports officials that the cities of Phoenix and Tempe and many major companies already observed Dr. King's birthday. Organizers of the Fiesta Bowl college football game, to be held on New Year's Day, added scholarships for minority students for the participating schools and promised a halftime civil rights ceremony.
"We're telling them, 'Why punish Phoenix? It has a King holiday,' " said Larry Hilliard, vice president of the Phoenix and Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau.
All sides agreed that whatever resolution is worked out, the issue must go to another statewide vote. "It absolutely must be submitted to the people," Mr. Merrill said, "or the wrath will be terrible."

HEADLINE: How to Save the Trade Talks

 BODY:
There is new hope that the Uruguay Round of international trade talks, currently stalled by protectionist bickering, will finally pick up speed toward resolution. The White House announced this week that President Bush and his European counterparts had agreed to take charge of the negotiations. The elements of a deal are clear. All that's missing is leadership.
The talks are scheduled to end early next month. Yet there is no agreement in view, primarily because of shortsighted decisions by the industrialized countries. 
 At the core of the impasse is the attempt by Western leaders to protect the economic privileges of politically powerful domestic industries at the expense of the vast majority of their own citizens. The European Community persists in protecting a few million family farmers, the U.S. proposes to exempt telecommunications, aviation and shipping; Japan won't agree to import a grain of rice. And the industrialized powers have yet to make major concessions on protectionist textile policies.
The key stalemate is over European farm policy. To protect its farmers, the Community keeps food prices high, generating tremendous surpluses that it then dumps on foreign markets at subsidized prices. The policy costs European taxpayers $100 billion a year, and devastates competing farmers in food-exporting countries.
Third world food exporters are demanding that Europe open up its markets to imports of food and textiles before they agree to rules governing trade in services and intellectual property.
Last week the Europeans offered to cut farm supports by about 15 percent from current levels. That wouldn't provide much help, especially combined with other provisions that would allow Europe to preserve its export subsidies and even raise tariffs on selected products.
The U.S. has also been obstinate. It insists on exempting some key industries from trade talks even though there is nothing to lose by keeping them on the negotiating table. The negotiators are discussing a set of basic principles -- such as the obligation for each country to treat domestic and foreign service companies alike -- that the U.S. fully supports. Deciding how to apply these principles to individual sectors won't be negotiated until later, and the U.S. will be able to veto any rule it doesn't like.
Liberalized trade could add trillions to economies around the globe over the next 10 years, more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. But it won't happen unless Mr. Bush and European leaders make it happen.
Europe must agree to lower export subsidies and forsake raising any other trade barriers. The U.S. must withdraw its proposal to exempt specific service sectors. And the industrialized nations must agree to phase out protectionist textile agreements.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Hijack in Washington

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
Early on the morning of Oct. 26, a handful of members of the House of Representatives, working with the Bush Administration, hijacked direct relief for the people of the Soviet Union. Americans little noted, but should long remember.
With time running out before Congress adjourned, a few members of the House were able to override the Senate and prevent a dollop of humanitarian and economic aid from going directly to the Baltic nations and people still imprisoned in the Soviet system. 
 By this act, the perpetrators sent two messages. One was that aid to the Soviet people had to be channeled entirely through the staggering Gorbachev Government.
The other was that the Congressmen and State Department officials involved give President Mikhail Gorbachev's personal and political future a far higher priority than helping the people of the Soviet republics survive the hunger bequeathed to them by Communism.
The American public does not care -- because it was never told. Things that go bump in the middle of the hectic last Congressional nights don't get much newspaper or TV attention. Anyway, betrayal of the Baltics is not much of a story in Washington; routine. Newspapers and TV paid no attention that I know of except for a column in The Cleveland Plain Dealer.
In June, legislation was introduced in the Senate calling for $10 million in humanitarian aid to be divided among Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. President Bush had helped Mr. Gorbachev fight Baltic independence, despite almost a half-century of American endorsement of Baltic freedom. But the Baltics continue the struggle for freedom as best they can.
As a New Yorker, I am happy to report that Senators Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse D'Amato were among the major movers, as was Senator William Armstrong, Republican of Colorado. Then Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, introduced a measure giving the Baltic nations an additional $15 million to be spent in helping private economic development.
The Senate passed both bills. But mysteriously, the House never got around to acting. So, with adjournment rushing up, they went to a conference committee, where the necessary House agreement was expected.
But that $25 million in a foreign aid package of $15 billion stuck in the craw of a few House committee members and they killed it. The Baltic-American communities, who have been kept informed by their own organizations, hold two Democratic representatives chiefly responsible: Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana and David R. Obey of Wisconsin.
A little poking around supports that. Congressional and State Department reasoning for rejecting sending even a drop of money directly to the Soviet republics goes like this: "It would annoy Gorbachev. Also, it would upset his negotiations with the Baltics. And it would be difficult to send help or investments directly, hard to find the right banking channels, contacts, all that."
Yes, it might upset Mr. Gorbachev to show that Moscow's writ is so weak that it cannot handle relief by itself. But it is politically wise and humanly decent to send most aid directly to the republics and their people. That plea comes from all over the Soviet Union.
True, sending official American aid to the republics and private Soviet groups through U.S. organizations might be complicated at first. But somehow private American aid manages to get through Soviet customs guards. Central authority in the Soviet Union evaporates every day. It's long past time for the U.S. to work out far better communications with the Soviet people. The longer we wait, the deeper the danger of famine.
As for the Moscow-Baltic talks, the U.S. has thrown all its weight to Mr. Gorbachev. The gesture of sending the Baltics a little help would not end the shame of the American betrayal of the Baltics. But after so many decades of unfulfilled blabber about helping, it might ease their hearts, and ours too.
So that is the story of how a small, compassionate attempt to help 3 of the 15 Soviet republics was mugged in the middle of the night. But the Baltics will not go away, nor the other rising republics. Neither will hunger in the Soviet Union. The need to send help to the survivors of Communism, direct to the people and places where it will do them and us the most good, becomes more important by the day.
If that aid annoys Mr. Gorbachev, it seems a price worth bearing for all of us, even members of Congress.

HEADLINE: Upbeat European View

BYLINE: By PAUL L. MONTGOMERY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Trade ministers from the European Community's 13 nations tried today to put a positive cast on the continuing negotiations to break the impasse on farm subsidies.
Renato Ruggiero, Italy's trade minister, who presided at today's meeting, said, "Success is possible in all 15 subjects of the Uruguay Round," including farm subsidies.
After months of deadlock, the European Community last week approved a negotiating position on farm subsidies that fell far short of the sharp cuts sought by the United States, Canada and other food-exporting nations, including Australia, Argentina and Brazil. The Europeans, who have long had a policy of subsidizing small farmers because of their political strength, finally agreed to consider a 30 percent cut in subsidies covering a 10-year period retroactive to 1986.
The big producers, including the United States, want reductions of 75 percent in price supports and 90 percent in export subsidies over 10 years beginning in 1991. Japan, where small farmers are also a potent political force, is the only major country taking the European side.
Mr. Ruggiero reiterated the community's position that its negotiating position had room for change. "We have never said it is a take-it-or-leave-it offer," he said.
France has said a 30 percent cut in subsidies is probably the limit it can hope to sell to restive farmers. Peter Lilley, Britain's trade minister, said today in a clear reference to France that some countries had done a disservice to the community by indicating the negotiating position was a final offer.

HEADLINE: Eventually, We'll Have to Legalize Drugs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Ethan Kalett states that an end to the drug war "would increase abuse and have little effect on crime" (letter, Oct. 22). But each day brings more evidence that adopting some form of drug decriminalization would enhance law and order while not necessarily leading to significantly more drug abuse over the long term. 
 Mr. Kalett refers to the British approach in which registered heroin addicts may obtain free methadone from the British Government. It is essentially the same methadone-based approach used in the United States. He seems to object on the ground that the addict's dependency is simply shifted to the state's drugs.
Why is it a problem if addicts must stay on methadone for the rest of their lives? People with diabetes and epilepsy must take insulin and dilantin, respectively, all their lives to function properly. In this sense, they are addicted. At least they are not stealing for fixes, supporting drug gangsters and clogging our court dockets and prisons.
Mr. Kalett rightly observes that methadone does not work for all heroin addicts, and that these addicts will continue to buy heroin illegally. This is perhaps what prompted Dr. Philip Connell, chairman of the Home Office Advisory Committee on the Misuse of Drugs, to urge that the British return to their earlier lessrestrictive approach to treating heroin addiction. He proposes that the British abandon the policy of treating addicts only if they promise to withdraw and accept rapidly reducing doses of methadone. He recommends giving free needles, methadone or heroin for as long as addicts request.
Dr. Connell's suggestion is gaining favor in the British medical community. At the most recent conference of the International Council on Alcoholism and Addiction in Berlin, David Turner, director of Britain's Standing Committee on Drug Abuse, said he favored seeking alternatives to drug prohibition. "We have to learn to live with drugs, rather than dissipate our energies in pursuit of the myth of a drug-free world," he stated.
The most recent surveys indicate that drug use among young people in the United States continues to decline even as they report that drugs are easily available. Changes in attitudes and concern over health are winning the war on drugs, not paramilitary strategies of interdiction. Enlisting the criminal justice system in drug prohibition undermines its ability to execute effectively its traditional function: protecting people and property. Eventually, this country will legalize drugs because the black market pathologies -- addiction-supporting crime, corruption of law enforcement, overcrowded prisons -- will prove intolerable burdens on nonaddicts.

Selling Sacrifice: Gulf Rationale Still Eludes Bush

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
More than three months after the Persian Gulf crisis began, the Bush Administration still seems to be seeking a rationale to convince the American public of the need to commit hundreds of thousands of troops for a possible war to free Kuwait from Iraq.
 In an interview tonight on Cable News Network, President Bush acknowledged this problem, when he said: "If I haven't done as clear a job as I might have on explaining this, then I've got to do better, because I know in my heart of hearts that what we are doing is right. I know what the United Nations has done is correct. I know that we've got to stand up to this aggression." 
 The Administration has found itself with often contradictory-sounding explanations. This was highlighted this week when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, talking more like a former Republican campaign chairman, shrugged off the President's earlier message that the gulf operation was "not about oil" and linked it directly to oil supplies and the health of the American economy.
"If you want to sum it up in one word, it's jobs," Mr. Baker said. "Because an economic recession, worldwide, caused by the control of one nation, one dictator, of the West's economic lifeline will result in the loss of jobs on the part of American citizens."
 
An Argument That Resonates
 The fact that Mr. Baker would suggest that the protection of jobs was a primary reason American troops might have to fight a war for Kuwait seemed to be both a search for an easily appealing rationale, as well as an acknowledgment that the Administration's explanations up to now have failed to resonate with the public.
Mr. Baker's attempt at political manipulation, and the negative reception it has received from commentators, seem to have stirred the President to engage in a new effort to win the backing of the American public. In addition to the long interview with CNN, he will also be appearing in the "My Turn" column in the forthcoming issue of Newsweek.
The Bush Administration came into office priding itself on prudence and pragmatism. In its first 18 months, when the most important foreign policy decisions involved reacting to events initiated by others in Eastern Europe, its instinctive caution and pragmatisim worked well enough.
But mobilizing the country for possible war is a different enterprise, one in which a President must take the initiative to persuade the nation that his aims are clear and the sacrifices justifed.
 
Slogans Aren't Substance
 "That requires a clarity of purpose that can only grow out of a vision of America's role in the world," said Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard University political theorist. "Pragmatism is not enough. Slogans comparing Saddam Hussein to Hitler, or claiming that the whole thing is about 'jobs,' are no substitute for serious moral and political arguments."
From the very start of his term, though, Mr. Bush has seemed to believe that political debate, and the building of constituencies, were the stuff of election campaigns, while governing involved pragmatic decision-making.
As a result, when Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker found themselves in the position of having to shape a national consensus for a large-scale foreign commitmemt, their instincts seem to hark back to campaign tactics. They appear to approach the building of a domestic political base for war as though it were another political campaign, where different slogans are employed each week, hoping that eventually one will strike the right chord.
This ad hoc approach led into a web of contradictions. On Oct. 16, the President said that "the fight isn't about oil; the fight is about naked aggression," while on Nov. 13, Mr. Baker said that it was about "jobs." How can it be about jobs, but not be about oil?
 
Defending What?
 On Aug. 8, the President declared that the mission of American troops was "wholly defensive," but on Oct. 23, he declared that "we're dealing with Hitler revisited, a totalitarism and brutality that is naked and unprecedented in modern times. And that must not stand." How can the United States insure that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will not stand, if the mission of American troops is "wholly defensive," to protect Saudi Arabia?
These contradictions not only arise from the Administration's lack of a clearly defined purpose, but also from the very ambiguous nature of the stakes in the gulf crisis and the Administration's difficulty in sorting out the complexities.
"In World War II," said the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, a former Librarian of Congress, "the threat of Hitler was so clear and unambiguous that to be anti-Nazi was to affirm something. If your enemy is sharp and clearly defined, then just by opposing him you have principles of your own. But who is Saddam Hussein? Most Americans had never even heard of this man. Is he really Hitler, or something else? There is a real confusion here about what these people over there are all about."
If there is any argument that seems to resonate with American troops in Saudi Arabia, it is that Saddam Hussein is a dangerous dictator with chemical weapons and a nuclear potential, who, if not stopped now, will threaten world peace.
But up to now, the President has limited himself more to name-calling than explaining why this particular dictator, with these particular weapons, in this particular spot, must be stopped.
"If you say that this man is Hitler, then Hitler calls forth a Churchill," said Fouad Ajami, a Middle East expert at Johns Hopkins University. "Bush has to meet him on the symbolic level, with a sweeping historical vision and the stirring oratory that will make men ready to sacrifice to stop him. But a nation that has just bid farewell to the cold war and ideological passion is not easily summoned for a warring assignment in a faraway place against a man whom people sense is not really part of our story."

HEADLINE: Sit Down and Talk With Hussein

BYLINE: By Judith Kipper; Judith Kipper, a Middle East specialist, is associated with the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The United States should talk directly with Saddam Hussein.
As events this week in Washington underscore, President Bush cannot risk war without being absolutely sure that there is no diplomatic way out of the gulf crisis. The political repercussions, both at home and in the fractious multilateral coalition opposing Iraq, could be disastrous. Moreover, with an isolated dictator who asserts draconian control over his people and his closest advisers, direct talk is the only way to take the correct measure of the man. 
 Despite United Nations Security Council resolutions and constant but apparently ineffective public diplomacy, Mr. Hussein sees himself confronted by the U.S., not by the international community. He believes there is an American conspiracy against Iraq, and when he looks over the horizon he sees hundreds of thousands of G.I.'s to confirm his suspicion.
The script for a Presidential envoy to Baghdad is simple: "Mr. President, you still have a chance for statesmanship by withdrawing unconditionally from Kuwait or you will, Mr. President, be removed from Kuwait by other means." No concessions can be made. An American envoy can talk only about arrangements for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and the simultaneous introduction of peacekeepers.
This is a message that even a risk-taker like Saddam Hussein can understand. He is ruthless and inexperienced in the ways of the world, but he is neither crazy nor suicidal. When he has understood past miscalculations, he has reversed himself without explanation.
If Saddam Hussein can be made to understand by an American envoy what he is up against, he may again reverse himself. If he is only 99 percent sure that Iraq has to get out of Kuwait, he will play the 1 percent for everything it is worth.
 American policy makers may remember that even friendly dictators need to be persuaded directly. In 1986 President Reagan sent his close friend Senator Paul Laxalt to see the Philippine President, Ferdinand Marcos. Despite constant contacts with officials and elected American representatives, Marcos refused the message until the President finally dispatched a veteran diplomat, Philip Habib, to Manila. Marcos left for exile in Hawaii soon after meeting Habib.
Similarly, President Bush sent senior envoys on several secret missions to Beijing shortly after the massacre in Tiananmen Square. The mission to China failed, but the President had taken a chance -- sending his envoy -- to see if the United States could influence a bad situation.
Administration officials claim that talking to Saddam Hussein would be a reward for the Iraqi dictator. This view is not shared by some European and Arab coalition partners or by the Soviet Union. They recognize that direct talks with an American envoy may be the necessary face-saving-device Saddam Hussein needs. The United States has nothing to lose. At worst, no progress will be made. At best, war will be prevented.
The decade of the 90's belongs to the Middle East. The outcome of this crisis will shape the emerging world order for this decade and perhaps for decades to come. Iraq must get out of Kuwait because sovereignty is indivisible and nonnegotiable. Using force as a primary instrument of policy is unacceptable. Regional actors like Iraq must be persuaded that they cannot act with impunity to re-arrange the map or resolve grievances. This will dissuade others tempted to resort to force, which could create global anarchy.
Three months after Iraqi forces ruthlessly invaded a peaceful Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has the upper hand. Kuwait is devastated, thousands have been killed and displaced, the price of oil has doubled, threatening Eastern Europe and the third world with economic collapse; tourism and commerce are disrupted, and the time needed to shape the post-cold-war world has been stolen by Iraq.
Thus, military action may yet be necessary. But the U.S. should not even contemplate such a step without first talking to Saddam Hussein (not to speak of Congress). The uproar in Washington this week will seem mild compared with the explosion that is sure to come if the Administration refuses to talk before going to war.

HEADLINE: The Million Dollar Disgrace

BYLINE: By James Boyle; James Boyle is a professor of law at American University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Richard Berendzen, the former president of American University, was asked to resign this spring when it was discovered that he had made obscene phone calls from his office. He remains a tenured professor. The trustees of American University -- without consulting anyone in the campus community -- have offered Dr. Berendzen more than $1 million to sever all ties with the school.
What are we to learn from this? 
 Lesson No. 1: When I first came to American University in 1982, the janitorial service workers were just beginning to organize themselves into a union. On Christmas Eve of that year, they were all fired with two weeks' pay by a gung-ho president who said that we had to make hard decisions in order to safeguard the university's meager resources. That president's name was Richard Berendzen.
The janitors had made no obscene phone calls. No one offered them $1.2 million, asked them to appear on "Nightline," or sympathized with them in print about the wrenching effect that this must have had on their family life. Eventually, a coalition of students, faculty and staff shamed the university into rehiring these employees.
As I write this article eight years later, the contractor has just refused to bargain with the janitors' union.
Lesson No. 2: When the board of trustees makes such decisions without consulting the faculty or the students, the campus reaction is one of fury. Signs are everywhere. Some of them are substantive -- "We want a voice." Some are humorous -- "Q: If the president gets a million dollars for committing sex offenses, what should the janitors get for unionizing? A: Fired." Others are biting -- "Why did the board like having Adnan Khashoggi as a member? He supplied them with moral vision."
My reaction to the board's persistent refusal to consult students or faculty is one of puzzlement. They must have seen the students at Gallaudet and at the University of the District of Columbia speaking out for democratic university governance. They probably cheered the wave of activism in Eastern Europe, yet apparently believe that universities are no place for debate and democracy.
Lesson No. 3: I teach in a law school. In a law school, one learns to decode texts. How can we decode the board's proposed settlement? On the one hand, you might believe that Dr. Berendzen is himself a victim, that he acted out of compulsion and that the appropriate response of a caring university community is to welcome him back with open arms.
On the other hand, you might think he is a sleazy, egomaniacal criminal who has simply used his disgrace as another whistle stop in his campaign of relentless self-promotion. In that case, presumably, you would move to terminate his tenure for cause. Which of these messages does the settlement convey?
The answer is, "Neither." The settlement says, "Go away, we love you." On its face, this is a morally cretinous response. It would be morally cretinous even if the university had limitless resources. In fact, this is a university with a tiny endowment and dependent on tuition. With $1.2 million, we could have given scholarships to 50 inner-city kids. We could have paid the medical insurance of everyone on campus or given our chronically underpaid staff a raise.
The board wants instead of hand it to Dr. Berendzen as a bonus for his work at American University -- above and beyond his salary, expense account, car, house and phone privileges. The board members will not feel the effect of their decision. They will not have to pay more tuition or see their classrooms made more homogeneous. Perhaps that is why they find it easy to give the money away.
So, what lessons does the Berendzen case teach us? It teaches us that our sympathy and interest go out most easily to people of our own class and race, that we are more likely to sympathize with a disgraced university president than a fired janitor.
It teaches us that democracy is never an unimportant ideal, that you can't draw a line around elections and declare that the moral force of democracy must be restricted to this narrow arena. It teaches us that one reason we have democracy is because people make unspeakably stupid decisions without it. The American University board certainly did. Perhaps Dr. Berendzen was a pretty good teacher, after all.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Lower Rates Push Dollar To New Low Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined broadly yesterday and settled at a new low against the German mark as lower American interest rates drove investors from the market.
The mark has been rising on expectations that the Bundesbank may be on the verge of raising interest rates, which would make German bonds more attractive to investors, enhancing their need for marks. 
 Further hurting the dollar was the continuing expectation that the Federal Reserve is preparing to lower interest rates. In New York the dollar settled at 1.4705 marks, down from 1.4755 on Thursday.
Currency trading was active following a Labor Department report that consumer prices were up by six-tenths of 1 percent in October. But once volatile food and energy prices were subtracted, the "core" inflation rate registered a moderate three-tenths rise.
"The market seized on the figure," said John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank. He added that because inflationary pressures seemed to be stabilizing, the Fed had more room to maneuver interest rates downward. Indeed, around midday, the Fed injected reserves into the banking system by buying Treasury bills with the promise of repurchasing them soon, usually after the weekend.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.73 Japanese yen, from 129.30 late Thursday. Later, in London, it fell to 129.45 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 129.50 yen, down from 129.69 on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9655, from $1.9590 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9660 to buy 1, more expensive than Thursday's $1.9575.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday, included: 1.2465 Swiss francs, down from 1.2518; 4.9685 French francs, down from 4.9850; 1,109.50 Italian lire, down from 1,113.25, and 1.1633 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1624.
Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $378.90 a troy ounce, down 20 cents from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for bullion of $379, up 25 cents an ounce.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy ounce, from $379.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $376.20 an ounce from $378.60. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.08 an ounce, to $380.11.

HEADLINE: Legislators Seek Laws to Aid Environment

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Legislators from the United States, Europe and Japan announced plans today to introduce parallel legislation to deal with climate change, deforestation and other threats to the environment.
The legislators, members of Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced Environment, or Globe, said at a news conference here today that tough environmental legislation would be introduced into the United States Congress, the Japanese Parliament and the European Parliament. They also said they expected their initiatives to put pressure on national governments to act more decisively on threats to global ecological systems. 
 Representative James H. Scheuer, Democrat of New York and founder and outgoing president of Globe, said that the two-year-old group was "coordinating environmental initiatives and providing common standards" to governments around the world.
 
Less Energy Consumption
 At the end of their three-day meeting, the legislators agreed to back laws aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing energy consumption in their respective countries. Scientists believe the earth's surface will warm by 3 degrees Fahrenheit or more by the middle of the next century, as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels along with other industrial gases accumulate in the atmosphere and retain heat radiated from the sun.
The legislation would stress reducing dependence on fossil fuels through conservation and through developing technologies that rely on other energy sources.
They also said they would try to enact legislation for protecting rapidly disappearing tropical forests. Their proposed law would require their Governments to enter negotiations on an international timber agreement. Such an accord would reduce timber cutting, improve economic returns to the the tropical countries and encourage the sustainable uses of the forests.
 
Help for Malaysian State
 The legislators urged an 80 percent reduction in cutting in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, where, according to Hemmo Muntingh, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands, unrestrained logging has created a desperate situation that approached "ecological suicide" for much of Sarawak. The legislators called for a moratorium on log imports from Sarawak by the industrial nations.
An official in the Malaysian Embassy here said logging in Sarawak had already been reduced. The official, who would not give his name, said he would not comment on any of the other statements made by the legislators at today's news conference.
They also called on the United States, Canada, Japan, and the Soviet Union to draw up a treaty for protecting the ecology of the North Pacific where, they said, marine mammals, fish, and sea bird populations were being reduced very rapdily because of excessive harvesting and pollution.
Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat who is Globe's new president, said: "Whether presidents or prime ministers act in these areas or not, parliamentarians will act. The people of the world want the environment to be protected and parliaments, by their nature, are closer to the grass roots."
 
Praises From Japan
 Takashi Kosugi, a representative of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, said that the common positions taken by Globe had helped overcome resistance to environmental protection measures by the Trade and Finance Ministries of his Government.
The legislators agreed on a letter to Maurice Strong, the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, to be held in Brazil in 1992, urging that the conference take up as a primary issue "the burgeoning human population growth in the developing world." Unsustainable population growth, the letter said, threatens "public and private programs to improve health, combat poverty, raise education levels and improve the environment."
The June 1992 conference, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, is expected to play a critical role in developing global programs for protecting the environment while promoting economic growth, particularly in the poorer nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
PRAGUE TO APPEAL FOR AID FROM U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 16

 BODY:
As flags went up and a workman on Wenceslas Square painted over graffiti saying "Yankees, Get Out of Saudi Arabia," Czechoslovakia prepared today to mark the anniversary of the revolution that toppled Communism by presenting President Bush with an appeal for economic aid.
Mr. Bush is to arrive in the Czechoslovak capital on Saturday to help mark the anniversary, on the first leg of a weeklong trip to Europe and the Middle East. On the eve of the visit, Prague officially renamed its railway station in honor of President Woodrow Wilson, who encouraged an earlier Czechoslovak push for independence. 
 One year after ousting the Communist Government, Prague is looking for American help in obtaining from financial agencies like the International Monetary Fund $1.5 billion to help stabilize the Czechoslovak crown, the national currency, and $2 billion to help balance a negative trade balance.
But in the talks between President Bush and President Vaclav Havel, the former dissident who is now this country's leader, Prague will also press to set aside a State Department judgment that lumped Czechoslovakia together with the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as Eastern European countries that are "high risk" areas for travel. Czechoslovakia received the designation because of the smoldering conflict between the Czech and Slovak regional republics.
 
Inter-Regional Relations Worsen
 Since Communism fell last November, relations between the Czech and Slovak parts of the country have become seriously aggravated.
Last Tuesday, Czech and Slovak regional leaders reached partial agreement to leave jurisdiction of areas like defense and foreign affairs with the central Government. But other key issues, like the power to impose martial law and control of the railroads and telecommunications, remain disputed.
Still, in interviews this week, Czech officials stressed harmony between the republics. The head of the Czech regional government, Petr Pithart, spoke of "agreement on all substantial questions."
President Havel had lunch today with the heads of the central Government and the Czech and Slovak republic administrations, and officials close to the President emphasized the harmony at the table.
 
Warning on Investments
 Mr. Havel has warned in recent public pronouncements that national discord could jeopardize foreign investment. Officials also admit, however, that the Government must step up the pace of change.
Michael Zantovski, Mr. Havel's spokesman, said: "To attract foreign investment, capital and loans, we have to provide a legal framework and also a feeling of security for investors. Some say we are moving too slowly."
The spokesman stressed the complex legislation needed for change, including more than 40 draft laws. But he acknowledged that some critics within President Havel's Civic Forum movement have accused the Government of dragging its feet.

Chrysler Halts Plans To Make a Mini-Jeep

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Amid a worsening economic climate and pressure on automotive producers worldwide, the Chrysler Corporation scrubbed plans today to produce a mini-Jeep for lack of a joint-venture partner.
Chrysler had initially estimated that the entire project would cost $500 million. 
 The No. 3 United States auto maker had first planned to build the vehicle -- code-named JJ for junior Jeep -- as a 50-50 venture with Renault, the French auto maker. But Renault backed out in June, saying the alliance "wasn't feasible."
Chrysler tried to replace Renault with Fiat, the Italian auto maker, but talks leading toward a broad cooperative agreement, including joint production of a small Jeep, fell through earlier this month.
Although the JJ was not envisioned as an important volume seller or money maker for Chrysler on the scale of its mini-van or Jeep Cherokee, the cancellation shows how auto makers' capital resources have been strained by soft sales worldwide.
For Chrysler, the disappointment is another in a series that began when the company's performance turned downward in 1989.
A prepared statement said that "while attractive as a joint venture, the JJ project as a stand-alone program required too great a commitment of resources that are needed for higher-priority product programs."
For Chrysler's approximately 1,500 Jeep-Eagle dealers, the cancellation may be a bitter pill since they have been begging Chrysler for new Jeep models to make up for the weakness of the Eagle brand.
Chrysler said it intended to maintain a "dominant position" in the market for larger sport utility vehicles and was "studying several alternatives to enhance the value of the Jeep franchise."
Ray Scofield, sales manager of Buerge Jeep-Eagle in Los Angeles, suggested the best thing Chrysler could do would be to bring out the planned luxury Jeep model, code-named ZJ, as soon as possable.
Chrysler's stock was unchanged today at $11.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.

ACCORDS REACHED BY IRAN AND IRAQ

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 16

 BODY:
In another sign that Iran and Iraq are drawing closer even as an international alliance tries to isolate President Saddam Hussein, the two nations said today that they had reached agreement on a series of steps to end major disputes lingering from their eight-year war.
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, returning to Teheran after meetings with his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, announced the accords and told reporters that he detected a willingness by Iraq to end the crisis peacefully by withdrawing from Kuwait. 
 "They are not rejecting it, that was one's feeling," he said of international demands that Iraqi forces end their three-month-old occupation of Kuwait. "I believe that they will gradually become aware that neither the world nor the region will accept the occupation and the annexation, and that this is not something that will change with time."
Under the agreements reached in Baghdad this week, Iran and Iraq will soon resume the exchange of tens of thousands of prisoners of war who are still in captivity more than two years after the end of the war.
 
Number of Prisoners in Dispute
 The prisoner exchange, which began soon after the two nations resumed diplomatic relations last summer, was suspended in September, in part because of confusion over the exact number of Iranian prisoners held in Iraq.
In an interview with the Iraqi Government newspaper Al Jumhuriya, Mr. Velayati was quoted as saying Iran and Iraq had also made "confident steps" toward resuming full diplomatic relations, including an exchange of ambassadors, and had reached an understanding that will allow Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims to visit Muslim shrines in both countries.
Mr. Velayati was the highest ranking official to visit Iraq in more than a decade, and his trip offered new evidence of Iran's determination to capitalize on the gulf crisis by taking from Iraq now what it did not secure durng eight years of war.
Mr. Velayati also told reporters that despite the resumption of diplomatic relations with Iraq, Iran would continue to abide by economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.
 
Alliance Worries Western Leaders
 The evolving alliance between Teheran and Baghdad has worried some Western leaders, who fear that Iran might violate the embargo by shipping vital supplies to Iraq or, in a far more ominous scenario, might agree to some sort of military partnership with Iraq against the West.
The condemnation of Iraq continued unabated today in Cairo, where President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said that President Hussein of Iraq "doesn't understand the danger surrounding him -- his aides do not tell him the truth."
At the same time, Mr. Mubarak was quoted in Cairo newspapers today as repeating his call for a delay in the use of force in the gulf, saying the United States should postpone any military action against Iraq for up to three months to allow time for a settlement.
The Egyptian leader said that after consultations with envoys from the Soviet Union and China, he was convinced that neither country would oppose the use of force in the gulf as a last resort to remove Iraq from Kuwait.
In Baghdad, 16 Danish hostages were freed today after a meeting between Mr. Hussein and former Prime Minister Anker Jergensen of Denmark. Several dozen Danes are still being held in Iraq, however.
And in Beirut, a senior Muslim cleric affiliated with the Party of God called for the release of all Western hostages in Lebanon. Western diplomats here said it appears that the release of several British hostages held in Lebanon, including the Church of England envoy, Terry Waite, may be imminent, in part because of Iranian pressure on the Party of God, an umbrella organization of Shiite groups believed to be holding them.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Favored Easing At Meeting in Early October

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers agreed in early October to ease interest rates if a Federal budget-cutting agreement was reached and to permit further easing if economic conditions warranted, records released today showed.
Four weeks after the Oct. 2 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal funds rate dropped to 7.75 percent from 8 percent as the Bush Administration and Congress agreed to a deficit-reduction package. 
 The committee met again on Tuesday, and traders said today that the credit market was showing signs that the central bank had acted to drop the Federal funds rate some more.
Until recently, the Fed has been reluctant to ease credit because of fears over inflation related to the rise in oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
In fact, three of the four committee members at the early October meeting opposed an easing of rates, saying they felt "the committee risked losing sight of its fundamental objective of controling and ultimately bringing down inflation." But the increased oil prices have not spread to other costs.
According to the committee meeting minutes released today, Martha Seger, a Fed governor, also dissented from the majority vote because she favored immediate moves to permit lower interest rates.
The three who opposed any easing were Wayne D. Angel, a governor, and two presidents of Fed district banks, Robert H. Boykin of Dallas and W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland.
The majority included Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman; three governors, Edward W. Kelley Jr., John P. LaWare and David W. Mullins Jr., and three district presidents, Edward G. Boehne of Philadelphia, E. Gerald Corrigan of New York and Gary H. Stern of Minneapolis. There is one vacancy on the committee.
 
Manipulating the Rate

The Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, has been used for two years in combating inflation. It peaked at 9.75 percent in the spring of 1989 and the Fed has since let it fall in quarter-point increments to stimulate economic growth. It had declined to 8 percent last summer.
Some analysts said they thought that at the Tuesday meeting the committee might have voted to cut the discount rate it charges commercial banks for loans. That rate has stood at 7 percent for more than four years.
The committee is composed of the 7 Fed governors and 5 of the 12 presidents of Fed regional banks. It meets in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy. Minutes are released about six weeks later, a few days after the next meeting.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Drop Below $30 a Barrel

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A barrel of oil cost less than $30 yesterday for the first time in more than three weeks, as traders reacted to conciliatory talk from Saddam Hussein and to the beginning of President Bush's trip to Saudi Arabia.
Warm weather in the United States and reports of ample oil production have also helped drive prices down.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude for December delivery fell $1.34 a barrel, to $29.78. The last time the spot contract closed below $30 was on Oct. 23. 
 Market experts said the $30 level was an important barrier. Some in the market had left standing orders to buy at that price, which made it a level of strong support.
After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, oil prices began a run-up that peaked at $41.15 a barrel on Oct. 10. Yesterday's close represented a drop of 28 percent in 26 trading days. At one point yesterday oil was trading at $29.25.
"What was in the news was peace, negotiated peace," said Richard D. Donovan, senior vice president of futures trading at Lehman Brothers. "I would imagine prices are going to go down another buck or two next week," he said, adding that many people who had "gone long," or bought contracts that promise delivery in future months, were selling those contracts.
Many traders had talked about the possibility of a war in one of two "windows," between Thanksgiving and Christmas, or after Christmas but before mid-March, when the Muslim world begins observing Ramadan and windstorms begin in the gulf region. Mr. Donovan said that given the present tone of public statements by world leaders and President Bush's trip to Saudi Arabia "the first window is closing." The President began an eight-day trip to Europe and the Middle East yesterday.
At Pegasus Econometri Associates, Thomas Blakeslee, an oil analyst, said the main motivation of the market yesterday was a statement by Mr. Hussein, the President of Iraq, that he preferred a peaceful end to the standoff. But Mr. Blakeslee added, "He's made this same type of comment in the past."
"The market used this as an excuse to move toward a more 'supply and demand oriented' price level," Mr. Blakeslee said. He added that the market still had a long way to go to reach that level, down perhaps another $9.
But the fact that the market paid attention to Mr. Hussein's remark was "a good indicator that we're in a bear market now," he said.
Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington said the market was "discounting the prospect of near-term hostilities," but he added that this judgment could turn out to be wrong, and that a war would send prices right back up.
With the lull in war fears, Mr. Ebinger said another factor was exerting some influence: "The growing and deepening concern about recession leading to a fall-off in demand, alleviating pressure on the supply for the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year."
On that combination, the prices of petroleum products also fell yesterday. Unleaded gasoline closed at 77.63 cents a gallon, down 2.53 cents, and heating oil was at 84.42 cents a gallon, down 2.25 cents.
The demand for heating oil has been pushed down somewhat by the recent warm weather in the Northeast, where most heating oil is used. The National Weather Service said that in New York City fuel requirements have been 9.4 percent less than normal so far in this heating season.

HEADLINE: A Bitter Pill for Trump and Maybe Another

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
For the first time, Donald Trump is being forced to hand over a share of his real estate empire to creditors. It could happen again next month.
Yesterday's agreement to surrender as much as half of his ownership in the Taj Mahal casino to bondholders is part of a quick bankruptcy reorganization that will keep the operation running.
 Losing a part of his stake in the Taj, which Mr. Trump calls the "seventh wonder of the world," may be a bitter pill to swallow for Mr. Trump, who won a bitter fight to control it while it was still under construction. But a similar setback may occur next month. 
 On Dec. 15, Mr. Trump's Castle casino hotel in Atlantic City will again owe interest to bondholders, and Mr. Trump could be hard pressed for cash once again.
It was the Castle's inability to meet debt payments last June that led to protracted negotiations with banks, which eventually agreed to put up the cash for those payments and to allow Mr. Trump to stretch out the payments on many loans to the banks. Mr. Trump's greatest success in those negotiations was that he was not forced to give up ownership stakes in any assets.
While that bank deal was touted at the time as a five-year arrangement, it later turned out that the negotiators focused almost exclusively on the money Mr. Trump and his enterprises owed to banks, while paying little attention to the money that was owed to bondholders.
As a result, it was only a matter of weeks before Mr. Trump was again involved in debt talks, as the Taj Mahal casino was unable to make a $47.3 million interest payment on its bonds. Under the agreement reached yesterday, Mr. Trump will give up 50 percent of his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal. And depending on how much cash the casino is able to come up with to pay interest over the next 10 years, Mr. Trump could end up with 80 percent. Bondholders will get to keep 50 percent if Mr. Trump's organization avails itself of interest-rate concessions.
The Castle, the weakest of Mr. Trump's three casinos in terms of attracting gamblers, in part because it is not on the Boardwalk, has suffered with the rest of the industry from the deteriorating Northeast economy and from the competition that was introduced when the Taj Mahal opened in the spring. Yesterday, Mr. Trump declined to comment on whether he expected the Castle to meet its obligations next month.
Because the casino bondholders have mortgages on the casino properties, they are in a relatively strong negotiating position, a fact that helped the Taj bondholders to get the equity stake. Whether that equity stake will be worth anything depends, of course, on the performance of the casino in the future.
While attention has been focused on a Trump bankruptcy, in the world of real estate it is not unusual for developers to see one or more projects go under. Mr. Trump did not personally guarantee payments on the casino bonds, although he did provide guarantees for some bank loans to other Trump enterprises.
"I have some very good projects, and I have some that need work," Mr. Trump said yesterday. "These are individual deals. They stand alone."
Mr. Trump is not alone as a hard-pressed borrower. Several real estate developers have defaulted on loans, the most recent being Sam LeFrak, who did not meet mortgage payments on the Newport project in Jersey City. And Rupert Murdoch, the owner of an international media conglomerate, asked his banks this week to defer interest payments to give him time to sell assets.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about Donald Trump's debts, and another on Monday about troubles in the real estate industry, referred incorrectly to a default on a mortgage loan for the Presidential Plaza apartments, part of the Newport complex in Jersey City. Although members of the LeFrak family have an interest in the companies that own the development, neither the Lefrak Organization nor any member of the family defaulted. Other parts of the Newport project have not defaulted, and Lefrak says its financial condition is good.

HEADLINE: 3 Bids for Mexico Phone Company

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Mexican Government said today that two multinational consortiums and one Mexican group had made formal bids to buy a controlling share in the national telephone company, Telefonos de Mexico. The bids set the stage for what promises to be one of the largest and most complex sales of a government-held enterprise attempted by any nation.
Two of the bidding groups are made up of Mexican companies paired with giant communications concerns from the United States and Europe. One matches the Mexican concern Accival Casa de Bolsa with GTE and Telefonica de Espana. The other partnership has the Mexican Grupo Carso teaming up with Southwestern Bell and France Cable and Radio. 
 The third bidder is an all-Mexican consortium, Grupo Gentor. It is led by a prominent Monterrey-based businessman, Javier Garza Sepulveda, and other investors associated with the Mexican conglomerates Vitro and Grupo Industrial Alfa, Government officials said. The amount of the bids was not disclosed.
The bids for the company, known as Telmex, end more than a year of intensive preparation and screening for what will be the most important single element of the Government's ambitious program to transfer many state-owned enterprises to private hands.
If the overall value of the company reaches $7 billion to $8 billion, as expected, the sale would rank among the five largest privatizations ever carried out. It is also the first deal this large tried in a third world country of limited domestic financial resources and one that has designed the sale to attract foreign capital to a vital but neglected utility.
Through the sale, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari plans to gain not only a lot of foreign money for the Government treasury, but also the assurance that the new owners will overhaul a communications system that is now a big obstacle to modernization of the whole Mexican economy.
Only about 20 percent of all Mexican homes have telephone service, one of the lowest rates in the world. There are more than 1.5 million unfilled requests for installation and about one-fifth of the existing lines are out of service at any one time, making innovations like facsimile and computer communications difficult or impossible to introduce.
 
 No Bid by Nynex
 Government officials have said that about 12,000 complaints about telephone service are received daily.
In a surprise last-minute development, a consortium led by Nynex, the New York-based American communications company, did not submit a bid. Nynex, citing the potential for the rapid growth of Mexico's communication markets, said in late September that it would try to buy Telmex in association with a Mexican financial group and the parent company of Bell Canada. But on Thursday Nynex issued a statement saying the consortium had "decided not to proceed with a bid at this time."
A Nynex spokeswoman, Joan C. Huthwaite, said today that the consortium members had not felt "entirely comfortable" with the purchase after reviewing it in detail.
Under a plan intended to encourage new investment and strong management while preserving Mexican control of the company, the winning bidder in the Telmex sale will receive a 20.4 percent stake, representing a majority of full voting stock under a new capital structure made up for the sale. The rest of the Government's current 56 percent share of Telmex, with limited voting rights, is expected to be sold next year. The remainder of the company is already owned by a mix of private investors, and t he Government will retain strong regulatory control over the company, officials said.
At least 51 percent of the winning consortium must be Mexican-owned, and Government officials said that the foreign and domestic components of the bids would be considered separately to insure the best purchase price. This feature, they said, could lead to a reshuffling of groups before the announcement of the final buyer on Dec. 20.
"Arranging a marriage like this is very complex, and we want to be as flexible as possible," said Jacques Rogozinski, chief of the Government's Office for Privatization. "As far as we are concerned, somebody can meet their bride at the door of the church or bring her to church with them."
Before Telmex was opened to bids, Government officials reduced the company's debt, streamlined telephone taxes, eliminated cross subsidies between local and long-distance calls and consolidated labor contracts. These moves have increased the company's attractiveness to potential buyers, but the frustrations faced by Mexican telephone customers have remained intractable.
On Aug. 3, Government officials staged an elaborate inauguration of new public phones in San Bernabe, a working-class neighborhood of Monterrey. But when President Salinas picked up the phone in front of officials and journalists to place a ceremonial first call to his hometown, the symbolism was all too familiar. Try as he might, the President could not get through.

HEADLINE: Import Fall Narrows Trade Gap

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Although the nation's bill for imported oil rose to the highest level in nine years, the American trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, the first full month after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Commerce Department reported today.
The deficit declined because other imports fell, which many economists said reflected the reduced consumption of a weakening economy. 
 The 3.3 percent contraction of the deficit, to $9.41 billion from a revised $9.73 billion in August, marked the first improvement in the trade picture since June. It came about chiefly as a result of a 2.4 percent decline in imports, to $41.25 billion. Exports also fell, but the drop was smaller -- a decline of 2.2 percent, to $31.84 billion.
 
 Rate of $99.13 Billion
 For the first nine months, the deficit was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $99.13 billion, compared with $109.4 billion last year, $118.5 billion in 1988 and the record $152 billion in 1987.
"Imports are behaving the way they should be behaving in a slow economy," said Morris Cohen, of Morris Cohen & Associates, economic consultants, in Hackensack, N.J.
He predicted that because of the improved foreign trade picture -- the large decline in imports and the smaller drop in exports -- any recession would be mild. After recent talks with White House advisers and business executives, President Bush acknowledged for the first time on Thursday what many economists had said for months, that the economy might be facing a recession.
 
 Move to 'Equilibrium' Seen
 David B. Bostian, managing director of Jesup, Josephthal & Company, investment bankers in New York, predicted that the country should be moving toward "trade equilibrium over the next two to three years" because of the "recessionary climate" and a weaker dollar, which makes American products less expensive overseas, relative to goods from other countries.
Although economists caution against reading too much into a single month's figures, there was some puzzlement over the September decline in exports. After reaching a record in June, exports have fallen to the levels of early this year.
Because of delayed reactions, some experts suggested, exports could still be suffering from earlier periods of dollar strength. "It takes two and a half to three years between the time the dollar starts changing course and the time you see effects in the trade flows," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist of Nikko Securities International.
The dollar fell sharply from 1985 to 1987, rebounded through the end of last year and started sliding again this year.
Another factor could be the weakness in some big markets for American goods, like Canada and Britain, which are in or near recessions of their own.
The rise in September oil imports, to $6.2 billion, was entirely a function of price. Oil averaged $24.31 a barrel, compared with $19.54 in August and $14.50 in July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The daily market price has risen as high as $41 a barrel, and now stands at around $30. The September imports of 254 million barrels were five million barrels less than in the average of the previous eight months.
 
 Fall in Manufactured Imports
 The surge in oil costs masked an unsually large drop of $2 billion in manufactured imports. Decreases came in sectors including clothing and footwear, machinery, new passenger cars and iron and steel.
Exports of manufactured goods were virtually the same as in August, with increases in office equipment, power-generating machinery and organic and inorganic chemicals. Lower exports were reported in fertilizers and general industrial machinery. Agricultural commodities declined.
J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist, said that the deficit when calculated without oil trade, as an indicator of underlying industrial competitiveness, stood at $3.8 billion in September, down from a revised $5 billion in August. Over the first nine months, it improved even more sharply, to $35.4 billion, against $49.5 billion over the 1989 period.
The United States continued to record its largest trade deficit with Japan, but the gap shrank in September, to $3.05 billion from $3.78 billion, mostly reflecting a drop in imports. In the first nine months the imbalance stood at $29.4 billion with Japan, down from $36.6 billion last year.
There was also a sharp improvement with Western Europe, where the United States went from a deficit of $374 million in August to a surplus of $882 million in September. For the first nine months the United States recorded a surplus with Europe of $3.5 billion, compared with a deficit of $600 million in 1989 and a deficit of $8.8 billion in the first nine months of 1988.
Other large deficits in September were with Canada ($1.25 billion), China ($1.07 billion), Taiwan ($1.03 billion), South Korea ($406 million), Hong Kong ($231 million) and Brazil ($105 million).

HEADLINE: CUZCO JOURNAL;
Drumming up Tourism Is Aim of 'the Safe Peru'

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CUZCO, Peru, Nov. 12

 BODY:
Voiced in the two-mile-high air of this ancient mountain city, Carlos Milla Vidal's command sounded like an ancient Inca rallying cry: Forget Peru.
Mr. Milla is not an Inca irredentist, nostalgic for the days 500 years ago when this Indian city was the seat of the Inca empire. 
 Instead, he is a modern-day Peruvian with a business card. As president of the local hotel association, he is designing a market strategy to revive international tourism here.
 
Emphasis on Incas and Andes
 "We don't want to talk about Peru -- we want to talk about the Andes," Mr. Milla said over coffee in a hotel whose thick gray stone walls bore witness to earlier tenants: Spanish colonial governors and Inca princes.
Divorcing destination from location is a sales tactic developed in recent years by desperate managers of beach resorts in troubled countries like Haiti and Colombia. Now, the technique has reached Peru's primary tourist destinations -- Cuzco, a graceful city where most people still speak Quechua, the language of the Incas, and nearby Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas.
In the 1980's, each new report of violence by cocaine traffickers or by the Maoist guerrilla movement known as the Shining Path seemed to push the number of foreign tourists here steadily downward.
Last year, six flights a day shuttled tourists between here and Lima, Peru's capital, on the Pacific coast. Today there are only two.
"Some of the guides have left for Ecuador, Bolivia or Chile," Rosario Salinas Salas, a nature guide, said as the flutes and drums of an Andean folklore group resounded through a virtually deserted restaurant.
With the European and North American winter fast approaching, vendors on the narrow cobblestone streets here are feverishly discounting unsold bales of alpaca sweaters, scarves and mittens.
"Our only major factory makes beer," said Rosa Maria Garcia, a tour guide.
Looking at Peru from afar, many potential visitors may have missed the fine print: in a nation three times the size of California, Shining Path terrorism has largely bypassed Cuzco and Machu Picchu. About 50 miles north of Machu Picchu starts an area of almost 100,000 acres of coca-leaf cultivation. But the clandestine crop there has not generated the violence of Peru's coca-leaf basket, the Upper Huallaga Valley.
 
Half as Many Tourists
 With tourist arrivals expected to drop to 100,000 this year, about half as many as a decade ago, Cuzco boosters have started a campaign to rewrite the fine print.
Support for the regional campaign came from President Alberto Fujimori last week. On a quick visit here, he helped push a plan to channel foreign tourists directly into what local boosters call "the safe Peru."
Mr. Fujimori announced that foreign airlines and chartered companies would now be able to fly here directly, bypassing Lima.
"We can't require foreign tourists to make a stop in Lima in order to get to know the natural wonders of Cuzco and Puerto Maldonado," Mr. Fujimori said, referring to this city and to a town 200 miles northeast of here on an Amazon tributary.
Benefiting from a surge in "green tourism," Puerto Maldonado is a gateway to the new Manu National Park, a chunk of pristine Peruvian rain forest the size of Massachusetts.
To drum up international interest, President Fujimori swept through Cuzco in a motorcade carrying the ambassadors of the United States and five Western European countries.
The United States Embassy hands out a five-page travel advisory that counsels Americans to stay away from most of Peru, including its own installations. That advice came after three bombs went off near embassy buildings in Lima last week.
 
A Lukewarm Endorsement
 "We don't recommend that Americans not go to Cuzco," Ambassador Anthony C. E. Quainton said in an endorsement that hotel keepers here might find short of ringing. One American tourist was killed in Cuzco earlier this year, and several others died in the late 1980's when a train line between here and Machu Picchu was sabotaged.
But Japanese interest in Peru soared after the inauguration in July of Mr. Fujimori, a Peruvian born to Japanese immigrant parents. In recent months, two Peruvian travel agencies have set up shop in Tokyo.
Flights to Tokyo are filled with Japanese-Peruvians fleeing Peru's bankrupt economy for relatively high-paying menial labor in Japan. Flights to Lima are filled with tourists curious about the Latin American nation that chose as President a man who speaks Spanish with a light Japanese accent.
At Machu Picchu the other day, a San Francisco college teacher rested her feet from walking the ruins. Over a cup of coca-leaf tea, she talked in a way that would have warmed the hearts of tourism promoters here.
"The Shining Path?" she said, puzzled. "What's that? A religious movement?"

HEADLINE: Darman Says Bush Is Exploring Shift in Benefits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said today that the Bush Administration was exploring ways to shift Government benefits from the wealthy and middle class and concentrate them more on the poor.
In his first public appearance since the end of this fall's budget ordeal, Mr. Darman said the new budget procedures gave the Administration and Congress a fresh opportunity to focus on principles and "basic policy analysis" rather than merely on "near-term cash flow." 
 Social Security, the Government's biggest benefit program, will be exempt from the examination of how programs affect people at various income levels, Mr. Darman said. But he suggested that Medicare and agriculture subsidies, among others, might be targets for benefit redistribution.
 
Question of Politics in Plan
 Democrats scored heavily in the battle over the budget by portraying President Bush and his fellow Republicans as patrons of the wealthy and themselves as the defenders of the more ordinary Americans.
The policy benefits aside, the Administration might see a chance to regain lost political ground by proposing to limit, for instance, Government expenditures on medical care for affluent retirees or crop-support payments to big farmers and to use the resources instead on health care for poor children in rural areas.
Democrats, who depend on political support from the elderly and farmers, could be expected to oppose such changes, and that would expose them, the theory goes, as guardians of special interests. But such a strategy could backfire. In the past, Republicans in Congress have fought changes in Medicare benefits every bit as vigorously as have Democrats.
Mr. Darman said that the matter was still being explored and that it would be weeks before the Administration's economic and budget policy for next year was developed.
Mr. Darman made these remarks in answer to questions after addressing the Council for Excellence in Government, a nonpartisan organization of former senior Government officials.
 
Making Use of Word Flair
 Unlike the didactic ones he has given occasionally during his years in the Bush and Ronald Reagan Administrations, the speech was notable mostly because Mr. Darman exercised his flair for metaphors and word-coinage. He entitled the address "Neo-neo-ism: Reflections on Hubble-ism, Rationalism and the Pursuit of Excellence (After the Fiscal Follies)."
"Neo-neo-ism" is the term he gave to politicians' search for a "bold new program" to meet every situation. "Hubble-ism," a reference to the orbiting space telescope that is malfunctioning because it was not properly tested, is the budget director's word for the political propensity to conclude that "if an idea is good enough for a few and large enough to label, it is ready to be launched at full scale."
Last year, in a widely publicized speech, Mr. Darman spoke against "now-now-ism," the tendency toward self-indulgence in the 1980's. And in an introduction to President Bush's budget this year, he played with words and metaphors again, describing the Federal budget as "the ultimate Cookie Monster," because it had the same huge appetite for consumption as the character on the children's television program "Sesame Street."
In those cases and others, Mr. Darman used his word games to take the hard edge off of serious and controversial points. Today's speech had no sharp corners to begin with. His main points were that the budget law he helped drive to enactment last month would lead to deficit reduction and that the new rules putting ceilings on spending and requiring pay-as-you-go provisions in new legislation would lead Congress and the President to focus more on how to use available resources.
He chided Democrats for standing for little more than "anti-millionaire-ism," a reference to Democratic support for legislation that would place a surtax on incomes of more than $1 million.
 
Conservative Republicans Angry
 And he raised the ire of some conservative Republicans by making light of "the new paradigm," the phrase that wing of the Republican Party uses to describe an approach to meeting social problems that emphasizes individual choice, such as giving parents the capacity to select which public schools their children go to.
"The effete might debate whether the new paradigm is, perhaps, enigmatically paradigmatic," Mr. Darman said. "At the same time, in the real world, others might simply dismiss it by picking up the refrain, 'Hey, brother, can you paradigm."'
Mr. Darman has become the scourge of the conservatives, who believe he was responsible for persuading President Bush to change his mind about raising taxes, and, however jesting Mr. Darman meant it, some took offense.
Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institute based in Washington, said Mr. Darman had become a liability and should resign.
And James P. Pinkerton, deputy assistant to President Bush for policy planning, said sardonically, "After the success of the budget deal, it's good to see Dick returning to the dialogue of ideas."

HEADLINE: Chase Says Its Losses Will Rise

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation expects increased losses on consumer and business loans in coming months, assuming that the economy continues to weaken, the banking company said in a document filed early this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The warning by the country's third-largest banking company confirmed the predictions of industry analysts that many large banks face more pervasive problems than the bad loans they made to commercial real estate developers. History shows that economic downturns result in sharply higher losses for all kinds of loans, as corporate profits dry up and unemployment rises. 
 A move to lower interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has recently begun, is expected to give little help to bank profits, since they manage their borrowing and lending in such a manner that gradual changes in rates have little effect on profits.
 
 Rise in Delinquencies Seen
 The Chemical Banking Corporation, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, predicted in a separate filing with the S.E.C. that the economy would continue to weaken in coming months, causing an increase in delinquencies for various
 
kinds of loans.
 Many analysts expect that banks will be slow to reduce the prime interest rate, a widely followed benchmark for loans to small businesses and consumers, because they need to compensate for rising loan losses and other expenses, like the increase in deposit insurance premiums paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
"The Chase filing is an admission of more problems," said J. Richard Fredericks, a banking analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "It is a reminder they have more work ahead to extricate themselves from credit problems with real estate loans."
 
 Other Poor Business Cited
 He added that other parts of Chase's business were not producing the profits needed for a quick recovery.
The description by Chase of its business pospects was part of a quarterly disclosure filing, known as a 10-Q, that all large publicly traded companies make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, usually a few weeks after they have announced quarterly earnings.
As losses on real estate loans have grown more serious for banking companies in the last year, many analysts have begun to look to the quarterly filings for clues to future developments. Analysts expect that other banks will also acknowledge that they, too, expect increased losses from business and consumer loans as the economy weakens.
"The S.E.C is getting banks to be a little more predictive in the filings, and forcing better disclosure," Mr. Fredericks said.
Chase's stock, which has not improved in recent days to the same extent as other banking issues, rose yesterday by 37.5 cents, to $11.125.
In its 10-Q filing, Chase said, "If the economy continues to weaken, and conditions in domestic commercial real estate markets continue to be adverse, there could be further increases" in charge-offs for commercial real estate, consumer and business loans. The bank added that at present it had adequate reserves to cover possible losses, but it said additional reserves might be needed if the economy worsened.
 
 Higher Charges Expected
 Chase said it expected to increase in the fourth quarter the amount of commercial real estate loans it charges off as a loss, and that charge-offs would remain high into 1991.
Earlier this year Chase was hard hit by losses on commercial real estate loans, which contributed to its overall third-quarter loss of $623 million. To improve its financial condition, Chase slashed its common stock dividend and began eliminating 5,000 jobs -- a move that will reduce its costs by $300 million in 1991.
Greater losses on consumer loans would follow several years of rapid growth, which made the consumer banking business a highly profitable part of the bank. Chase is the second-largest commercial bank issuer of credit cards in the country, after Citibank. While losses on its credit cards have been low in recent years, analysts have said they expect all banks to suffer an increase in defaults on credit cards and other consumer debt when the economy weakens.
Chase noted that its earnings would be depressed in coming months by a slowdown in business lending, particularly in loans for corporate takeovers. But it said that despite weakness in the economy, its holdings of loans issued to highly indebted companies in recent years are expected "to remain sound."
 
 Reduced Corporate Profits
 Many analysts have warned that loans made in the late 1980's to highly indebted companies to help finance corporate takeovers or other reorganizations could result in major losses during a recession. Their logic is that as a weaker economy reduces corporate profits, even pushing companies into loss positions, more companies will default on bank loans.
In recent weeks many banking analysts have forecast that banks' profits will slide in 1991. Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, recently reduced by $3 billion, or about 20 percent, his estimate for 1991 profits at 35 large banks, to $11.5 billion.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER PRICES ROSE IN OCTOBER AT A SLOWER RATE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
In a reassuring report on inflation that appeared to lead to another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the Labor Department said today that consumer prices had climbed less in October than in the preceding two months. The bond market rallied in response.
About half the October increase in prices reflected petroleum costs, which have flattened lately. 
 The overall price rise, six-tenths of 1 percent, although large by most standards, was a bit better than had been expected and represented improvement from the increases of eight-tenths of 1 percent posted by the Consumer Price Index in both August and September.
 
Prospect of Lower Rates
 Apparently convinced that the risks of serious economic deterioration now outweigh those of inflation, the Federal Reserve moved today to cut an important short-term interest rate by one-quarter point, to 7 1/2 percent. This could lead to eventual cuts in what banks charge for loans to invididuals and businesses, thereby spurring economic activity.
The impact was felt immediately in the credit markets, as prices of long-term Treasury bonds moved higher and their yields fell. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 8.44 percent, from 8.52 percent the day before and 8.61 percent a week ago. [Page 34.]
Indications of a recession have come from a number of recent economic reports, like the one today that showed the trade deficit narrowed in September largely because consumers cut back on buying imports. Given all these signs, an easing of monetary policy was widely anticipated, although the timing remained uncertain.
In fact, a summary published today of the Federal Reserve's Oct. 2 strategy session showed that 3 of the 11 members of its policy-making committee were sufficiently concerned about inflation to vote against an easing of rates.
But today's inflation data followed the report last Friday that producer prices, excluding energy and food, remained unchanged in October, and the combined reports seem to have convinced the central bank that the task of arresting economic decline has become paramount and the inflation risks have become minimal.
Indeed, various analysts said the sagging economy was itself acting as a brake on prices. At the consumer level, price increases, excluding the volatile energy and food components, have now been held for two straight months at three-tenths of 1 percent.
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist for CRT Government Securities Ltd., called the figures a "glimmer of improvement in core inflation."
 
 Outlook on Oil
 In the oil industry, many executives are saying the price of oil has peaked, a view shared by Patrick C. Jackman, chief of the Labor Department's consumer prices branch. He said today that current indications were that oil would exert little, if any, inflationary pressure in the November report. That would be a contrast to the three most recent months, when oil caused the inflation rate roughly to double.
During the first 10 months of the year, the index covering all urban consumers has climbed at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, compared with a 4.7 percent pace during the comparable 1989 period. The difference is mainly attributable to oil-price increases that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August.
The main impact has been in the transportation sector, where prices rose 2.1 percent last month, with 80 percent of the increase in motor fuels. Gasoline jumped 7.7 percent, compared with 9.5 percent in September and 7.6 percent in August.
Prices of new cars rose five-tenths of 1 percent in October, only the second rise in nine months, but used cars continued to fall and now cost 1.4 percent less than they did in December 1989. A 2.7 percent jump in airline fares was mainly responsible for a 1.8 percent rise in the cost of public transportation.
Housing, the most heavily weighted component, rose three-tenths of 1 percent as fuel oil was up sharply and local telephone service climbed. The cost of cable television fell for the second straight month but was still 12.1 percent higher than in October 1989.
 
 Variations in Food
 Food in general rose the same three-tenths of 1 percent as in September, but dairy products and meats, fish and eggs advanced more sharply.
Apparel prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent, a surprise result that was partly attributed to premature discounting in a sagging economy.
Medical care, paced this time by a 1.3 percent advance in hospital costs, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, bringing medical inflation for the latest 12 months to 9.4 percent.
In a companion report today, the Labor Department said the real average weekly earnings of American workers fell 2.1 percent last month, the biggest decline since 1979.
This figure was derived from a 1.4 percent decline in average hours worked and a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in the price index that covers urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Other data showed that commodities, about 45 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose 1 percent last month, mainly because of energy. Services, representing 55 percent of the index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, down from four-tenths in September and seven-tenths in August.
Before rounding, the index rose 0.60377, a rate that if maintained for 12 months and compounded would produce annual inflation of 7.5 percent. The index now stands at 133.5, meaning that a basket of goods and services that cost $100 in 1982-84, now costs $133.50.

HEADLINE: Trump, $47 Million Short, Gives Investors 50% of His Prize Casino

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump, whose sudden financial problems this year seemed a symbolic bookend for the free-spending 1980's, agreed yesterday to turn over half ownership of his crown jewel casino to its bondholders. On top of that, the flamboyant financier must take thecasino on a brief detour to bankruptcy court, and could eventually even lose control of it.
Even though Mr. Trump faced severe troubles this spring in his real estate and gambling empire, the latest agreement, reached early yesterday morning, represents the first time he has given up part ownership in one of his properties. 
 For weeks Mr. Trump and holders of the $675 million in high-yield "junk bonds" he sold to complete his Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City have been locked in tense negotiations as a Thursday-night deadline approached for a $47.3 million interest payment, a payment Mr. Trump was unable to make. The two sides, with Mr. Trump taking the lead role in recent days, carried on marathon talks into yesterday morning before finally reaching a deal that left Mr. Trump in control of the Taj.
 
Prepackaged Bankruptcy

 To make quick changes in the terms of the property's ownership and the debt it carries, Mr. Trump and the main bondholders' group are expected to file what is called a prepackaged bankruptcy petition. Such a filing will allow the two parties to present to a bankruptcy judge a complete plan to work out payments and avoid a long, contentious court battle. It is possible the plan could be approved within months after a bankruptcy petition is filed.
In the spring, Mr. Trump's bankers spent several months chiseling out a rescue package after the developer failed to make a payment on bonds for Trump's Castle. Yesterday's plan to file a prepackaged bankruptcy petition will not have a substantial impact on that rescue package, which provided $65 million in new cash and deferred about $1 billion of interest and principal payments for up to five years.
"I think it's incredible that he went into a situation with an asset where his equity was totally under water and where the bondholders could have left him with nothing" and came out with control, said a Wall Street banker who insisted on anonymity.
Under the settlement, the $47.3 million in interest on the junk bonds that Mr. Trump failed to pay Thursday will be added to the $675 million in the principal he owes on the property. The rate of interest on that debt will be reduced from the original 14 percent to 12 percent, two percentage points of which Mr. Trump can pay in new junk bonds.
 
 Budget Limitations
 The bondholders, whose investments are secured by a first mortgage on the casino, will receive 50 percent of the stock in the Taj and will be given three of the seven seats on its board, leaving Mr. Trump with control. But for Mr. Trump to keep control the Taj must come within 15 percent of a budget approved by the bondholders. If the casino fails to produce enough cash under Mr. Trump's management, he will lose control of the board.
If the Taj performs better than the projected budgets, and Mr. Trump is able to repay his junk bond debt at the original 14 percent interest rate until the bonds mature, the bondholders have agreed to give him back 30 percent of the equity they will receive.
"For him to get back the entire 80 percent we would have to get back all our original money at 14 percent plus we will keep 20 percent of the equity for the inconvenience," said Wilbur Ross, a senior managing director of Rothschild Inc., the firm representing the largest block of Taj bondholders.
As part of the agreement, maturity on the bonds was extended from 1998 to 2000.
 
 Incentives for Performance
 Yesterday's settlement plan, like the rescue package that scores of banks cobbled together in the spring, is intended to provide the developer incentives for good business performance. If Mr. Trump is able to raise the cash the Taj produces by significant margins, he will be rewarded with the bulk of the equity when the bonds mature in 2000.
Yesterday's agreement, which must be hammered out into several thousand pages of legal contracts, was reached with owners of approximately 90 percent of the face value of the bonds. The plan is still subject to approval by a bankruptcy court judge, Mr. Trump's commercial bank lenders and the New Jersey gaming industry regulators, but if those approvals are won, all the bondholders will receive stock in the casino proportional to their bond holdings. Carl C. Icahn, the corporate raider and investor, is believed to be the single largest bondholder.
The bondholders were determined to have a greater say in governing the company that runs the casino, although Mr. Trump will remain chairman. Along with the three board members, the bondholders will put in place a committee to audit the casino, and any transaction that includes sales, mergers or refinancings of the property must be approved by two of the three directors appointed by bondholders.
For his continued management services Mr. Trump will be paid the greater of $500,000 annually or 1.5 percent of the casino's earnings before expenses, taxes, and amortization and minus capital expenditures.
"It was a long, hard negotiation and I think it will be good for everyone," Mr. Trump said at a news conference to announce the settlement.
 
 Birth of the Taj
 The Taj Mahal was initially conceived by Resorts International as a grand replacement for its original casino, a refurbished old hotel that gave Resorts a head start when gambling was legalized a dozen years ago but that had grown increasingly frumpish.
Before the project could be finished, Mr. Trump had taken control of Resorts. When he sold his stake to Merv Griffin, the entertainer who later led Resorts into bankuptcy court, Mr. Trump bought back the unfinished Taj and vowed to make it the "seventh wonder of the world." Its casino is twice the size of any of its Atlantic City rivals.
With its lavish use of marble and crystal, its candy-colored onion domes perched on the rooftops and the cast-concrete elephants standing guard at the entrance, the Taj has become a tourist attraction along the Boardwalk. But the view from the bottom line is less spectacular, as high interest expense and overhead have consumed even the record-setting revenues the casino has drawn in.
 
 Operating Profits
 Since opening in April, the Taj has produced $26.4 million in operating profits and had some interest income, but fell $29.5 million in the red after paying $58.4 million in interest on its bonds and other loans.
Mr. Trump, who has been trying to sell minority interests in several of his assets in recent months in order to raise cash that will reduce his bank debt, still has other assets that cannot meet their interest payments.
On Dec. 15, he will have to make another multimillion-dollar interest payment on the bonds for his Trump's Castle. It is unclear if he will be able to raise the money.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 5.20, to 2,550.25, in Seesaw Session

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The stock market seesawed in jagged fashion yesterday and finished higher despite a selloff of long-distance telephone issues and weakness in autos. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.20 points, at 2,550.25, for a gain of 61.64 points on the week.
Stocks got some good news when oil fell below $30 a barrel for the first time in three weeks, and there was evidence that the Federal Reserve Board had moved to ease short-term interest rates. The bond market pushed sharply higher. 
 There was also some moderately good news from the nation's trade figures and the Consumer Price Index. The trade deficit narrowed by 3.3 percent in September, while consumer prices rose by a moderate six-tenths of 1 percent in October.
 
 Increase in Volume
 Trading volume reached 165.4 million shares, up from 151.4 million a day before. Advancing issues topped declining ones, 766 to 725, while 37 stocks touched new lows and 9 had new highs. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 0.10, to 317.12.
Despite all the news, "today was largely a random session," said Michael Metz, chief market analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. Some traders felt that the Fed had not moved aggressively enough to bring rates down, he said. And there was uncertainty during the session because of the expiration of some futures and options contracts. A weekend also loomed in which President Bush would be out of the country.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, said: "Initially the market went up because oil went down and evidently the Fed cut the Federal funds rate by another notch. But the stock of MCI had been taking a beating and other telephone issues declined in sympathy. Some program trading also took the market down."
In late afternoon, though, "the positive news like the lower price of oil and easier monetary policy seemed to be gaining over the pessimistic stories," he added.
 
 Effect of MCI Announcement
 The selloff of long-distance issues "inhibited a lot of speculators and was another example of a single misstep in one stock translated into a disaster," Mr. Metz said.
MCI Communications, which on Thursday said intense competition loomed as a drag on earnings for the next several quarters, plunged 7 3/8, to 22 5/8, as the most active stock in over-the-counter trading.
A.T.&T. led Big Board active stocks, down 1 1/8, to 32. United Telecommunications, operator of U S Sprint, was second most active, falling 2 7/8, to 22 1/2. GTE lost 5/8, to 27 5/8.
In the auto group, Ford Motor dropped 3/8, to 27 7/8. Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and at Merrill Lynch lowered 1990 earnings estimates on Ford. General Motors lost 7/8, to 38 3/8, while Chrysler closed unchanged, at 11 1/4.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TENSIONS;
On the Left, Voices Amid Confusion

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
For months, the Persian Gulf crisis has invited this surprising question: What if they gave a war and no protest movement came?
While the Pentagon was presiding over the largest American deployment since Vietnam, many of the left-liberal voices known for past condemnations of military interventions spoke in quiet or ambivalent tones. Some even supported the action. 
 That is now changing, as the recent increase in American forces in the Gulf has brought sharp criticisms from intellectuals and organizers camped under the broad tent of left-liberal opinion. But despite the criticisms, many on the left disagree about what the United States should do to counter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Conservatives Are Louder
 Some of the loudest objections to the deployment have been voiced by conservatives, like the columnist Patrick Buchanan. He and several other conservatives have parted company with their traditional allies by accusing Washington of "war hysteria" and arguing that the United States has no compelling interest in the Persian Gulf.
While the split on the political right has received much notice, less attention has been paid to the evolution of thought on the left.
"I think it's extraordinary that there hasn't been a burst of anti-interventionist activity on the left," said Paul Berman, a contributor to The Village Voice, who characterizes his thoughts as ambivalent. "That in itself is a sign that there's been a great deal of debate and a lot of confusion."
The contours of that debate were outlined in recent interviews with more than a dozen influential professors, journalists and organizers who represent left and liberal thinking. Many said they were initially reluctant to criticize the United States deployment because they shared the Bush Administration's disdain for Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President. Many found much to admire in the way the Administration summoned United Nations support for its actions.
 
Growing Criticism
 But since Nov. 8, when President Bush announced plans to add more than 150,000 troops to the Middle East force, the vital signs of an embryonic antiwar movement have been on the rise, and not only among left-leaning intellectuals. Many in Congress are demanding consultation with the President on his gulf plans. Protestant churches and Roman Catholic bishops have issued sharp antiwar statements.
On college campuses and in the offices of peace groups, new plans are being made for demonstrations and teach-ins to spread antiwar messages.
"The peace movement took a long time clearing its throat," said the Rev. William Sloane Coffin, the president of SANE/Freeze, a large peace group, who initially refrained from criticizing the deployment. "But now, it's finding its voice, and I think it will be heard."
Within the movement, those interviewed said, people are in broad if not unanimous agreement on several issues. They include support for the economic sanctions against Iraq and alarm at the Administration's decision to increase the number of troops and cancel their rotations home. Many say this puts the United States on a war footing before the sanctions have had time to take effect.
 
Bigger Role for Congress
 In addition, most leftist opponents of the deployment contend that Congress should play a greater role in the decision-making, and many say they distrust the motives of the Bush Administration. The Administration has had difficulty explaining the goals of the deployment, suggesting at different times that it is to protect oil, jobs, or the sanctity of international borders.
But while many on the left say they distrust the Administration, they disagree about what the United States should do.
Some, like Michael Lerner of the Jewish bi-monthly Tikkun, a liberal magazine, say that questions about Iraq should be linked to the resolution of other Middle Eastern disputes, like the Palestinian conflict with Israel. Others, like Irving Howe and Mitchell Cohen, co-editors of Dissent magazine, have argued against any linkage.
Some, like Erwin Knoll of The Progressive, contend that the United States should withdraw its forces immediately, while others, including Daniel Ellsberg and Alexander Cockburn, support participating in a smaller multinational force to defend Saudi Arabia. Still others, including Mr. Lerner, have begun to discuss conditions under which an eventual attack on Iraq would be justified, like preventing it from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Among the factors slowing an antiwar response is the obvious one: there has not yet been a war. It took several years of actual fighting in Vietnam for widespread protests to emerge.
 
Other Considerations
 But other reasons exist, grounded in the specifics of this conflict. One is that Mr. Hussein has inspired none of the admiration that some opponents of previous wars had for the enemy or its leaders, like Ho Chi Minh or the Sandinistas. Secondly, many on the left say they found something to admire in the international character of the Administration's initial response -- seeking United Nations approval and assembling a multinational force that included Arabs.
A third issue is Israel and the danger that it would suffer from a well-armed and belligerent Iraq. Some groups on the left, particularly Jewish organizations, say this adds to their initial support for some American military role in the gulf.
Besides these factors, some say other, long-term trends have come into play.
Charles Peters, the editor of The Washington Monthly and a frequent critic of fellow liberals, argues that some of them reflexively opposed the military after the Vietnam War and then overcompensated by growing reluctant to question it. "They began to fear not looking strong on national security matters," he said.
He faults this strain of center-left liberalism for failing to distinguish between the differences in types of military response. While he supports the embargo and the naval blockade, and believes the United States should defend Saudi Arabia through the threat of air retaliation, Mr. Peters said that bringing in ground troops "invites a blood bath like we had in Vietnam."
"What has appalled me is how few people made the distinction," he said. "Where were the people who were supposed to have learned the lesson of 'No land war in Asia' ?"
 
Who Did and Who Did Not
 Those who immediately opposed the deployment of American troops included The Nation, The Progessive, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
But among the prominent figures who declined to oppose the initial deployment were Reverend Coffin, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, and Todd Gitlin, a University of California sociologist who was a leader of the protests against the Vietnam War.
In an interview this week, Mr. Jackson said the commitment of additional troops "is boxing the nation in" and making war more likely. He added that if war came, he would support a draft, so that the military was not composed disproportionately of poor people and minorities.
 
Confusion at Magazine
 In October, the editors of Dissent magazine, a journal of democratic socialism, gathered to debate the validity of the United States' presence in the Middle East. They came to little agreement, with most of them belonging to what Mr. Howe, a co-editor, called "the party of confusion."
Tikkun has attracted attention with an article arguing that a war against Iraq could be justified to protect Israel and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Mr. Lerner, the editor, calls in the article for a conference linking a reduction in Iraqi military power to other Middle East issues, including the creation of a demilitarized Palestinian state.
Mr. Lerner's willingness to support a fight against Iraq as a final resort drew sharp published criticisms from many of the magazine's contributors. He entitled his article, appropriately enough, "My Inner Conflict About Iraq."

HEADLINE: Four Senators Deny Doing Favors For Keating in Exchange for Cash

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Four United States Senators forcefully defended their political integrity today, insisting to their peers on the Senate Ethics Committee that they had done no special favors for Charles H. Keating Jr., a savings and loan executive, in exchange for large campaign donations.
Their speeches reflected the Senators' personalities, legal strategies and the varied accusations against them, but each insisted that he had broken no Federal law or Senate rule. 
 Speaking with emotion from a lectern at the side of the hearing room after being sworn in, the Senators attacked the system that puts them in a constant search for campaign contributions. Yet they argued that they had done nothing sinister for Mr. Keating, and nothing that they would not have done for any constituent.
The fifth Senator being investigated by the committee, Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, will give his opening statement on Monday.
Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, who was depicted by the ethics panel's special counsel this morning as the lawmaker who most aggressively solicited donations from Mr. Keating, recounted his 22-year Senate career and the "two-year period of much pain" brought on by the Keating investigation.
Offering few specifics about his relationship with Mr. Keating, Mr. Cranston declared, "The notion that I would risk my reputation and the reputation of this body, which I love, by raising money in any improper way is simply preposterous."
 
Painstaking Detail
 By contrast, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, spelled out in painstaking detail his involvement with Mr. Keating, and was close to tears when he left the lectern.
"There has never been a time, and there will never be a time, when somebody walks in to see me and says, 'Look, I'd like you to do thus and so and I'll do a campaign fund-raiser for you,' " Mr. Riegle said. "Let me tell you, I enjoy doing this work, but if I had to have this job on that basis I'd be in a different line of work."
Mr. Riegle devoted much of his speech to attacking the special counsel, Robert S. Bennett, calling his presentation of the case "inaccurate in many important respects." Mr. Cranston also derided Mr. Bennett, asserting that he had based his case on "some notion of ethics never adopted by this body."
As it became clear that Mr. DeConcini would be the last to testify, he asked that his address be put off until Monday, telling the committee it would be "very detrimental" to testify since two members of the Ethics Committee had to leave before today's proceedings ended.
 The two Senators who Mr. Bennett said had the least involvement with Mr. Keating, John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, were firm, but not as combative as their peers. Instead they praised the special counsel, who characterized Mr. Cranston and Mr. DeConcini as the most deeply involved, while he said Mr. Riegle was more toward the middle.
The Senators' campaigns or causes collected $1.3 million from Mr. Keating or his associates in Lincoln and its parent company, American Continental Corporation. Lincoln was seized by Federal regulators in April 1989 after they concluded that the institution was insolvent and its parent company was draining its reserves. The Government has estimated that the loss to taxpayers will exceed $2 billion. Mr. Keating has been charged with misleading investors and is free on bond.
The Senators met with regulators when they were looking into Lincoln in 1987. The five have said that their action was no different from what they would do for any constituent operating a business aiding their states' economies. Lincoln was in California, the parent company was in Arizona and Mr. Keating had business dealings in Ohio and Michigan.
 
A Chance to Reply
 The Senators have watched their standing in public opinion polls slip during the committee's inquiry of a year. More than one remarked today that he had been waiting that long to tell his side of the story.
The Senators told of meeting with Edwin J. Gray, who was head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and other banking regulators. Mr. Keating had complained that the regulators were interfering with the operations of Lincoln, which was seized by the Federal Government in April 1989. The Senators insisted that such a meeting was entirely proper.
Mr. McCain addressed the committee first, with the briefest statement. "Charles Keating was a political friend and supporter from 1981 to 1987," he said. "When he came to see me in March of 1987 and asked me to do sometihng I thought was improper, I said no. When he asked me to get Ed Gray off his back, I said no. When he asked me to negotiate for him, I said no. The only thing I said I could do was to inquire whether American Continental Corporation and Lincoln Savings were being treated fairly."
Mr. McCain was followed by his lawyer, John M. Dowd, who chronicled in detail what he said was his client's story, and accused the Senator's Arizona colleague, Mr. DeConcini, of trying to involve him further.
At one point, he said that a letter among the exhibits from Mr. DeConcini to Mr. Riegle asking that the Senator attend a meeting with regulators on behalf of Mr. DeConcini and Mr. McCain "is a phony."
 
'Thank God for That'
 Mr. Dowd read another letter that Brad Boland, a son-in-law of Mr. Keating, wrote to Mr. DeConcini last year, thanking him for his "unselfish efforts" in helping Mr. Keating and attacking Mr. McCain as "probably the biggest disappointment in my life."
"Thank God for that," Mr. Dowd said of the letter, calling it "the most powerful piece of evidence."
Next to testify was Mr. Glenn. Appealing to panel members who "have known me as a colleague for nearly 16 years," he said firmly: "John Glenn does not peddle influence. Period."
Mr. Glenn also disputed allegations that he did something wrong just because he joined other Senators at two meetings with Federal regulators who were overseeing Lincoln.
"I believe that a crucial part of my job as a U.S. Senator is to insure that Federal regulators and bureaucrats are treating people fairly and carrying out their regulatory activities responsibly," he said. "I submit that every Senator on this panel has office files full of cases where regulatory mistakes have been made and injustices against individuals and businesses have occurred."
The most dramatic moment came this afternoon when Mr. Cranston, who had not been at the hearings before, took his seat at a table in the hearing room and strode to the lectern to defend himself. The Senator, who has said he would not attend the hearings after today because he will be undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer, spoke stridently about the "shattering" experience of being accused of wrongdoing.
 "Cynics and idealists believe that we are all corrupted by the money we have to raise," Mr. Cranston said. "It's easy to make an allegation of unethical conduct; it's hard to defend against such an allegation."
In an effort to remind members of the ethics panel that they each have designated fund-raisers on their staffs, Mr. Cranston's aides set up easels with large charts listing each Senator and their fund-raising aides.
"If someone thinks politics is a dirty, ugly, corrupt business," said Mr. Cranston, who last week announced that he would not seek re-election in 1992, "he will find evidence of it -- even if he has to distort the truth to find it."
Mr. Riegle then took to the lectern, mocking Mr. Bennett for using a jigsaw puzzle in his presentation to illustrate that his case was built on many disparate facts. The Senator, chairman of the Banking Committee, held up a jigsaw puzzle of his own, and emptied pieces of it out of the box.
"It may very well be that you are never going to get this puzzle put together properly, with the pieces you have," he said. "And you may have to make a leap of faith, and you may have to make a judgment as to what you think that puzzle finally looks like."
Responding to Mr. Bennett's contention that Mr. Riegle had forgotten many key events, he conceded: "I readily confess it. I have a lousy memory."
Echoing comments by Senators McCain and Glenn, Mr. Riegle said he had no contacts with Mr. Keating after meeting with bank regulators in April 1987.
Before the Senators presented their defenses, Mr. Bennett this morning described how there were more connections between Mr. Cranston's contributions and actions than with the other Senators. He recounted four occasions when Mr. Cranston solicited or accepted several hundred thousand dollars from Mr. Keating.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Ethics Committee's Session on Five Senators

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of today's session of the Senate Ethics Committee's hearings into the conduct of five Senators in the Lincoln Savings and Loan affair. The Federal News Service, a transcription company, recorded the session.
ROBERT S. BENNETT, special counsel to the committee: This is the final portion of the evidentiary presentation, and it deals with Senator Cranston. The evidence will show that on approximately four separate occasions Senator Cranston accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from Mr. Keating for Senator Cranston's voter registration groups and that each of these four occasions was linked by time and circumstance to a request by Mr. Keating for assistance with the bank board. . . . 
 Mr. Keating, the evidence will show, or members of his family or individuals employed by him, gave about $49,000 to the Senator's -- Cranston's -- campaigns. . . . It appears that all of these contributions were duly reported to the Federal Election Commission. Lincoln also made, in addition to those contributions, a $300,000 line of credit available to Senator Cranston's campaign under unusual circumstances. . . .
Most significantly, Mr. Keating's companies contributed a total of $850,000 to groups closely affiliated with the Senator. These contributions were not required by law to be publicly disclosed, and Mr. Keating had asked that he be listed as an anonymous contributor. These groups were U.S.A. Votes, the Center for Participation in Democracy and the Forum Institute. They were funded, and what they did is they funded or conducted voter registration drives. The Senator's son, Kim Cranston, was a full-time unsalaried officer and director of two groups that benefited directly and indirectly from these contributions. . . .
The Senator potentially benefited from the increased registration of Democratic voters in California. Secondly, father and son benefited from knowing that organizations to which Kim Cranston gave his time and reputation had a solid financial foundation. And third, two of the organizations had hired the Senator's campaign finance director, Joy Jacobson, after his campaign was over. . . .
 
Contact by Keating Aide
Let's talk a little bit about Senator Cranston's initial contacts with Charles Keating. In 1984, Lincoln's Jim Grogan, who was, as I earlier stated, the principal contact of Mr. Keating here on the Hill, approached the Senator's finance director, Joy Jacobson, at the Democratic convention in July of 1984. He offered to support Senator Cranston. That comes from the Jacobson deposition, which is -- will be -- in evidence. Most of the $49,000 Mr. Keating raised for Senator Cranston's campaigns was raised in 1984 and 1985.
On Dec. 17, 1984, it appears that Senator Cranston met with Mr. Keating and Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan, who has submitted an affidavit to us, is now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, but at the time he was an independent economic consultant. And at that meeting Mr. Greenspan discussed his views of the direct-investment rule. Joy Jacobson, the Senator's campaign finance director, attended this meeting. As both Miss Jacobson and Senator Cranston agree, she had no substantive duties or expertise on banking matters. Nonetheless she was there with Mr. Keating and Mr. Greenspan because, in the words of Senator Cranston, and I quote, she would be more effective in fund raising, closed quote. And that appears at page 25 of Senator Cranston's deposition.
Let's talk a little bit about the loan that I referred to. The next significant event in Senator Cranston's relationship with Mr. Keating occurred in the fall of 1986, as his -- as you know, he was in, by his admission, a hotly contested Senate campaign, which was drawing to a close. His campaign officials were concerned that the campaign might not have sufficient funds to pay for last-minute media buys. So Miss Jacobson, the fund raiser, solicited a line of credit from Jim Grogan at Lincoln, and you can look at pages 87 to 93 of the Jacobson deposition, which will be in evidence.
The $300,000 loan was personally guaranteed by the Senator and his wife, and it was arranged on an expedited basis. Let me explain how that was done. A former Lincoln employee by the name of Gloria Cardu, who has provided an affidavit which will be in evidence, stated that she flew from Phoenix, Ariz., to Los Angeles, where she met Senator and Mrs. Cranston and a lawyer in a limousine on the tarmac of the airport. They reviewed and executed the documents as the car drove to downtown Los Angeles. When they got to downtown, Miss Cardu was let out. She returned to the airport with the documents. . . . As it turned out, the Cranston committee did not need to draw on the line of credit, and the loan was canceled without ever being used.
 
 Solicitations by Cranston
Let's talk now a little bit about the links between money and action. Mr. Keating has been roundly criticized in this proceeding, but I do think in fairness to him it should be pointed out that it wasn't Mr. Keating who was always seeking things. It is very clear from the evidence, which I will detail for you, that Senator Cranston solicited contributions and sought contributions from Mr. Keating.
The first occasion was in early 1987, when Mr. Keating asked Senator Cranston to help bring an end to the Lincoln exam.
On Jan. 2, 1987, a fund raiser, Joy Jacobson, wrote a memorandum to Senator Cranston to prepare him for an upcoming meeting with Mr. Keating and Mr. Grogan, and this is Special Counsel Exhibit 154. And let me just read relevant portions to you. The entire exhibit will be moved into evidence.
It's "to Alan from Joy." It's dated Jan. 2, 1987, a few months before the April meeting, and it reads as follows: "Cases/legislation: Now that we are back in the majority, there are a number of individuals who have been very helpful to you who have cases or legislative matters pending within our office who will rightfully expect some kind of resolution. Following is a short list of ones you should be aware of."
Miss Jacobson then just lists several individuals, and the last one is Charles Keating. She says: "Charlie Keating is continuing to have problems with the bank board and Ed Gray. Jim Grogan and the company's legal counsel, Bob Kielty, are coming in to see you on Friday at 1 o'clock to get your advice on how to handle the current problem. In addition, Senator Glenn is arranging a dinner in the Capitol the night of the State of the Union for you, Senator DeConcini, Senator Proxmire, Charles Keating and himself. Jim will bring you up to date on where this stands."
As far as we can determine, no such dinner meeting took place.
Three weeks later, on Jan. 28, 1987, according to Senator Cranston's calendar, it indicates that he met with Mr. Keating and Mr. Grogan. The evidence indicates that at this meeting Mr. Keating asked the Senator what could be done to help in ending the Lincoln exam.
A few weeks later, on Feb. 24, 1987, Senator Cranston informed officials of one of the voter-registration groups that they would be getting a $100,000 contribution from Mr. Keating. . . .
On March 3, 1987, Lincoln issued a check for $100,000 to America Votes. This was later named -- renamed -- U.S.A. Votes. . . . A month after this contribution, Senator Cranston attended the meeting with Chairman Gray.
 
 Calls to Board's Chairman
The second occasion when money was, from the evidence, linked to action was in September of '87. This was after Senator Cranston had been told that a criminal referral was being made about Lincoln. By this time, Ed Gray's chairmanship of the bank board had ended, and a new chairman, M. Danny Wall, was in place. By this time, Senator Cranston already had called Chairman Wall on at least one occasion.
On Sept. 24, 1987, Senator Cranston met with Charles Keating. Senator Cranston's fund raiser, Joy Jacobson, wrote another memorandum to prepare Senator Cranston for the meeting. . . . It says, "To Alan, from Joy." Date: Sept. 6, '87. And the pertinent part reads as follows: "Sept. 24, Charles Keating, Whip Office, 3 P.M. I was originally trying to reschedule a trip to Arizona on Sept. 18, but Keating was not going to be in Arizona on that date, so instead he is coming to Washington on the 24th. I've attached an article from The Wall Street Journal which talks about the views of the new F.H.L.B. chairman, Danny Wall, views that obviously are good news to Keating. You should ask Keating for $250,000."
When we deposed Miss Jacobson, we asked her why she chose the figure $250,000, and she testified . . . that she picked the figure $250,000 because Senator Cranston had wanted to ask for $500,000 and she didn't think -- she thought that was too much.
There is evidence, a followup letter from Senator Cranston to Mr. Keating, that confirms that at the Sept. 24 meeting, the two men did discuss Chairman Wall and Mr. Keating did agree to give $250,000. . . . And I don't want to take time to read it all, but I will make reference to: "I'm very grateful for your willingness to contribute $250,000. I've asked Joy to discuss with Jim Grogan the states in which you would most like to help." And in the first portion of the letter: "I also, of course, deeply appreciate your willingness to support our U.S.A. Votes program." And the first paragraph says, "It was a pleasure to see you and your lovely bride while you were in Washington last week and to hear that your meeting with Danny Wall had gone so well."
Six days after receiving the checks, on Nov. 12, 1987, Senator Cranston telephoned Chairman Wall. We've obtained Senator Cranston's notes, and the notes of this conversation indicate that he discussed the San Francisco regulators and told Wall that, quote, He shouldn't let personality factors cause difficulties for our constituents, close quote.
Third occasion: . . . On Jan. 8, 1988, Senator Cranston and his son, Kim, dined with Charles Keating and others in Los Angeles. At that dinner, according to Senator Cranston, Mr. Keating went into a tirade about the regulators -- that's the Cranston deposition, from Senator Cranston's deposition, page 191. The evidence shows that Mr. Keating asked Senator Cranston to make two telephone calls on behalf of Lincoln -- one to Chairman Wall and the other to a former bank official named Donald Havdie. And let me explain the evidence that supports this.
Following the dinner, Jim Grogan called Joy Jacobson and told her about it. . . . Based on this conversation, Ms. Jacobson wrote Senator Cranston a memorandum. . . . And this is what she says, and it's a little difficult to read, but: "I was pleased to hear that your dinner went so well with Charlie Keating. He has asked that you call Danny Wall and request that Wall meet with him next week. The reason for this meeting is that in September, when Charlie met with Wall, Wall said the investigation of Lincoln Savings would be concluded in two weeks. Charlie wants to know directly from Wall why the investigation is still" -- and there's a word I can't -- "still going on months later. Also, you apparently requested the phone number of former F.H.L.B. board member Don Havdie to discuss with him a conversation he had with an employee of the San Francisco F.H.L.B. office re the Lincoln Savings investigation. . . ."
The evidence further shows that -- and Senator Cranston has testified that -- at this dinner on Jan. 8, 1988, Mr. Keating offered to make another contribution to the voter registration groups. . . . So, the Senator said, on Jan. 20, 1988, within a few days of receiving Ms. Jacobson's memo reminding him about the telephone calls Mr. Keating had asked him to make, Senator Cranston made the calls. . . . Chairman Wall told Senator Cranston he would meet with Mr. Keating. . . . He did so on Jan. 28, 1988.
On Feb. 10, 1988, just 12 days after Chairman Wall met with Mr. Keating, as Senator Cranston had requested, the Senator and his son, Kim, went to A.C.C. [the American Continental Corporation, Mr. Keating's company] headquarters in Phoenix. Senator Cranston stayed at Mr. Keating's home, and that comes from Senator Cranston's deposition at page 228.
While there, they personally collected A.C.C. -- at A.C.C., at the offices of A.C.C. -- checks totaling $500,000 for two voter registration groups. This included a $400,000 check . . . for the Center for Participation in Democracy. And there's another check, in the amount of $100,000, to the Forum Institute. Six days after collecting these $500,000 in checks, Senator Cranston again called Chairman Wall about Lincoln, and this is from Senator Cranston's deposition at page 230.
The fourth occasion was early 1989, and there's evidence that on one other occasion Senator Cranston or his aide -- and we're not sure which -- solicited a $100,000 contribution from Mr. Keating at a time when Lincoln was seeking his assistance. In February of 1989, the bank board had issued a new and a very negative examination report on Lincoln, and Mr. Keating was eager to sell Lincoln before it was taken over. And the bank board had to approve any sale.
Senator Cranston and his banking aide, Carolyn Jordan, attended a meeting with Jim Grogan on Feb. 7, 1989, to discuss the sale. In February and April of '89, Senator Cranston personally contacted Chairman Wall on four occasions regarding the bank board's approval of the sale. He also called several other regulators, as did his aide, Ms. Jordan.
 
 Actions Proper, McCain Says
SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN, committee chairman: The issue of which Senator would go first, which last, and the order that they would make their presentations . . . was determined . . . by a drawing of positions. This was felt to be a fair approach. . . . So we will now proceed to hear from Senator McCain. . . .
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Once again, I'm glad to have the opportunity to fully and publicly account for my relationship with Charles Keating and my conduct in connection with April 1987 meetings with Chairman Ed Gray and regulators at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Charlie Keating was a political friend and supporter from 1981 to 1987. When he came to see me in March of 1987 and asked me to do something I thought was improper, I said no. When he asked me to get Ed Gray off his back, I said no. When he asked me to negotiate for him, I said no. The only thing I said I could do was to inquire whether American Continental Corporation and Lincoln Savings were being treated fairly.
On April 2, I attended a meeting in Senator DeConcini's office with Chairman Ed Gray to ask those questions about whether Lincoln was being treated fairly.
I asked Mr. Gray if it was proper to meet and ask questions. He said it was proper. Chairman Gray said he didn't know the facts of the Lincoln investigation, and he suggested that we meet the following week with the bank board regulators from San Francisco, who could answer my questions. I again asked if that would be proper. Mr. Gray said it would be proper.
On April 9, I joined other Senators in Senator DeConcini's office to meet with these San Francisco regulators, as Mr. Gray had suggested. There's a transcript of that meeting, which has been referred to several times already during this hearing. I'd like to excerpt again what I said at the beginning of that meeting, and I quote -- and remember this is from Mr. Black, who was one of the members of the meeting, and this transcript was taken unbeknownst to me, at least. Quote: "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. American Continental is a big employer and important to the local economy. I would not want any special favors for them." And I went on to say, I do not want any part of our conversation to be improper.
I was able at this April 9 meeting to make my inquiries. I learned at this meeting that Lincoln's complaints of bad treatment from the regulators were unfounded and that there would be a criminal referral to the Justice Department against Lincoln. That, Mr. Chairman, was the end of any involvement I had with American Continental or Lincoln Savings.
From then on, I had no further dealings at all with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. I had no further contact on this issue with other government officials. I had no contact with Danny Wall or others to support the sale of Lincoln Savings in 1989. I had no further contact with Mr. Keating or any American Continental representatives. I neither solicited nor accepted any campaign contributions from Mr. Keating or American Continental employees. My relationship with Mr. Keating was ended, over, and there's nothing more. . . . I know I acted ethically and properly and in compliance with all applicable standards of conduct, including my own. . . .
 
Glenn's Account of Meetings
SENATOR JOHN GLENN: As for my own conduct, the facts are very clear, and were fairly and accurately laid out for you yesterday by the special counsel.
On April 2 of 1987, I attended a meeting with three other Senators on behalf of Lincoln Savings, a financial institution headed by a former Ohioan, and whose parent company was an Ohio-chartered corporation.
A former employee of mine, Jim Grogan, had told my staff that Lincoln was being harassed, was receiving unfair treatment by Federal banking regulators. But my staff knew that before I would agree to go to such a meeting, I would have to be persuaded that Lincoln's complaints had merit.
They knew that because it was and is my normal office procedure, and they knew these procedures would have to be adhered to, even though they knew and trusted Jim Grogan.
As a result, I received detailed assurances from the senior partner at one of the nation's largest independent accounting firms that the still-ongoing audit of Lincoln was longer and more intrusive than he had ever seen.
In addition, I was given a copy of a 1985 letter written by Alan Greenspan, one of America's most respected economists, vouching for Lincoln's financial stability.
With this evidence in hand, I decided to attend the April 2 meeting with bank board Chairman Ed Gray. I did not talk with any other Senators before the meeting, discuss any aspect of it afterwards. And at the meeting itself, no one spoke for me. I spoke for myself, and only for myself. In fact, I went to the meeting with only one purpose, and that was to ask why the audit of Lincoln had gone on so long and to urge that the bank board reach some kind of a decision: either bring charges against Lincoln if they're warranted, or close the audit if they were not.
But Chairman Gray could not answer my questions -- in fact, claimed to know very little about the Lincoln situation. So Chairman Gray himself proposed that a second meeting be held with some of his supervisory staff on April 9, and I agreed to go to that meeting as well. As the transcript of that second meeting attests, I asked the very same questions I asked at the first meeting, but this time I got some answers. What I learned was that the Government had a very, very different view of Lincoln from the one I had received from Lincoln, the Arthur Young accounting firm and Dr. Greenspan.
Specifically, the regulators told me that Lincoln had very serious problems and there would be a criminal referral to the Justice Department. Well, that was all I needed to hear. Having received the explanation I sought, I closed my file. I told my staff I could not disclose what happened at the meeting. I instructed them to tell any of Lincoln's representatives who asked that we could say nothing about the meeting. And I had absolutely no contacts whatsoever with the bank board about Lincoln's problems thereafter.
 
 Cranston, Point by Point
SENATOR ALAN CRANSTON: With all my heart and soul, I want to make very clear certain facts that the evidence presented to you subsequently will substantiate.
One, I engaged in no unethical conduct.
Two, You know that I broke no law.
Three, You know that I broke no Senate rule.
Four, You know that I pocketed no money, that there was no personal gain for me or any member of my family. Most of the money now in question was in the form of charitable deductible contributions for nonpartisan registration drives in California and in approximately 20 other states, all conducted by organizations I did not control, all of this after I was re-elected in 1986.
Five, I never recommended, much less demanded, that any government official do anything improper or grant any constituent any special favor. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary.
Six, I did nothing that affected or delayed any government action in any way. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary.
Seven, At the two now-famous 1987 meetings of Senators and regulators: on April 2 I asked only why an audit was going on endlessly, and on April 9 I attended for only a few seconds and said nothing of consequence. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary.
Eight, I had good reason to believe that a business which employed almost 1,000 of my constituents, in my state of California, and thus benefited their families and the communities where they live, was being dealt with improperly by a huge bureaucracy which couldn't make a decision and had a reputation for incompetence. There is abundant supporting evidence. . . .
Nine, When I first received complaints regarding the way bureaucrats were mishandling this business, and for a long, long time thereafter, there was abundant substantiating evidence that this business was solvent, sound and well managed. Among those who gave me confidence in the business in one way or another were Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; two of the nation's leading accounting firms, Arthur Young and Arthur Andersen; The Arizona Gazette; The Los Angeles Times, and Thrift News.
 
 Remarks by Riegle
SENATOR DONALD W. RIEGLE JR.: I'm not interested, frankly, in Mr. Bennett's notion of what the picture looks like. I'm interested in your notion as to what the picture looks like. I think his job is to give you all the pieces and not thin them down, . . . not tailor them so that they fit a picture, and that's hard to do.
Let me go straight to the bottom line on my conduct. . . .
First, the record of facts here show that at no time did I ever ask any regulator to take any action or not take any action with respect to the regulatory oversight of Lincoln. No one contests that.
Second, the facts also show that any actions taken by the regulators, or not taken by the regulators, regarding the regulatory treatment of Lincoln was not caused or influenced by me in any way whatsoever. And the regulators themselves have confirmed that with sworn testimony.
Third, this: The record will also show that I had no part whatsoever in keeping Lincoln open a single day. The regulators will testify to that fact, as they have testified before, and they're going to testify to it right here in this room.
Now, the false charge which has helped make this story a lot bigger than it really is -- that senators kept Lincoln open two and a half years at great cost to the taxpayers, that everybody in this country has heard probably a million times -- that's just not true. Never been true. Not a shred of truth to that, but it gets printed and reprinted.

HEADLINE: Budget Gap Grows Larger In New Jersey

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Less than five months after pushing through the largest tax increase in New Jersey's history, the Florio administration announced today that the state now faces a budget shortfall of more than $600 million, and that it expects the situation to grow even worse.
The State Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, said the state was ordering an immediate hiring freeze and a freeze on major building projects while it developed plans for probable layoffs nd the possible dismantling of some government departments. 
 Mr. Berman said that a new tally of the state's receipts showed sales tax revenues down 10 percent from their expected levels in July, August and September, the first three months of the fiscal year. At the same time, he said, the state's spending on Medicaid, fuel and other items has gone up.
 
'Serious, but Manageable'
 "Clearly, something drastic happened since the summer," Mr. Berman said in a State House briefing for the press. "The situation is serious, but manageable."
The news, coming so soon after the passage of $2.8 billion in new taxes, including $1.4 billion in unpopular sales tax increases to balance the budget, brought demands from a top Republican legislator for Mr. Berman's resignation. Other Republicans said that the figures proved that the Democrats had chosen the worst possible time to begin an ambitious program of liberal social engineering and tax increases.
In addition, the new revenue estimates catch the Florio administration in a difficult political crosswind: It must now try to find hundreds of millions of dollars in savings to close the budget gaps while the public as well as Democratic and Republican legislators are crying out for tax cuts.
"The budget is just four and a half months old, and it is in a shambles," said Assemblyman Garabed Haytaian, the Republican minority leader, who has called on Mr. Berman to cut both taxes and state spending. "I want him to be fired because he is inept and inexperienced."
New Jersey's latest budget troubles come as governments around the region struggle to contend with plummeting tax revenues. In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is considering furloughing state workers to close a nearly $900 million gap, and the Governor-elect of Connecticut, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., faces a gap in next year's state budget of nearly a third of this year's $7.1 billion budget.
 
Further Erosion?
 Mr. Berman said that in the first three months of the fiscal year, sales tax revenues were down $450 million dollars, taxes on financial institutions were down $30 million, taxes on the sale of real estate were down $10 million and taxes on motor fuels were down $10 million dollars, compared with the revenue projections on which the current budget were based.
In addition, Mr. Berman said, the state had discovered it would be required to spend $80 million more than expected for increases in the costs of Medicaid and to cover new costs shifted to the state by the Federal budget deficit reduction plan.
Mr. Berman's estimate of a $600 million shortfall for the 1991 fiscal year, which ends next June 30, does not take into account income and corporate tax revenues. It is too early to calculate those receipts, he said, but if they fall off as well, the gap will be even larger.
"If the projections that we now have, which is a national recession with a clear impact on New Jersey, continue to hold, we can expect further erosion of the revenues," he said. "There will be less government services; there will be smaller state government."
Mr. Berman said the state would be able to save $295 million by freezing major building projects and save an additional $50 million by reducing travel, consulting fees and equipment purchases.
 
Won't Raise Taxes
 Nonetheless, the Treasurer said, the state will still have to find $255 million in savings from still undetermined "personnel actions," which may include furloughs and layoffs. Considering the size of the shortfall, the state may have to dismiss thousands of workers.
Although earlier this week Gov. Jim Florio announced plans to cut agencies' budgets by up to 8 percent, and possibly eliminate some departments, it was unclear today if closing the budget gap would require deeper cuts.
Mr. Berman said the state would not raise taxes. Under the State Constitution the budget of more than $12 billion must be balanced when this fiscal year ends on June 30.
Last March, Mr. Florio proposed a series of controversial taxes to fill a $600 million budget gap that he blamed on his Republican predecessor, Thomas H. Kean. By passing his tax package, including a rise of the sales tax from 6 to 7 percent, Mr. Florio said, the state would protect itself against unexpected fiscal crises in the future.
But after electoral setbacks for Democrats on Nov. 6 that were widely seen as an expression of anger at Mr. Florio's taxes, the Governor promised to rescind a tax on heavy trucks and consider rescinding other parts of the tax package. Some Democrats are expected to press for major revisions of the program when the Legislature meets next week, including an end to a new sales tax on paper products.
"Wow," said Senator Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from West Orange, when told of the new budget figures.
"It's a hard message," he said, "because you raised taxes and now the public says, "Where is all the money going?' "

The Economy
Consumer prices climbed 0.6 percent in October, less than in the preceding two months, the Labor Department said. About half of the increase stemmed from higher oil prices. Apparently persuaded that the risks of a serious slump now outweigh those of inflation, the Fed acted to cut a key short-term interest rate. [Page 1.] Fed policy makers agreed in early October to ease interest rates if a budget-cutting agreement was reached, and to allow further easing if economic conditions warranted. [32.]
 The trade deficit narrowed slightly in September, the Commerce Department said. The U.S. bill for oil rose to the highest level in nine years, but imports of other products fell. [31.]
 Four Senators forcefully defended their political integrity, insisting to their peers on the Senate Ethics Committee that they had done no special favors for Charles Keating. [1.]
 About $780.7 million in unclaimed money was collected by state governments last year. The total could reach $1 billion in 1990. [29.]
 
Companies
 Donald Trump agreed to turn over half ownership of his crown-jewel casino to bondholders. On top of that, the flamboyant financier must make a brief detour to bankruptcy court, and could eventually lose control of the Taj Mahal. [1.] For the first time, Trump is being forced to hand over a share of his real estate empire to creditors. It could happen again next month. News analysis. [33.]
 Chase Manhattan said it expected increased losses on consumer and business loans in coming months, assuming that the economy continues to weaken. [31.]
 Mexico reported three formal bids to buy control of Telmex, the national telephone company. The bids by two multinational consortiums and one Mexican group set the stage for what may be the largest sale ever of a government-held enterprise. [31.]
 The Manville trust to compensate victims of asbestos poisoning is close to approving a proposal to give its senior executives a lucrative severance package, trust officials said. [31.]
 Fred Allegretti doesn't like the price fluctuations he sees on his computer screen, and his customers don't like what they see on their bills. He heads a large heating oil delivery company. [31.]
 Chrysler canceled plans to produce a "mini-Jeep" for lack of a joint-venture partner. [33.]
 A top Daily News spokesman sallied out for the company's first head-to-head, out-in-the-open debate with some of the strikers. [26.]
 U.P.I.'s union employees accepted a 35 percent pay cut for 90 days while its owners seek a buyer. [26.]
 
 Markets
A barrel of oil cost less than $30 for the first time in more than three weeks. Traders reacted to conciliatory talk from Saddam Hussein and to the beginning of President Bush's trip abroad. [31.]
 Signs that the Fed had begun to cut interest rates lifted the credit markets. Prices of long-term bonds rose sharply. [34.]
 The stock market seesawed, then ended higher, despite a selloff of long-distance telephone issues. The Dow Jones industrials closed up 5.20 points, to 2,550.25, a gain of 61.64 points this week. [34.]
 The dollar declined broadly and settled at a new low against the German mark as lower interest rates drove investors away. [40.]
 Soybean prices were lifted by aggressive commercial and professional buying. Grain, meat and livestock futures climbed. [40.]

HEADLINE: Coping;
With the Sudden Loss of a Job

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
In scenes that are becoming increasingly common among companies hard hit by the sagging economy, employees are being called in, usually by an immediate superior, and being told they have lost their jobs.
Typically, that superior has been told not to show emotion or to get into an argument, but to explain how and where the employee can find out about benefits and services that are available. 
 This is where the process of out placement begins, an increasingly common company practice of helping former employees find new jobs. In fact, "Do I get outplacement help?" should be one of the first questions they ask when they are told they are dismissed.
 The first thing dismissed employees should think about is financial arrangements.
Continuation of the employee's benefits, like medical and hospital insurance (often six months), severance pay (often two weeks for each year of service) assume added importance today, as does unemployment compensation, which varies from state to state: finding a job takes longer in a recession.
Some experts say that for dismissed executives who were earning $75,000 a year or more, a year can pass before they find a similar job.
Outplacement, which originally provided help for high-level managers on an individual basis, has in recent years been offered to less senior employees.
Now, because there have been so many dismissals, a counselor may meet with them in group sessions.
The company pays the tab, which is often based on the employee's yearly salary. This is the sort of help that outplacement can provide:
*Individual counseling sessions, sometimes with a psychologist.
*Seminars at which job-searching skills can be relearned, like how to write a resume and how to act during an interview.
*For the dismissed employee, the right to use the outplacement firm's clerical services, telephones and office space while the job search goes on.
*Pointers on where to look, including newspaper ads, corporate directories, job advertising in professional publications and openings listed by college placement offices.
The more resumes sent, the more interviews won; the more research done, the better the chances.
James Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago firm that deals in outplacement, said managerial jobs can be found in three and a half months if job-hunters take an aggressive approach.
"The individual who goes on 25 interviews has a much better chance of being re-employed than the person who goes on only 10," Mr. Challenger said.
Unlike an employment agency, an outplacement firm will not find the dismissed employee a new job. In this, the advice from Dale Winston, the president of Battalia & Associates, a management recruiting organization in New York, is simple: "Network, network, network" -- calling friends and acquaintances, including fellow members of clubs and professional societies, to ask for advice and job referrals.
Many middle managers who have lost a job now think of turning to management recruiters hired by a company when it has a specific opening to fill. Such recruiters once showed little interest in dismissed managers because the companies with the openings tended to view jobless candidates with disfavor.
Mrs. Winston said that attitude had changed in recent years because of the numerous mergers, personnel cuts and bankruptcies that have thrown so many out of work.
So recruiters now accept resumes a little more kindly than they once did, even though they have been recently deluged with them. Many recruiters say the resumes that appeal to them go into their computers for future references when suitable jobs are available.
There are reference books like the Directory of Executive Recruiters, published by Kennedy & Kennedy in Fitzwilliam, N.H. These can be found in large public libraries as well as at outplacement firms.
Some executives make contact with management recruiters early in their careers. Building such relationships can help at the time of a job loss, at least with advice about where jobs are. Finally, optimism is important for any job-seeker, as difficult as that may be to summon up.
The Hudson Institute, the prominent research center in Indianapolis, recently predicted that businesses would face supervisory and managerial shortages just as soon as the economy regains its old momentum.

'Nutcracker' And Joffrey: Both Fine

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
The Joffrey Ballet made an exuberant return to New York on Thursday with the opening performance of "The Nutcracker," which runs through Dec. 2 at City Center Theater. The company, which survived an administrative and financial crisis in the spring that threatened to destroy it, is in top shape. And so its presentation of the holiday classic, in a production conceived and directed by Robert Joffrey with some new choreography by Gerald Arpino, is an even happier occasion this year.
This "Nutcracker," staged by George Verdak and Scott Barnard, is a fairly traditional one inspired by the 1940 version of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in which Mr. Verdak danced -- itself influenced by the original Maryinsky production. The Joffrey's staging is quite different in sensibility from the standard-setting version by George Balanchine for the New York City Ballet. There were a few too many spritzes of glitter on Thursday night at City Center, and the giant Mother Ginger doll looks like a refugee from Care Bear Land, though the production, designed by Oliver Smith and John David Ridge, is otherwise so pretty and cozy it might have been created by Currier & Ives. 
 And it drew its oohs and aahs from the audience, with some tumultuous cheering for the dancers. On the crowded, swirling City Center stage, the Joffrey's Sugar Plum Fairy doesn't stand out much as a character or even as the icon that it ordinarily is. But Tina LeBlanc's ravishing dancing, so focused, precise and filled with liquid phrasing and so technically strong and daring, made the Grand Pas de Deux one of the highlights of the evening. Part of its impact was also attributable to the partnering of Tom Mossbrucker, one of those rock-steady and sensitive partners that ballerinas must dream of. Mr. Mossbrucker's own variation was danced with pleasing clarity and the kind of modesty that, though it is sometimes counterproductive, makes the Joffrey such an endearing company.
 Another of the evening's highlights was the performance of Carl Corry in the role of Fritz, the little brother of Clara Stahlbaum, whose receipt of a Christmas nutcracker sets the ballet in motion. Replacing Edward Stierle, who was indisposed, Mr. Corry was sweetly bashful and believably boyish in a role that must be difficult to pull off on that stage full of real children. But there was nothing ingenuous about his pyrotechnics as the Snow Prince, in a show-stopping performance.
The classical elegance of Douglas Martin made him stand out in the same scene, in the Land of Snow, partnering a radiant Deborah Dawn as the Snow King and Queen. The scene's central dance for Snowflake ballerinas and male Snow Winds, interspersed with ranks of little Snow Trees who look like ambulant pine cones, is a glorious confection in which Mr. Arpino sends the dancers flying through a winter storm and gives all a typical extra, beveling edge.
There was also a standout performance from Glen Harris as Dr. Drosselmeyer, the godfather of Clara and Fritz. Mr. Harris's elegant Drosselmeyer was much younger and more dashing than the usual interpretation, with a glint of irony that made the character mysterious in a more contemporary way. One of the evening's poetic moments occurred when Mr. Harris, suddenly visible behind the glitter-eyed owl that crowns the clock in the Stahlbaums' Victorian parlor, circles his head slowly in the dim light like a creature in brief contact with another, more familiar world.
In the second-act divertissements, Beatriz Rodriguez looked, enticingly, as if she knew a secret or two as Chocolate from Spain, and Mr. Martin and Julie Janus made a sensuous, expertly intertwining pair in the Coffee from Arabia duet. Tea from China was danced with spirit by Cynthia Giannini and Mr. Corry. Linda Bechtold's flashing grins epitomized the hurlyburly excitement of the Nougat from Russia quartet, also danced by Alexander Brady, Brent Phillips and Joseph Schnell. The lead cast was completed by Mary Barton as little Clara and Thomas Morgan as the King of the Mice.
And through the evening there was dancing with an extra sparkle from Valerie Madonia in Mr. Arpino's pretty Waltz of the Flowers and as an eye-catchingly tender parent in the opening party scene; from Meg Gurin as the mechanical Columbine doll and a Marzipan Shepherdess, and from Peter Narbutas as the mechnical Harlequin doll and an ardent Snow Wind.
The orchestra did itself proud under the direction of Allan Lewis, who drew some especially magical sounds from the percussion section. The singing of the Boys Choir of Harlem was celestial. And the Joffrey Ballet School had reason to be proud of the dancing children of "The Nutcracker."

HEADLINE: On Iraq's Other Front

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman; Clyde Haberman, the Rome bureau chief for The New York Times, reports frequently from Turkey.

 BODY:
THE DUST-SWIRLED TOWN OF SILOPI LIES along a stretch of blacktop that Turks call the Silk Road. It isn't quite as glamorous perhaps as the ancient Silk Road that linked China to the West, but it carries the same whispers of prosperity and hopes of lasting security.
The highway runs east-west through southern Turkey and into Iraq. Silopi is the last Turkish town for truck drivers heading to the Iraqi border, 10 miles away at the foot of rugged humps of sandy mountains that separate the two neighbors. 
 In better times, 4,000 or more trucks a day would pass through Silopi to and from Iraq, bringing fuel and plenty of cash, which the drivers spread around the shops that line the Silk Road for many miles.
But when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, the music died for Silopi and other towns all along the road. Turkey wasted no time in joining the international blockade of Iraq. And when the truck traffic stopped, so did Silopi. These days, townsmen spend empty hours in cafes, sipping strong coffee and tea, denouncing President Saddam Hussein of Iraq but cursing the embargo as well.
So much for whispers of prosperity.
The scene is basically the same 20 miles up the road in Cizre. But there, the active young Mayor, Hasim Hasimi, voices another fear: that Hussein would not hesitate to use chemical weapons if war broke out. That could make early casualties of Cizre's 50,000 people, Hasimi says with a glum look as he strolls across his small garden.
"This guy Saddam could do it -- we're all agreed on that," he says. "And we will be the first to feel it. We don't have gas masks or bomb shelters. Even our doctors don't known much about the impact of chemical weapons."
So much for hopes of lasting security.

IN THE TURKISH CAPITAL, ANKARA, 600 miles away, a senior Government official sat up in his chair and waved aside the possibility of an Iraqi threat. "They would not dare attack an Ottoman," he said. Few Turks still refer to themselves by the name of the long-gone empire. His use of "Ottoman" may have been intended as mild irony. Nonetheless, it was an effective reminder that time was when these trouble spots, Iraq and Kuwait, were not countries but mere outposts of the far-flung Turkish realm.
Other officials admit to being deeply worried about the Iraqi menace. Either way, no one disputes that Turkey, a NATO member, has put itself on the front line in the United States-led campaign to isolate Iraq.
When Washington needed allies in August, President Turgut Ozal said to count on him. A few days after the invasion of Kuwait, the Turks moved to shut twin pipelines stretching across their southern tier to the Mediterranean that carried more than half of Iraqi oil exports. Bowing to the will of the governing Motherland Party, an unruly coalition that Ozal controls, the Parliament handed the executive branch the power to dispatch Turkish soldiers abroad and to let foreign troops onto Turkish soil. A detachment of American F-111 fighter jets has been allowed to remain at a Turkish air base instead of returning to their station in Britain, as scheduled, after a training exercise. The Turkish Army has increased its strength near the Iraqi border to upward of 100,000 men, pinning down Iraqi forces that otherwise could be sent southward to face American soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
For Turkey, these are no small steps. Indeed, Ozal has come under domestic fire for exceeding the ceremonial role of his office and for violating the country's tradition of extreme caution in foreign affairs. Most of all, his critics complain, he broke a cardinal Turkish rule forged over centuries of empire building and losing: Only grief can come of getting involved in Arab squabbles. Both the Foreign and Defense Ministers resigned largely to protest Ozal's handling of the gulf crisis. But his decision prevailed.
Economically, the anti-Iraq embargo has cost hard-pressed Turkey dearly. Officials figure that the country stands to lose at least $7 billion a year in trade, pipeline fees and foreign investment. Relations with an unpleasant neighbor have been poisoned for a long time, no matter how the crisis ends. And if Mayor Hasimi's worst fears about chemical warfare are realized, Turkish civilians could pay a terrible price.
So Muslim Turkey, with a toehold in Europe but the rest of its expanse lying squarely in Asia Minor, expects the United States and its Western allies to remember its sacrifices when it comes time to take stock of their friends. Too often, the Turks feel their good deeds have been too quickly forgotten. "Turkey has always felt itself on the threshold of loneliness," says Bozkurt Guvenc, a professor of anthropology at Hacettepe University in Ankara.
What Turks crave is international respect, something they feel they are too often denied. The gulf situation, for all its perilous potential, has at least bolstered their image.
Just a day before the Iraqi invasion, many people were writing off Turkey's strategic importance as a thing of the past. A popular line of reasoning went like this:
For decades, the country's geopolitical strength lay mainly in its position as NATO's eastern bulwark against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Except for the United States, Turkey, with 635,000 troops, has the largest armed force in the Western alliance. But with the cold war over, it was argued, what use are all those soldiers to the West? And if its military trump card was indeed gone, what chance would Turkey have to join the European Community, an objective that amounts almost to a holy mission?
In a single day, Saddam Hussein changed that thinking. Suddenly, the West reawakened to the fact that Turkey, at the edge of the Arab Middle East, has a continuing and vital strategic role. A simple look at the map makes that plain.
Few countries are surrounded by so many traditional rivals. To the north is the Soviet Union, to the west Greece and Bulgaria. And to the east and south lie three of the world's nastiest regimes -- Iran, Iraq and Syria. Turkey may no longer be needed to help fight the cold war, but it remains the Atlantic alliance's point man in the Middle East.

THE TURKISH ARMED forces would certainly never be willing to fight except within a NATO or United Nations framework, and military specialists agree that the Turks, on their own, would not fare well against battle-hardened Iraq.
They rely heavily on conscripts who stay on active duty for only 18 months. Since World War I, the army has seen sustained combat only twice, when it joined the United Nations force in the 1950-53 Korean War and when it invaded northern Cyprus in 1974. The main battle experience of its soldiers in recent years has come in sporadic skirmishes with Kurdish guerrillas demanding a separate state in the southeast. Moreover, the military is hobbled by obsolete weaponry. Turkey, the loyal ally, curiously enough, has found it relatively hard to obtain financing to buy the modern equipment that the West managed to give Saddam Hussein.
"I hate to think what would happen if the Turks were to go one-on-one against Iraq," a Western military expert said.
Still, serving as NATO's tripwire against an Iraqi attack gives Turkey new importance. So does its apparent, if not explicitly stated, readiness to let the United States use Turkish bases if war comes. The main installation, the Incirlik air base near Adana, a southern city, normally has a contingent of 5,000 Americans to provide backup for pilots who are stationed elsewhere in Europe and who use the base for training maneuvers.
In return for their help, the Turks have tangible goals that go beyond a pat on the head from foreigners about what stalwart fellows they are. Above all, they want the European Community to approve their membership application, and there is muted hope that the gulf crisis may alter the equation a bit.
The application was submitted in 1987 and rejected, politely but firmly, last December. Knock on our door again in 1993, the 12 existing community members said, after we have finished our vaunted economic integration. In off-the-record conversations, European diplomats allow that the Turks' prospects will remain dim for quite a while. Let's face it, they say, Turkey is too poor, too populous, too Muslim, too harsh, too culturally different, too everything.
Turkey's leaders are not fooling themselves that, just because they quickly joined the embargo of Iraq, Western Europe will suddenly admit them into the club. "Europe comes to us for help only when its backside is on fire," a senior official said. When the crisis ends, he fretted, Turks will probably be put back "in our place," and that might even include having to stand behind Eastern European parvenus like Hungary and Czechoslovakia on the European Community application line.
Nevertheless, Turks feel that they hold a strengthened hand for now, and they have an i.o.u. for the United States as well. They want the Americans to import more Turkish textiles and to provide them with dozens of F-16 fighters and other military hardware. Down the road, they would like a change in a formula that guarantees Greece, its archrival, $7 worth of American military aid for every $10 that Turkey gets. The Turks view the arrangement as unfair capitulation to a powerful Greek lobby, given that their armed forces are three times the size of Greece's and face many potential enemies.
At the core of these requests lies that yearning for respect.
Turkey's nationalism is virulent, and it sometimes seems as if it is shared by every one of its 57 million people. They greatly resent it that the very word "Turk" for many foreigners has long conjured up images of a backward place where torture is the national sport.
Regardless of political persuasion, Turks bristle when the United States Congress periodically considers a resolution referring to Turkish genocide in the killing of hundreds of thousands of Armenians in World War I, as the Ottoman Empire tottered toward collapse.
No one denies that Turks massacred Armenians. In Turkey, the most common figure for the death toll is 300,000. That is far from the 1.5 million victims generally claimed by Armenian groups, and the dispute has its odd tones. In dismissing the higher number as an outrageous exaggeration, Turks sometimes sound as if they believe that 300,000 is not such a terrible total, all things considered.
More to the point, they complain that "genocide" is a loaded word, and insist that the Armenian deaths were not the result of a deliberate extermination campaign. It was a period of general mayhem, they say, with many people killed on both sides. As Turkey sees it, a resolution on Armenian genocide like one Congress considered and then voted down in February is an unnecessary dredging of old waters and a gratuitous insult to a faithful ally.
Contributing to the Turks' troubles is a sorry human-rights record that makes it easier for Westerners to think the worst of them. While their performance is light years ahead of those in neighboring Middle Eastern states, it still falls far short of Western standards.
During three years of military rule in the early 1980's, hundreds of thousands of people were tortured, human-rights groups say. Although the situation has vastly improved, the present Government is nonetheless accused of foot-dragging on carrying out accords that Turkey itself signed. Amnesty International says that in 1989, it received hundreds of reports of torture from political prisoners, who described methods like electric shock, hosings with cold water and beatings on the soles of their feet. Police officers are often said to be casually brutal, more so than prison guards.
The Government also has a dubious record when it comes to free speech, even though Turkey boasts a lively press that shows no reluctance to criticize Ozal and others in authority. The police regularly arrest citizens who espouse left-wing causes, or challenge the country's secular principles too zealously, or write articles deemed overly sympathetic to the Kurdish separatists. This fall, a 16-year-old girl in Istanbul was arrested -- and, her sister said, possibly tortured -- for writing "No to war" on school walls.
A flint-hard line has been drawn in the battle against the Kurdish guerrillas. Last April, in an extraordinary delegation of power, the Government gave the regional governor for 11 southeastern provinces the authority to evacuate entire villages and to confiscate the printing presses of any publication whose articles he feels could undermine security operations. His decisions may not be appealed in court. In this atmosphere, editors of at least 17 left-wing publications have been arrested, and mainstream newspapers admit to self-censorship to avoid possible run-ins with the authorities.
All this notwithstanding, many Turks complain that Americans and Europeans are too quick to criticize, always ready with a lecture on how to treat one's fellow man, but slow to lend a hand when one is needed. Even human-rights advocates feel that way. "There is a double standard applied against us," said Nevzat Helvaci, secretary general of the Turkish Human Rights Association.
Helvaci tells of two Kurds who came to him asking for help in moving to Western Europe. They were among some 60,000 Kurds who had fled into Turkey two years ago after Saddam Hussein's soldiers attacked their villages in northern Iraq with chemical weapons. About 30,000 refugees remain in Turkish camps whose spare conditions are routinely deplored in Europe.
"We asked European countries to take the two Kurds," Helvaci recalled, "and they kept saying no. They said they had done all they could. The Dutch Embassy said they had already accepted 11 Kurds, and that was too many. Eventually, these two went to Germany. But usually Europe just criticizes, and doesn't help."

IT IS A SPRAWLING country, twice the size of California and just as varied, with fertile plains, barren wastes, languid Aegean islands and imposing mountains that include Mount Ararat.
It is also a land of striking social contrasts.
Istanbul, city of minarets and once the capital of Ottoman sultans, is now a bursting metropolis spread across both sides of the Bosporus. Its eight million people include a large affluent middle class that is thoroughly Westernized, with a taste for Vuitton bags and CNN television. But go to Diyarbakir, capital of Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast, and you are in the Middle East, surrounded by horse-drawn carts.
Turks can be harsh to those on society's margins, yet also remarkably generous to strangers. Heading to a late dinner in Ankara one night, I was left by a taxi driver at a building that, I discovered too late, was far from where I was supposed to be. I knocked on a door to ask for directions. The man who answered was in his pajamas and had already gone to bed. Nevertheless, he signaled for me to wait while he got dressed, and then walked me many blocks to my intended destination.
Turkey's leaders think of themselves as Europeans, yet their country struggled along on an average per-capita income last year of only $1,435. Taking care of basic needs is a formidable task. The population will reach 83 million by 2005, if its annual growth rate of 2.5 percent continues. It would be greater than any European country, including reunified Germany. Simply to absorb all the new entrants into the work force requires an economy that expands by at least 5 percent a year.
Through most of the 1980's, the Turks managed to keep pace. Last year, the economy suddenly went flat, partly because of drought-induced disasters in agriculture. But Turkey has bounced back, and, despite sharply higher fuel costs brought on by the gulf crisis, the Finance Ministry forecasts 9 percent growth for 1990.
At outdoor stands and in countless small shops, the commercial energy is almost electric, notably in and around the labyrinthine central bazaar of Istanbul. One can buy almost anything there, from antique Persian rugs to the latest electrical appliances, from slices of halvah to shares on the fledgling stock exchange.
Much growth over the last decade can be credited to Turgut Ozal. He was chief economic planner after the country fell under military rule in 1980, and then became the first civilian Prime Minister after the junta dissolved itself in 1983.
Until he came along preaching a form of the free-market gospel according to Reagan and Thatcher, the Turkish economy was state-run and insulated. In the 1970's, shortages of staples like oil and coffee contributed to a cycle of violence that finally persuaded the generals -- and many civilians -- that the army had to reimpose order.
Ozal's Government lifted heavy-handed regulations and promoted exports. It encouraged a turnover of state enterprises to private hands. It lured foreign investment and emphasized tourism. Until then, foreign exchange had come mostly from money sent home by the 2.5 million Turkish workers and businessmen who migrated to Western Europe.
Most visible of all, Ozal ordered basic improvements that were desperately needed, especially in the east, where incomes are less than half the national average. Electricity, once barely known in many areas, has been extended everywhere. In 1983, only one-third of Turkey's 34,500 villages had telephones; now they all do. The most ambitious project is a $21 billion program for the semiarid southeast. It envisions the construction of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric stations to create, in the expansive words of one Cabinet minister, "a new Fertile Crescent."
But success has a price, and for Turks it is rampant inflation. It came close to triple digits two years ago, receding to a still-galloping 64 percent in 1989. This year's official forecast is 45 percent, but the effects of the gulf crisis put that figure into question.
Inflation has strained national harmony. Increasingly, the state and big companies are locked in struggles with workers who find that, despite hefty wage increases, they keep losing ground. Moreover, inflation accentuates fundamental imbalances and the fact that Turkey is still a developing country -- basically agricultural, industrially weak and thin in social programs that the West takes for granted.
In turning down the Turks' application, the European Community noted that their purchasing power is one-third the community average and that the gap is not likely to shrink soon, given the fast-growing population.
Turkish officials say the Europeans have it backward: Europe keeps getting older and will need the dynamism that a populous Turkey can provide, they argue. Despite the negative signs, optimists abound.
"I think we will catch the E.C. train," said Hasan Cemal, editor of Cumhuriyet, a liberal newspaper. "Maybe it will be the last cars, but we will catch it."

MODERN TURKEY WAS and still is defined by Mustafa Kemal, who became a national hero in World War I when his forces defeated the British at Gallipoli. Otherwise, that war was a disaster for the Turks. They made the mistake of siding with Germany. Defeat in 1918 sealed the death of the already-moribund Ottoman Empire.
From its ashes the present republic rose in 1923, founded by Mustafa Kemal, who had assumed the name Ataturk, or Father of the Turks. Convinced that his Muslim country had to turn westward and reduce Islam's rigid and antimodern influences, he put teachers of religion and imams under state control. He replaced Arabic script with the Latin alphabet. He banned the fez and the veil.
In short, he imposed strict secularism -- no interference of Islam in state affairs. Kemalism remains the nation's guiding principle, so strong that it has become a form of religion. Ataturk's resolute image is hard to escape. His portrait -- sometimes in uniform, sometimes in a fur-collared coat, sometimes in white tie and tails -- hangs on the walls of every public building and in many private houses. To speak out against Kemalism is to invite arrest.
While some Westerners might see this personality cult as a repression of legitimate religious instincts, Ataturk's legacy has enabled Turkey to make economic and democratic strides unknown in any other dominantly Muslim country. With only an occasional lapse, the country has also been scrupulously tolerant of the few Christians and Jews in its midst. Looking at such gains, secular Turks wonder why anyone would challenge a successful formula.
That is why they are appalled by a steady rise of Islamic fundamentalism. In fact, Turkey began retreating from strict Kemalist ways not long after Ataturk's death in 1938. But a religious surge in recent years, said to be financed in part by Iran and Saudi Arabia, goes much further.
According to the Government, 42,511 Turks made the annual pilgrimage to Mecca this spring compared with 25,644 some 10 years ago. In a country where Islamic education was once prohibited, there are now nearly 400 religious schools, five times the number 15 years ago. Their graduates have started to fill important positions in the Interior Ministry, which supervises the national police. Increasingly, dining rooms in public buildings shut down during the Islamic fasting period.
For the last few years, Turkey has been jolted by thousands of young women who, flouting a ban, insist on wearing Islamic head scarves on university campuses. A middle-aged professional woman in Ankara, like many other secular Turks, confesses that the scarves make her uneasy.
For all that, there is little fear of a Khomeini-style revolution within the largely Sunni Muslim population. Fundamentalist political parties draw a small share of the vote, and imams lack a powerful voice. "People still think that religion is something private between them and their God," said Necdet Serin, the rector of Ankara University.
Besides, if all else fails, the army is standing guard as a self-styled protector of Turkish secularism. It has staged a coup roughly every decade over the last 30 years -- in 1960, 1971 and 1980 -- and it is widely presumed to be ready to intervene again if it feels that extremists threaten Kemalist verities.
There is no evidence that the army is gearing for action. And yet other types of trouble contribute to parlor speculation about a possible coup. After a decade of tranquillity, Turkey is again confronted with a wave of political murders that seem the work of both left-wing and religious militants. Sixteen people have been killed this year, including outspoken politicians, lawyers, professors and journalists. Their deaths revive memories of the 1970's, when urban guerrillas killed more than 5,000 people, and the army felt compelled to step in. For now, however, the violence is comparatively mild. In the 1970's, 16 deaths, on average, were reported every three or four days.

NO MODERN turkish leader has been more open about his Islamic beliefs than Turgut Ozal, who often attends Friday prayers and caters to the religious wing of his ruling Motherland Party. Nor has any leader of recent vintage dominated Turkish politics like him.
A short 63-year-old man who runs to serious overweight, he is a technocrat-turned-politician with a passion for following world events through CNN, often using a remote-control device to turn up the sound even when he is being interviewed.
That is not to say he is popular; his opinion polls have been disastrous for several years. At one point, his approval rating dropped almost into the single digits, though it has improved since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. High inflation greatly eroded his strength, as did a pervasive weariness with his bluff style and sultan-like tendencies in appointing relatives to high positions. When the Defense Minister quit in October to protest the Government's handling of the gulf crisis, Ozal's nephew got the job.
But Ozal is the only Turkish politician with power, and many foreign diplomats feel he is also the only one with a global vision. In 1989, he used his party's commanding majority in the Grand National Assembly to have himself elected president, a seven-year position that has little inherent authority but provides wondrous job security for someone with terrible ratings. The main opposition groups screamed in outrage. Given Ozal's negative polls, they argued, his maneuvering was a defiance of public opinion and therefore undemocratic. But the move was totally legal, and the weak opposition had to acquiesce.
Now, even in the ceremonial presidency, it is Ozal who runs the Government, not the Prime Minister he installed, Yildirim Akbulut. It is Ozal who guides Turkey in the gulf crisis, Ozal who receives the phone calls from President Bush.
Foreigners arguably are more impressed with Ozal than the Turks are. He won high marks abroad for making an official visit to Athens two years ago in an attempt to improve relations with Greece. That effort has not produced much, though. Greeks and Turks are as divided as ever, especially over Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus.
More successfully, Turkey is forging a new relationship with another old enemy, the Soviet Union. Two-way trade expanded last year to $1 billion. To the west, tensions have been sharply reduced with Bulgaria since the new Government there abandoned the forced assimilation of ethnic Turks, a Communist policy that drove 310,000 Bulgarian Muslims to seek refuge across the border last year.
With Turkey's Middle Eastern neighbors, relations are trickier. Iran is seen as an exporter of unwanted fundamentalism. Syria and Iraq grumble that the Turks threaten their water supplies with a new dam at the headwaters of the Euphrates River, the lifeline of ancient Mesopotamia. In turn, Turkey accuses the Iraqis and Syrians of sheltering Kurdish rebels in the southeast. More than 2,000 people have been killed in the Kurds' insurrection since 1984, and while the rebels have almost no chance of defeating the Turkish Army, they seem to be winning sympathy from villagers in the region.
There are about eight million Kurds in Turkey, concentrated in the southeast, where until recently, the authorities refused to accept them as even a distinct ethnic group. They were not called Kurds but rather "mountain Turks." Their language was forbidden in public buildings and not taught in the schools. Some restrictions have been eased in the last few years, but villagers continue to resent mistreatment at the hands of Government troops even if they fear the guerrillas just as much.
The Kurdish problem could become Turkey's Achilles' heel, and from one perspective it already may be. Kurdish leaders and their supporters account for a high percentage of torture victims, human-rights advocates say. The European Community cited Turkey's human-rights shortcomings as a big reason -- almost as important as the economy -- for rejecting the country's membership application. It is clear that as long as the words "Turk" and "torture" continue to be linked, Western Europeans will remain convinced that Turks indeed belong to a different tribe.
But then, in towns like Silopi and Cizre, they already know they are different. They are the people in between, they say, neither European nor Arabic, neither West nor East. They despise Saddam Hussein, but they also have little use for Europe's preaching. Words are important but not everything, they say. Deeds count, too. Whose bodies, they ask, are now on the front line?

HEADLINE: A Mountain of Trouble

BYLINE: BY WILLIAM J. BROAD; William J. Broad is a science reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
YUCCA MOUNTAIN IS A BARREN, flat-topped ridge rising out of the Nevada desert. Located 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, it stands amid a desolate expanse that is broken every so often by a Joshua tree or yucca plant. The mountain rises some 1,500 feet and runs six miles or so. Within two decades it could hold the most dangerous nuclear facility in the world.
The Government plans to build a dump inside Yucca Mountain for the most highly radioactive nuclear waste in the nation. The job is considered urgent. More than four decades after the start of the nuclear era, there is no permanent place to put the vast and rapidly growing accumulation of the most lethal of America's nuclear refuse -- the spent fuel rods and radioactive debris that constitute a largely forgotten legacy of this country's conquest of the atom. The nation has sites for the storage of low-level waste -- and one, under construction in Carlsbad, N.M., for some higher-level military byproducts -- but none for the most deadly substances of all. 
 The Government wants a final burial place for these items, now stored at Federal sites for nuclear weapons production and at many of the nation's 111 operating nuclear power plants. It wants a repository that will keep them isolated from the earth's environment for 10,000 years, until radioactive decay has rendered them less hazardous than they are today.
Yucca Mountain is the last candidate, selected after a stormy, decades-long, multibillion-dollar search that crisscrossed much of the nation and eliminated dozens of other potential sites, often for reasons of politics rather than science. Today, the site's 1,800 federal and contract workers feel great pressure to stay on schedule in assessing the site's suitability and planning the repository, which would be a labyrinth of tunnels up to 115 miles long. Its cost is expected to be up to $15 billion, some $1 billion of which has already been spent. If everything goes according to plan, it will open for business in 2010.
At first glance, Yucca Mountain seems perfect for the job. Its main virtue is aridity. The Nevada desert is one of the driest places in the United States. The water table beneath Yucca Mountain is unusually low, a third of a mile down. By contrast, the water table in the East can be within a dozen feet of the surface. In theory, canisters of radioactive waste (which are very hot both physically and radioactively) could be deposited deep inside Yucca Mountain and still be hundreds of feet above the water table, safe and dry for thousands of years, unlikely ever to contact or contaminate ground water, unlikely ever to spread radioactivity.
One scientist, however, has quietly but persistently warned that this vision of a safe repository is little more than a delusion.
Jerry S. Szymanski (pronounced sha-MAN-ski) is a geologist who works on the Yucca Mountain project for the United States Department of Energy, which is in charge of evaluating the site and would run the repository. For years, he has argued that ground water under the mountain could eventually well up, flood the facility and prompt a calamity of vast proportions. The geological action is easy to visualize. Crustal stresses in the area slowly open fractures and faults under and within the mountain. Water seeps into them. An earthquake occurs, compressing the fractures and forcing the ground water upward into the dump. As the inrushing water comes into contact with the hot canisters of nuclear waste, the water is vaporized, threatening to cause explosions, ruptures and the release of radioactivity.
Szymanski has worked for the D.O.E. since 1983. He takes pains to distance himself from foes of nuclear power. "This report is not the act of a disgruntled employee or an antinuclear freak," he wrote in the preface of a study he made on Yucca Mountain. "Rather, it is the act of a deeply concerned scientist, a public servant and a pro-nuclear activist."
He chain-smokes Winstons and drinks Scotch, neither of which seems to impair his ability to take brisk hikes up the mountain with his dog Max, a fierce-looking but friendly creature that is half Labrador, half pit bull. Szymanski's eyes flash when he speaks of those who oppose his view of the evidence. "It's banality of thought," he growls, "absence of depth." That same kind of banality, he says, was responsible for the Holocaust, around which his earliest memories revolve, and for a brutal crackdown in his native Poland, which prompted him to flee that country two decades ago with his wife and 6-month-old son. Today, he says, banality is prompting the Federal Government to court disaster.
Squinting in the bright Nevada sunlight, a cigarette firmly in his mouth, Szymanski walks into Trench No. 8, a deep scar on the side of Yucca Mountain dug at the behest of the Energy Department. It runs across a fault. He bends down to examine a one-yard-wide vein of rock whose creamy color stands in contrast to the dark, surrounding earth tones. His fingers play over its surface. The vein was deposited, he says, by mineral-laden water that welled up and turned this desolate site into an oasis.
"This is above the repository level," he says with studied understatement. The implication is clear and troubling -- where water once flowed, it might flow again.
The repository would hold up to 70,000 metric tons of waste. A large release would have an environmental impact that, by some estimates, would exceed that of a nuclear war. For perspective, the explosion of the Chernobyl reactor in the Soviet Union shot into the atmosphere just a few dozen pounds of highly radioactive nuclear waste, one of the most dangerous components of which was cesium 137 (it would also be a significant part of the waste at Yucca Mountain). Various studies say the consequences of Chernobyl will eventually be somewhere between 17,000 and 475,000 deaths from cancer, as well as an alarming number of serious ailments.
For half a decade, Szymanski's was a lone voice. His grim appraisal was opposed by almost everyone else on the Yucca Mountain project, who let their displeasure be known in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. But recently, growing ranks of geologists have backed his view. The dispute is by no means resolved.
If Szymanski is right and his warnings are heeded, it could mark the end of the Yucca Mountain project. The retreat would be a stunning setback for the Government and the nuclear-power industry, which is poised for a revival. If he is right and his warnings go unheeded, some experts say it might be the beginning of the ultimate end.
"You flood that thing and you could blow the top off the mountain," says Charles B. Archambeau, a geophysicist at the University of Colorado who has reviewed Szymanski's work and found it persuasive. "At the very least, the radioactive material would go into the ground water and spread to Death Valley, where there are hot springs all over the place, constantly bringing water up from great depths. It would be picked up by the birds, the animals, the plant life. It would start creeping out of Death Valley. You couldn't stop it. That's the nightmare. It could slowly spread to the whole biosphere. If you want to envision the end of the world, that's it."

JERRY SZYMANSKI WAS BORN, IN 1943, TO POLISH nobility. The family's prosperity ended during the Second World War as waves of invading Germans and Russians swept the area. Born amid the turmoil, Szymanski says his earliest memory is of his grandmother telling a friend about a mass grave in which thousands of Jews were buried, many of them half alive. "Hands were sticking out of the ground," he recalls his grandmother as saying. "The earth was moving." His father, active in organized resistance against the Germans and Russians, was eventually sent to a labor camp in Russia for six years.
Szymanski grew up in Communist Poland, bright, eager to learn and marked for advancement. He was sent to the University of Warsaw, where he graduated in 1965 with a geology degree. Two years later, he was hard at work on doctoral research and teaching when, in March 1968, he joined students clamoring for economic and social reform. "We wanted a dialogue," he says. "What we saw was brute, bloody force, storm troopers beating people." Students were arrested on charges of "anti-state activities," and hundreds of Jews were fired from newspaper and university posts as the Government blamed them for shortcomings in the Polish economy. Though not Jewish, Szymanski was fed up. The Government was eager to be rid of university agitators. So, in December 1968, he was allowed to board a plane with his wife, baby and two suitcases, bound for the United States.
Penniless, Szymanski went to work as a consultant to the burgeoning nuclear-power industry, helping find and evaluate sites for reactors and related facilities. Paramount in his work was the study of fault lines, breaks in rock strata that can shift and cause earthquakes. In 1972, he landed a job with Dames & Moore, a civil-engineering company with a global reputation for site-selection skill. Within some five years, Szymanski became a senior geologist, advising American companies and foreign governments in places like Iran, Korea, Spain and Chile on the geologic feasibility of setting up nuclear reactors. He also worked extensively with Federal regulators in charge of reactor licensing.
Peers held him in high esteem. "He's brilliant," says James G. McWhorter, the senior geologist at Dames & Moore. "One of his greatest talents is the ability to see the forest and the trees."
In 1977, at an international conference in Stockholm, Szymanski got a severe shock. Attending a session on the geologic disposal of used nuclear fuel, he was astonished to hear that the field was in its infancy, with one speaker after another talking only in theoretical terms. Nowhere in the world was there a permanent disposal site for the growing mountain of high-level nuclear waste. "I had been convinced there was somebody on the other end," Szymanski says. "I was wrong. The fuel cycle was not complete."
In 1982, he switched jobs, intending to address what he considered a looming obstacle to the industry's growth. At Decision Planning Corporation, a private company, he worked on Federal contracts to evaluate the merit of different types of deep geologic disposal. But he found himself only on the periphery of the process. In early 1983, he accepted a job with the Energy Department itself, though it meant a $20,000 cut in annual pay. "I figured I would have some influence," he says. Soon after, the D.O.E. offered him a position at the Yucca Mountain site, which was starting to undergo intense evaluation.
In February 1984, he arrived at the project offices in Las Vegas, blocks from the swirl of casinos, lights and illusion that make up the strip. Szymanski was one of the unit's four officials. He was in charge of gathering and assessing data from teams of scientists (mainly the U.S. Geological Survey and various contractors) whose work was to form the basis for evaluating the mountain. Equally important, he was in charge of packaging that data for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Federal body that would be asked to license the nuclear-waste repository.
Everything went fine until Szymanski took his first field trip that September. It became what he calls "the most incredible three days of my life." He led a party of some 30 Federal and Nevada state officials to the mountain, and as they traveled back and forth across its arms and valleys, he grew increasingly edgy. From atop the mountain he could see 10 volcanic cones. Some showed little erosion, suggesting they were geologically quite young. Also visible were signs of six major fault lines. The area clearly had a history of intense geologic activity.
At Trench No. 14, on the mountain's east side, a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey, which had done much of the exploratory work, used the word "travertine" to describe a large, cream-colored deposit of fine, crystalline calcium carbonate exposed at one end of the ditch. Alarm bells went off in Szymanski's head. Travertine is a type of limestone found in caves (in the form of stalactites and stalagmites) and around springs. It is synonymous with the presence of water and is deposited in bands over long periods of time. Szymanski was no stranger to travertine, which is often associated with fault lines and which he had repeatedly searched for, found and examined all over the world. Its analysis can reveal the age of a fault, a fact that is important in evaluating whether it is likely to shift and damage a nuclear reactor.
Szymanski kept his concerns to himself. He doubted his perceptions, even his sanity. After all, none of the other geologists on the field trip seemed to be worried. The party continued its tour. But then came the evidence that tipped the balance. At Trench No. 8, on the west side of the mountain, was another deposit of travertine, situated, as usual, along a fault line. This time Szymanski examined it closely.
The travertine held many rock fragments in suspension, caught there by the mineral-coating process. Some had been cut in half by bulldozers. Those near the main vein had a shell of discoloration. Those farther away did not.
To Szymanski, the disparity was evidence that a warm spring had formed the travertine, etching rocks near the source but having no effect on those farther away, where the water would have been cooler. Other signs caught his eye. Travertine at the source was laced with vertical bands of minerals, including opal. The spring had definitely been warm, Szymanski concluded, carrying different kinds of water-soluble minerals up from deep within the earth.
The tour group pulled away. Szymanski stayed behind, kicking the tires of his vehicle, blind with rage. For seven years, from 1977 to 1984, he had visualized in ever greater detail what a repository should look like. Yucca Mountain did not come close. In many respects, it was the least likely site he could imagine. Moreover, he could see no means of improvement. Trying to waterproof the dump was hopeless. Barriers could be broken by earthquakes. And diversion channels for water might not be big enough, or last long enough. At best, complex man-made structures survived for hundreds of years, not thousands. In any case, the whole philosophy of the project was to have the site be safe naturally -- not made that way.
Yucca Mountain was predicated on dryness -- falsely, Szymanski was now convinced. Yet here he was, in charge of the Federal team meant to explain to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission why this site was good. Szymanski knew there was no way he could do it. In that instant, he foresaw the fights, the bureaucratic battles, the personal attacks. "Why me?" he thought to himself. "I'm just an immigrant."
It was Friday. Szymanski drove back to Las Vegas, where a friend from Dames & Moore, Timothy R. Harper, was arriving to spend the weekend. The next day, Szymanski took Harper, a geologist who is now a research scientist with a major British oil company, on a tour of Yucca Mountain, eager for an independent analysis.
"It was so obvious," Harper recalls. "Travertine is well known by the most inexperienced geologist to be a spring deposit. You walk into that trench and it shouts at you, it screams at you: 'This was an ejection of fluid.' Familiarity with a situation sometimes closes your eyes to understanding. It's quite possible that people became too familiar with seeing these deposits all over the place. But an outsider could see it straight away. You just look at the thing and know it's a fluid flow."
Harper was the first of more than a dozen independent geologists Szymanski would take through the site over the next few years. Without exception, they supported his views.

SZYMANSKI TOLD HIS Energy Department superiors of his concerns. The officials, not being geologists themselves, were in a bind. They had to rely on advice from contractors, the Geological Survey and the nation's nuclear-weapons laboratories: Los Alamos, Livermore and Sandia. Very quickly, these experts, led by the Geological Survey, came up with an explanation that became the standard reply. The deposits were superficial, they said, the result of rain, dating from an age when Nevada's climate was wetter. Calcium dust on certain kinds of exposed rock, this theory went, was picked up by the wind, carried many miles, caught in raindrops over Yucca Mountain and deposited over the course of millions of years in pools, fractures and faults, where it grew ever more concentrated.
This vision was immensely reassuring. It said that while the mountain's surface might once have been wet, the repository area deep underground had always been dry and would stay that way into the distant future. No ground water would rush up from beneath the mountain. Except for Szymanski, no one spoke of travertine any more. Instead, the cream-colored mineral was called pedogenic, meaning formed in the soil.
In late 1984, the Energy Department dispatched a bulldozer to Trench No. 14 in an effort to explore the issue, the assumption being that the limestone deposit would prove to be superficial. Roaring and grinding, the machine dug deeper and deeper, removing layers of material. Surprisingly, the deposit simply narrowed into a one-yard-wide vein that seemed to dive deep into the mountain.
Szymanski pressed his superiors to continue the investigation, to take core samples, to further expose the vein, to resolve the issue once and for all. "Nothing happened," he says. He pressed the contractors and Federal experts to document the findings and explain what they meant. "They resisted," Szymanski says.
For two years, Szymanski fought a losing battle to try to get the problem addressed. Finally, in frustration, he decided to do it himself.
Szymanksi thought the source of the surface deposits was clearly warm water bubbling up from below. So he decided to wrestle with the problem of how the springs got there in the first place, hoping a clear explanation would persuade skeptics and give his science teams an intellectual framework on which to base their work.
Ground-water levels are usually governed by climatic trends. But Szymanski theorized that levels in the Yucca Mountain area could be altered by earthquakes, and sustained that way for hundreds or even thousands of years by the earth's inner heat, through a process known as thermal convection. "It's like water percolating up in a coffee pot," he says.
To test his hypothesis, Szymanski examined the huge amount of data on the geology and hydrology of Yucca Mountain and its environs, which had been accumulated over the years. The evidence, he concluded, was indisputable. Rock samples from the mountain's core showed calcium carbonate deposits extending down many hundreds of yards. Analysis of trace elements in the deposits showed that the water creating them had been warm -- again, suggesting it came from below rather than in the form of cool rain.
But the powers that be were still not persuaded by the evidence. "My desk was moved closer and closer to the door," Szymanski recalls. "I was a forgotten man." In November 1987, he submitted a 322-page draft report. It sat in the mail room, untouched by his superior.
Meanwhile, a copy of the report came into the hands of Richard H. Bryan, then Nevada's Governor, who had strongly voiced the state's opposition to the repository. In January 1988, over Szymanski's objections, Bryan released the draft at a news conference. "If the conclusions of the report are accurate -- and state scientists have every reason to believe that they are -- there can be no doubt that Yucca Mountain should never have been selected as a possible repository site," Bryan told reporters. His comments threw the Federal bureaucracy into action.
More than 40 scientists were now put onto the job of reviewing Szymanski's draft. Their 133-page review, issued in July 1989, said the majority "doubt that there is sufficient technical basis to warrant pursuing the author's hypothesis further," adding that Szymanski's evidence was ambiguous at best. The lead reviewer, William W. Dudley Jr. of the Geological Survey, called the draft "deceitful" and riddled with "violations of scientific ethics."
In an interview last month, Dudley softened his tone, saying Szymanski's effects "probably do occur to some degree" but were blown "out of proportion." He even said that the area around Yucca Mountain may hold examples of calcium carbonate produced by the welling up of ground water but were too old to have any bearing on the repository project.
John S. Stuckless, a Survey geologist on the Yucca Mountain project, also remains unpersuaded. The disputed calcium on Yucca Mountain "cannot be deposited from the ground water," he said in an interview this fall. "That leaves only soil-forming processes." He said such action could account for much of the field data, including deposits of opal, although he conceded that the thickness of the band found in Trench No. 14 is "more than is typical in a soil horizon."
Asked about calcium carbonate found at great depths beneath Yucca Mountain, Stuckless acknowledged the possibility of ground water, but he, too, discounted its relevance. "We have a suspicion, unconfirmed, that we are looking at two different kinds of calcite, one up and one down," he said -- one deposited by rain, the other by ground water far below the repository level, too far below to threaten the project.
Szymanski was calm amid the storm. During the yearlong review, he had been listening carefully to the criticism and revising his draft. He was confident. There was no way rainwater could become concentrated enough to produce opal that was as thick, pure and banded as that found here. Only a flowing source of ground water could carry enough of the dissolved minerals. And from careful study of rock cores, Szymanski knew the mountain was riddled with calcium from top to bottom, strengthening his thesis. Moreover, chemical analysis showed these calcium deposits were, for all practical purposes, identical.
Szymanski's final report, 911 pages long, was made public in July 1989. He wrote that evidence for his ground-water model was overwhelming and dismissed the Energy Department plan for Yucca Mountain as "wishful thinking." Privately, he viewed most of his critics as decent men who were blinded to the obvious by bureacratic inertia, a desire for career and financial security and a fear that the nation and the nuclear industry would be thrown into turmoil if Yucca Mountain were to be abandoned.
The report had an introduction written by Gerald A. Frazier, a scientist at the Science Applications International Corporation who had quit the internal-review panel because he felt it was biased. After listening to the criticisms and Szymanski's responses, and after traveling extensively through the desert with Szymanksi, Frazier was sure his thesis had merit. "If there is but 1 chance in 10 that his postulates are valid," Frazier wrote, "then we must jointly share his concerns and seek resolution."

THE BATTLE BETWEEN Szymanski and the Federal bureaucracy had by now been going on for five years. In 1989, it was moved to a higher plateau by Carl P. Gertz, a civil engineer who had become head of the Yucca Mountain project two years earlier. After making public the conflicting reports, Gertz announced that Szymanski's work would be reviewed again, this time by experts outside the Federal preserve. A five-member independent panel (with two members picked by Szymanski and three by Gertz) and a 17-member group from the National Academy of Sciences, a prestigious group that advises the Government, would separately review the material.
Gertz says he is opened-minded. "We want to ask the hard questions right now," he said in an interview. "My personal view is that it's healthy for a scientific program to have debate at this stage." Even healthier, he says, would be more research to help resolve the ground-water issue. A lawsuit brought by the State of Nevada has stopped much work at the site.
"There are many things we don't know about Yucca," Gertz said. "Until we gather the data, I don't think I'll be surprised about anything out there." However, he said, the consequences of a flooded dump would probably not be as severe as Szymanski fears. The slow corrosion of canisters would be more likely than their explosive rupture, Gertz said, lessening the odds of a massive release.
John Stuckless feels that further research will resolve the ground-water riddles. "We're just starting a three-year study of this whole problem," he noted this fall, referring to a "site characterization" study the D.O.E. is undertaking. "It's not like anybody is finished." After the data has been gathered, he said, it will undergo a fairly lengthy period of analysis. By this schedule, the issues Szymanski raised in 1984 might conceivably be answered a decade later.
Meanwhile, the five-member independent panel is expected to report near the end of the year. The National Academy of Sciences group is to file an interim report in 1991 and a final one in 1992.

"MAX!" SZYMANSKI shouts. The dog bounds out of the desert into the vehicle. As we drive off, Szymanski holds up a yellow butane lighter. "My objective is to make sure we see reality and act accordingly," he says. "I don't really care what the specific actions are. But when a society starts calling a yellow lighter black, that's the end."
He says the waste project needs no more data. It simply needs to examine objectively the huge amount of evidence already in hand.
What are the odds of ground water welling up through the mountain in the next 10,000 years? "It's a sure thing," Szymanski answers, "just like death."
The project has so far failed to weigh seriously the worst-case consequences, he adds -- a major release from waste containers.
We leave Yucca Mountain behind, crossing a valley dotted with volcanic cones. At Bare Mountain, we get out and climb its lower elevations, still in sight of Yucca. Gold miners have dug on the mountain's side, exposing layers of rock as they worked their way along a fault line. Clearly evident are the same cream-colored deposits of calcium carbonate, alternating with thick, four-inch bands of opal, some of gem quality. Gold ore lies along the fault, Szymanski says, deposited there in the same manner as the calcium carbonate. "That stuff has uranium in it," he says. "You don't get that from the sky."
He picks up a cream-colored, heavily banded rock. "To say this is the result of rain is preposterous," he asserts. "Take it to Columbia University and say that. They'll throw you out of the office."
We drive away, across the dry, dusty valley toward the state highway. I ask if there are springs around like the ones he is suggesting may someday appear on Yucca Mountain. Yes, Szymanski says, including ones on the sides of mountains.
We pull up to a site known as Devil's Hole. The rocky outcropping is cut by a deep gash. At its bottom is a pool of crystal-clear water, which Szymanski says goes down hundreds of feet. "This is not rainwater," he says. A gorge leading to the gash is obviously a fault, covered with the same calcium deposits we have seen all day long.
We drive down the mountain. The sun is setting, the desert tinged with gold. Ahead is a lake surrounded by dense foliage. It is known as Crystal Pool, Szymanski says. It is spring fed, an oasis in the desert.
Covered with dirt, I pull off my clothes and plunge into the water, swimming far from shore. A flock of birds glides by. Looking back, I see Szymanski sitting on a bank near the shoreline, fully clothed. He is smoking a cigarette, waiting patiently, staring into the distance.

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
The Plight Of the Session Player

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WALKER; Michael Walker has written about popular music for Rolling Stone.

 BODY:
Mark Murphy's new album was just about finished, and Larry Fallon, a New York-based producer-arranger, had booked a studio to sweeten four of the jazz singer's tracks with incidental music. Strings, horns and voices were once used to enhance records, but on this day Mr. Fallon hired only one musician, Jon Cobert, a freelance keyboardist.
Flanked by five-foot-tall racks of digital synthesizers, Mr. Cobert auditioned a few sounds for Mr. Fallon, then added a blend of oboe, French horn, flute and an ethereal choir to the song "What a Way to Go." For the musicians who would have played the 12 violins, four violas, four cellos, two double basses and three woodwinds that the synthesizers replaced on this one recording session, the song title is an unwitting epitaph. 
 At studios across the country, similar scenes are played out every day with the same refrain: music is being recorded largely unencumbered by musicians. The practice, made possible by advanced digital synthesizers that emulate the sound of instruments, has become so widespread it has decimated the corps of musicians who earn their living playing in recording studios. The change is startling: a decade ago, replacing an orchestra with a synthesizer would have seemed revolutionary; today, hiring musicians is the novelty.
So-called session players are perpetually on call to sight-read whatever music is placed before them, be it blazing heavy-metal riffs, thorny jazz passages or, most typically, the stylistic hodgepodge of advertising jingles. Before the synthesizer onslaught began in the mid-80's, the session players most in demand earned more than $100,000 a year, but bookings and incomes have dropped by about half, and many players have simply dropped out. Membership in Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, to which New York's studio musicians belong, has fallen from more than 18,000 in 1982 to about 14,000 today, with the bulk of the studio jobs going to perhaps 40 players. "There's a tenth as much work and a tenth as many people doing it," says Jay Berliner, a studio guitarist for the last 25 years.
The foundering studio-musician scene is stark evidence of the synthesizer's impact and inevitability. "As scared as we are of it, there doesn't seem to be anywhere where we can make a stand," says J. Martin Emerson, president of the musicians' union. "You're talking about technological progress, and everybody knows you can't stop that."
Despite criticism that synthesized music can be metallic-sounding and rigid in tempo, it is pervasive; Mr. Berliner estimates that 90 percent of television jingles are made with synthesizers. Says David Horowitz, owner of a New York company that writes and records jingles, the bread-and-butter work for session players: "Advertising is always a follower of pop music, and the Top 40 now is totally dominated by synthesizers."
Many musicians also fear that people are losing their ear for the real thing. They point out that synthesizers get the sounds of instruments right but sacrifice the phrasing and cooperative spirit of live playing. With synthesizers, says Mr. Cobert, "it's usually one person sitting there playing the drum part, the horn part, the string parts. You don't get input from individual players, the energy and spontaneity of different people's interpretations of the music. You get the sound of the snare drum, but not the feel of the drummer reacting to the bass player reacting to the trumpet player."
Studios have traditionally served as a finishing school for hungry young players. The list of people who have worked or continue to work as session musicians includes Duane Allman, Jimmy Page, Chet Atkins, Steve Cropper, Lee Ritenour and Larry Carlton. But with jobs increasingly scarce, it is harder for young players to break in. "I sort of feel like I'm the last generation of studio musicians," says Seth Glassman, a session bassist. "I don't feel anybody lapping at my heels."
What makes the synthesizer so irresistible is its economy and flexibility. Stored in its memory are hundreds of digitally accurate samples of instruments, which can be called up in endless combinations. When linked by the technology known as Midi (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and a sequencer, a sort of electronic piano roll, several synthesizers can be marshaled by a single player into, literally, a one-man band.
The ranks of session musicians have been thinned before by new technology and changing musical styles, like the switch from solo pop singers, who recorded with large orchestras, to the self-contained rock bands of the 60's. The coming of electrically amplified instruments in the 50's evoked the same fear and loathing many players now have for synthesizers. When the Fender electric bass began to supplant the acoustic stand-up bass, "a lot of players said, 'That's the end of us,' " remembers Herb Bushler, a former session player who contracts musicians for recording dates. "And it was the end of a lot of them, unless they learned to play the Fender bass."
The difference today is that, except for keyboard players and, to a lesser extent, drummers, there is no way for most musicians to compete with synthesizers, short of becoming synthesizer players themselves. Theoretically, many instruments can be adapted to play sampled sounds -- guitar-based synthesizers have been around since the 70's -- but keyboards predominate because of their wide range and simple, linear layout. This has been a windfall for musicians like Mr. Cobert, whose skills on piano and organ transfer readily to synthesizer playing. After programming the synthesizer components, Mr. Cobert plays sampled sounds much the way he would play a piano.
Synthesizers are particularly adept at mimicking ensembles of horns and strings, which has hit those players the hardest. Drummers, meanwhile, have taken a pounding from drum machines, a subspecies of synthesizer that plays drum samples with flawless timing. Because real drums are difficult to record -- microphones must be positioned precisely and sound checks performed -- the machines have been especially welcomed by producers.
"The sound you can get with a drum machine takes forever to get in the studio," says the session drummer Allan Schwartzberg. "A drum machine sounds great, immediately." Mr. Schwartzberg has since reached a detente with the technology: at some sessions, he wires his kit with devices that trigger drum samples when he strikes the actual drums.
The evaporating studio scene has forced session musicians to find other outlets for their talents. Jim Pugh, a session trombone player, is playing in the pit orchestra of the Broadway musical "City of Angels," an engagement he would have declined during his peak session days. Mr. Schwartzberg and others have turned to composing -- the theme to the "Geraldo" television show is his, and last winter he tutored Kevin Dillon for the actor's portrayal of the drummer John Densmore in the movie "The Doors."
There is even talk that the end of the studio grind may be a blessing in disguise. "A lot of the job had become getting the job," says Mr. Pugh, who now maintains a leisurely Sunday-brunch gig at the Blue Note, the jazz club in Greenwich Village. "There's the feeling that you're back to doing what you originally got into it for.
"It's real nice," he says, "to go out and play music just for the sake of the music."

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Ballet Lovers, Pack Your Luggage

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
New York City: Dance Capital of the world. That has been the phrase bandied about by critics at home and abroad for the last 25 years, and until very recently, it has usefully described the locus of international dance activity. Foreign companies felt compelled, as a matter of course, to appear regularly in what is, by consensus, also America's cultural hub. Such seasons were essentially more glamorous versions of home-grown creativity in New York City itself -- from George Balanchine and Martha Graham to the novice giving a first concert in a downtown church or loft.
But nowadways, dance lovers -- and that presumably includes critics -- may have to travel more than in the past to keep up with major companies and premieres. Increasingly, New York City is being bypassed by companies as diverse as Mikhail Baryshnikov's new troupe and a touring ensemble from the Kirov Ballet. 
 The reasons are multiple, governed largely by economic considerations (New York is more expensive to play than out-of-town theaters) but also have to do with choice and chance. A new factor is a conscious challenge to New York's supremacy as the focus of an art form -- an attitude embodied in new commissioning projects by the Kennedy Center in Washington and summer dance festivals as well as in the ambitions of regional ballet companies.
Nothing dictates that the best of dance in America should be seen only in New York City. History provides an illuminating precedent. In the most centralized of kingdoms -- 18th-century France -- a historic ballet was staged not at the Paris Opera but in a provincial opera house. That work was "La Fille Mal Gardee," which had its premiere in 1789 in Bordeaux, where the choreographer, Jean Dauberval, was then ballet master.
In our own time, New York City, like Paris, will probably yield little ground as a pre-eminent dance center simply because choreographers thrive amid their peers in a dance community that has educated its public.
Yet for the first time, more areas of the country are seeing what New York City does not -- which is very different from the days when all tours opened in New York or its audiences saw the same premieres as elsewhere, albeit later.
This fall alone, nearly 70 dancers from the Kirov Ballet, including fresh young talent that New York audiences did not see during the Leningrad company's season in 1989, will come no closer to New York City than the Midwest during a national tour. The White Oak Project, Mr. Baryshnikov's troupe with choreography by Mark Morris, opened in Boston. But it is on the same money-making circuit formerly traveled by Baryshnikov and Friends, which always bypassed New York City.
Since Helgi Tomasson became artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet in 1985, the troupe has performed twice (most recently last month) at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. But this radically renewed company has yet to be seen under its new regime in New York. From March 12 to 24, the Kennedy Center will also present the Royal Ballet from Britain, which canceled a season last summer at the Metropolitan Opera House owing to a lack of financing.
This fall, a New Yorker needed to go to Cleveland to catch Rudolf Nureyev with the Cleveland San Jose Ballet. The novelty was not so much an aging superstar in still another role but "The Overcoat," a treatment of Gogol's story by Flemming Flindt.
A ballet fan who wants to keep abreast of developments is now an itinerant ballet fan. Like other smaller Soviet companies that slip into the country with increasing frequency, the Russian Ballet could not reach New York and performed in Atlantic City in September and October. It featured remarkably good, youthful dancers assembled by Vyacheslav Gordeyev, a former Bolshoi star with a strong following.
On another level, the Bolshoi Ballet itself came up with a spinoff group. Yuri Grigorovich, the Bolshoi's director, announced that the world debut of the Bolshoi Ballet-Grigorovich Company, a troupe with recent Soviet ballet school graduates, would take place from Nov. 23 to Dec. 2 at Texas A&M University in College Station, Tex. The university provided technical and rehearsal facilities, which may be another reason why out-of-town bookings are attractive. The troupe, which is performing Mr. Grigorovich's "Nutcracker," will appear in Miami from Dec. 4 through 7; only a last-minute booking into the Brooklyn Academy of Music at Christmastime will bring the production into New York City.
Charles Dillingham, president of the Entertainment Corporation, the commercial producing organization that is touring the Kirov and Bolshoi-Grigorovich groups, denies that the aim was to avoid New York as such. But, he said in a recent interview, the full Bolshoi and Kirov companies would be overexposed if they returned to the Metropolitan Opera House so soon (the Bolshoi was there last summer). The touring contingents (the Kirov's is topped by its stars) perform in cities that did not see the full companies (which the Entertainment Corporation plans to bring to New York every three years). The Bolshoi-Grigorovich venture was, in Mr. Dillingham's words, "a way to introduce a new company for the future."
It is obviously cheaper to put this kind of operation together in an arts center at a university like Texas A&M than in New York. Moreover, anyone aware of performing-arts centers in the rest of the country should not be surprised that they have developed both audiences and new activities.
Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa in Iowa City is a prime example. Its director, Wallace Chappell, and its board gave the Joffrey Ballet the residencies that contributed rehearsal time, space and money three years ago toward the company's own "Nutcracker" and reconstruction of "Le Sacre du Printemps." Iowa audiences saw portions or full versions of those productions first.
Hancher Auditorium also books attractions such as the current Kirov tour, which became the first visit ever by Kirov dancers to Iowa City. It is one of the financial contributors to "The Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land," the new work by the experimental choreographer Bill T. Jones. Unlike the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which saw the first performance of the Jones piece and is known as an advocate of experimental work, the Hancher Center is also apt to book in "Les Miserables" to satisfy a broader public and stimulate box-office income.
The Kennedy Center too is a multipurpose arts center, and for this reason a new project devised by Sheldon Schwartz, its director of dance programming, could serve as a model for the future. Six ballet companies -- San Francisco, Boston, Houston, Pennsylvania, Pacific Northwest from Seattle, Ballet West from Salt Lake City -- will each commission a choreographer to create a new work that must be first performed at the Kennedy Center.
The center has received a $450,000 challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, the terms of which allow each of the premieres to be transferred, free, to the other five companies (thus creating a potential of six premieres per company per year). Paul Taylor has agreed to a premiere for the Houston Ballet, and John Neumeier will work with Ballet West.
Mr. Schwartz, a former dancer, says candidly that one of his problems in presenting these companies at the Kennedy Center was their overlapping repertories. The commissioning project, he hopes, will stimulate creativity. He calls them national companies and adds, "We at the national cultural centers should feel an obligation to help American creations. I don't see anybody in New York doing this."
With a solid base of subscribers as willing to see the San Francisco Ballet as the New York City Ballet, the Kennedy Center is now the main East Coast venue for most major companies. Even the Roland Petit National Ballet de Marseilles found it worthwhile to zip into the center last January. "I wanted the Kennedy Center to get into the international marketplace without depending on the Met," Mr. Schwartz said.
There will always be those who maintain that the arts need one identifiable center to flourish. In this country, however, competition from a Rome-on-the-Potomac might well benefit an Athens-on-the-Hudson.

Hong Kong Tourism Recovering
 HONG KONG -- Hong Kong, a traditional stopover for tourists headed into and out of mainland China, experienced a dramatic decrease in tourism after China's brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing last year. After promoting Hong Kong as a destination in its own right, officials say the colony's tourism is now recovering. They estimate 5.8 million tourists will visit by the end of 1990, compared with 5.4 million last year. (By the end of September, there had been 4.3 million visitors.) Special events like the Hong Kong Arts Festival -- which opens Jan. 19 and runs through Feb. 10 -- have been particularly successful in drawing tourists who live in Taiwan, Japan and other Asian countries, an official said.
The 19th annual Arts Festival will offer a mix of productions -- from London's Royal Shakespeare Company presenting "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," to New York's Joffrey Ballet dancing a tribute to Diaghilev, accompanied by Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, as well as a series of Mozart concerts marking the composer's bicentennial. This will be the British colony's most ambitious festival, with 44 musical, operatic and theater events featuring European and American as well as Hong Kong and other Asian artists. Many events will be staged in Hong Kong's new Cultural Center, a boldly modern complex that was dedicated by Prince Charles and the Princess of Wales last fall. The festival opens with Hong Kong's first production of Mozart's opera, "The Marriage of Figaro," featuring an international cast.
For those who seek something more Asian, the Hubei Province Peking Opera Troupe from China will present a program of mainland operas. Pro Musica Nipponia from Japan will perform classical and modern pieces on traditional Japanese instruments. The Hong Kong Tourist Association in New York (212-869-5008) can advise on seat availability and on how to make reservations on reaching Hong Kong. -- By BARBARA BASLER
 
Treasure Cay Remains Closed
 Treasure Cay, one of the largest resorts in the Family Islands in the Bahamas, will remain closed for renovations when the winter season begins next month. A representative of the resort on Great Abaco Island said it would reopen on Jan. 25 after work was completed. The 190 rooms have been closed since Aug. 26. Bahamian residents have expressed surprise that Treasure Cay, a favorite call for yacht people, closed before Labor Day and will not be ready for the beginning of the winter season. He added that Treasure Cay will no longer be operated on an all-inclusive basis with meals, drinks and sports activities covered by one price. Meanwhile, the resort's marina, tennis courts and golf course as well as time-share units are operational. Information: 800-327-1584.
 
Hollywood Park Survives Fire
 The fire that raced through the backlots at Universal Studios Hollywood on Nov. 6 has disrupted the filming of several movies and television shows, but has had little effect on the park's tourist attractions, according to Universal officials.
"It's virtually business as usual," said Jim Yeager, a Universal spokesman. Most of the visitor attractions, including the stunt shows and thrill rides, were not damaged and the initial reports of King Kong's demise were greatly exaggerated, according to Mr.
Yeager. "Not only was King Kong not destroyed, it sustained only the slightest of damage to its electrical system," he said. Repairs on the 37-foot-tall copy of the gorilla from the movie were expected to take several days.
The fire consumed four acres of Universal's 420-acre lot, an area that includedNew York Street and Courthouse Square, which were the backdrops for such films as "Dick Tracy" and "Back to the Future." Mr. Yeager said Universal planned to rebuild New York Street and Courthouse Square as close to the originals as possible; it has not set a timetable for construction yet.
Officials said they had no plans to offer discounts or other promotions as a result of the fire, as the company's sister park in Orlando did when mechanical problems forced the closing of several rides this past summer.
 
Winter Flights To French Isles
 The nonstop weekend flights from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Martinique and on to Guadeloupe will be resumed by a French charter operation, Minerve Airlines, on Dec. 15. The flights were inaugurated last winter. Major airlines do not fly nonstop to either island from New York. Most of the seats on Minerve's 167-passenger MD-83 aircraft will be sold as part of package tours, but some seats will be available to independent travelers. The planes are scheduled to leave Kennedy at 3 P.M. on Saturdays and arrive at Martinique at 7:30 P.M. They then continue to Guadeloupe, a 40-minute flight. Northbound flights will leave Guadeloupe at 8 A.M. on Saturdays and Martiniqueat 9:45 A.M.
Seven-night packages, including hotel, Continental breakfasts and round-trip air fare, start at $759 a person based on double occupancy, in economy hotels and rise to $1,205 for deluxe hotels. Airport transfers, tax and gratuities are also included. Prices are slightly higher on peak season dates. Round-trip fare alone is $459. Reservations can be made through travel agents, Caribbean tour companies and Council Charter (212-661-4546).
 
Booking Easier For Talgo Train
 It's now easier for Americans to make reservations for Spain's six international Talgo trains. Renfe, the national railroad of Spain, has authorized an American travel marketing company to make reservations for seats and sleeping cabins as well as sell tickets on the Talgos, which run daily between Madrid and Barcelona and five other European cities: Paris, Geneva, Zurich, Milan and Lisbon. Reservations can be made with Donna Brunstad Associates, 25 Sylvan Road South, Westport, Conn. 06880 (800-468-2546 or 203-454-9780). Previously, Americans could purchase tickets in this country -- from FrenchRail, which represents the Spanish railroads -- but they could not make reservations (required before boarding) for seats and sleepers. They had to get in line at the station in Europe when they were ready to travel. Many of the seats, particularly on the Madrid-Paris Talgo and the Pablo Casals between Barcelona and Milan, both overnight trains, are reserved months in advance.
On the daytime Talgos passengers may choose to travel in first or second class. On the overnight trains, travelers have the choice of tourist class (four berths to a cabin), first class (two in a cabin with sink and hot and cold running water) and grand class (two in a cabin with private toilet and shower in addition to a sink). Examples of fares (based on 97 pesetas to $1): Madrid-Paris about $270 a person in double occupancy in first class and $310 in grand class; Barcelona-Milan, $237 in first class, $257 in grand class.

HEADLINE: S. & L. Crisis Muddies Market Outlook

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE fallout of the savings and loan bailout, only beginning to be felt in the housing markets of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, will become more evident next year as Federal regulators hasten their efforts to sell single-family homes, co-ops and condominiums that have been seized from failed lending institutions.
Federal officials say sales in the region will be far less widespread than in Texas, Colorado, Florida and other states where tens of thousands of homes must be sold. 
 "What we have seen so far is not going to put enormous pressure on the New York area market," said J. William Bowen, managing vice president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group, a firm that advises real estate lenders and financial services companies.
By last week, Federal regulators for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency charged with disposing of the assets of insolvent thrifts, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which oversees commercial bank failures, said they had counted only 225 homes and commercial structures to be disposed of in the New York region. But both agencies said the task of sorting through the lenders' assets was far from complete, particularly in the cases of several thrifts taken into Federal conservatorship since June.
Some New York area analysts fear that the number of properties inventoried and slated for sale by the Federal government so far may just be the tip of the iceberg. Frederick J. Mehlman, head of the New York State Attorney General's real estate finance bureau, which has been investigating widespread defaults by the sponsors of cooperative and condominium buildings, said he knew of 500 apartments that had already fallen under control of the Resolution Trust Corporation, although fewer than 20 have so far been offered for sale by the Federal agency.
Any Government real estate sales in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will take place in a market glutted by for-sale signs, in part because dozens of thrifts and commercial banks that remain solvent are themselves trying to sell off foreclosed properties.
Although no precise count is available, bankers and real estate executives say there are several hundred foreclosed homes on the market in each of the three states.
One reminder of the problems facing New York area lenders came last week with the failure of the Freedom National Bank of Harlem, a Federally chartered commercial bank that had its assets seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The institution, New York City's oldest lender focusing on minority business, is one of 12 banks in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that have been taken into conservatorship by the Federal agency in the last two years.
COMMERCIAL banks have smaller real estate-loan portfolios than thrifts, and F.D.I.C. officials said they had so far counted only 26 properties from the failed banks that must be sold.
But the principal problem is the failure of savings-and-loan institutions, traditionally the largest source of home mortgages. Resolution Trust, created by Congress as part of its 1989 savings and loan bailout initiative, has taken 17 of the New York region's thrifts into conservancy since February 1989.
Nine of 17 have come under Government control over the last six months, and most of their assets remain to be inventoried.
With the regulators under intense pressure from Congress to dispose of real estate quickly, their sales in New York City and its suburbs are bound to hurt a housing market that is already in a deep recession.
"Any forced sales are going to dampen the market further," said Eugene Sherman, senior economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. He added that the Government sales will be "a bad thing happening against a bad background."
Part of the Government's plan was described in October by William Seidman, chairman of Resolution Trust. In a speech to a business group in Washington, he said the agency would try during the first three months of 1991 to sell "almost all" of the 30,000 homes and land parcels it has so far counted in its national inventory that are appraised at under $100,000.
"The faster disposition of these small assets will maximize our returns by freeing up our staff to concentrate on large sales where the real dollars are concerned," he said. Other agency officials said most of the sales would be auctions, some of them absolute auctions with no minimum price.
Some had feared that the government's plan to dispose of properties quickly would undermine already weak housing markets, particularly in the Southwest. But their worries have so far proven unfounded. In Houston and Dallas, realtors said last week that there had not been any evidence of panic selling in advance of the government sales, and some maintained that their housing markets could only be strengthened by the elimination of the huge backlog of properties held by Resolution Trust.
By far the greatest number of homes seized by the Government is in Texas, where Resolution Trust has published a list of more than 6,000 properties -- mostly single-family houses and condominiums appraised under $100,000. In the New York metropolitan area, not many of the properties to be sold will fit Mr. Seidman's description of "small assets" because the real estate boom lifted market values in this area far above $100,000 on most homes.
But Resolution Trust said it would approach the region's market next year as a determined seller, just as it plans to do in Texas, even when it is trying to dispose of expensive properties.
"It depends on the complexity of marketing the property, but in some cases we will be using the auction process" in the New York area, said Andrea Plater, an agency spokeswoman at the eastern regional office in Atlanta.
For prospective buyers, the first listing of properties that the agency is trying to sell is already available, in many cases at local libraries. Since August, Resolution Trust has been distributing its first Asset Inventory of real estate in each state, which will be updated as properties are sold and others fall into Government hands. For now, all the properties are being listed with local brokers.
In the New York region, the offerings are diverse, if not extensive. For the affluent, there is 1059 Peguot Avenue in Southport, Conn., one of the nation's most expensive suburban enclaves. The four-bedroom colonial lacks floors or fixtures for its kitchen and bathrooms, which were left unfinished when its builder was foreclosed on by his lender, Community Federal Savings and Loan of Bridgeport. That lender was taken under Government conservatorship this year.
The asking price for the Southport house, first offered at $815,000, is now $650,000.
Those on a lower budget might consider 6 Stuart Lane in West Windsor, N.J., a four-bedroom stucco residence offered at $315,000, or 273 Densign Court in Mays Landing, N.J., a four-bedroom brick house listed in only "fair" condition and offered at $69,900. There is also 129 Hoyt Street in Dunkirk, N.Y., another fixer-upper with three bedrooms that is listed at only $34,500.
The Government listings also include more than 40 New York City co-ops and condominiums, many of them occupied by rent-regulated tenants who elected not to buy their apartments when their buildings were converted. Among them are eight condominiums a 444 East 57th Street, eight co-op apartments in a large complex at 64th Avenue and Burns Street in Rego Park, Queens, and seven co-op units at 24 West 75th Street.
Resolution Trust has raised a storm of protest in its efforts to dispose of some of the apartments.
In September, saying it was under orders from Congress to get the highest prices it could for the assets of failed thrifts, the agency sent letters threatening to evict eight rental tenants at 444 East 57th Street, a luxury building near Sutton Place.
THE Federal regulators maintained that the tenants, with rent-stabilized leases, paid less in rent than was necessary to cover the monthly carrying charges assessed on their apartments. If the apartments were vacant, the officials said, they would be far more attractive to buyers.
But the evictions would violate New York State law and would require Resolution Trust to invoke Federal statutes to attempt to circumvent those of a state. Attorney General Robert Abrams, responding to the eviction threat, said hundreds of rent-regulated tenants could be vulnerable to losing their homes if the Government evicted those at 444 East 57th Street.
Mr. Abrams said his staff would challenge the evictions in court. Since then, Resolution Trust has temporarily withdrawn its eviction threat at the East Side building and said it would give further study to how it will deal with the rent-regulated apartments. Last week, spokesmen for both the Federal agency and Mr. Abrams said the matter was still under study in Washington.
And while the legal questions surrounding co-ops and condominiums remain unresolved, real estate executives say the bigger question facing the New York region is how many more properties will fall into Federal Government control and wind up on Resolution Trust's for-sale list.
Properties make their way onto the list only after they are foreclosed on by a thrift institution and the thrift itself is taken into conservancy by the Government.
"There appears to be no bright light at the end of the tunnel in the Northeast," said Joseph E. Robert, chairman of the J. E. Robert Company, one of the largest managers of property seized by Resolution Trust.
He said the number of listings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut would grow rapidly as Federal officials sort through the assets of thrifts they have taken over in recent months, as the thrifts they control foreclose on more property and as more thrifts fail.
"The number of properties has got to grow significantly in 1991," he added.
Indeed, the Federal takeover of failed thrifts, which had become widespread in many regions during 1989, did not begin to pick up momentum in the New York region until this year. Among those seized over the last six months whose assets have not yet been fully inventoried and offered for sale are the Ensign Bank in Manhattan, Nassau Federal Savings and Loan of Brooklyn, Whitestone Federal Savings and Loan of Whitestone and Yorkville Federal Savings and Loan of the Bronx.
In New Jersey, recently seized thrifts include Nassau Federal Savings and Loan of Princeton, the Mutual Aid Savings and Loan of Manansquan, United Savings of Paterson and United Savings and Loan of Trenton. And in Connecticut, the Charter Federal Saving and Loan of Stamford and Financial Federal Savings of Hartford have both fallen into Federal conservatorship since June.
In an analysis of the documents filed with the Government, Mr. Bowen of the First Manhattan Consulting group found that the 17 thrifts under control of Resolution Trust in the New York region had foreclosed real estate on their books with a total appraised value of $363.1 million. Although the number may seem vast to home buyers, he said it was "not a big deal" in a market where the total appraised value of real estate would run far in excess of $100 billion.
Still, Mr. Bowen's analysis showed that the number of foreclosures was all but certain to grow. He found that the 17 thrifts had "problem loans" to property owners and developers -- loans that were 90 days or more past due -- totaling $1.6 billion.
For now, disposal of assets is moving at a snail's pace.
Although interested buyers can read through six separate volumes of listings in Resolution Trust's Asset Inventory, including homes, apartment buildings, commercial structures and land in all states, brokers assigned to sell the properties in the New York region say there are been many more frivolous inquires than serious buyers.
"PEOPLE seem to have the impression that they can buy these properties at such incredibly reduced prices that they are a steal, and that's not the case," said Doug Bisset, broker with William Pitt Real Estate of Fairfield, Conn., who has been trying to sell Resolution Trust's unfinished colonial home in Southport. He said there had been more than 20 inquires on the house since it came on the market in June, most from people in New York City, Connecticut and Boston who had found it listed in the Asset Inventory. Some made offers, he said, but they were rejected as ridiculously low.
A broker in Queens, Margie Elstein, has been assigned responsibility by Resolution Trust for selling several of its co-op apartments. She said inquiries have come from New York, Boston and Philadelphia.
But she said most of the prospective buyers lost interest immediately when they learned the apartments were occupied by rent-regulated tenants who cannot be evicted unless Resolution Trust carries out its threat to circumvent New York State law.
Those willing to buy the occupied apartments as long-term investments have another problem, she said. With co-ops under financial strain across New York City, she said, banks are unwilling to finance investment in occupied units. That means anyone willing to buy them would have to pay cash. So far, she said, one vacant co-op in the Rego Park complex has been sold for $29,000. None of the occupied apartments has been sold.

 BODY:
WHILE New York City fights to retain companies considering moves to the suburbs, southwestern Fairfield County, where so many New York companies resettled more than a decade ago, is experiencing a surge of newcomers. This time, they are smaller companies and divisions of the large ones, rather than huge corporations.
 Local brokers say the resultant employee relocations, which have risen by 25 percent in the last year, are a glimmer of light in an otherwise dim housing market. 
 "Fairfield County was born because people wanted to move out of New York," said Peter Helie, president of residential real estate at William Pitt Realtors in Stamford. "That beat still goes on."
 Holger Arning, the company's senior commercial broker, said he believes that 68 companies -- mostly from Manhattan and Westchester County -- will have moved into the county by the end of the year, equaling last year's total. Those that have already moved this year include the New York offices of Hitachi Instruments, Chevron Oil International, Eastman Kodak, Chrysler Capital Corporation, Corroon & Black Insurance, and General Electric Capital Corporation.
 Office vacancy rates countywide have declined since the third quarter of 1989, going from about 29 to about 20 percent vacant, according to the Grubb & Ellis commercial realty office in Stamford. As the offices fill up at a rate of about 600,000 square feet a year, the demand for housing rises.
 "The exodus of companies has all but stopped, and we have a decline in the number of houses that corporations must sell after employees have left," said Ann Moore, relocation director for William Pitt.
 The US West Capital Corporation, which provides financing for customers of the Denver telephone company, relocated from Denver to Stamford in January. Like many capital corporations, the company needs to be near New York's banks and credit markets, but the employees like the quality of life in the suburbs, said Judith Thomas, its human resources director. Another incentive has been the decline in residential real estate prices.
 Timothy Gallagher of suburban Chicago is one of several people recruited by US West and transferred to Stamford. He sold his house in Willamette, Ill., on his own and, working through US West's relocation program, bought a house in New Canaan, getting a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at just under 10 percent from Prudential Home Mortgage. "The house had been for sale for two years and the asking price had come down 30 percent," he said. "The location is a strong drawing card. We have the benefits of the city without having to be there."
 His only problem now is one endemic to Fairfield. "We are trying to hire clerical help at the office and it's very difficult," he said. "They can't afford to live here."
 Listings in most Gold Coast towns now include a few houses under $200,000, and dozens between $200,000 and $300,000. "Not since the early 1980's have we had inventory at these prices," said Douglas Milne, president of Kelly Milne Realtors in Darien. Most relocating executives look for homes in the $350,000 to $600,000 range, most brokers said.
 Among Mr. Milne's recent customers are Anthony and Susan Ibarguen, transfers from Boca Raton, Fla., who bought a house in New Canaan last July. Mr. Ibarguen is a vice-president at JWP, a technical services company based in Purchase, N.Y. His wife, Susan, is Westport sales manager.
 The Ibarguens, former Manhattan residents, ruled out living in New York City or Westchester. "New York taxes are outrageously high," said Mr. Ibarguen, "and when we go into the city now it's shocking. Whether it's the people on the streets, or the lack of space, or being afraid to use the subways, it's not the life style we want."
 Their relocation involved only moving costs. Their Florida apartment was a rental, and friends in Connecticut steered them to realtors and mortgage lenders, many of whom offered better terms when they learned the couple was being moved by an employer, Mr. Ibarguen said.
 Relocating an employee's family can cost up to $50,000. US West paid for the Gallaghers' moving, house-hunting trips and temporary housing and paid some points on their new mortgage. To save monthly carrying charges, repair bills and commissions, some companies urge employees to sell their own houses. In return, the company may pay off several thousand dollars worth of interest on the employee's new mortgage. Some companies hire local placement services.
Home Buyers Assistance Corporation in Westport does not buy or sell real estate, or finance mortgages. "We provide advice and counsel to the transferees," said Robert J. Vossler, the president, "matching towns to pocketbooks, evaluating rental against purchase, discussing financing, schools and services in the area and finding the appropriate real estate agent and lender."
His county tour costs $600. "To keep a $200,000-a-year executive happy, the companies think it's worth it," he said.
OTHER relocation firms include Prudential Connecticut Realty, based in West Hartford. Its Fairfield County office in Norwalk just added three people to the staff because "companies are getting interested again in relocating to Fairfield County," said Linda Lara, the agency's president.
 In the early 80's, when interest rates were climbing, Homequity relocation service opened in Wilton and "transferees were first perceived as real buyers, not tire-kickers," said Linda Alt, Homequity's president. Today it moves 40,000 families a year for Champion International and other local companies.
 Relocations, once viewed as steps up the corporate ladder, had been rejected in recent years by many executives who resented disrupting family life. Now, as the economy slows, it is regaining acceptance as employees realize that somebody else may be waiting to take the job.
"We placed an ad in The New York Times for a director of financial planning," said Ms. Thomas at US West, where 150 management people will eventually be hired, "and we got 600 answers."

M.C.I. Rent Increase
 
Question: What are the sorts of major capital improvement expenses for which a rent-stabilized tenant can be charged? Would pointing, for example -- which it seems to me is maintenance rather than an improvement -- qualify? What about new plumbing or the cost of a lobby renovation? . . . Mary Watson, Manhattan
 
 Answer: It would depend on the extent of the work. According to the New York City Rent Stabilization Code, most work must be a new installation and not the repair of old equipment. New plumbing would qualify.
Some procedures, like pointing and waterproofing, could be eligible for M.C.I. rent increases. However, to qualify, any work must be done not on part of the building or in some units, but buildingwide, and benefit all tenants.
As for lobby renovations,Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said this kind of work would probably not qualify for M.C.I. increases unless it was done in connection with some other type of capital improvement project in the lobby.
"If an owner made some changes in the way the lobby looked in connection with other improvements like new elevators or new buzzer system," said Mr. Viola, "part of the expenses for the renovation project might qualify. But redecorating would not qualify for M.C.I. increases."
For more information, call the Rent Hotline at the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal at (718) 739-6400 or send for fact sheet #11, available at both Manhattan locations: 156 Williams Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10038, and 163 West 125th Street, 5th Floor, N.Y., N.Y. 10027.
 
 Sublet Surcharge
 
 Question: I own a cooperative apartment that I sublet. When I bought it there was a 10 percent surcharge on the maintenance for subletting. A letter from the management recently stated that the by-laws of the co-op had been changed, increasing the sublet fee to 20 percent of the maintenance.
Can the board raise the maintenance fees for some owners but not for the majority of shareholders? . . . Howard Furman, Howard Beach, Queens
 
 Answer: No. But the sublet fee is is a surcharge, not a maintenance increase. The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court upheld the right of co-op boards to impose "reasonable" sublet fees without the approval of a majority of the shareholders. The fact that the bylaws for your co-op have been amended to increase the sublet fee strengthens the board's position.
 
 Sublet Without a Lease
 
Question: I am subletting a stabilized apartment from an acquaintance without a formal lease. Our arrangement is that I can live there as long as I wish. Conditions have deteriorated over the last few years. Paint is peeling from the ceiling and the contact paper on the walls has started to come off. Repairs are needed. Do I have any legal recourse? . . . W. J. F., Manhattan
 
 Answer: No. If you cannot persuade the prime tenant to improve the conditions, your only options without a legal lease are to live with them, do them yourself or move out.
Your situation illustrates the risk of subletting without a lease. Both you and the person who has allowed you to live in the apartment are vulnerable to eviction. The rent stabilization rules give prime tenants the right to sublet for two years in any four-year period and a landlord can not unreasonably deny a prime tenant the right to sublet. But the rules also require that subtenants have subleases signed by landlords.

HEADLINE: The '91 Budget's Impact on Homeowners

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
THE nation's 1991 deficit-reduction package will make real estate a slightly less attractive tax shelter for the most affluent families while continuing incentives for low-income housing, according to accountants and tax experts.
The legislation leaves in place the deductibility of mortgage interest and local property taxes, but starting next year taxpayers will have the amount they can claim for those and other itemized deductions reduced by 3 percent for every dollar of income above $100,000. That change represents more a nibble than a bite. 
 Real estate related deductions will become slightly less valuable to those at the upper end of the income spectrum. For families with incomes below $100,000, however, the full amount of their mortgage payments and property taxes will remain deductible.
"Many people will be paying higher taxes and getting less deductions," said Jeffrey Perone, a tax partner in Deloitte & Touche, one of the nation's largest accouting firms. "The higher your income, the bigger the bite."
Others said the 1991 tax law changes will do more to weaken than support real estate markets that have already slumped into recession.
Particularly vulnerable are New York, New Jersey and Connectict, which are home to the nation's largest concentration of upper-income taxpayers.
"People are going to feel less wealthy, and they will think twice about buying new homes," said David L. Milstein, chairman of the national real estate practice of Coopers & Lybrand, an accounting firm based in Manhattan.
"Layered on top of our weak real estate markets, I do not see the new tax law as positive."
Nevertheless, the changes in the 1991 tax code will have a less dramatic impact on real estate than the sweeping overhaul enacted in 1986. Under the 1986 act, investors, who had previously been allowed to deduct interest payments on an unlmited number of properties, were limited to their own home and one vacation home or investment property.
Passive loss provisions, which had attracted investors into rental housing and commercial ventures, were largely eliminated and depreciation schedules were lengthened, further reducing the returns of real estate investors.
Although the 1991 revisions will be modest by comparison, real estate industry executives maintain that the decision by Congress to reduce itemized deductions, even by a little, is a troubling sign.
"It bothers us more in principal than practice," said John Tucillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. "It means that the deductibility of mortgage interest is on the table and could remain on the table in the future."
Some provisions of the tax code and Federal budget that for years have been supporting low- and moderate-income housing, and had been threatened with elimination in 1991, survived the Congressional ax.
One is the mortgage revenue bond program, used by most states to raise capital through tax-free bond issues, with the funds used to make low-interest mortgage loans available to low- and moderate-income home buyers. Although qualifications vary from state to state, the mortgages are usually offered to families buying their first homes.
"We really were at risk," said Carmen A. Culpeper, president of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, or Sonyma, which issues the mortgage revenue bonds in New York. At times in the lengthy negotiations over the Federal budget, support for the state programs was deleted but ultimately the program was restored.
NEW YORK'S program, which is larger than those in any of the other states except Alaska, has committed $2.6 billion in mortgages to 36,000 home buyers since 1983. Income qualifications vary depending on the cost of housing in different parts of the state -- New York City families can qualify with higher incomes than families in Buffalo, for example -- but Ms. Culpeper said the typical family getting a mortgage has $33,000 in income and is buying a $74,000 house.
Those receiving Sonyma mortgages pay 8.5 percent interest and can finance up to 95 percent of the price of the homes.
Another Federal program that was targeted for elimination by some in Congress was the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, offered since 1986. The program has attracted dozens of corporate sponsors into low-income housing development by offering them credits that can be used to reduce their corporate income taxes. Originally authorized for three years, the program was due to be phased out in 1991.
Although proponents had lobbied Congress heavily to have it extended indefinitely, the compromise budget package for 1991 extends it only one year, and even that concession came in last-minute negotiations.
"THIS is the only Federal subsidy we have left for rental housing designed for the truly poor," said Martin D. Levine, vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, which has invested $150 million in the tax credit projects.
One of the biggest beneficiaries of the program has been New York City, which has relied heavily on the tax credit program in its $5.1 billion, 10-year plan to rehabilitate city-owned property into low-income housing, as well as build new apartments and houses for poor and moderate-income people. Investors in the New York City program include Fannie Mae, the American Express Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company and Pfizer, among others
"We see wide support for this program," Mr. Levine said. "We had hoped to see it extended permanently."
Some real estate industry groups lobbied heavily, but unsuccessfully, for new investment incentives or at least the restoration of those lost in the 1986 overhaul. One such incentive would have been provided in the budget proposal by President Bush, which would have lowered capital gains taxes. While most experts said the measure would have had its most pronounced effect on stocks, bonds and other more liquid investments, it might also have lured more money into real estate ventures.
Under the compromise passed by Congress, householders in the income tax "bubble" -- those currently paying a top rate of 33 percent -- might benefit by waiting to sell their homes until next year.
That is because the capital gains rate they pay on the sale would be the same as their tax rate this year, but will be reduced to 28 percent in 1991.
Nonetheless, analysts said they did not expect the slight relief in capital gains taxes to lend much encouragement to those considering real estate purchases.
Another proposal, advocated widely by the real estate industry, but rejected by Congress, was to restore the passive-loss provisions of the pre-1986 tax code. Those provisions allowed large investors in rental property who were not getting enough rental income to meet their expenses to deduct part of the loss from their income for tax purposes.
Under current law, left intact by Congress, passive-loss deductions can be claimed, but only by small investors on a tightly limited basis. Only those making less than $100,000 qualify and they can claim no more than $25,000 in deductions from their taxable income.

HEADLINE: Collectors of Classic Jigsaw Puzzles Love to Pick Up the Pieces

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
IN 1908, jigsaw puzzles were advertised as "all the rage of Newport." Now the puzzles are much the rage in Connecticut. Craftsmen are cutting them from wood, manufacturers are stamping them out of cardboard and at least one collector is saving the puzzles that were such a hit with the smart set in Rhode Island.
"There's a considerable interest," said Anne D. Williams, an economics professor at Bates College in Maine and author of the just-released "Jigsaw Puzzles, an Illustrated History and Price Guide," published by Wallace-Homestead Book Company. She and other fans say old puzzles are part of history, contemporary ones present new challenges, and a good puzzle from any era is simply fun to assemble. 
 Stephen J. Olin of Woodbridge, a toy collector, said he has put together each of the 200 antique puzzles in his collection. The walls of his home are adorned with completed, framed 19th-century puzzles, some of them depicting steam-powered boats and locomotives. Shelves and tables hold jigsaw puzzles with interlocking pieces and puzzles of strips or blocks.
Mr. Olin pointed proudly to "The Permutation Dissected Map of the United States," made by Milton Bradley in 1868. Its rectangular pieces were assembled to show a map of the nation as it was then. "Look, no Oklahoma," Mr. Olin said, "only Indian Territory."
He also displayed an 1876 puzzle featuring the buildings of that year's Phildadelphia Centennial Exposition. The celebration introduced to the public the power scroll saw, or jigsaw, that soon produced fancy woodwork and intricate puzzles.
An 1891 puzzle in Mr. Olin's collection advertises Hood's sarsaparilla, an all-purpose remedy. Others are from the E. I. Horsman Company, which promoted its wares as "all the rage of Newport."
Professor Williams noted that puzzles were also the rage during the Depression, when some people made puzzles to make money, and many people had ample time to do them.
Faith Kenton, a kindergarten teacher in Willimantic, said her mother and brother cut puzzles during the 1930's and sold them door to door. Recently, Mrs. Kenton began cutting them herself, she said, because she wanted puzzles that would help children learn and that would not bend, break or peel.
"I specialize in children's literature puzzles," she said, adding that her puzzles have illustrations of classics like Mother Goose rhymes, with words printed on them. "It's exciting. You have kids who don't want to look at letters, but they'll do a puzzle. And then you can read it together."
Mrs. Kenton said she still has her mother's worn saw but uses a new electric scroll saw with a fine blade to cut puzzles from birch plywood. Besides making puzzles for her classroom, she operates Primary Pieces, a part-time business through which she sells puzzles for $5 to $30 each.
"Teachers are my best customers and grandparents my second best," she said.
For Robert Godfrey of Thompson, making wooden puzzles became a full-time occuaption a few years ago, when he retired from his job as a sales manager for the Monsanto Company. He said he was inspired by his grandfather's puzzles, long kept in his family's Maine cottage.
"Every summer, we'd drag them out," Mr. Godfrey recalled. "They were cut back in the 1920's and 1930's, and today they're just as good as they were then."
When he decided to make such puzzles, "at first, I had to experiment," he said. Now his creations of basswood plywood range from simple puzzles for children to more complex ones for adults. Each includes Mr. Godfrey's trademark, a piece shaped like a flying gull.
Some of his puzzles include custom pieces. A puzzle for a devoted owner of corgis, for instance, included pieces shaped like the dogs. Mr. Godfrey said he makes adult puzzles "as difficult as possible," employing diabolical devices like a straight line that does not form an edge but is in the middle.
 
Presidential Note
 Mr. Godfrey often makes puzzles of decorative maps of the Maine coast, and he recently sent one to President Bush depicting Walker Point, the area of the Bush family home in Kennebunkport. "I got a nice thank-you note," he said.
Mr. Godfrey charges around $10 for a children's puzzle of 8 to 10 pieces and up to $300 for an adult puzzle of 500 to 600 pieces. He said that his customers include older people who fondly remember the puzzles of their youth and younger people who say they have never seen such things before.
Professor Williams noted that Stave Puzzles Inc. of Norwich, Vt., has sparked interest in well-crafted wooden puzzles. The company, established in 1974, makes intricate wooden puzzles, selling for $200 to $3,000 apiece, that are cut by hand and can be made to order.
Liza Weihman of Greenwich said that she is fascinated by the beauty and complexity of Stave puzzles and regularly orders them cut with special features, like pieces that represent sports enjoyed by her three children. For a cousin who likes good wine and classic cars, she ordered a puzzle with pieces shaped like wine bottles and the Bentley insignia.
Stave puzzles "are really brilliant, and they become like popcorn," Mrs. Weihman said. "But you find out how selfish you are. You don't want anyone to help you."
Mass-produced cardboard puzzles are also successful in Connecticut. The Bepuzzled Division of Lombard Marketing in Bloomfield produces booklets containing mystery stories that a reader cannot solve without assembling an accompanying jigsaw puzzle.
 
Map of Soviet Union
 "You get literal and visual clues," said Mary Ann Lombard, who owns the company with her husband, Robert, adding that business is good. Among the Bepuzzled titles (around $10 to $20 each) are "Death by Diet," "Double Cross" and "Bomb." The customers for the latter, Mrs. Lombard said, include the Central Intelligence Agency.
The Great American Puzzle Factory in Norwalk produces cardboard puzzles that cost $5 to $15. One is a map of the Soviet Union designed by Kirill Doron, an artist from Moscow who now lives in Redding.
"People really want to know more about the Soviet Union, and this is a fun way to learn," said Pat Duncan, president of the company. Other Great American items include "Where's Waldo?" puzzles, to accompany the popular series of "Waldo" books for children, and "Celestial Planisphere," which shows the stars and glows in the dark.
Ms. Duncan also said that business is good, noting that people are especially likely to stay home with puzzles "when the economy is not doing too well."
Although her employees are busy, Ms. Duncan said, they know how to relax. "Sometimes we put the phones on hold," she said, "and do a puzzle."

HEADLINE: Tape Recorder vs. Court Reporter

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A STATE Supreme Court committee's search for the most efficient way to insure accurate records of court proceedings has intensified a debate over the use of tape recorders in the state's trial courts.
Though electronic recorders have been a fixture in many New Jersey courtrooms for almost 20 years, opponents of the technology say their use in civil and criminal trial courts will have a negative impact on the administration of justice and could be prejudicial to poor litigants. 
 Lawyers say the use of recorders restricts their ability to move about the courtroom and makes it difficult to comply with jurors' requests to rehear specific testimony without exposing the jurors to exchanges they should not hear, like objectionable testimony or conferences at the bench between the lawyers and the judge. In addition, they say, tape recordings often result in ambiguous, incomplete and even incorrect transcripts of the proceedings.
Proponents of electronic recording, however, say that properly operated modern tape recorders can do everything a human stenographer can do and more. They say recorders provide the most cost-effective, efficient and reliable method of obtaining accurate, permanent records of proceedings.
Caught in the middle of the debate are the hundreds of certified shorthand reporters, 200 of whom are official court reporters, and scores of students of the profession who are striving to keep one step ahead of the advancing technology that threatens their future livelihood.
 
Two Views on Accuracy
 "Basically, if you want an accurate record, then there's only one way to get it, and that's with a court reporter," said Barbara Johnson, a certified shorthand reporter in West Orange.
But Charles Gspann, of the Sound-Arts Company, an Ocean Township concern that installs sound systems in courtrooms, said: "There is no question about it. The right piece of recording equipment in a courtroom will far and away exceed anything that one human can do."
Tape recorders and court stenographers have been quietly coexisting, each with its own niche in the court system. But that balance began to shift when Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz of the State Supreme Court acknowledged late last year that he was considering replacing some retiring court reporters with tape recorders.
Lawyers and court reporters objected, and as a result Justice Wilentz appointed a 24-member committee to study the issue and make recommendations.
 
Public Hearings Held
 At two public hearings last month at the New Jersey State Bar Association Center in New Brunswick, the committee heard testimony. The majority of those who testified spoke in support of the court reporters.
"I would say that the organized bar is generally in favor of court reporters," said Judge Herman D. Michels, presiding judge of the Appellate Division of Superior Court and chairman of the committee.
"I also solicited the views of all the judges, and I would say that many of them are in favor of the court reporters, although those who already work with electronic recorders find it acceptable," he said.
 Judge Michels said he expected to hold at least one more hearing to give those familiar with the recording technology an opportunity to make a presentation. In addition, he said, the Certified Shorthand Reporters Association in New Jersey and the State Bar Association have asked for another opportunity to address the committee.
"I want the committee to see how this all stacks up when both sides are compared," Judge Michels said. "We hope to reach our conclusions by June."
Tape systems, which cost about $5,000 a courtroom, are considered to be an economical alternative to stenographers in some situations. Most lawyers say that nonjury proceedings in the Family Court and the Appellate Division do not require a court reporter.
But a reporter is essential, they say, in the trial courts.
"The tape just doesn't cut it," said Thomas J. Vesper, president of the New Jersey affiliate of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. Mr. Vesper's organization, many lawyers and the State Bar Association are opposed to the use of recorders in trial courts.
One of the reasons that lawyers disdain electronic recording, Mr. Vesper said, is that transcripts made from tapes are often incomplete, with words like "inaudible," "unintelligible" and "indiscernible" inserted in place of words or phrases the transcriber could not understand.
 
'Whoa, One at a Time'
 That occurs, he said, when two people speak at the same time, or when extraneous noise is picked up by the tape recorder's microphones. With a court reporter, Mr. Vesper said, that can be avoided.
 "When a court reporter hears two people talking at the same time," Mr. Vesper said, "he can just put up his hand and say, 'Whoa, one at a time.' " And if a witness's testimony is obscured by outside noise, he said, the reporter can simply ask the person to repeat what was said.
Those in favor of sound recordings, however, say they are more accurate, more economical and less subject to the personal interpretation of the transcriber.
"The court stenographer is the only person who can read his own notes," said Terry Gribben, owner of an Eatontown tape transcription service. "With us, if you don't agree with the transcript, you can just get the tape and listen to it yourself."
 In addition, Ms. Gribben said, the concerns expressed about the clarity of the recordings and monitoring of the proceedings are exaggerated.
"There's a live person running that machine," she said. "And that person can monitor the recording and make the same suggestions that a court stenographer can if two people are talking at the same time."
 
Used in Municipal Courts
 Tape recorders are now used in all of the state's municipal courts and in the Superior Court's Family Division, Special Civil Part and Law Division for some nonjury trials.
In addition, the State Supreme Court, the Appellate Division and the State Tax Court also record their proceedings.
Most of the state's trial courts, however, use official court reporters who have been hired from among the approximately 900 certified shorthand reporters licensed in New Jersey.
In 1981, Justice Wilentz froze the number of official court reporters at 215. Since then, as the result of retirements and a subsequent hiring freeze on all state jobs, that number has fallen to about 200. The average salary for an official court reporter is $45,000.
The courts that now regularly use reporters instead of recorders are the civil and criminal trial courts. And for trials, lawyers say, stenographers are far superior to tape recorders.
"With a tape recorder the lawyer is handcuffed to the counsel table," said David Ben-Asher, a lawyer in the state's Office of the Public Defender. "He's restricted in his mode of argument; he can't move away from the counsel table toward a witness or the jury."
In courts that use tape recorders, Mr. Ben-Asher said, participants must always be near a specific microphone in order to be identified on the recording. In most courtrooms, four microphones are used -- one in front of the judge, another at the witness stand and one at each counsel table.
As a result, Mr. Ben-Asher said, it is difficult to record conferences at the bench between the judge and the lawyers and private conferences in the judge's chambers, which are part of the trial's official records.
And transcripts of recorded proceedings, he said, are often inferior to those provided by stenographers.
 
More Reversals Expected
 "We think that there will be a greater number of verdicts reversed on appeal simply because the record can't be re-created," he said.
As a result, Mr. Ben-Asher said, some litigants will hire their own court reporters if the hearing is being electronically recorded.
"And that is something that indigent litigants have less of a capacity to do," he said.
Steven M. Koskinen, an official court reporter in Superior Court in Hudson County, agreed.
"We're seeing that people with money are bringing their own freelance reporters into court," he said. "There are going to be two forms of justice: one for the rich and one for the poor."
Mr. Koskinen said that to demonstrate the inaccuracy of the sound recording technology, he recently ordered second transcripts of tape recordings that had already been transcribed, with the second set prepared by a different transcription company from the first.
"In about 200 transcript pages there were over 1,000 differences in the actual words that appear," Mr. Koskinen said. The transcripts, he said, were turned over to the committee.
"The tape recorder does not record language," Mr. Koskinen said. "It just mindlessly records sounds."
 
Eliminating Many Problems
 But Frank Gspann, vice president of Sound-Arts and son of Charles Gspann, said that the new "digital audio tape" technologies, or DAT, can eliminate many of the problems now associated with electronic recording.
"With a good, four-channel DAT machine, four people can talk simultaneously, and you can later identify what everybody said," Mr. Gspann said. Such a system, he said, would cost about $6,000 to install.
"Technically, all of the problems can be addressed," he said. "But we're dealing with lawyers and judges who don't understand technology and what's doable and what's not doable."
Mr. Gspann said he would demonstrate the benefits of the new machines to the Supreme Court committee at its next hearing.
 
Meeting the Competition
 And while the proponents of electronic recording extol the virtues of their advanced technology, the new wave of court reporters emerging from stenography schools are being prepared to meet their competition on equal terms.
"Court reporters do not believe that this is a new technology replacing the old," said Stanley Rizman, an official court reporter in United States District Court in Newark and vice president of the Certified Shorthand Reporters Association in New Jersey. "Court reporters believe that they themselves are the new technology."
Mr. Rizman was referring to the ability that court reporters now have to connect their stenographic machines to computers. The computer, using a dictionary of stenographic terms, then translates the reporter's cryptic shorthand into everyday English.
As a result, instantaneous transcripts of the proceedings can be made available to the judge and lawyers during the trial.
Though no such systems are now in place in New Jersey courts, they are being used in courts in other states and in some Federal courtrooms.
Indeed, students who are now training to become certified shorthand reporters must be familiar with the new technology in addition to being able to take dictation on their machines at the rate of 225 words a minute.
 
Concern on Replacement
But even armed with their technological advances, and backed by most of the lawyers in the state, some court reporters in training are nevertheless concerned with the prospect of eventually being replaced by a machine.
"It's really dog eat dog in this business," said Crizella Smith, a 25-year-old Fort Lee resident, who is just completing three years of training at the American Business Academy in Hackensack.
"It's constant practice, keeping your confidence up and building speed," Ms. Smith said. "You look around and you know you're going to be competing with all the other students for jobs. And then you hear that they want to start bringing in tape recorders. Sometimes I think it's just not fair."

HEADLINE: For Kean, Drew Has Become a Laboratory for His Ideas

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

DATELINE: MADISON

 BODY:
TEN months after leaving public office, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean says he is thriving in his new role as Drew University's 10th president. A bicycle has replaced the state car and driver, and Cabinet meetings have given way to faculty meetings, but his new position is allowing him to pursue the some of the education reform issues that meant so much to him as Governor.
As Governor, Mr. Kean was accustomed to speaking at length and in the superlative about the importance of schooling. These days he still does, only instead of prodding New Jersey's diverse network of public schools and colleges into improvement, the 2,200-student university has become his laboratory. 
 "I don't think it's hyperbole and I don't think it's impossible, but I want to make Drew the finest small university in the country," Mr. Kean said in an interview.
 
'A Virtual Drew Demigod'
 Even with these aspirations, living up to the standard the Drew community has set for its new leader may be somewhat difficult. An article in the alumni magazine said that Mr. Kean was regarded as a "consummate fund-raiser, mediator and publicity gold mine -- a virtual Drew demigod." The Theological School dean gave Mr. Kean a sign that read, "Please don't walk on the water."
Mr. Kean said he had been in the water a lot since coming to Drew, but about the only mistake that has been noted is when he put his mortarboard on backward at his inauguration in April.
Both students and faculty have been surprised by Mr. Kean's visibility at Drew. He darts along campus paths on his bicycle to theater productions and sports events, eats meals with students, plans to teach political science next year and holds a weekly office hour for students who wish to drop by to discuss concerns. Professors were flabbergasted that he would actually sit through an entire faculty meeting.
"There's a presence we never had before," said Dr. Donald Jones, chairman of the University Senate and a professor of religion. "He is more hands-on in managing the internal affairs of the university than some of us thought he would be."
Along with the pleasures of the new post have come old headaches Mr. Kean was hoping to escape, like a work calendar that keeps him out an average of five nights a week, leaving little time for his family. But he said he has for the most part dodged feeling like what his friend Lamar Alexander, former Governor of Tennessee, has warned was the fate of former governors: "Rooster today, feather duster tomorrow."
Mr. Kean was reluctant to talk specifically about the policies of his successor, Jim Florio, but he made no secret of the fact that he disapproved of much of what Mr. Florio has done.
"Obviously I would have done things very differently, and everyone who knows me knows I would have done it differently," Mr. Kean said. "One thing that Keynesian and supply-side economists agree upon is that raising taxes in a falling economy is a mistake. I hope that if the economy continues to drop, the current administration will find some way to readjust the taxes."
Mr. Kean has little sympathy for the difficulties Mr. Florio is confronting in trying to eliminate a major budget deficit and comply with the New Jersey Supreme Court mandate to increase state aid to urban school districts in a weakening economy.
"We were in a worse situation my second year as Governor than Governor Florio is in now," he said. "We had the worst recession since the Great Depression, there was 12 percent unemployment and the Legislature was in opposition."
Mr. Kean is as far from Mr. Florio on the issue of education as he is on taxes. He said Mr. Florio's sweeping revision of New Jersey's public school financing law lacked accountability and might well diminish the state's finest school systems. Mr. Kean added that he was equally concerned about a 10.7 percent cut in this year's higher education budget.
"I have stayed totally out of the discussion because I thought that, had I involved myself, it would become political, rather than academic, and that's as it should be," he said. "But if next year's higher education budget is 8 percent lower than this year's, you'll not only have the highest cut in the country, but the highest cut in the history of the country in the last two years. I don't think that can be sustained without losing the progress we've made, losing presidents and faculty members."
 
Autonomy for State Colleges
 Under Mr. Kean, state expenditures for higher education reached record levels, state colleges were granted unprecented autonomy from Trenton and a competitive grant system was established that has been emulated by other states.
Jon Shure, director of communications for Governor Florio, said that accountability was a "cornerstone" of the Governor's new financing plan for public schools and that the cuts in higher education were a result of hard times.
"When Mr. Kean raised taxes in 1982 before the economy really started to improve, he realized you can't be on the side of increasing spending and also not increase revenues for the state," Mr. Shure said.
"These are very tough times, and hard decisions have to be made," he added. "In the process of cutting the higher education budget, the Governor increased the amount of money available for tuition assistance. It's a case of tough priorities."
"My theory as Governor was that a strong system of higher education enhanced jobs and created jobs," Mr. Kean said. "It was always at the top of our priority list."
With shrinking demographics and a shaky fiscal outlook, this is not the easiest time to be the president of a university, and Drew is no exception. This year the university's enrollment is 7.5 percent smaller than had been anticipated, largely because of an insistence that the quality of students admitted to the university not decline. After more than 30 years of balanced budgets, a small budget deficit last year grew to a $1.9 million deficit this year that is expected to grow to $3.5 million by next year.
In addition, Mr. Kean has acknowledged that morale on campus was low but said it was improving. He said that the morale problems were due to the fact that some Drew students "didn't recognize just how good this place was."
 
Building on Strengths
 He plans to enhance the university's reputation by building on its strengths in the areas of technology, multicultural understanding and teaching, rather than changing direction. He hopes that in the process Drew will become a model of what other universities should be doing.
Mr. Kean said Drew had just begun to enlist technology in the service of a liberal arts education. The university says that in 1984 it became the first liberal-arts school in the country to issue computers to students, who now routinely leave messages, submit homework and check the library card catalogue with their machines as part of an elaborate computer network. They can also watch European theater productions and foreign newscasts in their rooms by satellite.
"The liberal arts teach the student how to think, but these days you also have to be technologically competent," he said. "If you produce a student who is both -- who has the ability to think and adapt and is also technologically competent -- you've got a very special product."
As a second objective, Mr. Kean would like to make Drew's foreign study option mandatory within five years. Currently one-third of Drew's undergraduates spend at least one semester studying abroad. Four new faculty positions have also been created for next year in Asian, African, Russian and Arabic studies, despite the university's strained financial resources.
"We're a much changed, much smaller world," Mr. Kean said. "The U.S. is not going to be No. 1. It is going to be one of three or four strong economic powers. And if a person cannot understand how to work with other cultures, then eventually the country will not succeed."
 
$10,000 Award Created
 The third aspect of university life Mr. Kean hopes to develop is in the area of teaching. He has created a $10,000 president's award to go to a Drew faculty member for teaching and community service, which he believes is the largest award in the country for teaching.
The concept of rewarding the best teachers monetarily echoes an unsuccessful effort by Mr. Kean to introduce a master teacher plan throughout the state when he was Governor. But this time, without union resistance and with the help of an anonymous donor, the Drew plan is expected to go forward.
The specifics of the award are still being worked out -- how often it will be given and what portion of the money, if any, would be used to improve education at Drew. Mr. Kean said both faculty and students would help select recipients.
 
Considered a Coup
 Signing on Mr. Kean as president of Drew was considered a coup for the university. It was the late Rutgers University president, Dr. Edward Bloustein, who encouraged Mr. Kean to look at smaller universities, saying that effecting change at larger institutions would take a minimum of 10 years. Dr. Bloustein died last year.
Just how long Mr. Kean will remain at Drew is unclear, but there is an assumption that he will be gone in a few years.
"We know he won't be here for a decade," Dr. Jones said. "At first we thought he'd be here for about five years, and now it might be four or four and a half."
That timing coincides with speculation that Mr. Kean might challenge Senator Frank R. Lautenberg for his seat in 1994. Mr. Kean, who serves on President Bush's education advisory committee, said he had made no promises to the university about the length of his tenure there. He did, though, deny rumors that had been circulating that he would be replacing Lauro F. Cavazos as United States Secretary of Education or would run against Governor Florio in 1993.
"I'm a Jeffersonian," he said. "You serve your time and then you do other things. Eight years to me is a long time, and I did my best. Now it's time for other people and other ideas."
But Mr. Kean, ever the politician, left the door open for the future. Speaking of government positions, he said, "I hope frankly that there's never a year when I'm not doing something."

HEADLINE: L.I.R.R. Planning To Drop 60 Trains

 BODY:
THE Long Island Rail Road, beset by a budget gap of $27 million and a shrinking ridership attributed to "the unexpected depth of the recent downturn in our region's economy," is planning to cancel 60 trains a day and close Pennsylvania Station and the Flatbush Avenue terminal in Brooklyn from 1:30 A.M. to 4:30 A.M.
The cuts would go into effect on Jan. 21, if approved by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the railroad's parent agency.
In a brochure distributed on all trains last Wednesday, the railroad said that "despite significant, continuing belt-tightening and streamlining internally," it was turning to service changes to balance its 1991 budget, which totals $643 million.
The railroad said that the changes would preserve its core commuter service while targeting areas where alternative service was available and that the changes reflected "the conclusion that L.I.R.R. service in many cases is scheduled beyond the capacity of our physical plant to carry it."
 
Faulting the Economy

The railroad is re-evaluating its service in the wake of five years of signal upgrading between Jamaica and Penn Station, which culminated in Harold reconstruction project last summer.
The L.I.R.R. said the timetable revisions were "exceedingly complicated" because each change can ripple through the system and the movement of crews has to be coordinated with equipment maintenance and regular service.
"Into this complex scenario," the brochure said, "comes the current state of the economy," adding:
"About half our budget comes from government subsidies, mainly through state business, real estate and insurance taxes. Because the regional economy is depressed, tax receipts are down, and other subsidies have been trimmed."
The railroad noted that almost one-third of the commuters worked in the depressed finance, insurance and real-estate industries, "so we've felt the impact of a slowdown there in the form of lower ridership."
With subsidies and commuter revenues falling, the railroad said, it would have to trim its budget by 4 percent from the original projections for 1991. In 1990, the railroad added, it had already cut its budget 3 percent and made cuts not related to schedules. Any reductions in the work force, the railroad said, would be by attrition.
 
1.1% Decrease in Morning Seats

Beginning on Jan. 21, there will be 11 fewer trains in the morning rush hour and three fewer in the evening. The other eliminated trains are from off-peak hours, mainly in the morning. A spokeswoman for the railroad said the changes would translate to a 1.1 percent decrease in seats for the morning rush hour.
These are the major proposed changes:
BABYLON BRANCH: Eliminating the 5:02 A.M. and 8:37. Combining the 6:32 with the 6:56 from Wantagh and the 6:58 from Freeport into two trains, one from Babylon at 6:33 and the other from Wantagh at 6:54. Merging the 7:46 runs from Freeport and Merrick into a 7:42 departure from Merrick. Combining the 7:41 from Seaford and the 7:33 from Babylon into a 7:27 from Babylon to Brooklyn.
FAR ROCKAWAY BRANCH: Eliminating the 8:12 and the 6:40 from Penn Station.
HEMPSTEAD BRANCH: Eliminating the 8:20. Changing the 8:03 to leave at 8:08, adding a stop at Queens Village.
LONG BEACH BRANCH: Eliminating the 8:05. Combining the 4:55 and 4:59 from Penn Station, to leave at 5 o'clock.
MONTAUK BRANCH: Eliminating the 7:27 from Speonk. Adding an 8:12 departure from Speonk.
PORT JEFFERSON BRANCH: Changing equipment on the 5 A.M. Combining the 5:56 and the 6:51 from Huntington.
Two runs from Penn Station would be added, 7:42 A.M. to Ronkonkoma and 7:50 A.M. to Babylon.
A hearing on the changes is scheduled for 4 P.M. on Dec. 5 at the Nassau County Board of Supervisors Executive Building in Mineola.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Mills;
Still for Women Only, With New Curriculum

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.

 BODY:
A half-year after Mills College reversed its decision to admit men for the first time in its 138-year history, faculty members have begun a plan to revitalize the liberal-arts curriculum and thus make ends meet by attracting 225 more female students in the next five years.
The plan centers on a pilot program of interdisciplinary classes for freshmen and sophomores. 
 Marilyn Chandler, the English department head, who is teaching one of the classes, said Mills's experiment was part of a national trend. "A lot of schools are going in the direction of interdisciplinary, cross-cultural and ethnic studies," she said, adding that recent writings, like Allan Bloom's "Closing of the American Mind," have raised questions about what educated people should know.
The college's acting president, Virginia Smith, said: "If we think about how people use liberal-arts education, it is rarely used within the confines of any one discipline. Life isn't so neatly divided."
Ms. Smith, the former president of Vassar College, replaced Mary Metz, who resigned in July, saying she could no longer provide the strong leadership that she felt Mills would need during the next five years. Her nine-year tenure had ended in a student and faculty uproar over a May 3 decision by the trustees, supported by Ms. Metz, to make Mills coeducational.
 
 Enrollment Goal
 In reversing their decision on May 18, the trustees set various goals for fund raising and alumnae participation as well as enrollment -- to 1,000 -- for the college to meet by 1995. The proposed curriculum changes are intended to help attain those goals.
The freshman seminars -- "Women at Work in America," "Ecological Policy and Public Catastrophe" and "Understanding Revolutions" -- and the sophomore core course, "Critical Perspectives on Human Problems," are taught by teams of professors from two different disciplines. In "Understanding Revolutions," for example, students are asked to research and define a revolution from both a historical and a political point of view. "Ecological Policy" draws from biology and government.
Although many colleges offer freshman seminars, Ms. Chandler said, the sophomore course is more unusual. Ms. Chandler and Bruce Pavlik, a biology professor who also teaches the course, said they were trying to provoke thought and to question assumptions about subjects like space, time and knowledge systems.
During the unit on space, for instance, professors from different disciplines lecture weekly on spatial concepts, maps, urban planning, indoor and outdoor space in photography and ancient peoples' sacred space, Ms. Chandler said.
 
Different Perspectives
 The students will learn "how to step back and think rather broadly about the assumptions surrounding an issue," using these different perspectives to help them, Ms. Chandler said. In her planning, she talked to core class directors at Princeton University and at Occidental College in Los Angeles, which has an integrated humanities program for freshmen and sophomores.
The faculty voted to start the pilot courses last April, when it also voted on a motion to remain a women's college. The professors and students in the classes will turn in evaluations at the end of this semester that the full faculty will use to decide whether to continue the classes.
Nancy Thornborrow, an economics professor who helped develop the program, said the idea was for first-year students to complete a semester-long seminar and move on to a two-semester sophomore core course, eventually choosing an interdisciplinary major.
 
Staff Turnover
 Because of staff turnover and less than adequate advertising, the pilot courses "didn't get the kind of student response we expected," Ms. Chandler admitted. They also were not "bracketed as new" in the registration course packet given to students or listed in the course catalogue. Professors sent freshmen information on the classes during the summer, but most of the interest came from juniors and seniors who were allowed to enroll because of the low number of freshmen and sophomores.
Elin Caughey, a freshman from Indianapolis who is an art major, said that the seminar concept reminded her of humanities classes in high school and that she liked having two professors for a seminar.
Salome Portugao, a freshman from San Francisco who is majoring in education, is taking two seminars. "It's neat getting two different perspectives," she said.

HEADLINE: The Love for Cars: A Quarter-Century of Best Sellers

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE BEST-SELLING car today is a lot different from what it was 25 years ago. In the affluent and resource-abundant 1960's, an occasional Ford won out, but for the most part Americans saw the U.S.A. in a full-size Chevrolet. And No. 1, selling well over a million models, was a massive beast, stretching to 18 feet and more and weighing a couple of tons. To move all this metal took a powerful V-8 engine, which was mounted in the front to drive the rear wheels -- an arrangement that required a large hump in the passenger compartment to accommodate the drive shaft.
Late in the decade, gasoline mileage, never outstanding for a V-8, was further reduced by the onset of air pollution control equipment. At the worst, in 1974, the best seller got a mere 10 miles to a gallon. In 1974, the cutoff of oil by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries jolted the country with long lines at gasoline stations and rapidly rising prices. Sales of small, fuel-efficient imported cars, many from Japan, jumped as buyers opted for efficiency. 
 In 1975, Washington made it law: Detroit had to get an average of 27.5 miles to the gallon by 1985. Americans weren't shrinking, but their cars had to. The solution was to convert to front-wheel drive, eliminating that passenger-space hump by putting the entire power train under the hood. On average, the domestic car shed nearly 1,000 pounds and developed an overwhelming liking for smaller engines.
When the second oil shock hit in 1979, the General Motors Corporation kicked off with a four- or six-cylinder, front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Citation compact that claimed first place, until ousted by the even smaller Ford Escort. As the price of gasoline, adjusted for inflation, declined through the 1980's, a subtle shift occured. The better-performing V-6 began to gain on its four-cylinder counterpart.
Meanwhile, the number of models from domestic and import manufacturers proliferated into the hundreds. And the Japanese began building factories in this country to evade import restraints imposed to protect Detroit in the early 1980's. Last year, sales of just 362,707 units qualified a car as the best seller. For the first time, it bore a foreign name: Honda. But in some ways, it is as American as apple pie; 60 percent were assembled in Ohio.

A New Claim on Drexel
 The Government's claim for $11 billion from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. reads like an indictment of organized crime: Drexel plundered failed savings and loans "through bribery, coercion, extortion, fraud and other illegal means." The market for Drexel's "junk bonds" depended on the savings and loans, the Government said, and the collapse of dozens of these institutions can largely be blamed on Drexel. Drexel, still kicking, suggested that the Government is asking for so much because its New York law firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore, will share in the money recovered. Thomas D. Barr, the Cravath partner handling the Government's case, knows plenty about fighting Federal charges himself. He defeated a 13-year antitrust effort to break up the International Business Machines Corporation. But even he can't recover $11 billion. Drexel's estate is worth only about $3 billion, with other claimants swarming.

Major Surgery at First Boston
 Another wounded veteran of the takeover battles of the 1980's is pulling through with intensive care. CS Holding Inc., the parent of Credit Suisse, the ambitious Swiss bank, gained control of CS First Boston last week by pouring in $300 million. First Boston underwent two other delicate, expensive operations: First, CS Holding removed from the First Boston portfolio hundreds of millions of dollars in weak loans. Then came a major amputation, with First Boston dismissing nearly all senior executives in real estate. The only major American investment bank to come under foreign control, First Boston is just the latest to require emergency resuscitation. Samuel G. Liss, a securities industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, said, "The difficulties that began with the demise of Drexel, which intensified the scrutiny of brokerage firm balance sheets, forced the hands of CS First Boston, Kidder Peabody and Shearson." General Electric has had to invest hundreds of millions in Kidder, and American Express had to buy full ownership of Shearson Lehman. On Wall Street, as elsewhere, health care costs are rising out of control.
 
Sad Days for Freedom Bank
 It only had assets of $101.9 million. But Freedom National Bank of New York was often the first place black business people turned for a loan. Freedom was founded in 1964 by investors, among them Jackie Robinson, who wanted to promote Harlem's redevelopment. By the late 80's, overly ambitious goals mired the bank in bad loans. Federal regulators took it over as private rescue efforts failed. On Tuesday morning, Freedom opened its doors to pay off depositors who had been lining up on West 125th Street since 4 A.M. But a larger black-owned institution still thrives justdown the street: Carver Federal Savings Bank, with more than twice the assets, a healthy financial base and managers who know they can't afford as many mistakes as the bigger lenders downtown.
 
Another Chance for Eastern
 Attracting more domestic business travelers helps, but Eastern Airlines's survival might depend on events in the Middle East. On Wednesday, a Federal bankruptcy judge gave Eastern $15 million from an escrow fund to keep flying. The creditors, who say that continued losses are draining their potential payoffs, clamored for the airline's liquidation. Martin R. Shugrue, the airline's trustee and manager, says that the offer of first-class seats for full-fare coach travelers gives the airline a chance of breaking even by March. "He's having some success," said Thomas Longman, an analyst at Bear Stearns. The judge's forebearance has reassured travelers, who are keeping their reservations. But Mr. Longman said that Mr. Shugrue's plans are based on 90-cents-a-gallon aviation fuel. The fuel rose from 58 cents in July to as much as $1.40 more recently, but sold for less than a dollar a gallon last week.
 
Shaky Days at Pan Am
 The only United States airline that flies to Moscow is looking as harried and hungry as most Soviet consumers. The Pan Am Corporation sold its London routes last week to United Airlines for an urgently needed $400 million. United also agreed to guarantee $100 million worth of Pan Am tickets, so travelers would not be stranded if Pan Am folds. The airlines will coordinate their schedules and share their frequent-flier programs -- measures likely to feed passengers from United's domestic network onto Pan Am's international flights. The British and United States Governments have yet to approve the deal. But the airline's survival also depends on the price of fuel. Pan Am's fallback is a $450 million takeover offer from Trans World Airlines and its chairman, Carl C. Icahn.
 
Donald Trump Pays His Dues
 Donald J. Trump agreed on Friday to carve up his interest in the Taj Mahal hotel and casino and serve his creditors as much as half. He missed a $47.3 million interest payment, forcing the Atlantic City hotel into a quick bankruptcy reorganization and losing some assets to creditors for the first time. A payment on Trump's Castle casino comes due next month.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
The President's Optimism
 The economy is really in trouble if even the President says it might be in a recession. Until recently, President Bush was able to find prosperity where most economists found decline. On Thursday, his tone changed, somewhat. "I am concerned about the slowdown," he said. "I worry about anybody that wants a job and doesn't have one." Not that the President has lost his ability to sound as upbeat as someone who has just thrown a half dozen ringers one after the other. His economic advisors gave him word that a recession is likely to be mild, he said, "six months at most." He must hope so, or else he could be the one in need of a job come January 1993. .
 
The Inflationary Slope
 Higher energy prices are giving rise less to an inflationary spiral than a gradual slope. The cost of energy did raise the consumer price index six-tenths of 1 percent last month, but only three-tenths without food and energy -- the same pattern as the producer price numbers reported earlier. With a weak economy, said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, "we're not seeing the oil price shock being translated into a permanent acceleration in core inflation."
 
Tarnish on the Bright Spot
 The weak dollar, an exporter's best friend, resulted in no increase in September shipments. Exports, which had been growing, fell 2.2. percent. "That takes care of the one bright spot in the economy," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover. Some economists blamed weaker growth and reduced demand abroad, while others said that air cargo companies were too busy carrying military goods to the Middle East. The trade deficit fell 3.3 percent, to $9.4 billion, as imports also declined 2.4 percent. Dr. Kellner drew encouragement from oil imports that rose from in September despite the embargo against Iraq. "It shows there is plenty of oil," he said.
 
In Brief
 Most of last week's other figures confirmed the economists' consensus that the nation is entering a recession. Industrial production fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in October. Retail sales grew just one-tenth of 1 percent. The Federal Reserve apparently responded by pushing down interest rates.
 Oil prices fell $4.11 to $29.78 a barrel last week, as oil traders said that their fear of a a Middle East war had diminished.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Trade Talks in Jeopardy
 A dispute over European farm subsidies last week threatened the success of four years of trade talks. The Europeans reluctantly offered to cut their subsidies, down 15 percent since 1986, another 15 percent by 1996. Inadequate, said Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, as the Administration debated whether to stalk out of the negotiations. Her response helped convince the Dutch trade minister, Yvonne van Rooy, to speak of the 15 percent reduction as "not a final offer, but clearly an opening bid."
 
Mrs. Thatcher's Challenge
 A "Europeanist" has arisen to challenge British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 11-year reign. Michael Heseltine, who quit her Cabinet in 1986, said on Wednesday that he would contest her leadership in a vote by Conservative members of Parliament on Tuesday. Mr. Heseltine sides with many business people but not Mrs. Thatcher in wanting Britain to take part in the European Community's drive towards economic union. A news service survey gave Mrs. Thatcher a clear edge. But the British public appears restive under high inflation and a headstrong leader.
 
Japan's Quiet Green Movement
 Japanese corporations fear that their envirnomental efforts will be greeted with the sound of no hands clapping. Accused of single-minded dedication to efficiency and growth, some are pursuing recycling, conservation, beautification and rain-forest renewal. Semiconductor companies are working on ways to clean printed circuit boards without using chlorofluorocarbon gases that destroy the ozone layer. But the Japanese consider it defensive and immodest to boast of such efforts, reports the daily Nihon Keizai in an Asia Foundation translation. "Even within corporations, people look askance at environmental proselytizing," the newspaper said. "Action-team members risk accusations of grandstanding by colleagues for using recycled business cards."
 
In Brief
 No longer will natty New Yorkers have to risk a shopping trip downtown. Barneys New York, with support from a Japanese partner, plans to open an 11-floor clothing store on upper Madison Avenue in 1992.
 Scali, McCabe, Sloves gave up the $40 million Volvo advertising account last week. A recent commercial demonstrating the car's ability to hold up under the onslaught of a monster pickup truck turned out to have been rigged.

One Muni Fund's Dismal Days

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
SOME mutual funds are born troubled. Others become troubled through their own efforts. And still others have trouble thrust upon them. But the best explanation for the mess brewing at the New York Muni Fund, with $230 million in assets, would seem to be "all of the above."
The tax-exempt fund's early days were shadowed by regulatory problems that continue to affect the day-to-day management of the fund. The fund's managers subsequently bought a number of small bond issues of uncertain provenance, and then carried some of them at premium prices after they had defaulted. And, along with all other regional muni-bond portfolios, the fund has had the mounting worries about New York, state and city, added to the problems it already faces. 
 The result is bad news for the New York Muni Fund's shareholders, whose principal value has declined sharply already, and a clear warning that all investors should monitor the quality of the bonds their funds own, and the prices ascribed to them.
 The New York Muni Fund is managed by Fundamental Portfolio Advisors, which is owned by Vincent Malanga, the fund's president, and Lance M. Brofman, the fund's chief portfolio strategist. The same firm also manages the California Muni Fund.
According to the New York fund's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Brofman "is limited in his activities" at the funds until Jan. 6, 1992, because of sanctions imposed on him by the commission in 1987. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Mr. Brofman settled a complaint that he had caused the fund's former investment advisory firm to make false and misleading statements about the California Muni Fund.
The New York Muni Fund's portfolio includes a number of small, illiquid bond issues that were sold by the brokerage firm of Matthews & Wright, which earlier this month agreed to plead guilty to criminal conspiracy charges in connection with a municipal bond scandal in the mid-80's. Further clouding its portfolio, New York Muni is the sole owner of all the bonds sold on behalf of certain private projects, giving fund shareholders a nerve-wracking stake in the ventures.
Of course, given the state of the New York economy, New York Muni was not alone in lagging behind the national averages for tax-exempt mutual funds in October. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytic Services, reports that his sample of 48 New York muni funds trailed all tax-free funds for the month, and five funds besides New York Muni saw their principal value actually decline. Those six funds, Mr. Lipper found, had invested a larger share of their assets, on average, in lower-rated bonds than the better-performing state and national funds had.
But the drop at New York Muni was more than twice that of the next-ranking fund, and it followed an equally bad third quarter. Some of the reasons were first reported last week by Barron's magazine, which noted that two Niagara County Industrial Development Agency issues, totaling $14 million and making up 6 percent of fund assets, had missed two interest payments.
The bonds were sold on behalf of the private developers of a local retail and amusement arcade that is a year behind schedule and remains 30 to 40 percent vacant. Nevertheless, as recently as June 30, the bonds were listed on the fund's books at $106 for each $100 in face value.
Since only a few muni-bond issues change hands often enough to produce reliable quotes from traders, most funds rely on independent services to provide prices, based on interest rates and comparable trades. Mr. Malanga, the fund adviser, said on Friday that the prices he has ascribed to the Niagara issues -- about $93 these days, he said -- came from Interactive Data. A spokesman for Interactive Data said that no one was available to discuss how the firm had arrived at its past and current prices on the Niagara County issues.
 Mr. Lipper noted that "there is more art than science" in municipal bond pricing. And considerable artistry would have been needed to persuade most people to pay a premium price, or even 93 cents on the dollar, for bonds that are two payments late on debt service. But Mr. Malanga explained that there is "some sort of reserve fund" that would have covered the two missed payments -- except that "some judge" intervened.
He and Mr. Brofman were both somewhat vague about the reserve fund's size and the legal problems that have barred its use. But Mr. Malanga said he was confident "the situation will resolve itself over the next few months or so." John Bartolomei, the attorney for the various developers, was equally uninformative about the legal tangle affecting debt service. "I heard there were some liens," Mr. Bartolomei said Friday. "Or maybe not liens, exactly, but something. You could call the trustee."
The trustee for both bond issues is Norstar Bank in Albany. Mary McCraken, trust officer for the bonds, declined to answer any questions about them. She did say, however, that the S.E.C. had recently called about the issue. "Perhaps you could check with them," she said. A commission spokesperson said, "The staff is not authorized to confirm or deny the existence of any investigation."
In any case, John C. Drake, the assistant director of the Niagara County agency that issued the bonds, said that the Niagara County Urban Renewal Agency sold $5.9 million worth of bonds last year to help bail out the Falls Street project. As it happens, that entire bond issue was bought by the New York Muni Fund. As of June, the latest report available, the bonds were priced at 98 cents on the dollar.
But consider another small issue in the fund's portfolio, sold by the Erie County Industrial Development Agency to finance a private warehouse project. Those bonds defaulted sometime in 1988, and the project is being liquidated. The fund valued the bonds at 79 percent of par last December; by June, that price had fallen to 40 percent of par.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Pinning All The Blame On Drexel

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE demonization of Mike Milken is proceeding apace. Now, the Government says he was a significant villain in the savings and loan debacle. Mr. Milken will be punished for other crimes, but the latest claims appear to be highly exaggerated, at best.
There were many causes of the savings and loan losses, and what the Government calls Drexel Burnham Lambert's "gospel of greed" was part and parcel of the times. But it should not be forgotten that the losses followed from the Government's decision to let the industry go off and make whatever risky investments it wished, secure in the knowledge that Government-guaranteed deposits would provide the needed cash.
The fraud factor in the savings debacle cannot be ignored, and the Government allegations make a case that Drexel and Mr. Milken played a role in some suspicious transactions with the two most infamous bank executives of our time, Charles Keating of Lincoln Savings in California and David Paul of Centrust in Florida. But neither is fraud anything like the whole story.
Drexel did raise billions for savings institutions, which promised to pay high interest rates and had to take big risks to have a chance of succeeding. That was clear at the time, but regulators chose to look the other way. Most of the unwise risks, and most of the bad loans, came in that old staple of savings and loan lending, real estate, not from savings institutions buying the junk bonds Mr. Milken was peddling.
As it happened, junk bond prices generally rose last week, even as the Government was using its heaviest rhetoric to declare that the entire market was little more than a giant fraud. The hope is that the Federal Reserve will push down interest rates and thus ease the economic pain. The same stimulus helped raise stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 61.64 points, to 2,550.25, despite the growing evidence of a weak economy. That is keeping companies from passing on cost increases, and thus holding down inflation.
The rising stock prices also reflect the new conventional wisdom that while there is a recession, it will be mild and brief. The bottom-fishers like bank stocks, and the N.Y.S.E. financial index has risen 10.7 percent over the past three weeks, the best such period in more than six years. (For the year, it remains down 25 percent.)
Whether that rosy forecast is correct will depend in part on just how long it takes to work off the excesses of the 1980's, excesses that go far beyond the fraud the Government was talking about last week.
"Keating and Paul and Milken are fast becoming villains of a Saturday matinee variety," says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a man who was denouncing junk bonds long before it became fashionable to do so. "I have no doubt they did many bad and money-losing things, but they did not lose half a trillion dollars.
"If the limits of the thrifts' problems were junk bonds," Mr. Grant added, "we'd all be a whole lot better off."

Gold: No Longer the Sure Thing

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THE dollar is falling. American banks are in trouble. In the Persian Gulf, a war seems as likely as a debilitating standoff. And gold, the usually perfect play in such circumstances, is going nowhere.
Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, gold has twice rallied to more than $400 an ounce, once in August to $415 and then in September to $406. But it fell hard both times and now stands at $379. That is just a few dollars higher than where it was the day before the invasion ($373) and far below its high for the year of $422 in February. 
 "If you had told me last winter that Saddam Hussein would invade Kuwait and cut oil production, that oil prices would reach $40 a barrel and that the dollar would fall, I would have forecast a gold price of $450 an ounce easily," said Warren Myers, vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
There are several reasons for gold's misbehavior. Some are short-term, like a surge in supply through large sales by the Soviet Union and governments in the Middle East. But there is a longer-term factor that will continue to have an impact on gold far into the future. It is the opening, diversification and growth of global financial markets and the resulting decline of gold's traditional role as a haven for investors in times of trouble.
In the 1970's, the global foreign exchange market was still relatively small. The financial markets in places like Germany, Switzerland and Japan were just beginning to grow. Trading in these and other markets was not easy because of restrictions and a lack of liquidity.
But all this had changed by the beginning of the 90's. Foreign exchange has exploded into a $500 billion-a-day market and liquidity in securities outside the United States is growing, making it easier to get in and out of an investment quickly. The markets in Japan are huge and growing and are becoming more accessible to foreign investors. Germany, with the tearing down of the Berlin wall and this year's unification, has become one of the most attractive markets in the world. London has become a center for Europewide trading. And the coming economic union of Europe is forcing markets throughout the continent to drop trading barriers.
Indeed, trading -- whether in currency, bonds or stocks -- is fast becoming a global game played 24 hours a day. With computer trading and improvements in settlement practices, money and trades move much faster than ever before, giving investors and money managers the confidence they can respond swiftly to changing political and financial events.
All this adds up to a much more modest role for gold, which flourished in the 70's when there were not nearly as many investment alternatives that could serve as safe harbors in times of crisis.
"The world is much more sophisticated, especially in finding other places to invest money," said Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse in New York. "A lot of the money is going to Switzerland and Germany."
Added Mr. Myers of Merrill Lynch, "You can move money, hedge and do all these things. Gold is not the only game in town." The general worldwide commitment to fight inflation has also lessened the attractiveness of gold as a hedge, he said.
These changes have also affected investments in platinum. Purchases are expected to fall to 115,000 ounces this year, down from 630,000 in 1988, according to Johnson Matthey, a major manufacturer of platinum products which is also an important dealer of the metal. "There are a lot of other options now," said Michael Steel, director of research at Johnson Matthey.
With other options available, the short-term factors affecting the price of gold have even more of an impact. Gold quickly lost much of its attractiveness in August and September when speculators were hurt by sharp falls in prices that resulted from minor shifts in the outlook for war in the gulf.
Mr. MacDonald said it would take a major revival of interest in gold as a speculative or long-term investment to push the price up again. "There is a lack of conviction in the gold market now," he said. "There is not a reason to go into gold."
Also holding down the price in the near term are sales of gold by the Soviet Union, which needs to raise Western currency to provide transfusions for its faltering economy. Some countries in the Middle East have also been selling gold, in part to help pay for the military standoff with Iraq.
"All this adds up to a temporary and artificial extra supply on the market and that dampens the price so gold does not behave like people expect it to," said James P. Hildebrandt, vice president for investment at the World Gold Council, a Swiss-based association of gold-producing companies.
To be sure, the price of gold is likely to jump if there is a war in the gulf. But without the usual signposts it is hard to say how high the price might go, and how long it might stay there, making gold look especially dicey. And since the stock prices of gold companies also depend on this outlook, they are risky bets as well, even though many have fallen to more attractive levels.

HEADLINE: When Businesses Decide to Flee

 BODY:
In a Forum article, "A Company Gives Up on New York" (Nov. 4), Stuart Meyers, a partner in a small family-owned business, wrote that after 20 years, he was moving his business out of New York. An unusually large number of letters were received in response.

 
 
It's Not New York's Fault
 To the Editor: It seems to me that the true reason Mr. Meyers is moving his business out of New York City is that his company has lost 30 percent of its business in five years and that modern technology has made it possible to locate elsewhere. Mr. Meyers seems to be confusing the reality of reduced earnings and changing technology with a series of events that have nothing to do with his company's declining revenues.
It made me angry to read that he used the tragic story about one of his workers who killed someone as an example of this city's social problems. Is Mr. Meyers implying that murder only occurs in the working class and that the working class is responsible for our city's social ills?
Also, Mr. Meyers allowed his company's burglary insurance policy to lapse because he said that after repeated break-ins, his premiums had become too high. It doesn't seem to be a wise business policy to let your burglary insurance lapse in any large metropolitan area where protection of any kind against theft is just the prudent cost of doing business.
He also relates the story of how his company van had to be left on a city street overnight because of mechanical problems and was then vandalized and ticketed for being illegally parked. It would not have happened if he had had the van towed to a garage for repairs and safekeepingovernight.
And what does he mean when he says his workers incurred delays when they went to get replacement parts for the van? In this case the pejorative use of the verb incur has been used to blame the employees for mismanagement by the employer.
I believe Mr. Meyers would not have bothered to take the time and the energy to write an article filled with such ill will and prejudice toward the city that treated him and his family so well for so many years if his company's profits had increased substantially.
I wish Mr. Meyers the best of luck at his company's new location and in his career as a novelist. With his attitude, he'll need all the luck he can get.

The Rats Will Return
 To the Editor: Item: Another rat jumps ship. Response: Good riddance.
I made the mistake of reading Stuart Meyers's farewell speech to the metropolis before I went to bed. Instead of partaking in the dreamless, I became restless, angry. It isn't enough to leave the city while the getting is good; it's become de rigueur to grandstand it in a major publication.
Some of Mr. Meyers's comments as they relate to New York require examination. Was the shock that Mr. Meyers felt upon learning that one of his employees committed murder based on the act or the staffer's candor? I guess they don't commit murder in Mr. Meyers's new locale, Connecticut. No -- it must be that they don't have the bad manners to talk about it.
I had to smile at Mr. Meyers's admission that, due to his inability to run his business from his office during the unfortunate water main break, he and his partners "had to visit our customers in person." Now, there's a real imposition. Can you imagine actually having to leave your office to meet face to face with the people who provide you with your raison d'etre? Mr. Meyers forgets, or perhaps never knew, that business was conducted this way once upon a time, before the advent of the very telephone systems that his company installs.
Perhaps most galling are what seem to be Mr. Meyers's attempts to blame New York City for what in effect were his own poor management decisions.
He didn't back up his data files and his computer was stolen; he wasn't insured for the loss because he let his policy lapse. Sandwiching these facts between his litany of woes makes it seem that big, bad New York is big enough and bad enough to be the scapegoat for every problem.
It is my guess that New York was pretty good to Mr. Meyers and his brothers for 20 years or so, or they probably would have taken off sooner. It's hard not to get angry at a breed of businessman who feeds off the lifeline that is New York, only to abandon it when the going gets tough.
Perhaps we should coin a new term for this army of turncoats heading beyond our borders -- Tambys, or this ain't my backyard no more.
As Mr. Meyers and his compatriots gaze adoringly over their Beamers and Jags in their new office parking lots, I hope they think about this: that the homeless they choose not to look upon are still here. That the crime and horror that pervade this city cannot be wished away. That we simply cannot blame the politicians who inherited this mess without doing our part to get the city back on its feet. And that the executives who had the courage and the wherewithal to open businesses in New York should have the backbone to bolster the city when it falls, rather than turn tail and run.
I propose that we construct an edifice that complements the Statue of Liberty. This lady would be erected in the upper East River. Instead of robes, she'd be dressed in the familiar orange and brown garb of a New York traffic officer. And rather than holding a book and a torch, her arms would assume a dramatic gesture northward, the better to guide the fleeing horde beyond the pale.
When New York again becomes the flavor of the month, the opportunists will likely return in droves. That's to be expected; everyone will want a taste of the Apple once it's been de-wormed.

Another Woeful Tale
 To the Editor: One morning while watching the news on television, a reporter announced that my office building was destroyed by an explosion! The space I occupied had very little damage, and all records were retrievable. I had insurance and a temporary space to move to. It really wasn't so terrible.
But after spending a tremendous amount of money to keep the business intact, the insurance company raised questions. Due to the condition of the space I was renting, it questioned whether paying for costs incurred was required. But the building had been condemned. And as a result, I had no access to the space. It had been padlocked!
It has been two and a half years since the explosion and no decision has been made on recovering my costs. Perhaps Mr. Meyers saved himself from another disappointment.
Can we survive in New York? Not easily. My firm moved to the Design Center in Long Island City. We are surviving.
One questions what the current economic conditions are doing to the city. How many mergers and acquisitions or bankruptcies will there be?
This was a city of opportunity. Good luck Stuart Meyers.

The City of Opportunity
 To the Editor: I understand why the article written by Stuart Meyers was included in last week's business section -- his horrible experience and his decision to leave New York are legitimate business news.
Nevertheless, it does seem irresponsible to fail to run an article on a business that has experienced the positive effects of moving to New York.
In 1989 we moved our editorial, publicity, art and subsidiary rights departments into New York from Secaucus, N.J. Despite various problems that arose as a result of the move, it has been a primary reason that revenues have risen more than 200 percent in less than two years. There are opportunities in this city that simply don't exist anywhere else.

Taking Advantage
 To the Editor: The sad part is not so much that Mr. Meyers is moving his company to the 'burbs. He had a tough time and everything seemed to go wrong. He can put all of that in the novel he's writing. In fact, I detect a bit of the novelist's imagination in the article, but so be it.
The tough part for New York is that Mr. Meyers will still count on continuing to do business with the 70 percent of his customer base that did not disappear or downscale during the past five years. (Actually, any company that can keep 70 percent of its customer base for five years is doing pretty well; would he have done better anywhere else?)
Let him relocate to the Sun Belt, and sell his telephones there. New York can certainly survive without those who run, if we who continue to ply our trades here will only give our telephone and other business to those who stay here with us. It's the guy who goes to the suburbs but continues to draw on the city for his customers who hurts us. He wants our business; he wants to congest our streets by driving in from his office; he wants to use the many facilities provided by the taxes on New York City companies -- sure he has a competitive advantage.
Our association, National Marine Manufacturers Association, has been in New York City since 1904. We have a great mix of employees because we draw on the five boroughs, on Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut. They love our central location, the opportunities to shop, to lunch.
We love it here, and we have a stock response for suburban suppliers who call requesting our business.

HEADLINE: A Setback for Polystyrene

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
MANUFACTURERS of polystyrene, the lightweight plastic packaging material, have been struggling for two years to improve their environmental image by establishing a recycling program. But all of their efforts may have been undone by the decision earlier this month by the McDonald's Corporation to switch from plastic foam to paper packaging for its hamburgers.
Leaders of the polystyrene recycling effort, which is backed by some of the biggest petrochemical companies in the nation, vow they will press on despite the defection of McDonald's. The fast-food chain, the biggest in the nation, was the most prominent participant in pilot recycling programs based in New York and Massachusetts and was to have been part of a planned nationwide program. 
 "What McDonald's did was give us another quarter of red ink," said Russ Welton, vice president of the National Polystyrene Recycling Company, which is building four recycling plants across the country. Without McDonald's, company executives are scrambling to line up school and industrial cafeterias, big users of foam cups and plates, as new sources of supply.
But some industry observers say the switch by McDonald's will have much bigger repercussions for the $2.5 billion industry.
"Food manufacturers will think twice about continuing to use polystyrene and other plastic packaging," said Peter Coombes, the editor of Chemical Week magazine.
"McDonald's was the engine driving this program," said Nancy Wolf, executive director of the Environmental Action Coalition in New York. "Without them, the whole polystyrene recycling system may collapse."
Some environmentalists have questioned the value of the recycling effort, saying it puts a mantle of respectability on a material whose manufacture generates pollution and which is particularly troublesome as litter. They say the foam is so light it is difficult to collect and transport economically. And they argue that if the chemical industry withdraws the subsidies it has used to start recycling, the effort may end.
"THUS far, polystyrene recycling is more a problem-ridden theory than a proven option," said Frederic D. Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, which is helping McDonald's improve its environmental performance and influenced the company's decision to drop the foam box. "There is a lot of pressure on the companies that make polystyrene to say they are recycling, but saying it does not mean it will really happen."
Mr. Krupp noted that the recycling program does not even address the approximately 50 percent of the packaging that leaves fast-food restaurants with takeout orders.
Leaders of the foam recycling effort concede that early efforts to re-use the material have not been profitable and have been hampered by contamination with paper and food waste. But they say four new, much larger plants in the Chicago, Philadelphia, Oakland, Calif., and Los Angeles areas will be able to stand on their own financially .
"Startups always lose money initially," said Mr. Welton of National Polystyrene. "But we are not saying to the industry, 'Subsidize us for 10 years.' I think we can get to a positive cash flow by the end of 1991."
The polystyrene industry began the recycling effort late in 1988 after some areas, including Suffolk County on Long Island, banned the material as part of their response to the solid-waste crisis. Although foam plastic is a small part of all solid waste, hamburger boxes have been singled out by environmental groups because of their very short useful life and prominence as litter.
However, most of these bans include exceptions for materials that are, or can be, recycled. To keep the enacted bans from taking effect, as well as to deter new ones, the polystyrene producers must keep the recycling program alive.
In November 1988, Mobil Chemical and the Genpak Corporation set up a recycling operation in Leominster, Mass., called Plastics Again, which has since been absorbed by National Polystyrene. Early last year, the Amoco Foam Products Company established Polystyrene Recycling Inc. in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn in association with McDonald's.
Since then, the industry has united behind National Polystyrene and pledged to recycle 250 million pounds of the material by 1995. Company executives said this represents about one-quarter of the billion pounds of plastic foam used in various food packaging applications, and thus is responsive to the Environmental Protection Agency's goal of reaching a 25 percent recycling goal by that date.
The companies that each put up $2 million last fall to start National Polystyrene are Amoco Chemical, Arco Chemical, Chevron Chemical, Dow Chemical, Fina Oil and Chemical, Huntsman Chemical, Mobil Chemical and Polysar.
But the amount to be recycled is a small fraction of the more than 5 billion pounds of polystyrene used in this country each year. Sometimes referred to by the Dow Chemical trade name Styrofoam, polystyrene is also used as molded packaging blocks for shipment of electronic devices, loose packing materials and in the construction and home furnishing industries. Most of these products end up in landfills, where they break down very slowly. But a huge amount simply becomes litter.
"WHEN we did a cleanup of the Merrimack River, the biggest single item we found was Styrofoam," said Pat Scanlan, the director of recycling at Wheelabrator Technologies Inc., recounting a cleanup effort he was part of in Massachusetts with a group of friends. "A lot of it was packaging. People threw boxes in the river after buying appliances. The cardboard dissolved, but the Styrofoam floated on to the shore."
Foam plastic's light weight is the major obstacle to recycling, environmentalists and industry executives agree. Although re-using the material simply involves remelting and forming into a new shape, the obstacles posed by collection, shipment and decontamination remain formidable.
"The people who run curbside collection programs don't want to have anything to do with it," Mr. Scanlan said. "They are paid by the ton of material delivered, but the polystyrene takes up space without adding much weight."
"The big cost is transportation," said Tom Tomaszek, the former manager of the Plastics Again plant who now heads a plastics recycling company in Fort Edward, N.Y. "You have to go after other materials in addition to polystyrene to get favorable economics."
Ollie Ligon, an executive at Amoco Foam Products and president of the Brooklyn operation, conceded that "the cost of collection and processing exceeded the value of the resin." The Brooklyn plant paid nothing for the material it received; the shippers benefited by not having to pay the cost of disposal.
MR. WELTON said new methods of compressing the foam are being developed, allowing economical truckloads. But the manager of a recycling program in Fitchburg, Wis., said it took all night in a baling machine to compress 275 pounds of foam. A bale made quickly, she noted, only weighs 75 pounds.
In addition, foam that has been used in connection with food has to be washed before it can be remelted, or the resulting contamination will weaken the mechanical properties of the plastic. Executives at National Polystyrene said McDonald's was unable to persuade its customers to separate the plastic foam hamburger boxes from paper wrappings and food waste. As a result, the material arrived at the Leominster facility heavily contaminated and yielded low-quality plastic.
For that reason, Rubbermaid Inc., which said it was eager to use recycled plastic in its household and office products, has only accepted one shipment that was remelted at Plastics Again. "The quality of the material we were getting from McDonald's was terrible," said Mr. Welton of National Polystyrene, the current owner of Plastics Again. "And the material we were producing at the plant was not sufficient to meet the needs of customers like Rubbermaid."
Charles J. Lancelot, materials manager for Rubbermaid Commercial Products, said the company had used only "modest" amounts of recycled plastic foam. But he said Rubbermaid was prepared to use more "if it is consistently available in the right quantity and quality."
Mr. Welton said the new plants, the first of which will open later this year in the Los Angeles area, will each be capable of recycling 13 million pounds of plastic a year, compared with 3 million at Leominster. "At 2 to 3 million, I'm marginal," he said. "At 13 million, I can be profitable."
But McDonald's isn't the only fast-food chain to turn away from foam. Burger King, the second-biggest chain, has used paper-based packaging all along except for coffee cups, which it plans to replace as well. Other chains say they may soon follow suit.
To make up for the loss, the polystyrene recyclers say they are focusing on school and industrial cafeterias. Schools, they note, do not have the carryout problem of fast-food restaurants and students are more dutiful in separating foam trays from other wastes.
National Polystyrene has signed up the Los Angeles school system, and executives say this is typical of the types of supply arrangements the company will use to replace McDonald's. The company's plant in Corona, Calif., will pay 4 cents a pound for foam delivered to its doors.
Beth Lauargand, a business manager for the school system, said it already hauls its own garbage, so it has trucks and a collection system in place. Recycling the foam, she said, "would be very difficult to do unless you are fortunate enough to be in our circumstances."

HEADLINE: Suddenly, the Specter of Capitalism Is Haunting Intourist

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
INTOURIST, the vast Soviet agency that has monopolized foreign tourism for decades, is packing for a new destination: the world of competition.
Top Intourist officials say they are preparing to make their 61-year-old agency less like a bureaucracy than a business, all in the spirit of Government plans to open the economy to investment from abroad and market forces at home. 
 "We welcome everybody who wants to be involved in tourism," said Anatoly V. Skripnikov, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Travel, Intourist's parent.
With challenges expected from big Western travel companies, other Soviet state agencies and perhaps hundreds of private enterprises, Intourist has responded with a whirlwind of change: it is building 30 new hotels, renovating 15 others, signing up foreign partners, including an American hotel chain, and freezing its tour prices. Acknowledging a history of surly behavior, it is even trying to teach employees to greet guests with smiles instead of scowls.
But less may be changing than meets the eye, say Soviet experts in the West. In practice, Intourist is still guarding its official dominance, giving rivals the same cold welcome extended to many of its guests. And it continues to advocate strong central oversight of prices, accommodation standards, investment and strategy, and the avoidance of what it calls "unhealthy competition."
Foreign tourism companies are only a minor threat to Intourist so far, since few are willing to chance the chaotic Soviet economy, and those that do venture in sometimes form partnerships with Intourist itself. Intourist has refused to help foreign interests find private-sector partners in the Soviet Union, Mr. Skripnikov said. [See box.]
To be sure, the revamping of Soviet tourism will raise the quantity -- and maybe the quality -- of hotel rooms, open broad new reaches of the nation that were once off-limits to foreigners and make it possible, on occasion, to avoid using Intourist.
But Soviet experts say that Intourist will remain firmly in charge of most tourism. And some are skeptical about how committed the agency is to repairing its reputation for bad service and mediocre facilities.
Without tougher competition, Intourist "will still be fat, lazy, inefficient and rude," said Michael Mandelbaum, director of the Project on East-West Relations at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
Indeed, Intourist's obstinacy suggests the difficulty of persuading entrenched state agencies to join the march toward free markets, Dr. Mandelbaum said, calling Intourist "one of the pathologies of a planned economy." Because many visitors bring hard currency, it is easier to attract Western competitors to Soviet tourism than to most other industries, he said. But, he warned, "Intourist is going to hold on and resist."
No other Soviet travel service can come near to matching Intourist's size or reach: it owns 110 hotels and is affiliated with more than 800 travel agencies abroad. Intourist handles about 2 million of the nation's 2.5 million foreign tourists each year, and arranges Soviet travel abroad.
"THEY are in a very strong position," said Tomasz Telma, an economist at Planecon, a Washington consulting firm. "They have access to all the infrastructure."
Intourist officials themselves boast that the agency's size and ready access to hard currency will help it grow much more rapidly than other agencies serving foreign visitors. By the year 2000, Intourist plans to expand to 250,000 beds, from 55,000 now. "Intourist will undoubtedly remain for a long time the leading tourist firm engaged in receiving and rendering service to foreigner travelers," said a recent agency report.
Intourist's strongest rivals so far are two other state agencies, Intourbureau and Sputnik.
Intourbureau, also called the Central Council for Tourism and Excursions, was established in 1967 to handle trade-union exchange programs. It remains part of the Government's trade-union organization, but in recent years it has gingerly ventured into commercial travel, encroaching on Intourist's domain. With hotels in at least 25 cities, Intourbureau expects to host 200,000 foreign visitors this year.
Sputnik, affiliated with Komsomol, the Communist youth organization, handles tours for the young, loosely defined in the Soviet Union as those no older than 35.
Intourist officials say they expect further competition from hundreds of local and regional authorities and private establishments newly authorized to host foreign tourists. But few of these local agencies have representatives in other countries.
UNDER current plans, the Soviet Government would continue to hold a major stake in Intourist. Mr. Skripnikov said that his agency is seeking the authority to regulate other tourist organizations, especially to police those that might provide inadequate service or accommodations.
Yet Intourist's own standards have offended many a guest. Visitors often encounter lost reservations, dilapidated buildings, lackadaisical tour guides, dingy rooms, glowering floor attendants and interminable waits in restaurants where menus bear little resemblance to what is available. In Moscow, with hotel rooms chronically scarce, the daily rate typically is more than $100 and can sometimes exceed $200.
"We feel more and more responsible for providing better service," Mr. Skripnikov said, alluding to the pressure from the Government to lure more visitors bearing hard currency. "All the improvements must contribute to the development of tourism."
Like many other Soviet agencies, Intourist often feels the state planners tugging on one arm, the proto-capitalists on the other. Intourist officials envision the sale of shares to employees and to local and national authorities. "Soon, perhaps, to anyone," said Vladimir B. Lebedev, an Intourist press officer.
But a report Intourist issued earlier this year seeks to keep decentralization and the friction of free markets from getting out of hand. "Only a state organ can solve such tasks as elaboration of a long-term strategy," the document said, citing the need to maintain "adequate pricing policy and uniform standards."
For now, at least, a certain amount of confusion reigns in the new world of Soviet tourism.
"There are more options," said Elizabeth O'Shea, director of the Moscow office of Barry Martin Travel, a London-based agency specializing in the Soviet Union. "But the traveler doesn't necessarily know what his options are."
THE nation's growing political openness, and its hunger for foreign currency, have encouraged the authorities to open remote and exotic regions to tourism. "Areas you and I have never heard about," said Robert Woolis, sales manager for Anniversary Tours, a New York-based firm specializing in Soviet travel.
Intourist's local offices, and the many local governments that have their own hotels, already have the right to deal directly with foreign tourists and travel agencies. Yet few have ready means of offering their services.
Anatoly Matytsin, Intourist's manager in the United States, suggests that tourists take the initiative. He urged anyone eager to see the Soviet Far East, for example, to get directly in touch with the Intourist office in Khabarovsk. By phone? Might not work, he said, but added, "They've got their own telex machines."
Some officials are more confident of expanding tourism in the major cities first. There, the skirmishing between Intourist and Intourbureau has already begun. Intourist managers paint Intourbureau lodging as little better than camping out -- accommodations suitable for hardy Russians, but not for cossetted Westerners. "Only small pensions and some low-grade hotels, so this speaks to their possibilities and potential," Mr. Lebedev sniffed. "Intourist has the best hotels."
Intourbureau officials accuse Intourist of monopolizing central locations and trying to squeeze Intourbureau out of the market. "Nobody likes competition, but we must compete," said Ludmilla Obratsova, Intourbureau's deputy manager.
Intourbureau plans to continue undercutting Intourist's prices, but Mr. Skripnikov said that Intourist would hold its prices for the next two years. Intourbureau, too, is lining up joint venture partners, planning new hotels and training employees abroad.
But for Intourbureau, some reversals might be in store. Its parent agency, the Central Council of Trade Unions, is disintegrating, with many workers supporting trade unions independent of the Government. And both Intourist and Intourbureau are considering whether to demand hard, convertible currency from East Europeans beginning next year, a step likely to keep visitors away.
But even then, Intourist has the edge. Flush with Western visitors, it can better afford to adopt more exclusive ways.
 
 
A REVOLUTION IN HOSTELRY
 Radisson Hotels International's first rule for hiring employees at its soon-to-open Moscow hotel: avoid anyone contaminated by experience in Soviet hotels.
As the first Moscow hotel under American management, the Radisson Slavjanskaya aims to be distinctive. While the skylit lobby and endless halls may have the same sleek impersonality as dozens of other $200-a-day hotels in the West, these features seem reassuring compared with most Soviet accommodations.
The Slavjanskaya (the j is pronounced like a y) is one of several new joint-venture hotels involving Intourist and other Soviet agencies. Intourist's first luxury joint-venture, the renovated Savoy Hotel, opened near Red Square last year in a partnership with Finnair, the Finnish airline. Its services -- including Cable News Network and room-service caviar -- are so far beyond the scope of most Moscow hotels that some visitors fly Finnair for help in getting reservations.
Other Soviet agencies have found their own American partners to compete with Intourist. The Sheraton Corporation and Aeroflot, the Soviet airline, plan hotels in several major cities. Their first, the Sheraton Moscow Hotel, a partnership with the Pan Am Corporation and the City of Moscow, is set to open by 1993.
Ramada Inc. has joined the City of Moscow and Fiat, the Italian auto maker, in an agreement to build and manage two hotels, one to open in 1991, the other two or three years later.
Virtually every American chain has held talks with Intourist or other Soviet agencies, said Dieter Janssen, a Sheraton executive. But high initial costs and the Soviet bureaucracy have discouraged many.
Intourist officials hope that joint ventures will bring in capital and expertise. Until recently, foreigners could own at most 49 percent of a joint venture. Now a foreign company could, in principle, open a hotel on its own. In practice, many foreign companies will need Intourist or another native partner to guide them through the welter of Soviet laws.
The Slavjanskaya is Intourist's first new Moscow hotel since 1972. Radisson, a subsidiary of the Carlson Companies of Minneapolis, will manage the hotel, while the Americom International Corporation of Irvine, Calif., will operate an adjoining business and conference center. One thing it shares with other Intourist projects is a busted schedule. Its opening has been delayed from this year to next April.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
John Templeton's Faith and Patience

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
THERE are certain words that crop up in discussions with money managers and John Marks Templeton knows them all. But in his 50 years of money management, he has been just as likely to weave God and patience into a paragraph as yield and return. In today's market, there's more of a connection than usual.
Mr. Templeton, widely regarded as the dean of international investing, controls 52 mutual funds worldwide, with $13 billion in assets. Of the 11 mutual funds for sale in the United States, four are global stock funds that have underperformed the overall market and the global-fund segment this year, and the others are doing about as well, or a bit better than others in their segments. Two of the global funds -- the $3.6 billion Templeton World Fund and the $679.7 million Templeton Global Fund -- have taken a serious beating. 
 But Mr. Templeton, who turns 78 on Nov. 28 and says that strong religious beliefs underlie his investing principles, is unperturbed. "It's all a question of patience," he said. "In our 50-year history," he added in a recent telephone conversation, "there have been other years, sometimes two, when we have lagged the results of others. That will always be the case."
But why, specifically, have the two big global funds been hit so hard? There are several reasons.
Mr. Templeton, whose investment empire is headquartered in Nassau, the Bahamas, is a global manager and a value manager, too, hunting for bargains among companies all over the world. But value managers, as a group, have not done very well this year. "Value managers usually do poorly going into a recession, but pick up steam and perform better as a recession takes hold," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants. He argues that "this is a terrific time to buy Templeton funds" because prices are so low.
Another reason for the funds' slippage is their focus on smaller companies. Stocks of smaller companies, especially the emerging growth stocks favored by the two Templeton global funds, have been hit hard this year. Not that that has shaken Mr. Templeton's belief in them. Indeed, the Global Fund is being renamed the Smaller Companies Fund; its entire portfolio is invested in that market. The World Fund is about two-thirds invested there.
What has also hurt both funds is that they are heavily invested in the United States. Global is 61.4 percent in American stocks; World, 47.8 percent. This year, international stock fund managers have beaten their domestic counterparts by four full percentage points, according to Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds.
There were other problems for the two funds. They held virtually nothing in health care, a sterling performer this year. (Mr. Templeton believes it is overpriced.) And they hold big positions in financial services -- 14.4 percent of the Global portfolio and 24.3 percent of World's -- which has done poorly.
But Mr. Templeton believes financial services companies will be good bets over time. He has bet heavily on mutual fund companies and brokerages with large fund businesses because, he says, mutual funds are the most rapidly growing part of the industry. "Americans have a thousand times more invested than they did 50 years ago, and it's only the beginning," he said.
As for banks and insurance companies, he says "the risks on the downside are small" compared to upside potential. "If they recover -- and most banks will -- you earn three to four times the amount of your present investment," he said.
Clearly, his is a long-term outlook. His funds hold stocks for an average of five years, one of the longest holding periods in the industry. And he plans no major changes in his holdings.
But, he said, he is always looking for better values. "It is our custom to buy shares at the lowest price in relation to what we think companies may earn in the long term," he said. He sells a stock whenever he can find a comparable stock that is 50 percent cheaper. Right now, he sees bargains galore. In August, he began buying stocks heavily, but will not say what he is buying. Among his biggest holdings in World Fund are National Australia Bank Ltd. and Merrill Lynch. In Global, they include the Quantum Corporation, United Carolina Bancshares and Atlantic Southeast Airlines.
He contends that the United States is in the later stages of a bear market that began in August 1987, and predicts unprecedented global prosperity over the next 40 years. His optimism is reflected in his just-published book, "Riches for the Mind and Spirit," comprising inspirational writings from the Bible, history, literature and other sources. His strong spiritual sense -- he is a devout Presbyterian -- is also reflected in the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, worth $800,000 this year, which he endowed because "the laws of love and charity differ from the laws of mathematics." How? "The more we give away," he said, "the more we have left."

 
 
THE BROKERS TAKE VENGEANCE
 CONVENTIONAL wisdom holds that in tough times, independent mutual funds sold by stockbrokers flounder because brokers, pushed to fatten profits, are selling more funds sponsored by their own firms.
But the reality is quite different this year. The market share of both types of funds has remained static even as the stock market has taken a beating. (The August blip, so evident in the accompanying chart, came from big sales pushes for several global income funds created recently by big brokerage firms.)
Why? Brokers are not pushing mutual funds sponsored by brokerages; they don't want to tie themselves too tightly to employers in a period of layoffs, says Dean Eberling, vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. In other words, brokers with clients heavily invested in funds sponsored by their employer will find it tough to take them along to a new employer. Mr. Eberling doesn't expect that to change until employment at the big brokerages stabilizes.

HEADLINE: Technology;
A Thirsty California Is Trying Desalination

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN RAFAEL, Calif.

 BODY:
FACING a possible fifth year of sustained drought, communities along the California coast are looking to desalinated ocean or bay water as a way to quench their thirst and water their lawns.
While most water districts are only looking at desalination now because alternative sources are dry, advances in technology over the past few years have helped make seawater a competitive source for drinking water. As California's population growth continues to outstrip its water supply, communities are looking beyond the current drought and investigating desalination as a long-term solution. 
 Most are considering some form of reverse osmosis, a kind of ultrafiltration technology first developed in the late 1960's to supply super-pure water for use in manufacturing computer chips. In the Middle East, most countries use various distillation methods that heat the salt water and recapture the purified water as condensed steam. While this method consumes more energy, it can be efficient when coupled with a power plant that utilizes the waste heat.
No matter which method is used, desalinated water is expensive -- two or more times the cost of water from natural resources. But in areas where those resources are drying up, polluted or simply overtaxed, it may be the most viable alternative.
"You back into desalination; you do it when you don't have other choices," said Robert S. Castle, senior engineer of the Marin Municipal Water District, which is currently operating a pilot desalination plant near the north end of San Francisco Bay. Despite the costs, desalination "uniquely fills our needs," he said. "It is incremental in supply; you can run it only when you want it; and it's drought-proof."
The bay is less salty than the ocean, but it is more turbid, clouded with silt from rivers, industrial waste and microscopic marine life. As a result, Marin County is experimenting at the pilot plant with various types of pre-treatment filtration systems to clean bay water before it goes into the desalination plant. After the larger particles are removed, the still-salty water is sent to the reverse osmosis unit. Wheras conventional filters can only remove suspended solids, reverse osmosis can remove dissolved solids, like salt.
In reverse osmosis, the salt water is pumped along a porous cylindrical membrane at high pressure. The process is a continuous one, and because the water is flowing along the membrane rather than perpendicular to it, the flow tends to flush the very small pores, so only occasional cleaning is needed.
Water molecules pass through the membrane, while salt molecules, bacteria and pollutants, which are larger, are left behind. It takes two or three gallons of salt water to make one gallon of fresh, depending on the saline content. Solid particles are collected and dumped at a landfill, while the concentrated salt brine is often blended with sewer outfall, which, being non-salty, brings overall salinity back to normal ocean or bay levels.
One development that made possible the current generation of seawater reverse osmosis equipment is the spiral wound membrane. Winding the membrane material like paper towel on a tube allows much larger amounts of membrane surface to fit in a given space. And the membrane materials themselves have evolved to the point where they can reject more than 99 percent of the total dissolved solids.
IT takes just one pass through the reverse osmosis unit to reduce total dissolved solids from the 35,000 to 40,000 parts per million typical of seawater to less than 500, the level considered safe to drink. But to make a better tasting water, Marin and other counties perform two passes, and then run the water over limestone to restore some mineral taste. Water sampled at the Marin pilot plant was very fresh and clean-tasting.
Unlike some communities that plan to operate or lease desalination plants only for the duration of the drought, Marin County plans to build a permanent, five-million-gallon-a-day plant to supply up to 25 percent of its water needs. Mr. Castle estimates that water from the plant would add about $6 to the average $25 monthly residential water bill.
Other California communities considering desalination include Santa Barbara -- which is already building a $25 million plant to supply one-third of the city's needs by 1992 -- Monterey, San Diego, Morro Bay, Ventura, Oxnard and Los Angeles. So far, no other states have seawater desalination, although reverse osmosis is commonly used in Florida to purify brackish water for drinking.
Compared with alternatives like pipelines or tanker ships, desalination plants offer communities the advantages of an unlimited water supply and greater self-sufficiency.
"You can place a desalination plant anywhere there's seawater," said David Grunau, vice president of Aqua Design Inc. in Campbell, Calif., which has installed 30 reverse osmosis plants on seven Caribbean islands. Owning such a plant means "nobody else controls your water supply," he said.
The Caribbean plants built by Aqua Design and most of the reverse osmosis plants envisioned for California are relatively small. But the Bechtel Corporation recently completed a 15-million-gallon-per-day plant in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, the largest of its kind in the world. David C. Bolton, Bechtel's project manager for desalination, said the simultaneous advance of several technologies made such a large plant viable.
Reverse osmosis "technology has advanced fairly dramatically in the last three years," Mr. Bolton said. "What actually has happened is that the entire system has come together, not just membranes, but pumps and other components have gotten better."
COSTS still need to drop further, but Mr. Bolton said it is wrong to compare desalinated water with the natural resource. "In the U.S., the cost of desalted water still tends to be prohibitive when compared with natural resources, but that's only when they are natural," he said. "In California, they are drying up." Given the pressures on the water supply, he said, desalination is "a long-term solution that has been brought up by a short-term problem."
Indeed, the Metropolitan Water District, which supplies water to southern California, is considering building several very large plants. These would be distillation operations, utilizing the waste heat from electricity-generating plants for greater energy efficiency. For the 100 million-gallon-per-day size planned, such plants are still considered more economical than reverse osmosis.
"Distillation has been around a long time; the only problem is cost," said Gary M. Snyder, the district's assistant chief engineer. "But as other sources of water get more expensive, and as we bring down the cost of desalination, there may be a point where they cross."

An Oil Policy That Can Keep the Peace

BYLINE: By HOSSEIN ASKARI; Hossein Askari is professor of international finance at George Washington University and senior adviser to the Petroleum Finance Company. From 1978 to 1981, he was adviser to the Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia.

 BODY:
THE Persian Gulf crisis has once again shown the underlying volatility of the international oil market and the world's economic dependence on gulf oil. While the restoration of Kuwait is the moral imperative, the international community should at the same time look ahead to formulate policies to support stable oil supplies and prices.
Oil price volatility during the last two decades can be attributed only marginally to the policies of individual exporting countries or of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Supply shortages, panic buying and the resulting price volatility have been due to three factors: political instability in oil exporting countries (during the Iranian Revolution), regional conflicts (the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the Iran-Iraq war and the current gulf crisis) and the absence of adequate strategic oil supplies. 
 A precondition of avoiding disruptions in oil supplies is the internal stability of gulf nations. The Iraqi invasion has focused on the internal conditions of some countries in the region. As was the case in Iran, human rights, free elections, inequitable income distribution, rampant corruption and the legitimacy to rule are the standard concerns. The fortunate people living in the region have money but are still wealthy servants. But in the end, there is never enough money to buy the hearts, minds and self-respect of any person with a soul. President Bush's proposal for a United Nations Commission on Free Elections underscores world opinion on this issue.
A second area of concern is regional security to deter aggression. A visible and permanent American presence is opposed by most governments and citizens of the gulf. Instead, the world community, through the United Nations, should adopt a resolution stating that any act of aggression will be rebuffed immediately. For such a resolution to be effective, the world community must be consistent in condemning aggression -- something that was not done after the Iraqi invasion of Iran.
An additional component of regional peace is the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Although this issue may be temporarily out of fashion, even in Arab circles, while attention is focused on Kuwait, it remains critical for any permanent regional solution. A solution to this problem is important for the credibility of the United Nations.
A third helpful policy is the development of a world strategic petroleum reserve to ameliorate unforeseen supply disruptions.
Although several prosperous countries, including the United States, have strategic reserves, they have not been used to make up for supply shortfalls. The need is for a world strategic petroleum reserve to meet shortfalls for all countries, with its use being more or less automatic and commensurate with the shortfall to deter panic buying and speculation.
This strategic reserve should be stocked when there is excess worldwide production capacity. All exporting nations should be asked to take part. The supplies should be stored in several locations around the world, reflecting import demands. The level of reserves should be substantial, say the output of the largest producer in the world for six months.
To implement a world petroleum reserve, many technical issues must be addressed. Should the oil be bought or leased? An approach discussed with Saudi Arabia for the American strategic petroleum reserve was for oil exporters to lease the oil to the importing countries.
Leasing, as opposed to outright sales, reduces budgetary pressures on importing countries, while leasing affords oil exporters some revenues. The oil exporters would receive annual lease payments -- based on the market price of oil when leased -- for their oil in storage. The lease rate is another issue. It could be fixed at the level of interest paid on the World Bank bonds.
If the oil is leased, who owns the oil in storage and thus decides when it can be used? If the World Bank controlled the reserve, it would be possible to establish an acceptable distribution of voting power between World Bank directors representing exporters and importers.
Another issue is how to set the price for suppliers? This is a classic inventory problem and must be negotiated.
A WORLD strategic petroleum reserve would not necessarily erase the need for national reserves. Some existing national reserves could be made a part of the world reserve, affording additional budgetary relief to countries like the United States.
The Persian Gulf crisis, though a tragedy, gives the world community a chance to look ahead and conceive policies to promote petroleum security and price stability. These opportunities can only be overlooked at great risk.

All the Wrong Moves on the Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT ORTNER; Robert Ortner was Under Secretary of Commerce during the Reagan Administration. He is author of "Voodoo Deficits."

 BODY:
THE agreement on the budget deficit is doomed to failure. All that time and effort were spent debating the wrong problem. The budget deficit is not the cause of our ailing economy, it is a symptom. By focusing on the deficit, our leaders found political accommodation but they did not begin to address the economy's actual short- or long-term problems, let alone solve them. In fact, the budget agreement could actually make our economic situation worse.
The United States has probably already entered its ninth postwar recession. Cutting spending or raising taxes -- or both -- will only slow the economy still more. Fiscal tightening at this time should be deemed a political felony -- reckless endangerment of the economy. In addition to taxing away more of our incomes, our elected officials will cause many of us to lose our jobs as the economy slows. 
 What got lost in the debate is that both the Federal deficit and total Federal debt are not at emergency levels. Today's outstanding debt is equal to about 42 percent of our gross national product -- not too bad by historical standards. During the post-World War II boom, total debt was gradually brought down from more than 100 percent of G.N.P. immediately after the war to about 25 percent a decade ago. It was brought down gradually through economic growth and not with debt-reduction measures.
The United States has been growing at about 2 percent to 2.5 percent or less each year while Japan has been growing at 4 percent to 5 percent. The reason Japan outstrips us in growth is that it allocates a much larger share of its domestic output to research and development and to capital spending than we do. While Japan invests about a quarter of its national income in new plants and equipment, we manage to invest only an eighth. Japan's investment allocation is highest among the major industrial countries. Ours is the lowest. The inevitable result is that productivity in Japan, especially in manufacturing, is growing more than twice as fast as in the United States.
These are not just cold, dry numbers. Throughout this century, the real wages of American workers have risen in line with productivity. Real wages represent our purchasing power and, hence, our standard of living. Some writers have taken comfort in noting that the level of American output per worker is still the highest in the world. That is true, for now. But Japan will surpass us in this decade.
Rather than concern itself with cutting the deficit, Congress should have reinstated the Investment Tax Credit. A lower tax rate on capital gains -- as was proposed by the President -- will not do the job of a tax credit. A cut in the capital gains tax will not encourage enough needed investment in plant and equipment. Instead, much of its impact will be diverted to purely financial transactions like leveraged buyouts. It would largely be a tax break for the rich.
AT a 2 percent growth rate, our economic pie will double in 35 years. If growth increases to 5 percent, the pie will double in only 14 years. By accelerating our economic pace through investment, we will not only raise our standard of living, we will have more resources available to deal with our pressing social problems. And of course, what Congress failed to understand, is that faster growth will help bring down the budget deficit without a tax-rate hike.
In the coming months and years, it will become clear that the 1990 budget summit was not a battle of Democrats against Republicans but of government against the people.

HEADLINE: The Gulf Isn't the Only Crisis

BYLINE: By Sam Nunn; Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Since Aug. 2, our attention to events beyond our borders has been confined largely to the Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf. In recent days, our preoccupation with Iraq has been magnified by the debate that was triggered by President Bush's announcement of new U.S. military deployments to the region.
However, three other ominous foreign policy problems -- serious energy shortfalls in Eastern Europe; severe food shortages in the Soviet Union and the chronic ills of the Middle East -- lurk just over the horizon. These problems lack the immediacy of the gulf crisis but if left unaddressed could spawn crises of even greater magnitude.
While the countries of Eastern Europe, including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, face potentially crippling energy shortfalls, their traditional supplier, the Soviet Union, is suffering its own oil production and energy problems. In addition, Moscow says it will soon shift to world prices and hard currency in its trade with former client states, which could mean billions in additional fuel costs for Eastern Europe.
These countries had planned to receive Iraqi oil in payment for past sales of Eastern European arms and other exports to Iraq. For the U.S., Japan and Western Europe, the U.N. embargo means we will not buy oil from Iraq. For Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, the embargo means these countries will not receive the oil Iraq already owes them.
The world community cannot neglect Eastern Europe as it struggles to overcome an impending energy crisis that could doom its quest for market economies and even jeopardize its emerging democracies.
In addition to asking the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to increase assistance to Eastern Europe, which the Administration is doing, I believe Saudi Arabia and our other friends among the oil producing states should be called upon to help. This should not pose an undue burden to the oil producers. Saudi Arabia alone has already realized a windfall profit of about $16 billion to $20 billion from higher oil prices and increased oil output.
We should urge the Japanese to help Eastern Europe with grants and low interest long-term loans, preferably through international organizations. This could be a much more meaningful Japanese contribution to stability than sending a few thousand Japanese troops to the Middle East.
As for the likelihood of serious food shortages in the Soviet Union, here is how a leading Soviet economic expert describes the domestic economic situation: "The market has collapsed, the budget deficit is dreadful . . . monetary circulation and the financial system are on the brink of complete disaster." Against this gloomy backdrop, much of the fall harvest has been lost because of bad weather, poor transportation and inadequate storage and processing facilities. Moreover, because the ruble has become virtually worthless, farmers are refusing to sell their output to the central Government.
Should we help the Soviet people overcome a potential crisis of food supply as they struggle to move from a command to a market economy, from dictatorial one-party rule to representative democracy? The answer is yes: Chaos in a nation that possesses 10,000 nuclear weapons is not in our national security interests.
Two measures would help us as well as the Soviet Union. We should bring the recently initialed U.S.-Soviet trade agreement into force and waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which denies the Soviets most- favored nation treatment and U.S. Government credits. The President has said he would not initiate waiver action until the Soviet Parliament passes a suitable law governing emigration. Though the Parliament has not yet done this, Soviet emigration to Israel and other countries is booming. Free emigration is why the Jackson-Vanik amendment was originally passed. President Bush should forget the formalities and deal with the realities.
Waiver, rather than repeal, of the Jackson-Vanik amendment would keep its sanctions in our arsenal, in case Soviet emigration practices take a turn for the worse. Meanwhile, such U.S. Government programs as Commodity Credit Corporation credits, intended to facilitate the export of U.S. agricultural products, would be able to swing into action. This would help the American farmer and our economy while providing relief to the Soviet people as they weather a particularly difficult phase of their economic transition.
Second, the Soviet Union has under-exploited proven oil reserves and inadequately explored potential oil reserves. This overall energy potential cannot be realized quickly. But it is a valuable and needed asset, and U.S. companies have the expertise to enhance current oil extraction and explore new oilfields in the Soviet Union.
The bottom line here is an exchange of the Soviet Union's energy resources for our agricultural products. To make this happen, we need to clear away outmoded legal and bureaucratic obstacles that handicap our businessmen and farmers and needlessly complicate such logical, mutually beneficial deals.
The third problem is the stability of the Middle East after the gulf crisis. There are four factors that predate the current crisis and exist independently from it, but which make it more complex and dangerous: the wide gap between the have and have-not Arab states; the Arab population boom throughout the region; the lack of democracy in Arab states as well as a lack of regional economic cooperation among the Arab countries, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Taken together, the problems make difficult the possibility of peaceful economic and political development within and among Arab states. The per capita gross national product in the region varies from more than $10,000 in the richest countries to under $1,000 in the poorest, with the bulk of the population living in the poorer countries.
A present Arab population of something over 200 million could swell to some 500 million by the year 2025, placing unprecedented demands on limited resources, including water. And at the moment there is neither a genuine working democracy among the Arab countries nor any significant regional economic cooperation among them. Interrelated problems of this magnitude defy easy solution. There is an encouraging historical precedent, however.
In the late 1940's, the United States responded to economic stagnation in Western Europe with the Marshall Plan, which offered economic assistance once the European countries developed a common plan for economic recovery. Despite the obvious differences between postwar Europe and today's Middle East, the Arab countries need to think in terms of a similar area-wide approach, financed primarily by the region's oil exporting countries.
Regional cooperation should help to ease population pressures and vast economic disparities among Arab states, which taken together with the absence of democratic government contain the seeds of desperation and confrontation. The United States and other democracies should work with the countries of the Middle East to assist their transition to genuinely representative government.
Regional stability cannot be achieved, however, without settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is no time for high-profile initiatives that could exacerbate tensions between the Israelis and Arabs. But at some point the conflict will have to be settled through negotiations. Left unattended, the Arab-Israeli problem polarizes and radicalizes the peoples of the region. It provides cover for militarization and military rule in the area. It fuels an ever more lethal regional arms race.
This problem is distinct from the gulf crisis created by Saddam Hussein. Yet out of the current crisis could come a coalition of Arab nations willing to pursue peace directly with Israel. The goal of quiet and creative U.S. diplomacy should be to facilitate renewal and success of the peace process, in the light of changing Middle East realities. Benign neglect is not an acceptable option.

HEADLINE: Budget Agreement Seen as Likely to Help the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker's pessimistic analysis of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 in "A Bad Budget Deal" (column, Nov. 4) does a disservice by overlooking a large body of evidence suggesting that the act will help the economy.
Moreover, Mr. Wicker is mistaken in his implication that the framers of this legislation acted in ignorance of, or indifference to, its likely economic effects. He argues that the package, which will reduce the deficit by about $490 billion over five years, will weaken the economy and reduce investment, and that its authors must have overlooked a number of arguments that purportedly shed light on the legislation's economic effects.
The architects of the budget deal acted because economists of virtually every ideological stripe advised them over the last few years that a significant reduction in the deficit would increase, not reduce, economic growth and living standards. To be sure, the spending cuts and tax increases in the package may temporarily weaken private investment and aggregate demand. But most economists are confident that, after some delay, these developments will be more than offset by positive ones.
In contrast to Mr. Wicker's arguments, private investment should increase because of a reduction in interest rates resulting from scaled-back Federal borrowing. The decline in rates should be helped along by an easing of monetary policy that the Federal Reserve chairman has all but promised to deliver in response to the budget pact. Exports should strengthen as the nation comes to depend less on foreign capital to finance its excessive deficits. In turn, stronger investment and net exports will yield higher incomes and living standards.
Additional public investment may also benefit the economy, as Mr. Wicker argues in "America's Real Deficit" (column, Nov. 7), but this does not diminish the benefits that are likely to flow from the budget deal. The spending cuts in the legislation did not significantly affect Federal investment. Moreover, the budget act leaves policy makers free to shift Federal spending toward investment, thereby fulfilling Mr. Wicker's wish.

HEADLINE: India Gets $450 Million Loan for Gulf Hardship

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to loan India $400 million to $450 million to address an economic crisis caused by rising oil prices and shortages after the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, a top Indian finance official said today.
But the release of the funds depends on a formal application by the new minority Government of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, who in the past has been a sharp critic of international lending institutions and multinational corporations. The impending decision is likely to reflect the economic thinking of Mr. Shekhar, whose views may now be tempered by harsh economic reality and a balance of payments crisis, aides said. 
 A top aide to Mr. Shekhar said separately that the Prime Minister was not against foreign assistance and that "we will make a decision very soon" on the issue. The aide, Yashwant Sinha, who is expected to get a major post in the Government, indicated that a decision on the I.M.F. offer would be made after the Prime Minister brought more ministers into his Cabinet. The Prime Minister has appointed only Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal so far.
The monetary fund's executiveboard cleared the assistance in principle this week. The money is to come from an I.M.F. reserve called the Contingency Compensatory Financing Facility, said a Government official familiar with the negotiations.
The reserve is meant to help third-world countries with foreign-exchange difficulties and pay the cost of food imports. After much lobbying from third-world countries, the fund agreed to expand its role to help meet problems arising from the sudden jump in oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Two Indian officials met with fund officials in Washington this week to press for special assistance to overcome high oil prices.
In an interview today, Mr. Sinha identified the new Government's economic priorities: holding the line on prices, increasing foreign-investor confidence, slashing Government spending, tightening management of resources and a review of all major uncompleted projects.
"I think that Mr. Chandra Shekhar would like to follow the policies of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, a happy amalgam of the principle of self-reliance with foreign assistance in required high-technology areas," he said. Mrs. Gandhi governed India for two terms and began a process of gradual economic liberalization that was continued by her son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi, and by V. P. Singh, Mr. Shekhar's predecessor.
Mr. Singh was ousted last week after a conservative Hindu party withdrewits support in Parliament and Mr. Shekhar broke with Mr. Singh by leading a dissident faction out of his party and reaching a deal with the Congress Party of Mr. Gandhi for the requisite support in Parliament.
Mr. Sinha said many of those involved in recent Hindu-Muslim and caste disputes that led to rioting and deaths across Northern India "are now in a chastened mood" after the turmoil led to the fall of Mr. Singh's Government. "Perhaps, it was necessary to go through this trauma," he said.
Still, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which withdrew support from Mr. Singh in a dispute over its plans to build a temple on the site of a mosque at Ayodhya, is prepared for a renewed confrontation with Mr. Shekhar; it has called for a new march on the site by followers on Dec. 6. Mr. Shekhar isreaching out to Hindu and Muslim religious and political leaders in an effort to calm both sides.
Mr. Shekhar was sworn in as India's eighth Prime Minister Nov. 9 and won a confidence vote Friday night with the support of the Congress Party and other smaller regional party allies.
Mr. Sinha said the Government must set deadlines for clearing foreign applications and cut the bureaucratic procedures that make many foreign companies wary of investing here.
"It is largely a problem of management," he said. "Foreign companies dislike delays and uncertainty the most. They do not know how long the clearance will take or if the sanction will come through at all. I think that the Government must set deadlines like 15 or 20 days in which an application is examined and cleared or rejected."

HEADLINE: The Ex-Im Bank Replies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The article ("Time for the Ex-Im Bank to Fade Away," Nov. 4) which criticized Ex-Im Bank's loans and guarantees alleged we had outlived our usefulness.
The facts are that Ex-Im Bank makes loans only to support the export of American goods and services and only when an Ex-Im loan is necessary for the American exporter to win the export sale. We do not, and should not, finance a large percentage of total American exports. However, the bank does play a key role in expanding the American export base. For example, last year, about 27 percent of its authorizations went to small business. Ex-Im loan and guarantee support is critical to American exports to some markets by certain manufacturing sectors in our economy.
In a perfect world, there would be no need for trade subsidies, no export agencies. However, the reality is that our trading partners have active, well-funded export credit agencies similar to Ex-Im Bank. I can think of no time in the last decade when the muscle of Ex-Im Bank was more needed to secure our global commercial interests. American business would be at a severe disadvantage without an export subsidy to meet the competition head on.
The other major export credit agencies have more than $210 billion in outstanding credit to developing countries. Only $26 billion or 13 percent of that is American Ex-Im Bank credits. In the Pacific Basin alone, the United States loses a minimum of $4 billion a year in export sales due to the use of mixed credits (a mixture of commercial credits and government subsidized loans) by competitors.
Export credit agency exposure in the half dozen emerging free market economies of Central Europe is now about $20 billion, plus $15 billion more in the Soviet Union. The Ex-Im Bank share is $1.8 billion -- we are hardly a factor. Obviously, American firms need to be more aggressive in securing a share of these markets. With commercial banks shying away from foreign investments, the demand for Ex-Im Bank to guarantee worthwhile credit risks in developing global markets is growing, not diminishing.

WEST IS REBUKED BY JORDANIAN KING

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Nov. 17

 BODY:
King Hussein opened the Jordanian Parliament today with a largely bleak assessment of Jordan's prospects in the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis and attacked what he called the "blatant and shameless" hypocrisy of nations involved in the military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
While the King did not mention the United States by name, his attack was clearly directed at the Bush Administration and its Western allies. 
 "Their actual goals stem from their desire to control our destiny and the Arab nations' resources," said the Jordanian monarch, using language that was uncharacteristically harsh. "Their blatant and shameless conduct must confirm to us that their real motives are far from being the hollow claim to uphold legitimacy and defend principles."
 
Signs of Fatigue
 King Hussein, whose speech to the opening session of Parliament amounted to a Jordanian State of the Union address, spoke in a solemn, deliberate tone, the fatigue of recent weeks visible on his face.
He said his nation of three million people was at a "crossroads" and that without an Arab solution to the crisis, the Middle East could be on "the verge of a catastrophe which would destroy our existence and place the future of the Arab nation in the hands of others."
King Hussein, an Arab leader who has promoted close ties to the United States and other Western nations during his 38-year reign, is a man with few palatable options as a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August.
Torn between his affection for the West and his longstanding economic and military alliance with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, the Jordanian leader suggested today that it was hypocritical for nations to try to uphold international law in the Persian Gulf while ignoring the plight of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.
 
'Double-Standard Attitude'
 "These powers adopt the complacent stand toward Israeli aggression while assuming the role of defenders of international legitimacy and human rights in the Gulf," he said. "They maintain this double-standard attitude with the least regard for principles."
He charged that some of those nations had responded with a "timid rebuke of victim and aggressor" after at least 17 Palestinians were slain by the Israeli police in a clash last month at Al Aksa Mosque in Jerusalem.
He called again for the removal of the thousands of Western troops deployed in Saudi Arabia, calling the deployment "a visible and persistent threat to the Arab nation's hopes and aspirations for a unified and impregnable homeland." The King has said that the crisis can be solved only through negotiations among Arab nations.
 
Moves Toward Democracy
 His speech to the Jordanian lawmakers came a year after King Hussein allowed the first parliamentary elections in this country in 22 years.
In his address, the King said he hoped a special commission would complete its work on what is called a national charter for Jordan by year's end. The charter, which is separate from the Jordanian Constitution, is expected to set guidelines for multiparty politics.
According to news reports reaching here today from Baghdad, Western diplomats in the Iraqi capital are hopeful that many more American hostages than originally planned will leave Kuwait on evacuation flights Sunday.
 
U.S. Hostages to Leave
 Reuters said in a dispatch from Baghdad that about 180 Americans, mainly women and children, would be aboard two Iraqi Airways jets being chartered by the State Department.
The dispatch said the planes would fly to Baghdad, where the passengers would be joined by a few Britons, and all would board an Iraqi Airways Boeing 747 for a flight to London.
The department said earlier this week that it had chartered only one plane, a smaller Boeing 707, and that only about 100 Americans were expected to make the trip. An American Embassy spokesman in Amman said today that he had no information on the Reuters report.
The situation remained bleak for other Western hostages being held in Iraq. Twenty-one Swedes being detained by Iraq released a statement today accusing their Government of doing too little to win their freedom.
"After 117 days as hostages, we no longer believe in Sweden's silent diplomacy or the Government's humanity," the hostages said. They asked that the Swedish Ambassador send envoys to Baghdad to negotiate their release.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN EUROPE;
Arms Pact to Codify Europe's New Power Balance

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In an important postscript to the end of the cold war, the Soviet Union is to renounce its traditional huge superiority in conventional arms in Europe when a far-reaching East-West disarmament treaty is signed at the opening of a 34-nation European-security summit meeting here on Monday.
With the treaty allowing the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 6-member Warsaw Pact a similar number of heavy weapons in an area stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals, the West can now move more confidently toward reducing its military strength in Europe. 
 Although perennial fears of a surprise Soviet attack on Western Europe were buried in the ruins of Eastern Europe's Communist regimes, the treaty has been hailed as the most comprehensive East-West disarmament agreement to date because it formalizes the dramatically changed balance of power in Europe.
 
Big Cuts for Soviet Union
 Once the treaty has been ratified by the 22 nations, probably by mid-1991, the Soviet Union will have three years in which to destroy tens of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft and helicopters, to achieve parity with NATO.
In contrast, NATO, whose stockpiles of conventional weapons are already close to the ceilings allowed by the treaty, is expected to destroy fewer than 4,000 tanks, half of which belonged to East Germany and were counted as Western after German unification last month.
The agreement does not deal with troop levels, but this question will be tackled in subsequent negotiations that are to begin in Vienna on Nov. 26 and take into account current moves and announced plans by Moscow and Washington to cut back their military personnel in Europe.
The importance the United States gives to the so-called Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe is such that President Bush warned that he would not attend next week's Paris summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe unless it had already been concluded.
 
U.S. Delegate's View
 "We ended up with a treaty that is awfully close to what we were seeking a year or two ago," R. James Woolsey, the chief American delegate at the conventional arms talks, said after the final text was approved in Vienna Thursday evening.
NATO's task was made easier, though, by the fact that the start of negotiations in March 1989 was soon followed by the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, by the virtual disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and by the voluntary withdrawal of many Soviet troops and weapons from the territory of Moscow's former satellites.
"You could say that, to some extent, the treaty has been overtaken by events," Manfred Worner, NATO's Secretary General, noted, "but this does not make it superfluous. What was done unilaterally can be revised unilaterally. So the treaty pins down the changes and makes them irreversible."
 
Easing the Soviet Threat
 Mr. Woolsey said the West originally saw the negotiations as a way of reducing Soviet military might in Eastern Europe and forestalling a quick thrust into the West. "But that was done by Vaclav Havel, Solidarity and others," he said, refering to the role played by the Czechoslovak dissident leader and the Polish labor movement in toppling Communist regimes.
Now, he went on, the treaty provides institutions and mechanisms to insure that the changes of the past year become permanent. And he stressed that, along with weapons destruction, it also contains crucial verification provisions that "make it much harder to think of a strike or a surprise military movement."
As a result, according to NATO experts, the Atlantic alliance will have a warning period of two to three years should a new buildup of Soviet conventional forces seem to pose a threat to the West. And if this violated the treaty, the experts said, NATO would have the right -- as well as ample time -- to respond.
Both Western and Eastern negotiators said the Vienna talks took place in a remarkably cordial manner, with Moscow apparently eager for a treaty even though its bargaining position was being steadily weakened by the surge of democracy in Eastern Europe and by mounting economic and political troubles at home.
 
'A Balanced Treaty'
 "It's a balanced treaty," Istvan Gyarmati, the chief Hungarian negotiator, said. "Militarily, the Soviets gave more than they gained, but politically they got a lot. And what they gave up militarily, they couldn't finance anyway."
Western officials also insisted that, while they are concerned, they are not alarmed about intelligence reports that over the last two years the Soviet Union has moved close to 20,000 tanks and more than 30,000 artillery pieces from Europe to east of the Ural mountains, beyond the area affected by the treaty.
If they were still stationed in Europe at 9 A.M. on Sunday, when the signing countries must provide information on their conventional weapons, the treaty would have required their destroyed. But Soviet officials have argued that many were moved as part of Moscow's withdrawal from Eastern Europe and that most will be destroyed or converted for civilian use.
"The Russians have given us assurances and have been forthcoming with information," Mr. Worner said, "and we do not distrust them. But we have told them that we will closely monitor what happens because, without absolute transparency, it will be difficult to get ratification of the treaty."
 
New Treaty Ceilings
 Since details of each country's conventional weapons will not be revealed until Sunday, Western experts said they still do not know how many will fall above the new European ceilings for each alliance: 20,000 battle tanks, 30,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack helicopters.
The last estimates considered reliable by NATO showed that when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a unilateral program of Soviet military cuts in December 1988, the Warsaw Pact had 60,000 tanks, including 46,000 Soviet tanks, in the area of the Atlantic to the Urals, compared with just 22,000 for all of NATO.
The Warsaw Pact enjoyed a similar advantage over NATO in other heavy weapons -- 63,000 to 27,000 in armored vehicles, 61,000 to 21,000 in artillery pieces, 14,000 to 6,300 in combat aircraft and 3,000 to 2,000 in attack helicopters. Most of those -- 45,000 armored vehicles, 47,000 artillery pieces, 11,000 aircraft and 2,800 helicopters -- were attached to Soviet forces.
Western officials said that, in mid-1990, Warsaw Pact nations provided information suggesting that the alliance still had 41,000 tanks, 52,000 armored vehicles and 49,000 artillery pieces in Europe. "These figures are much lower now," an American official said, "but we think they will still have to destroy around 13,000 tanks. Aircraft, of course, can be easily flown out."
 
Limits on Single Countries
 One additional restraint on Soviet military strength involves a treaty provision limiting any single country to about two-thirds of the total weapons its alliance is alloted in most of the separate categories, and about three-quarters in others. And, in practice, Moscow's Eastern European partners forced it to accept slightly less than the maximum tanks and artillery pieces it was allowed under the treaty.
Further, during the negotiations, it became increasingly apparent that the Warsaw Pact no longer functioned as a military alliance, with several Eastern European countries often endorsing NATO positions.
The 111-page treaty itself is enormously complicated. It even details approved ways of destroying tanks, including damaging them with explosive charges, crushing them with an eight-ton iron ball, squashing them in a powerful vice, cutting them up and using them for target practice. "Japan is very interested in all the scrap metal," the American official said.
A 22-nation Joint Consultative Group will also be established to verify information provided by countries over the next 120 days, while signing governments will be allowed to witness destructions and carry out on-site inspections of storage installations once the three-year "destruction period" is over.
Two questions considered crucial by the United States -- troop levels and aerial inspections -- were not included in the treaty, in part because of the rush to reach agreement in time for next week's summit meeting. But they will be tackled in talks scheduled to begin later this month.
The United States and the Soviet Union in fact agreed last February to limit their ground and air force personnel stationed in Europe outside their national territory to 195,000 each, with an additional 30,000 American troops allowed to remain at a greater distance from the Soviet border.
But this provisional accord was overtaken by events as the Soviet Union came under pressure to withdraw its troops from Eastern Europe. "Moscow found itself tied to an agreement authorizing 195,000 American troops in Europe when it soon would have no troops beyond its own border," a Western official explained.
Having agreed to pull out its forces from Hungary and Czechoslovakia by June 30 next year, from the former territory of East Germany within four years and from Poland probably in 1992, the Soviet Union obtained Washington's agreement in September to postpone negotiation on troop levels until the subsequent talks.
NATO officials said that after a united Germany pledged to reduce its armed forces to 370,000 men and women Bonn was eager not to be seen as being singled out among European countries; it favored incorporating its troop reductions into a broader agreement. Germany is nonetheless expected to repeat its commitment to the lower troop levels here Monday.
The signers of the treaty have agreed to embark on an entirely new round of conventional arms reduction talks after a planned summit meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1992. But under the presumption that the Warsaw Pact will no longer exist even in name by then, the plan is for them to involve all 34 members of the European security conference.

Iraq Could Have Atomic Arsenal by 2000, Intelligence Experts Say

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Iraq has acquired a nuclear weapons capacity that could enable it to begin manufacturing and using a small but devastating stock of nuclear missiles, shells and bombs within 10 years, American, British and Israeli intelligence experts have concluded.
The experts say that Iraq has amply demonstrated that it intends to build a nuclear arsenal from scratch. They add that unless Iraq is prevented from doing so by foreign military intervention or foreign economic restrictions, its engineers could almost certainly begin limited production of nuclear warheads within a decade. 
 Drawing from its immense oil revenues, Iraq has already acquired some of the foreign expertise, military secrets, tools, processing machinery, special alloys, electronic components, chemicals, computers, uranium ore and other materials needed for the task.
 
Threats Taken Seriously
 As Iraq hastens development of a fleet of intermediate- and long-rang missiles, moreover, its explicit and implied threats against Israel, Europe and even the United States are taken increasingly seriously.
But even the most pessimistic Israeli assessments assume that Iraq will need at least two years to begin warhead production. Most Western analysts believe that Iraq still faces enormous technical problems in creating a credible nuclear arsenal and that it would take 5 to 10 years to deploy nuclear warheads, even if the current international blockade of Iraq's borders and coasts were to be lifted.
"My own feeling," said Donald Kerr, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, "is that it will be five to seven years, provided someone doesn't destroy Iraq's industrial capacity before then. The physics of nuclear explosions is fairly well understood, but the engineering of warheads is a much more difficult matter."
The large plants that would be needed to manufacture nuclear explosives would be impossible to conceal or camouflage, nuclear engineers say, and would be easy targets for attacks like Israeli air raid in 1981 that destroyed Iraq's nuclear breeder reactor at Tuwaitha.
 
Plant Would Be Hard to Hide
 Another British intelligence analyst said: "I really cannot imagine that Israel would leave standing an Iraqi gas-centrifuge uranium separation plant if one should appear in a satellite photograph or intelligence assessment. The Iraqis are wily about hiding their clandestine foreign purchases, their chemical and biological warfare facilities, their missile tests and so forth. But hiding a uranium separation plant would be like hiding an elephant in a bathtub."
A welter of reports and rumors have circulated in recent months that Iraq is close to beginning production of nuclear weapons. One set of speculations centered on some highly-enriched uranium fuel salvaged from the breeder reactor after the Israeli attack. This fuel could be used to make one crude nuclear weapon relatively quickly, although it is regularly inspected by experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure it has not been diverted to military use. Several days ago Iraq invited the agency to conduct a new inspection, suggesting that Baghdad has no immediate military plans for the fuel.
Other speculations have been based on seizures by European governments of materials and components bound for Iraq that could be used for the production of nuclear weapons.
In March, British customs officials, acting on information from United States authorities, seized a shipment of special capacitors consigned to Iraq. Such devices can store electricity and release it in a few millionths of a second as a powerful pulse. Nuclear weapons of the type Iraq is believed to be planning -- the type that destroyed the city of Nagasaki in 1945 -- depend on just this type of capacitor.
 
Germans Seize Machinery
 On July 15, German customs officials in Frankfurt seized a consignment of Swiss-made machinery bound for Iraq. The shipment consisted mainly of items fabricated from a special high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel essential to the construction of gas centrifuges -- advanced devices capable of separating fissionable uranium 235 from its inert isotope, uranium 238.
Iraq already possesses substantial stocks of crude uranium. Most of it is imported, but some reports say Iraq is also trying to exploit deposits of low-grade uranium ore in the far northwestern part of the country.
According to a study by Michael Eisenstadt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Iraq bought some 250 tons of a uranium-bearing mixture called yellowcake in the late 1970's and early 1980's from Brazil, Portugal and Niger.
Yellowcake must be subjected to a complex series of processes to produce fissionable uranium 235. According to reports from Polish engineers who were briefly held as human shields by Iraq, the first chemical steps of that process are being performed at a large chemical plant at Al Qaim, northwest of Baghdad. The end chemical product in this complex chain is uranium hexafluoride -- a gas needed for the isotope separation process in which bomb fuel is produced. Western analysts can only guess where a full-scale uranium separation plant might eventually be built.
 
The Source of the Supplies
 The Simon Wiesenthal Foundation of Los Angeles has circulated a list of more than 200 companies in Europe, Asia and the United States that have supplied Iraq with materials and technologies potentially needed by a nuclear weapons industry.
Recent intelligence interest has centered on Iraq's efforts to obtain uranium raw stocks and in building a high-technology gas centrifuge plant for separating fissionable uranium 235 from nonfissionable uranium 238. Stymied during the 1970's and 1980's in attempts to buy plutonium, or weapons-grade uranium, from arms smugglers and other foreign sources, Baghdad decided to manufacture its own.
According to some published speculation, Iraq has already obtained enough parts and material to build 26 centrifuges.
But such experts in nuclear weapon technology as Leonard S. Spector, director of the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace, believe that despite this progress Iraq is still years from making weapons. One reason is that centrifuges can produce only tiny quantities of enriched uranium at a time.
In natural uranium, the content of uranium 235 is only 0.71 percent. Each time uranium hexafluoride gas made from natural uranium is passed through one of the huge centrifuges, the "enriched" product contains a slightly larger proportion of uranium 235 -- 0.794 percent -- while the "waste" gas (which is subjected to further processing) contains a slightly smaller proportion -- 0.635 percent.
 
An Elaborate Process
 To obtain significant enrichment of uranium-235 requires many passes through thousands of centrifuges, each one built of costly materials and standing some 20 feet tall. Enriched uranium suitable for most American nuclear power reactors contains only about 3 percent of uranium 235 while uranium fuel for a bomb works best at purities above 90 percent uranium 235.
A leading nuclear analyst, Gary Milhollin, director of the Washington-based Wisconsin Project of Nuclear Arms Control, said that if Iraq had only 26 centrifuges, "we'll all be long dead of old age before they get even one bomb."
A rule of thumb, he said, "is that for every thousand gas centrifuges you have in operation, you can produce enough uranium 235 each year to make between one and one-and-a-half nuclear warheads of about 15 kilotons, roughly equivalent to the explosions that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You certainly don't acquire a nuclear arsenal overnight."
Gas centrifuges cannot be dispersed because they must be operated in concert in what is called a cascade process. This means that a plant containing at least 1,000 of the big machines would be highly conspicuous, especially since it would require a railroad siding, access roads and other accessories, including a gigantic source of electrical power.
 
Three Research Installations
 Iraq is known to operate nuclear research installations at Erbil, Mosul and Tuwaitha, but no intelligence reports have come to light of any plant construction at these or any other sites that could house a full-scale gas-centrifuge separation plant.
Gas centrifuges are notoriously difficult to build and operate without accident. Their rotors spin at speeds high enough to tear ordinary steel asunder. Experimental centrifuges operated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee broke up so frequently that plant workers dubbed them "self-disassembly machines."
Pakistan, an emerging nuclear power that reportedly built some 14,000 gas centrifuges based on European technology, is rarely able to operate more than 1,000 at a time because of breakdowns. Pakistan is believed to have obtained enough material for a nuclear bomb in 1986, and according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace is thought to have sufficient fuel today to build fewer than a dozen weapons.
Weapons experts believe that Iraq must surmount another major problem -- the test explosion of a nuclear device.
If Baghdad were to build a simple weapon from its reactor fuel based on the "gun-type system," no test would be needed. The gun-type system, used in the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, uses a chemical propellant to slam a uranium 235 projectile through a cannon barrel into a target of uranium 235. Combining the two uranium masses suddenly initiates a chain fission reaction and a nuclear explosion.
 
Iraq's Sights Are Higher
 But Baghdad has given many signs that its sights are higher; it clearly hopes to build a more complex implosion bomb similar to the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki. The detonation of such a bomb must be perfectly choreographed in microsecond steps, or the explosion will fizzle.
"I would be very surprised if Iraq were to deploy implosion warheads without testing at least one of them," said Dr. Sidney Drell, a high-energy physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center who has served on Presidential scientific advisory boards since the 1960's.
Mr. Kerr of the International Institute for Strategic Studies agreed. "They'd have to look for some remote part of the world where they could carry it off without being observed too easily," he said. "Certainly, they have been testing their new missiles in Mauritania. Out in the open Sahara. It may be that their interest in those wide-open spaces in the Mauritanian Sahara also has to do with a nuclear test."
Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, who commanded Israel's military intelligence apparatus until 1987, said in an interview that in his estimation, based on the latest Israeli intelligence, it would take Iraq two years to pose a nuclear menace. "But left to himself," he said, referring to President Saddam Hussein, "Saddam will eventually build a nuclear arsenal, and he will have the means to attack not only Israel but most of Europe. Will the world stand by and let that happen?"

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Drugs in Europe: Signs of a Spreading Plague

BYLINE: By TOM MASHBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The 14-hour days spent treating heroin addicts at a clinic in Warsaw leave Helena Baran exhausted. But after spending 10 hours here, listening to grim predictions about crack in Europe, she was alarmed.
"This is all we need," she said as four American mayors finished giving their European counterparts a blunt lesson on drugs and urban decay at a meeting here this week. "We have unemployment, people on the margin. There's already a black market in opium and barbiturates. Now, with the borders open, this drug might well flow in." 
 The American warning, delivered by the Mayors of York, Pa., Colorado Springs, Charlotte, N.C., and San Diego, arrived with a statistical exclamation point: European police officials reported this week that Continent-wide seizures of cocaine had risen sixfold since 1986, from 1.5 tons to nearly 9 tons.
This is tiny by the standards of the United States, but drug-enforcement officials say evidence points to an effort by Latin American cartels to ship cocaine to Europe now that the United States market for crack seems appears saturated.
"There is no doubt that the Colombians are looking at 1992 and Western Europe," a Drug Enforcement Administration official told Reuters, referring to the 1992 integration of the European Community. "But they are also looking at Eastern Europe, which is virgin territory for cocaine."
Noting that crack cases are rare or nonexistent in their cities, European mayors have strongly resisted the idea that the smokable form of cocaine could someday come ashore. The American mayors here said they hoped that their message would be a cold slap in the face to a skeptical audience. "We were surprised by their blase attitude when we met in Montreal last year," said Robert M. Isaac of Colorado Springs, the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, referring to a conference on crime prevention held in October 1989. "We don't want to scare anyone, but in the area of drugs, Europe is where the United States was before crack got big."
Maureen O'Connor, the Mayor of San Diego, was blunter: "They're practicing denial. They don't believe there is a problem. But as we say in the States, 'Government is always the last to know.' "
The Americans were joined by a group of Canadian mayors who said their experiences might more closely mirror those of smaller European cities.
"We don't have the same problems with guns and lack of education that you see in the States, and yet even a small city like Halifax can be home to a crack house," said Mayor John Backhouse of Prince George, British Columbia.
Although the message from North America had a chilling effect, not everyone was sure of its relevance here. "I was astonished to hear about the violence and the enormous criminality in American cities," said Mayor Jorge Sampaio of Lisbon. "But to say there is crack in the big cities of Europe, I simply don't know."
And Patrick Ouart, an aide to Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris, said, "Are we truly vulnerable to crack? We just can't say."
European health specialists estimate that there are 100,000 cocaine addicts in Europe, and 800,000 heroin addicts, out of a population of 350 million. But 1989 was the first year that Interpol, the European police agency, reported the impounding of more cocaine than heroin, suggesting that the drug is gaining casual users.
"We don't really have hard numbers yet for crack," said Christopher Luckett, a specialist on the drug trade and on money-laundering who works for the Council of Europe, which organized the meeting here. "The Europeans have been free-basing cocaine for 15 years, and where there's coke, there's crack."
Jiri Kos, a police official in Prague who specializes in drug cases, said 7,000 people there have been counted as drug addicts so far this year. "Certainly, crack could arrive," he said. "People feel freer now, and that brings good consequences, and bad ones, too."

HEADLINE: Blacks and the Election: What Was the Message?

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
In an election that played out in a welter of mixed signals, few signals were so mixed as those coming from black Americans on Nov. 6.
The turnout of black voters in the nation as a whole apparently declined relative to white turnout. But it held steady, or even rose, in states with some of the country's leading contests, as in North Carolina, Texas and California. 
 Several campaigns featured a resurgence of racial politics that was viewed as harmful to Republican efforts to attract blacks. But Election Day polls showed growing black support for Republican Congressional candidates nationally.
And notwithstanding black support that was a factor in some of the Democrats' biggest successes, particularly Ann Richards's triumph in the race for governor of Texas, a number of experts said the party's move toward the political center and away from some of its more outspoken liberal positions could be hampering its ability to turn out black voters.
 
Decline in Electorate Share
 Perhaps the most arresting set of figures about blacks that came out of the balloting were those showing a decline in their share of the electorate. A survey of voters leaving the polling places, performed by Voter Research and Surveys, the new pool effort of the network news organizations, found that blacks made up only 5 percent of the national electorate on Nov. 6. A survey by the Wirthlin Group, which does polling for Republicans, found the same 5 percent share.
That compared with New York Times/CBS News Poll findings of an 8 percent share in the last off-year election, in 1986, and 7 percent in 1982.
But exactly what the decline means, or even whether it has any lasting meaning, is a matter of debate.
Among those who suggest that the Democrats are paying a price in lost black voters because of the party's move toward the center, a shift resulting from decisive defeats in the last three Presidential elections, is Larry J. Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia.
"This is not 1964," he said. "Blacks aren't thrilled to death just because they have the right to vote. They have to have someone to vote for. One cost of moderating the message by Democrats is that they aren't exciting their most loyal voter core."
Ed Brown, executive director of the Atlanta-based Voter Education Project, which seeks to enroll black voters in precincts across the South, said such slippage in their turnout was due in part to a feeling that neither party was adequately addressing their needs. Or, as it was put by Darrin Williams, a 23-year-old unemployed black Atlantan with two years of college education, "What happens at the top doesn't trickle down to the bottom." Mr. Williams counts himself among those who did not vote last week.
 
A Note of Caution
 Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a Washington research organization, notes similar slippage in the last Presidential election year. A Census Bureau survey taken shortly after the Presidential election 26 years ago found that 70.7 percent of voting-age whites said they had cast ballots, as against 58.5 percent of voting-age blacks, for a gap of 12.2 percentage points. That gap had narrowed to 5.6 points by 1984, then widened to 7.6 points in 1988.
Mr. Gans attributed the widening of the margin in part to the largely bland nature of the Democratic Presidential campaign and what he called its failure to address civil rights and other issues of concern to blacks. But he cautioned against reading a great deal into the exit-poll figures coming out of the Nov. 6 vote, saying too many factors were at work in an off-year election.
For instance, some analysts noted that there were few competitive elections this year in a number of states with relatively large black populations, like New York and Mississippi, and that as a result the figures on blacks' national share of the electorate might have been artificially depressed.
 
An Opposite Trend
 Indeed, some specialists in black voting patterns said they doubted that the figures indicated any significant trend at all. To the contrary, said David Bositis, a senior associate with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research organization specializing in black issues, various statistics point to a long-term trend in which the turnout of blacks relative to that of whites is on the rise. One such set of statistics comes from the Voter Education Project, which found that only four years ago, for the first time in history, blacks' share of the national electorate virtually equaled their share of the voting-age population.
Mr. Bositis said he expected this trend to be sustained in future elections. The number of black elected officials around the country has increased from 1,500 to more than 7,000 during the last two decades, he said, and as they move up to higher offices on the political ladder, they will carry black voters with them.
"I think the critical element is less issues than the role of black elites," Mr. Bositis said. "The movement is up over the past 10 years, and I expect it to continue. You may have episodic downturns, but the long-term movement is there."
 
Disappointment in Chicago
 The most dramatic case of disappointing black turnout last week may have been in Chicago, where it was viewed as a factor in the defeat of Neil F. Hartigan, the Democratic nominee for Illinois governor. An estimated 45 percent of black voting-age Chicagoans went to the polls, a drop of 10 percentage points from 1986, and in some predominantly black wards the figure was as low as 30 percent. One effect was to bring the city's overall rate of turnout down to 53 percent.
Black turnout was disappointing, too, in Louisiana, where in an October election State Representative David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, sought a seat in the United States Senate. Mr. Duke got 44 percent of the vote, and post-election analyses in Louisiana indicated that his showing was so strong because turnout among whites was 15 percentage points higher than among blacks.
But in some other states, particularly those with the most hotly contested, closely watched races, blacks' share of the total vote apparently held steady, or even rose.
In Texas, where Ms. Richards was locked in a bitter campaign against the Republican nominee, Clayton Williams, Voter Research and Surveys found that blacks made up 13 percent of the electorate, a rise of four points from the share found by CBS News in 1986.
In California, the Democratic state chairman, former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., has been under fire in recent days from a number of Democratic politicians who say that the state organization did not do enough to bring out the black and Hispanic vote and that this failure could have been the difference in Dianne Feinstein's unsuccessful campaign for governor against Senator Pete Wilson. But Voter Research and Surveys found that blacks made up 9 percent of California's electorate on Nov. 6, no drop at all from the proportion that CBS News found four years ago.
 
Gains by Republicans
 Some analysts expressed greatest surprise at an Election Day finding by a New York Times/CBS News Poll that Republicans had received 22 percent of the black vote around the country in races for the House of Representatives. That was a seven-point gain over the black vote that the same polling organization found for Republican House candidates in 1988, and double the percentage found in 1982.
Because of sampling error, a shift in black voting between any of those two polls had to be five percentage points or more to be significant. Put another way, that means that the apparent seven-point shift between 1988 and 1990 in blacks voting for Republican candidates might actually have been as little as two points.
 
Race as a Message
 One apparent benefactor of a black shift toward Republicans was Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, where the proportion of voting-age blacks who turned out was roughly equal to that of whites who did so. Rebuffing his Democratic challenger, Paul R. Hubbert, Governor Hunt got about a quarter of the black vote even though Democrats had accused him of injecting race into the campaign.
To a number of experts, race provided a most telling message of the election: the degree to which racially charged contests can bring out white voters.
In addition to Mr. Duke's drive in Louisiana, there was the case of North Carolina, where victory by former Mayor Harvey Gantt of Charlotte would have made him the first Southern black elected to the Senate since Reconstruction. The Gantt campaign brought a rise in North Carolina blacks' electoral share, from 16 percent in 1986 to 19 percent this year. But the incumbent, Senator Jesse Helms, whose organization injected racial issues into the campaign in its final days, won a massive white turnout that swamped Mr. Gantt.
"When the central issue of a campaign essentially is race, that's going to propel turnout," Mr. Gans said. "It's one of the fault lines of American politics."

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN EUROPE;
Bush Gives Czechs a Copy of Liberty Bell

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Nov. 17

 BODY:
President Bush rang a replica of the Liberty Bell in the Czechoslovak capital today to mark the first anniversary of this country's democratic revolution, and he evoked the memory of Czechoslovakia's subjugation by Hitler to appeal for support in his fight against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
"There is right and there is wrong. There is good and there is evil. And there are sacrifices worth making," Mr. Bush told an enthusiastic crowd of more than 100,000 people in Wenceslas Square, the symbolic center of the 1989 overthrow of Communist rule here. 
 Mr. Bush drew a cheer from the crowd, the largest he has addressed as President, by associating President Vaclav Havel with the coalition opposing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. He repeated his vow to drive Mr. Hussein's occupation forces from the Persian Gulf sheikdom.
"The darkness in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of light," Mr. Bush said, drawing on the symbolism of light and darkness embodied in the writing of Thomas Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia, to bolster his message.
 
Vague Promise of Help
 Saying that he expected Czechoslovakia to stand by the United States' side in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Bush promised his listeners that "America will stand with you" as the country grapples with its economic hardships.
This dual theme pervaded both an earlier speech that Mr. Bush delivered to the Federal Assembly here and his words to the crowd in the square. He spoke to the multitude from a bulletproof-glass booth as the early twilight slowly replaced the leaden skies of late afternoon and spotlights illuminated the Czechoslovak and American flags waved by many of those in his audience.
The mixed message seemed to underscore the way Mr. Bush's priorities have changed in the year since the revolution here and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
He was eager to make a strong gesture of support to Czechoslovakia, to reassure his listeners that the crisis in the Persian Gulf did not mean that the United States had forgotten them, and to participate more personally in events that seemed so far removed from Washington. But Mr. Bush brought little with him in the way of additional financial aid, and his attention focused on the gulf.
 
'Your Bitter Experience'
 "I have this feeling in my heart that no peoples understand better what is at stake in the gulf than Czechs and Slovaks," Mr. Bush told the Federal Assembly, which is still not an elected body.
"You know from your bitter experience that the world cannot turn a blind eye to aggression. You know the futility and vain hope that aggressors can be appeased. You know the tragic consequences when nations confronted with aggression choose to tell themselves it is no concern of theirs."
Mr. Bush will continue to press his case on the gulf as he proceeds on a weeklong trip through Europe and the Middle East that is to culminate in a Thanksgiving Day visit to the troops in Saudi Arabia. In Paris, he is to discuss the gulf crisis on Tuesday morning with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Bush is the first American President to visit Czechoslovakia while in office. He drew loud cheers from his listeners in the square when he announced that he would return to Prague a 1919 letter from Masaryk to Woodrow Wilson outlining a declaration of independence and a constitution for Czechoslovakia.
That letter has been kept in the Library of Congress, said Mr. Bush, who referred to it as a "declaration of independence." He said, "1989 was the year that freedom came home to Czechoslovakia; 1990 will be the year your declaration of independence came home to the golden city of Prague."
The emotional rally in Wenceslas Square mixed symbols of different cultures, times and countries. In a reminder of the tight security protecting Mr. Bush on this trip, agents in orange vests prowled rooftops behind neon signs advertising the original Budweiser beer and Licensintorg, an agency of the Soviet Union.
 
Symbols of Patriotism
 Mr. Bush spoke from a spot between the statue of King Wenceslas and a memorial central to Czechoslovakia's modern history, the spot where the student Jan Palach immolated himself in 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion a year earlier. It is covered with flowers and candles in memory of Palach and that of the student march on Nov. 17, 1989, that was violently suppressed by the police, setting in motion the final stages of the "velvet revolution" that overthrew the Communist leadership.
Mr. Bush's remarks on the future of Czechoslovakia were positive. "There are no leaves on the trees and yet it is Prague Spring," he said in a reference to the reforms of 1968 that were crushed by Soviet tanks.
"A year ago, the world saw you face down totalitarianism," Mr. Bush said. "We saw the peaceful crowds swell day by day in numbers and in resolve. We saw the few candles grow into a blaze. We saw this square become a beacon of hope for an entire nation as it gave birth to your new era of freedom."
Mr. Bush presented a replica of the Liberty Bell to Mr. Havel and rang it three times -- "once for your courage, once for your freedom, and once for your children."
He promised: "We have not forgotten. The world will never forget what happened here in this square where the history of freedom was written."
 
More Praise Than Money
 Mr. Bush had little to offer in the way of concrete assistance. He repeated an earlier pledge to obtain $5 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund to assist East European countries with rising energy costs as a result of the gulf crisis. But the only initiative he offered was a pledge to ask Congress to create a $60 million fund to assist nascent business enterprises here. This is to be drawn from $370 million already committed to Central and Eastern Europe for the coming year.
Mr. Havel, in his remarks, concentrated on the economic hardships and political divisions in Czechoslovakia.
Noting that a year had passed since the student march on Wenceslas Square, he said: "Today we are standing here somewhat embarrassed. We know very well what we still have to accomplish, and the question springing up to mind is why do we find it so difficult to launch our joint project off the ground."
He said, "Are we really a nation capable of reviving its virtues only once in 20 years' time?"
Mr. Havel also quoted Alexander Hamilton to bolster his effort to unite the country's divided population and counter a separatist movement among some in the Slovak minority. He cited a document in which Hamilton said, "Among the greatest obstacles obstructing the passage of the new constitution, one can easily discern the undisguised interest of a certain group of people in each state to prevent the coming of all changes threatening to restrict their power."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Seeks Big Cuts; 10,000 May Be Laid Off

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Warning that New York State faced "no other choice," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today proposed layoffs of up to 10,000 state workers and other actions that would ultimately reduce the state government's work force by about 18,000 jobs, or 10 percent.
The Governor's plan, intended to close huge budget shortfalls that have become a near-chronic affliction in Albany, would sharply scale back services at virtually every level of state government and would inflict painful cutbacks on local governments as well. 
 New York City, already overwhelmed with budget gaps of its own, would lose at least $100 million in state aid.
 
Huge Layoffs, Fernandez Warns
Although Cuomo administration officials pledged to work with New York City to minimize the impact of the proposed loss in aid, Mayor David N. Dinkins said he feared even greater cuts and their toll on city services. [Page 42.]
Included in the Governor's $100 million figure was a reduction of $75 million in aid to New York City's schools, a move that Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez has said could force him to lay off thousands of teachers.
Under the proposal, most of which is subject to approval by the Legislature, the state government would immediately cut aid to all school districts by a total of $200 million, and reduce Medicaid and other social programs by an almost equal amount.
 
Even More Cuts Next Year
In addition to closing the $1 billion gap the state faces in its current budget, the plan would start saving at least $1.3 billion in the budget for the fiscal year that begins next April, the Governor said at a press briefing in the Capitol. But even more cuts could be required then. Some state officials, including Comptroller Edward V. Regan, have forecast a budget gap of up to $3 billion for the next fiscal year.
Almost all state employees would have to take five days off without pay over the next few months. It would be the first time in state history that workers would be ordered to take unpaid furloughs.
The proposal would also propel smaller but unusual cutbacks in hundreds of other areas. To save money, New York would bar visitors from state prisons except on weekends. It would also turn off night safety lights along most state parkways in Westchester County and on Long Island.
All told, the Governor's plan would carve about $1 billion out of the $8 billion the state was planning to spend in the rest of the fiscal year that ends in March. The yearly budget was $30 billion, already the most austere of Mr. Cuomo's eight years in office.
 
No Tax Increases
 Mr. Cuomo's plan adheres to his pledge earlier this year not to raise taxes or resort to borrowing to close the gaps. After two years in which the Governor and lawmakers approved the largest tax increases in the state's history, the state could not afford to go that route again, Mr. Cuomo said.
"This plan closes the gap without taxes and without deficit notes," he said. "It does not do it, however, without pain."
Mr. Cuomo and the state's legislative leaders have been roundly criticized over the last few years for dealing with the state's fiscal problems on virtually an ad-hoc basis, and for using fiscal sleight-of-hand that tended to roll one year's problem over to the next.
In issuing his plan today, the Governor was clearly seeking to seize control not only over this year's problem but over next year's deficit as well.
Moreover, although lawmakers will most likely revise facets of the Governor's plan, the basic obligation to cut spending seems unavoidable. Under new strictures that the Legislature imposed on itself last year, its ability to borrow its way out of the problem is sharply curtailed. And both Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino have agreed with the Governor that tax increases should be avoided.
 
Facing the Inevitable
"Our position will be, if you don't like these cuts, then show me what other cuts you have in mind," Mr. Cuomo said. "I frankly don't believe there are a whole lot of other alternatives."
Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, said in a statement today that cuts in local assistance were inevitable. He said he had just begun reviewing the Governor's proposals and would reserve further comment.
The economic turmoil New York faces is reflected even more severely in its neighboring states. Both Connecticut and New Jersey are struggling to close gaps that are a larger percentage of their budgets than New York's.
Governor Cuomo's plan to lay off workers as well as to eliminate jobs through attrition and early retirementwould be spread across 26 state agencies over the next 17 months and would purge 18,000 positions from the approximately 180,000 on the state payroll. About 60,000 more workers are paid by New York State from Federal Government funds and other sources.
The plan would eliminate 6,000 state jobs before March 31, about 2,000 of those through layoffs, the Governor's Budget Director, Dall W. Forsythe, said today. In the 1991-92 fiscal year, which begins April 1, 12,000 more positions would be eliminated.
Mr. Forsythe declined to specify how many jobs each agency would lose, saying he preferred to brief union leaders before making that information public. Other Cuomo administration officials said the most serious job cutbacks would occur in mental-health care and in the Corrections Department, where at least 300 prison guards would lose their jobs.
 
Unions to Resist
 Union leaders vowed a bitter fight against both the layoffs and the mandatory furloughs. "Jettisoning thousands of dedicated state employees is not the answer to these fiscal problems," said Rand Condell, president of the 60,000-member New York State Public Employees Federation.
The state's ailing hospital system would lose about $55 million in state funds in the current year, partly through delays in planned Medicaid rate increases. The losses would amount to a partial retreat from a major hospital bailout package passed by the Legislature this summer.
The president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, Kenneth E. Raske, denounced the proposed cutbacks, saying they would have "the potential to wreck the health-care system in New York."
 
'Painful' in New York City
In New York City, the cuts would be felt most keenly in education, hospitals and other social services, said Mayor Dinkins's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael.
"It will be extremely painful, because we have no buffer left," Mr. Michael said in an interview today. "There is only one way to cover the loss, and that is to cut our services. There's nothing left under a rock, or in a reserve fund."
Both Mr. Michael and Mayor Dinkins said they needed more time to review the plan, but their initial assessment was that the city might lose as much as $200 million in state aid over the next few months, or twice the figure provided by the Cuomo administration. Mr. Cuomo's spokeswoman, Anne Crowley, said the Governor had pledged to work with the city to keep the cuts at $100 million.
 
Pressure to Review Teacher Pay
Mr. Dinkins stopped short of vowing to fight the cuts, saying he understood that the state's "long-term fiscal stability" might be at stake. But he said the city's own financial difficulties would require that it receive state relief in some form, possibly through the relaxation of state-imposed mandates or measures to reduce the cost of borrowing.
The cuts in school aid are certain to renew pressure on Mr. Dinkins and other city officials to reconsider the 5.5 percent pay increase recently negotiated with the teachers' union. About $70 million to help cover the increase was to come from state education aid, which is now being cut.
 
Nullify Contract, Stein Says
 The City Council President, Andrew J. Stein, said today that the contract agreement should be nullified and that officials should "substitute an agreement that works in the best interests of everyone."
The Governor said his education cuts had been tailored to be less severe in poor school districts than in wealthy ones.
Implicit in Mr. Cuomo's plan was an attack on "member items," or special funds that lawmakers have created to dole out money to various projects in their districts. These items, denounced for years by the Governor as pork-barrel spending, include grants for everything from local senior citizens' organizations to uniforms for Little League baseball teams.
The Governor's plan would immediately freeze all outstanding member items, saving the state from $40 million to $50 million this year. Repeated attempts by the Governor to do away with the spending have been rejected by the Legislature.
In issuing his plan, the Governor sought to state its impact favorably. "While these cuts are painful," he said, "they must be viewed in the context of the overall generous investments of this administration in education, social services and local aid over the last eight years."
Nevertheless, the immediate protests from union groups, local leaders and others affected by the cuts indicated that when the Legislature reconvenes soon to consider the Governor's plan, there could be a bruising fight.
