HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Turning the Tables

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker; A. M. Rosenthal is on vacation.

 BODY:
''The Republicans,'' Ronald Reagan once declared, ''are the party of July Fourth and the Democrats are the party of April 15.''
Knowing a profitable political message when he saw it, George Bush has continued to press the theme that the Democrats would raise taxes but he won't: ''Read my lips.''
It is with some poetic justice, therefore, that President Bush now must twist and turn to deal with the one response he neither expected nor can stonewall - an attractive Democratic plan to cut taxes.
The proposal by Daniel P. Moynihan of New York to repeal the most recent increase in the Social Security payroll tax appears to have been the Senator's own brainchild. It has deficiencies that ultimately may condemn it. But the idea is so nearly diabolical in the numerous political problems it poses for Mr. Bush and the Republicans that the White House rightly fears a ''stampede'' in its favor. 
Mr. Moynihan has proposed not just any old tax cut but one that would be of most immediate benefit to low- and middle-income workers - those who have just been hit with an increase, to 7.65 percent, in payroll taxes deducted from their earnings.
This would be a tax cut, moreover, in what can plausibly be termed - as it has been, repeatedly, in this space - the most regressive U.S. tax. All workers pay the same rate, whether they make $20,000 a year or $250,000; the earnings on which the tax can be imposed (now $51,300) are also the same. Someone making that much pays the same dollar amount as a person making $250,000. And all income other than wages is exempt.
Repealing the most recent rise in this onerous tax would benefit greatly those who have suffered most in the economy of the Reagan-Bush years: high school graduates and dropouts, most of whom are payroll workers. Peter Passell reported in The New York Times on Jan. 17 that from 1979 to 1987 their real earnings fell by 9 and 15 percent respectively; in the same years, the real earnings of college graduates rose by 9 percent.
A bird in the hand, moreover, is proverbially worth two in the bush (no pun intended). Higher retirement benefits for low-income workers, as well as the Federal earned-income tax credit for poor families, make up in some degree for the regressivity of the tax Mr. Moynihan wants to cut. But benefits are far in the future, and workers are suffering stiff payroll tax deductions now while trying to make ends meet.
Nor is it only to workers that a payroll tax cut would appeal, because Social Security deductions from a worker's wages have to be matched by his employer. That's a heavy cost of doing business, from which many an employer would like to be relieved -particularly small-business people who hire only a few workers.
Thus, a proposal appealing on its own terms, to workers and employers alike, also stands in stark contrast to one of George Bush's top priorities: a capital gains tax cut. No matter how he defends this scheme, it would be of no immediate relief to most low-income Americans and would yield its primary benefits to wealthy investors. Its trickle-down effect on employment and job creation would be speculative at best.
It's possible, in fact, that a sizable reduction in the Social Security payroll tax would produce at least as many new jobs and pay increases as would Mr. Bush's capital gains tax, and perhaps more. The benefits of a payroll tax cut, after all, would be spread across all levels of the economy, immediately. Not only might employers be enabled to hire more and pay better; millions of Americans would receive higher take-home pay to pour into the economy.
Besides, as Mr. Moynihan complains, the rising Social Security trust fund surplus - intended to pay benefits 30 and 40 years from now - is being used deceitfully to make the Federal deficit look smaller, and illicitly to finance other Government expenditures that ought to be paid for -if at all - out of general revenues. Thus, the payroll tax cut the Senator proposes, if achieved, would bring additional pressures on Mr. Bush for the general tax increase he is sworn to oppose.
Depending on its substance and purpose, such a tax increase might or might not be a good thing. Cutting the payroll tax now would raise the question whether future Social Security benefits would be sufficiently guaranteed. Other questions remain to be answered, but for now Mr. Moynihan has neatly turned the political tables on President Bush and the Republicans - in an election year, at that.

HEADLINE: L.I. Baymen Resist Shellfishing Ban

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST HAMPTON, L.I., Jan. 17

 BODY:
A battle between state officials and the baymen of eastern Long Island over closing rich shellfishing waters has erupted. The issue is not polluted seas, but the number of state inspectors available to test the waters.
Under a Federal public health program, baymen can legally harvest clams, mussels and other shellfish only from waters approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. In a race to test 900,000 acres of coastal waters for bacteria by the deadline, Tuesday, state officials ran out of time before they could inspect 56,000 acres in Suffolk County. 
Facing Federal sanctions against shellfish exported from New York, state officials said they had no choice but to close the waters until they could be analyzed and the safety of shellfish guaranteed.
Outraged baymen and officials from the two towns most affected, East Hampton and Southampton, argued that the state's foulup threatened to ruin their livelihoods and give the whole region a black eye. Shellfish dealers on the South Fork say clam sales have plummeted since the proposed ban was publicized last week.
 
Productive Waters Affected
The town officials took the matter to court, and on Tuesday Justice Kenneth K. Rohl of State Supreme Court in Hauppauge, a bayman himself, temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the ban in East Hampton and Southampton, pending a hearing scheduled for Jan. 24. The closures took effect in other parts of the county.
The ban would forbid shellfishing within 500 yards of shore from Eatons Neck east to Orient Point and Fishers Island along the North Shore, and from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point on the Shore Shore. In addition, rich clamming areas in the Peconic Bay system like Northwest Creek and parts of Accabonac Harbor, both in East Hampton waters, would be closed.
About 5,000 acres of the 56,000 untested acres are considered highly productive shellfishing waters, the commissioner of the state environmental agency, Thomas C. Jorling, said.
The ban is the latest blow to the baymen, a dwindling breed who for 300 years have relied on the sea for their living. In recent years, their ranks have fallen to about 35 from 150 in East Hampton alone as higher-paying jobs on the mainland lured away some men while a mysterious brown tide that wiped out the region's famous bay scallop industry discouraged others.
 
Accelerated Testing Ordered
The South Fork's tourism industry is still recovering from the effects of beach pollution in 1988 that scared away thousands of visitors from Long Island's shores.
''We cannot and will not allow the arbitrary, reckless and irresponsible actions of a state regulatory agency to jeopardize the economic foundation of our commercial-fishing industry and our tourist-related businesses,'' said Tony Bullock, the town supervisor of East Hampton.
In response to Suffolk officials, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last Friday ordered state inspectors to speed the testing in the most productive areas, including about 250 acres in Accabonac Harbor and Northwest Creek. Until the testing is completed, Mr. Jorling said, the agency would appeal Justice Rohl's injunction for those specific waters, based on preliminary evidence that suggests that the waters are contaminated.
The state is following the National Shellfish Sanitation Program, a voluntary agreement between Federal, state and industry officials established in 1925.
 
Original Deadline Missed
With only five full-time inspectors and a handful of water samplers and laboratory technicians to cover more than 900,000 acres of bay and coastal waters, the state has relied on county and town agencies for help in collecting and analyzing samples, said Pieter VanVolkenburgh, chief of the state's shellfisheries bureau.
The program requires the state to gather at least five samples a year from each of the 1,000 test sites. To measure the worst potential for contamination, the samples must be collected shortly after heavy rains, when the likelihood of runoff from sewage-treatment plants, storm sewers or other sources of pollution is greatest.
Based on that information, the state approves or closes the waters for shellfishing. About 485,000 acres of state waters are considered productive shellfishing areas, and about two-thirds of those have been approved so far, Mr. VanVolkenburgh said.
The state missed its testing deadline of a year ago and was granted an extension until July. It missed that deadline and faced closing any waters not inspected as of Tuesday. ''The Federal Government issued a directive that said unless we could show the waters were not polluted, they were considered polluted,'' Mr. Jorling said.
Clean or not, the mere threat of a ban has frightened customers and endangered the Island's $18 million hard-shell clamming industry. ''They're really trying to destroy the industry,'' said Thomas Lester, a 49-year-old bayman from Springs. ''As soon as the public hears they're closing down the waters because of pollution, they stop buying.''
Mr. Lester said the price of hard clams dropped to $24 a bushel from $100 a bushel in the last week.

HEADLINE: The Budget As Politics

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 17

 BODY:
At first blush, it does not look like an election-year budget.
It calls for almost $800 million in new taxes and rescinds the last phase of a popular income-tax cut. It cuts beloved programs for education and the arts. And it contains few new initiatives that can be used to embellish campaign literature. 
But given the options, the $31 billion budget Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presented to the State Legislature on Tuesday is probably as politically popular a proposal as the Governor could have come up with. Consider the alternatives. 'Unusual Election-Year Budget'
Mr. Cuomo could have proposed no new taxes and maintained the last phase of the income-tax cut. But then he would have had to come up with more than $1 billion in spending cuts.
Or Mr. Cuomo could have raised taxes further to avoid spending cuts altogether. But that might have meant increasing the income or sales tax, which is dangerous in an election year.
A third choice would have been for Mr. Cuomo to rely even more heavily than he already is on the state's reserve funds. But a likely consequence of that move would have been to lower the state's credit rating, even now considered precarious, and to risk plunging the state into a fiscal crisis.
''The Governor's budget is a very unusual election-year budget,'' said Mel Miller, the Assembly Speaker and Brooklyn Democrat. ''It violates all the taboos. It proposes to raise taxes, and in return, it isn't going to give you very much. But I don't think he had any options.''
 
'Tell Them the Truth'
Mr. Cuomo, who is expected to run for a third term in November, said today that he was not concerned about abandoning the conventional wisdom on election-year budgets. Indeed, he insisted, political considerations played no part in his budget plans.
''A lot of us politicians have it all wrong,'' he said, adding that voters ''don't want you to tell them everything is going to be wonderful even if it's not.''
''I think the best thing you can do is tell them the truth,'' he said.
But despite Mr. Cuomo's protestations, his budget reveals a political motive: To avoid the kind of criticism he encountered last year when he proposed a budget that retained the income-tax cut, but at the expense, many of his traditional liberal supporters said, of the state's poorest residents.
''Last year what happened is he really left his base, or his perceived base - the unions, the day-care advocates, the affordable-housing advocates,'' Mr. Miller said. ''One year you can walk away from your constituency. But you can't do that again.'' Little Obvious Impact for Some Mr. Miller, a vocal critic of Mr. Cuomo's budget last year, has voiced reserved support for his proposal this year.
A close look at the budget proposal also shows why, despite immediate denunciations, it might encounter less criticism than might seem likely.
On the revenue side, while the budget calls for $800 million in new taxes and fees, most of those levies would have little obvious impact on the average New Yorker. One new fee, for example, would raise the cost of vanity license plates to $25, from $15. Another would impose a new $15 charge on applying for a pistol permit. A third would impose a 2 percent tax on ''S corporations,'' which pay personal income taxes rather than corporate taxes.
One of the few tax changes the Governor has proposed that will affect virtually every taxpayer is the suspension of the income-tax cut. That proposal is likely to be the focus of protracted protest this spring.
 
'Austerity' at 9.3 Percent
But even the suspension of the income-tax cut is not the kind of issue that necessarily seizes voters' imaginations. As Mr. Cuomo noted rather insistently, he is not proposing to raise taxes, just not to lower them. And as Mr. Cuomo also likes to note, many taxpayers do not even know the state's current income-tax rate.
On the expenditure side, the Governor's budget, while lean, is hardly spartan. Many programs received no increase over inflation, and many others suffered cuts. But the budget still contains big spending increases for prison construction, for foster care, for Medicaid and for drug treatment. It eliminates no major programs and calls for few layoffs. And while by one measure it increases spending by only 4.5 percent, by another equally acceptable measure it raises expenditures by a substantial 9.3 percent.
''To me the most perplexing thing is that the budget is up 9.3 percent and everyone is calling it austerity,'' one Republican legislative official said.
A sign that the budget is indeed an election-year proposal is its heavy reliance on nonrecurring, or one-shot, revenues, like reserve funds. The Cuomo administration has acknowledged its reliance on almost $1 billion in one shots, but many financial analysts suspect that tucked in the 800-page budget book are many million dollars more.
 
'A Lot of Question Marks'
''There are a lot of question marks in this budget,'' said Hyman Grossman, a managing director of Standard & Poor's. ''One of them is how many of these so-called one shots they can afford.''
Although somber, Mr. Cuomo's revenue estimates also reveal what some analysts say is a degree of optimism explicable only as an election-year gamble.
''This is a time that projections should be based only on the most conservative estimates,'' said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group. ''But that's not what's being used. Because if it were, you would have to spend less money or raise more taxes. And then someone would have to lose.''

HEADLINE: Negotiators for Owners and Players Ready to Zero In on Numbers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
In 1981, the players struck the baseball season in June. In 1985, the players struck in August. In 1990, the owners are prepared to stage a pre-emptive strike of their own.
Only a month away from the scheduled start of spring training, labor negotiators for the owners and the players resumed bargaining yesterday in Manhattan for a new basic agreement. The session centered on noncritical nonsalary issues. 
At their meeting today, the negotiators are scheduled to return to the most critical issue, the one that is expected to determine whether camps will open as scheduled on Feb. 16. The issue is the owners' proposed revenue-sharing plan with its accompanying pay-for-performance salary scale for players in their first six years in the major leagues and a payroll cap that could affect the signing of free agents.
 
Batting for Dollars
Under pay-for-performance, a player would be paid according to his years of service on a statistics-based pay scale. Although no details are known, it would mean a player who hit .250 would be paid a certain amount and one who hit .260 would be paid a certain amount more.
If the players do not indicate a willingness to accept some form of the owners' proposal, the owners will very likely learn at a meeting Feb. 9 that they will not be opening spring camps.
It could be that simple because the owners have planned for a possible lockout for more than a year. Last week the owners were told not to proceed with plans for spring training pending instructions from the Player Relations Committee. They appear to favor the lockout strategy because this time they want to have their finger on the trigger.
''In August 1985,'' Charles O'Connor, the owners' chief negotiator, said, alluding to the last strike, ''the players had 85 percent of their pay, but the clubs didn't have 80 percent of their television money.''
In other words, if these talks are to produce a work stoppage, the owners prefer that they be the ones who say when the work stops, or doesn't start.
 
Delay Not Unlikely
Certainly, enough time remains before Feb. 16 to produce an agreement of some sort. The players, though, don't seem prepared to accept pay-for-performance, and the owners seem reluctant to open camps without such acceptance. Thus, barring a change of thinking on either side, a delay seems to be a very possible development.
The two sides have not progressed very far into their negotiations. The owners' labor representatives have talked about their revolutionary - for baseball - revenue-sharing concept since last July, but only last Wednesday did they move it across the table in the form of a proposal.
The owners offered to give the players 48 percent of what they estimate is approximately 80 percent of their revenue, the part that comes from ticket sales and national and local broadcasting income. The 48 percent share would pay for players' salaries, guaranteed pay owed released players and the players' benefits plan. The players have studied the proposal for the last week and will ask questions and seek additional information today.
In 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, the costs the owners are talking about covering with their proposed fixed percentage totaled approximately $402 million. A 48 percent share of the 80 percent pool the owners would draw on would have come to $411 million. But the players have noted that 1988 player payroll costs were depressed by the owners' collusion against free agents. Based on pre-collusion percentages, those costs could have amounted to about $477 million.
The players are not opposed philosophically to revenue sharing - a practice begun in the National Basketball Association, where the players get 53 percent of the revenue - but they have shown no great hunger for pay-for-performance or any type of payroll cap.
The owners, for their part, have no desire to share their revenue without gaining the other elements inherent in their proposal or some alternative that would meet their desire to know in advance what their player costs will be.
Why do the owners want to change the system? The players say the owners have not explained why they see a need for a change. The method of dollar distribution to the players has nothing to do with revenue sharing, Donald Fehr, the union chief, said. Revenue, the players say, flows to the clubs in great abundance, particularly the nearly $1.5 billion baseball will receive in national television revenue the next four years.
 
Owners Don't Like Surprises
The owners, however, want to create what they call cost certainty. They don't like the kind of surprises arbitrators spring in salary arbitration. They don't like the George Steinbrenners and the Gene Autrys, fellow owners though they may be, lavishing $2 million or $3 million a year on a player to whom no one else will give more than $1 million.
Pay-for-performance would eliminate salary arbitration, multiyear contracts, guaranteed salaries, the maximum-salary-cut rule and agents for two-thirds of the players. The owners especially detest salary arbitration and agents.
When players reach the six-year level under the owners' proposal, they could become free agents and be signed by any team to any salary the team could afford under the payroll cap. Such caps would prevent the Steinbrenners and the Autrys from signing other teams' free agents if they had already exceeded the maximum payroll level. The clubs have not defined that level.
But the players are certain to resist any plan that would put a ceiling on what they can earn. The players are not without their own bargaining goals. They are concerned about roster problems, the clubs' economic treatment of younger players and collusion.
They want clubs to return to 25-man rosters during the season (clubs have carried 24 players the last few years) and they want a player to be able to become a free agent if he is removed from a club's 40-man roster and sent to the minor leagues.
They want the minimum salary raised from $68,000 to somewhere between $100,000 and $125,000, though closer to the higher level, and they seek to lower the major league service time required for salary arbitration.
They want a collusion-proof agreement, assuring that clubs will not repeat the free-agent practices for which arbitrators found them guilty.
The players also want improvements in the pension and benefits plan, citing the increase in revenue from the national television package.

Black Images of the Past: Servile, Subhuman

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12

 BODY:
''Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940'' is an exhibition that no thinking person can walk through without feeling a measure of both sorrow and anger. The 100 or so paintings, sculptures and drawings gathered at the Corcoran Gallery of Art testify to a racism so ingrained in the American consciousness that artists - the overwhelming number of whom were white, but some of whom were black - thought nothing about stereotyping blacks as ''grotesque buffoons, servile menials, comic entertainers or threatening subhumans,'' writes Guy C. McElroy, the show's curator, in the exhibition catalogue.
It is the casualness of the cruelty that leaves the deepest impression on a viewer. Sometimes the methods of expression are sophisticated, the prejudices subtly masked. Yet to see in the context of this exhibition Thomas Eakins's depiction of a hunter and his guide, ''Will Schuster and Blackman Going Shooting,'' is to be reminded that the artist has evoked not simply a life of leisure but another kind of life entirely. 
The nameless, barefooted black man who steers Schuster's boat may be more sympathetically portrayed by Eakins than most of the blacks painted by American artists in the 19th century. Nonetheless, Eakins was inescapably a man of his time, and he took for granted the social and economic gulf that separated whites from blacks.
The image of Schuster and his guide is not the only well-known painting that Mr. McElroy has managed to cast in an unfamiliar light. Whatever may be the allegory behind John Singleton Copley's famous ''Watson and the Shark,'' it is hereafter impossible to overlook the central role given to the standing figure of a black man holding a rope.
''Facing History,'' in other words, puts before the viewer a variety of images that have been either ignored by art historians or thought about largely in terms other than race, and it insists that these works be reconsidered. Exhibitions have in the past dealt with portrayals of blacks in 19th-century American popular prints and cartoons. Mr. McElroy's show is the first to survey paintings and sculptures, and to underscore the fact that so-called high art was by no means above expressing the lowest of society's inclinations.
All of which is not to say, however, that ''Facing History'' can be counted a success. There are too many questions that Mr. McElroy leaves unanswered, many points that probably did not need making in the first place, and others that needed to be made far more forcefully.
For every work by Copley and Eakins and Homer that the curator has assembled, there are a dozen minor paintings by forgotten artists whose racism comes as no revelation. It is depressing to learn that the painter of ''Uncle Tom and Little Eva'' was Robert Scott Duncanson, a black artist. But to discover that a white painter named Charles Deas depicted blacks in the 1830's as either cowering weaklings or monstrous creatures, or that a work from the same period attributed to a white artist called Charles Winter represents a minstrel show in which blacks are made to seem like animals, is really to learn nothing unexpected.
Arguing, as Mr. McElroy apparently does, that better artists, like Copley, Homer and William Sidney Mount, relied less on crude caricature and predictable formulas than a Deas or a Winter is only another way of claiming that Mount and Homer and Copley were better painters. That is to say, ''Facing History'' mostly tells us what we already knew, or at least what we suspected.
What it does not tell us - and what presumably should be of fundamental importance to a social art historian like Mr. McElroy - is about patronage and provenance. Who bought these paintings? Where did they hang? What, if anything, was written about them? ''Facing History'' obviously has as one of its underlying themes the notion that these paintings and sculptures should be thought about not simply in esthetic terms but also on political and economic grounds. Yet viewers are often left uninformed about the financial history of these works.
That is not always the case. Among the most interesting paintings in the exhibition are the two or three commissioned by middle-class black families and black politicians, and one very moving silhouette of a slave from 1796. A portrait of a black man by Joshua Johnson, the first black artist to achieve prominence in America, is one of the few unqualifiedly dignified images in the show, as is the staid but respectful portrait of William Whipper by William Matthew Prior, an early 19th-century painter and writer on behalf of abolitionist causes.
The silhouette of Flora, a slave, accompanied her bill of sale in 1796 in Connecticut, and while never intended as a work of art, it has a poignance that is nowhere else to be found in this exhibition. There could be no better metaphor for the attitude of whites toward blacks than this spectral profile of Flora's head made by tracing her shadow.
But it would have been useful to know as much about other works in this exhibition. And it would have been very good to see more of the popular images on which these paintings were, directly and indirectly, based. Seeing in some depth how painters and sculptors transformed the banalities of printmakers and cartoonists would arguably have been a more valuable contribution by Mr. McElroy than the overview of 230 years of artistic activity he provides.
When arriving at the 20th century, ''Facing History'' can give only the sketchiest outline of how blacks were portrayed in art before World War II. There are a few works by Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton and Reginald Marsh and a hint of what the Harlem Renaissance fostered, but these paintings almost seem to belong to another exhibition, so different are they in tone and subject from most of the other images in the show.
The catalogue reproduces several prints and cartoons that are not displayed on the walls, and it includes an essay by Henry Louis Gates Jr. that focuses largely on the portrayal of blacks in American literature.
Works in the exhibition were borrowed from several dozen public and private collections. One university declined to lend a painting to the show, contending there was no value in displaying derogatory images of blacks. Given the uproar it provoked last year after canceling an exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, the museum is obviously cautious about displaying any works that can be considered inflammatory. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Corcoran has included an unusual number of lengthy wall texts, many of which condemn in the clearest possible terms the racist nature of the paintings and sculptures.
''Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940,'' which is at the Corcoran Gallery of Art through March 25, will be on view at the Brooklyn Museum from April 20 to June 25.

ECONOMY
 
U.S. oil production suffered its biggest single-year decline in 1989, falling by more than half a million barrels a day, the American Petroleum Institute reported. Imports surged to make up for the drop in domestic oil production. As a result, the nation's dependence on imported oil rose to a near-record 46 percent of demand, the highest level in more than a decade. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened in November

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit grew in November to $10.5 billion, the biggest monthly gap of 1989, the Commerce Department reported today.
Imports declined, but so did exports, and the trade imbalance worsened for the second straight month.
Although a strike at the Boeing Company, one of the biggest American exporters, accounted for nearly $1 billion of the November deficit, many analysts considered the results somewhat disappointing both for now and in the near future. Combined with other economic data, it appears that imported goods are beginning to pile up in inventories, while sales of American goods abroad are no higher than they were last spring. 
''Exports just are not going anywhere,'' said Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at the Continental Bank in Chicago.
 
Deficit 2.4% Larger
The trade deficit, the difference between imports and exports, was 2.4 percent higher in November than in October.
At $30.2 billion, exports were $800 million below the October level, and non-Government analysts said they took little comfort in the fact that November's trade decline could be largely attributed to the Boeing strike. The 45-day strike by 58,000 Boeing machinists, which ended Nov. 21, shut down production of commercial aircraft. Normal production has since resumed.
Imports during November totaled $40.7 billion, down $600 million from October, but still the second biggest level on record.
The nation's bill for imported oil remained at $4.4 billion. In both October and November, imported oil accounted for about 42 percent of the deficit in merchandise trade.
 
Oil Imports Fall Slightly
Volumes of imported oil decreased slightly in November, but that was offset in value by a 24-cent-a-barrel rise, to $17.33, in the average price.
Separately, the American Petroleum Institute today announced a 500,000 barrel-a-day drop in domestic oil production for 1989, the biggest one-year decline on record. This suggests the United States will have to spend increasingly more for imported oil.
The decline in exports in November is particularly worrisome to many economists because surging exports were a main force driving the general American economy during 1987 and 1988.
But the Government also reported today that industrial production rose four-tenths of 1 percent in December, prompting little consensus among economists on what the two figures together implied for the 1990 economy.
Mr. Peterson said that despite the decline in exports, he had ''less and less concern about recession,'' but Stuart G. Hoffman of the PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh said he saw ''more signs of weakness than strength.''
Another Pittsburgh analyst, Norman Robertson of the Mellon Bank, said the trend in trade had turned unfavorable, contributing to a ''sputtering'' economy.
 
Fewer Japanese Cars Bought
Today's report also showed a sharp decline in the American trade deficit with Japan, which had jumped nearly 20 percent in October. In November, it fell 18 percent, to $4 billion, from $4.9 billion. Contributing to that decline, imports of Japanese cars fell to $1.6 billion, from $1.9 billion in November, apparently reflecting the broad weakness in the United States car demand.
There was an even sharper drop in the United States deficit with the newly industrialized countries of the Far East. The combined deficit with Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore fell 25 percent, to $2.1 billion from $2.8 billion, with each showing a smaller surplus. The surpluses have been a source of trade friction with the United States.
Analysts cautioned, however, that these country figures are subject to wide month-to-month swings and that they are also not adjusted for seasonal variation.
At the same time, the American deficit widened by about $100 million each with West Germany, France and Britain and by about $400 million with Canada, the United States' biggest trading partner.
For the first 11 months of 1989, the trade deficit eased by $6 billion, to $101.7 billion, compared with the corresponding period in 1988, a result that Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called fundamentally ''in line with our expectations of continued moderate improvement'' in 1990.
 
Exports Tapering Off
But exports have tapered off since early in the year, while imports have leaped to record levels. Even had there been no Boeing strike, November exports would have been less than in June, analysts said.
Over all, the November export change reflected a $1 billion decline in capital goods, like electrical machinery, sent overseas by United States companies and a $200 million decline in industrial supplies. There were small increases in exports of consumer goods, foods and other merchandise.
In imports, the value of industrial supplies brought into this country fell $800 million, while capital goods climbed $500 million.
For manufactured goods alone, which include plastics, furniture and motorcycle parts and is a category that is not adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations, exports fell $1.9 billion, to $22.5 billion, while imports fell $2.2 billion, to $32.8 billion, from October levels, the report showed. In agriculture, exports rose $300 million, while imports were about unchanged, to produce a trading surplus of $1.8 billion.
In today's report, the $10.2 billion deficit initially reported for October, previously the highest of 1989, was revised upward, by about $50 million. Imports, which were at a record level, rose slightly to $41.3 billion, and exports also were revised higher.

HEADLINE: Conrail Sets $1.3 Billion Buyback

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
For months, takeover talk has been driving up the stock price of the Consolidated Rail Corporation. Yesterday, the railroad company, known as Conrail, moved to defend itself by announcing plans to spend about $1.3 billion to buy back more than a third of its outstanding shares.
The plan was announced after trading closed yesterday. Conrail's stock finished at $46.125, off 37.5 cents a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Conrail said it was offering to buy 21 million, or 30 percent, of its 67.1 million outstanding common shares for no more than $53 a share, but no less than $43. 
The offer, valued at about $1 billion, will begin today and expire at midnight on Feb. 14. The company also said it would establish an employee stock ownership plan worth $300 million.
 
Became Public in 1987
Conrail evolved from six bankrupt Northeastern railroads that had been taken over by the Government in 1976. About $3.3 billion was pumped in to modernize the tracks, locomotives, freight cars and other equipment. The company was sold to the public in 1987.
Although Conrail, which carries only freight, has had some problems recently as traffic has declined, the Philadelphia-based company has been profitable since becoming public. Some investors think the company's stock price does not reflect the true value of Conrail's assets and earning potential. Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, the railroad analyst for the First Boston Corporation, valued the company at about $60 a share.
When Conrail was sold to the public, one provision prohibited any investor from accumulating more than 10 percent of its stock. But that provision is due to expire on April 2.
As a result, the carrier's stock has experienced a lot of activity. ''They have been vulnerable,'' Ms. Lidgerwood said.
She said the company had more than $600 million in cash and could generate substantial amounts of money, so a raider could use its assets to help finance a takeover.
Ms. Lidgerwood said she expected the company to use much of its cash on the offer announced yesterday and then increase its debt to raise the rest of the money, making it much less attractive as a takeover candidate.
James A. Hagen, Conrail's president and chief executive, said the stock buyback ''represents an attractive investment for the company, provides all shareholders with the opportunity to receive a significant immediate cash payment for at least a portion of their shares, and provides flexibility for both those shareholders seeking to continue as shareholders and those who wish to sell all or a portion of their shares.''
The railroad is largely the creation of L. Stanley Crane, who took over Conrail in 1981 shortly after retiring as chairman of the Southern Railway Company. He worked to to wean Conrail from Government support.
Mr. Crane, who retired early last year, cut staff, phased out unprofitable routes and brought in the modern technology to help run Conrail efficiently.
By the time the company was sold to the public, it was profitable.
 
Feeling the Pinch
But this year Conrail, which serves mostly the Northeast, began to feel the economic downturn in the region.
Mr. Hagen has moved to cut costs, cutting hundreds of jobs, combining trains and consolidating operations.
As a result, Conrail took a special charge in the fourth quarter of last year, and reported a loss of $81 million, compared with earnings of $78 million, or $1.13 a share, in the corresponding period in 1988.
For the year, the carrier reported earnings of $148 million, or $2.17 a share, down by 51 percent from $306 million, or $4.44 a share, in 1988. Its revenues for 1989 totaled $3.41 billion, down by 2.2 percent from $3.49 billion in 1988.
Conrail has 13,100 miles of track concentrated in the Northeast but also also runs to such points as Chicago, Charleston, W.Va., and Hagerstown, Md.
The railroad's work force numbers about 13,000. Conrail has 2,340 locomotives and 75,500 rail cars.

HEADLINE: Japan Foreign-Aid Program May Finance U.S. Projects

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The Government-owned Export-Import Bank of Japan, whose principal mission is to help heavily indebted third world countries build their economies with low-interest loans, is contemplating its first loans to an industrialized country: the United States.
The Governors of three Southern states - Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi - raised the idea with Japanese officials a little more than a year ago, and the bank is now giving serious consideration to providing what could be billions of dollars of subsidized loans to underdeveloped regions in several states, said a bank official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. Bank officials have also met with representatives from New York and California. 
The loans would probably be used for projects like roads, ports or other developments that would aid economic growth, the official said, confirming a report in the Japanese press.
So far, the bank officials have looked at dozens of potential projects, with a total estimated value of more than $3 billion. Most proposals involve industrial parks, with the bank lending money for the buildings, roads and supporting services. The completed projects, the bank official said, could then be used by the states to attract Japanese companies that want to set up manufacturing operations in the United States.
The Japanese official said the idea was born in September 1988, when the three Governors visited Japan and asked for help in financing projects that neither their states nor the Federal Government could afford.
The bank official said the loans would be so-called untied loans, that is, the recipient would not be required to use Japanese contractors or Japanese companies to build the projects or provide services.
Europe is also being considered for such loans, the officials said.
 
Recycling the Wealth
The proposal, which is being hotly debated in Japanese Government circles and is still far from approval, is another reflection of the growing wealth of Japan and its need to find new ways to recycle its financial surpluses abroad now that Japanese companies no longer need help. The proposal also underscores how far some American states are going in their search for financing.
The Export-Import Bank was founded in the early 1950's to subsidize Japanese industrial exports. But most Japanese companies no longer need Government help, and the bank began its recycling program in 1986. Japan has promised to recycle $65 billion, mostly to countries like Colombia, Mexico and Indonesia.
The Japanese bank's proposed low-cost loans to American states are viewed by some Tokyo officials as a way to help ease anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States and halt growing protectionist pressures in Congress. Yet the loans, if they go through, might produce a backlash of resentment in the United States from people already worried about the amount of Japanese money coming into the nation.
''I think that the loans would be perceived as about 60 or 70 percent positive and maybe 30 or 40 percent negative'' in the United States, the official said.
The official acknowledged that the proposal had met criticism from some in the Japanese Government. One criticism is that the Government has no business providing subsidies for one of the world's wealthiest nations. Others in the Parliament and the Ministry of Finance have said that a Government-owned institution should not be involved if such loans could be provided by the private sector, particularly Japanese banks.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
East Germany As Capitalist

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
A EUROPEAN manufacturer of printing presses and auxiliary equipment was unhappy with the performance of its American sales and service agent. So it decided to buy the distributor to gain direct control of its operations in the United States.
That would be a standard enough transaction, except for the nature of the acquiring company, a state-owned monopoly from a Communist country, East Germany. Nevertheless, Polygraph Export-Import of Leipzig took control of Royal Zenith Inc. of Great Neck, L.I., last week and renamed it Planeta North America Inc. 
According to the Commerce Department, this was the first acquisition of an American company by an East German enterprise.
Polygraph is the sole exporter and importer of graphic arts equipment in East Germany. American lawyers say it is somewhere between a holding company and a sales agent in structure, an unknown entity in the West. This unusual structure, along with doubts about the creditworthiness of East German institutions, the fall of the Berlin wall and the political upheaval in Eastern Europe all complicated the deal. But they did not block it.
Polygraph sells the output of five East German factories, the largest of which is Planeta, a $50 million producer of sheet-fed offset printing machines. Planeta's presses, which are often used to print designs and instructions on cardboard cartons, have been sold in Western countries for more than 30 years and are among East Germany's most successful exports, said Alan Malachuk, the president of Plantea North America. For most of the postwar period, Polygraph was represented in the United States by Royal Zenith, which was owned by the Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corporation, a privately held holding company. But, Mr. Malachuk said, ''the relationship between the supplier and management had broken down.''
Talks about acquiring Royal Zenith began early last year, and quickly encountered complications. For example, there is no tax treaty between the United States and East Germany, and most Western banks have no experience in evaluating the credit of quasi-government organizations in the East bloc. Eventually, the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank of West Germany put up $25 million toward the undisclosed purchase price.
Hans Freidl, head of the bank's international department, said it had advanced the funds because it was accustomed to lending in East Germany and because of Polygraph's success as an exporter. ''We have a half-billion-mark exposure in East Germany,'' he said. ''We concluded that $25 million here is a reasonable risk.'' A key factor, he added, was that part of the credit was guaranteed by East Germany's foreign trade bank.
Robert B. Robbins, a partner in the Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, which advised Polygraph, commented: ''We originally tried to get credit based on the transaction alone, but it would have been very expensive. With the export bank taking on responsibility, we were able to get credit on terms that would be extended to a very creditworthy borrower.''
A West German engineering concern, C. Illies & Company, and Mr. Malachuk were minority investors in the transaction, participants said.
Thomas Schneider, the president of Polygraph, sounded like a Western businessman when he said the acquisition had been made because Polygraph ''needs opportunities to grow profit-wise.''
''My colleagues at home are watching this project,'' he said. ''If it is successful, they will want to imitate it.''
The political turmoil in East Germany threatened to stall the talks, since Polygraph is an arm of the Government, participants said. ''It was hard to know the chain of authority that would have to approve the transaction and the financing,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''The people involved wondered from day to day what their position would be.''
Nevertheless, both East and West German officials said they expected economic links between the East and West to grow rapidly. Heino Ackert, an East German lawyer and consultant who was a participant in the Polygraph deal, noted that East Germany had recently changed its joint venture law to allow direct foreign investments.
Mr. Freidl said that East Germany was currently considered the best credit risk in the East and could be expected to flourish as central planning was loosened. ''We will support American and West Germany investments in East Germany,'' he said.

First Interstate Sets Changes at the Top

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

 BODY:
First Interstate Bancorp said yesterday that Edward M. Carson, its president, would become chairman and chief executive. He will assume the position on June 1, after the retirement at age 65 of Joseph J. Pinola, who has led the Los Angeles-based banking company for 12 years.
The company said William B. Siart would succeed Mr. Carson as president of the parent company and would retain his posts as chairman and chief executive of the First Interstate Bank of California, the company's largest operating unit. 
Analysts said the appointment of the 60-year-old Mr. Carson to the top posts was not surprising, although there had been some speculation that First Interstate's board might bypass a generation of management and select Mr. Siart, who is 43.
Mr. Pinola, who is perhaps best known for his unsuccessful attempt to acquire the much-larger BankAmerica Corporation three years ago, is stepping down at a time when strong performances by most units of the company are being overshadowed by troubles in its Texas and Arizona subsidiaries.
The devastation of the real estate markets in those states has forced the First Interstate Bank of Texas and the First Interstate Bank of Arizona to establish large reserves for loan losses, causing losses for the company and dragging down its stock. The company reported a loss for the third quarter of 1989 of $15.5 million, compared with a loss of $214.4 million in the third quarter of 1988. The company is also expected to report a loss for the fourth quarter.
When he engineered the company's entry into Texas two years ago with the acquisition of Allied Bancshares of Houston, Mr. Pinola was gambling that the state's oil-based economy would rebound and that the real estate problems could be kept under control.
Mr. Pinola said in an interview that the company had tried ''to put the known problems in Texas behind us'' by taking the loss reserves, but acknowledged that shareholders had been angered by the problems there.
''All of whatever else we accomplished here is now being subordinated in large measure to that one problem,'' Mr. Pinola said, referring to the losses from Texas. ''I'm suffering for it, but I did it and I have to live with it.''
First Interstate has assets of $58 billion and operates 28 banks in 14 states, mostly in the West. The company also franchises its name in 11 other states.
Mr. Carson, who has been president of the parent company since 1985, came up through the ranks of the Arizona subsidiary, which he joined in 1951 after graduating from the University of Arizona. Analysts said he had a reputation as a methodical, low-key manager who had proved adept at cost-cutting.
''My expectation is that Ed will be more operationally focused than Joe was, and more internally focused,'' said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in San Francisco. ''They have an excellent franchise, but it continues to underperform.''
Mr. Siart is given credit by analysts for improving the performance of First Interstate Bank of California in a highly competitive market. He received a degree in finance from the University of Santa Clara and an M.B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley. He joined First Interstate in 1978 after spending nine years at the Bank of America.

Ford Strike Vote

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Union leaders rejected a two-year pay offer from the Ford Motor Company Ltd. and called a strike vote for next week. Ford's latest offer was a 10.2 percent pay increase in the first year and a choice between 8 percent, or the inflation rate plus 2.5 percent in the second year. It was rejected during talks at the company's London offices. If the union votes Tuesday to reject the proposal, union members will begin an all-out strike beginning with the final shift Jan. 26, officials said. About 9,000 employees were already off the job today, some for a 24-hour strike and some continuing indefinite strikes begun Monday. Ford said it had responded by laying off more than 10,500 employees. It employs 32,000 workers at 22 British plants. Levi Strauss Closing Plant DALLAS, Jan. 17 - Levi Strauss & Company said today that it would close one of three sewing plants in San Antonio in April and lay off 1,100 workers. 
The large privately held maker of jeans and casual clothing said it had decided to use less expensive contract labor in the Caribbean trade zone for the production of the men's slacks made at the South Zarzamora Street plant in San Antonio.
Levi Strauss said in a statement that competitive forces in the industry had dictated the closing of the plant, which the company had owned since 1981.
The Dockers brand pants that were made at the plant are one of the company's most successful new products. Sales have grown to an estimated $400 million since the product was introduced in 1985, a company spokeswoman, Sydney Kapchan, said.
The company said it had made an effort to maintain its production in the United States.
 
''More than 90 percent of
Levi jeans and more than 75 percent of all Levi's products sold in the United States are still made in the United States.'' said Peter L. Thigpen, senior vice president of operations for Levi.

HEADLINE: Production Climbed 0.4% In December

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production rose a strong four-tenths of a percent in December, bolstered by abnormally cold weather and the end of a strike at the Boeing Company, the Federal Reserve Board reported today.
In another report, the Fed said the operating rate at factories, mines and utilities rose two-tenths of a percentage point in December, to 83.3 percent, reflecting the increase in the production rate. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels. 
Analysts said the outlook for the near future was for slow growth in industrial output, but with enough strength to enable the economy to avoid a recession in the early part of this year.
 
Flirting With Recession
''The U.S. economy continues to flirt with some sort of a recession, but it is not quite there in the industrial production data,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company The Fed said the December increase in industrial output followed a gain of three-tenths of a percent in November after declines of four-tenths of a percent in October and one-tenth in September.
Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc., a Washington forecasting concern, noted that the initial reports on production in September, October and November each had been revised upward by two-tenths of a percent.
''It changes the whole fabric of the industrial production report,'' Mr. Evans said. ''Instead of having a decline, it was flat. That doesn't signal a recession.''
 
Some Special Factors
Record cold weather over much of the nation lifted utility output by 6.3 percent in November, while the settlement of the Boeing strike late in the month returned production there to normal the following month.
''If you discount Boeing and the cold weather, industrial production basically was flat, and that's the way it's been the past few months,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group, a forecasting organization, based in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Much of the December rise in the operating rate was attributed to the cold weather, which caused ''a surge of five percentage points in the operating rate for utilities, which was the largest in the 23-year history of this series,'' the Fed said. The increase placed the utility rate at the 86.3 percent level.
''Elsewhere, utilization in manufacturing edged down one-tenth of a percentage point, while the rate for mining fell nearly a percentage point,'' the Fed said.
 
No Growth in Industry
Factory use had remained unchanged at 83.1 percent from October to November. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent in December 1988 and January 1989.
The operating report is watched as a barometer of future inflation. The closer the nation's industry gets to full operating capacity, the greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases.
Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
The output report continued to reflect softness in the manufacturing sector, which rose a weak two-tenths of a percent in December.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Profit Falls 24.7%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Hurt by the slowdown in the nation's industrial economy, the Aluminum Company of America said today that its fourth-quarter earnings fell 24.7 percent, and the report sent its stock tumbling.
Pittsburgh-based Alcoa, North America's biggest aluminum producer, said fourth-quarter profits fell to $164.7 million, or $1.88 a share, from $218.7 million, or $2.47 a share, in the 1988 period. Revenues rose 1.5 percent, to $2.69 billion from $2.65 billion.
Disappointment with the report sent Alcoa's shares skidding $5.875, to $66.875, on the New York Stock Exchange, where the stock's decline of 8.1 percent was the seventh largest today.
Despite the fourth-quarter weakness, Alcoa's full-year earnings were up 9.7 percent, rising to a record $944.9 million, or $10.67 a share, from $861.4 million, or $9.74 a share, in 1988, the previous record year. Full-year sales rose 11.3 percent, to $10.91 billion, from $9.8 billion in 1988.
The Reynolds Metals Company, the continent's third-largest aluminum producer, reported today that its fourth-quarter profit fell 4.4 percent, to $133.8 million, or $2.26 a share, from $139.9 million, or $2.61 a share. Revenues rose 4.7 percent, to $1.54 billion from $1.46 billion.
For the year, Reynolds's earnings rose 10.5 percent, to a record $532.7 million, or $9.20 a share, from the prior record of $482.0 million, or $9.01 a share, in 1988. Revenues grew 11 percent, to $6.21 billion.
Reynolds shares lost $1.75, to $52.50, today on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Meeting Narrows Gap Between U.S. and Japan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Shintaro Ishihara, the Japanese economic nationalist who argues that the resentment in a declining America of his country's growing economic success is largely rooted in racism, crossed swords here today with a Congressman from Detroit.
But Mr. Ishihara, a former cabinet minister and author of a briskly selling book, ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' and the lawmaker, Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has been one of the leading critics of Japan on Capitol Hill, did agree on their diagnosis of some of the ills of both countries.
For example, they concluded - at what both said was an amicable lunch - that the United States had to strengthen its industrial base and become more export-oriented and that Japan should become more consumer and import-oriented and play a more active role internationally. 
 
Political Ambitions
They met privately and later provided reporters with an account of the meeting. Mr. Ishihara, who hopes to be Prime Minister of Japan, is here to meet fellow politicians and also seek publicity for a future English-language version of his book.
The principal point of difference, Representative Levin said, related to Mr. Ishihara's charges about American racism.
''I told him that his comments about American racial superiority were very much misunderstood,'' he said, ''that my constituents were motivated by the imbalance that exists in trade and what that means for jobs.''
In his book, which has sold more than 500,000 copies in Japan, Mr. Ishihara contends that Americans are proud that ''whites, including Americans, have built the modern era,'' but wonders whether ''historical pride has gone to the length of inerasable arrogance.''
''Right now,'' he adds, ''the modern civilization built by whites is coming close to a period of practical end, and I feel that is adding to the irritation of Americans as the postwar representative of whites.''
 
Morita Is Co-author
Listed as co-author is Akio Morita, chairman of the Sony Corporation, who wrote less controversial parts of the book. Although the book has not yet been published in the United States, an unauthorized English version has been distributed here and entered into The Congressional Record.
Mr. Ishihara also argued at the meeting today that the American work ethic and technological performance had declined markedly and that this, more than Japanese protectionism, was why his countrymen were reluctant to buy anything American.
But Mr. Levin responded by saying, ''There are good American auto parts,'' adding that the Japanese are not even ''buying American spark plugs, and we make good spark plugs.''

Dollar Ends the Day Mixed After Trade Deficit Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed yesterday as an unexpected widening of the nation's trade deficit had an unsettling effect on foreign-exchange trading.
Gold prices rose in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, gold rose by $1.70 an ounce, to $412.50. 
Foreign-exchange dealers said investors were concerned because the poor trade performance in November partly resulted from a drop in exports. Some analysts said the decline indicated a further slowing of the American economy.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit grew in November to $10.5 billion, its worst showing in 11 months. Imports declined by $593 million, to $40.69 billion, and exports dropped $843 million, to $30.19 billion.
The Government attributed about $1 billion of the increase to a strike at the Boeing Company in Seattle, which severely cut into exports of expensive commercial airliners. But private economists still expressed disappointment with the figure.
Ronald Holzer, the chief foreign-exchange dealer with the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said any possible upward moves by the dollar were being limited by traders' skeptical view of the economy.
Although the trade news pushed the dollar lower against some currencies, the exchange traders largely focused on the West German mark and other currencies, Mr. Holzer said.
The dealers overseas said continuing tensions in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe gave the dollar some underlying support.
In New York, the dollar rose to 145.40 yen, from 145.30 yen late on Tuesday. The dollar also rose against the British pound, which was quoted at $1.65235, down from $1.6585 late on Tuesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.6873 West German marks, down from 1.6950; 1.5055 Swiss francs, down from 1.5116; 5.7325 French francs, down from 5.7630; 1,256.50 Italian lire, down from 1,262.25, and 1.16515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16375.
On the Commodity Exchange, silver rose 2.6 cents an ounce to close at $5.256.

HEADLINE: Moynihan's Right, but. . .

BYLINE: By Henry J. Aaron and Charles L. Schultze; Henry J. Aaron and Charles L. Schultze are senior fellows at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan recently advanced a proposal to reduce Social Security payroll taxes by $55 billion in 1991 and corresponding amounts in later years, thereby moving the Social Security system closer to pay-as-you-go financing. Such a change of policy, however, would damage the economy. Congress should reject this proposal. 
Senator Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has raised a serious issue - the fact that large additions to Social Security reserves, financed by the payroll tax, are now masking the true size of the Federal budget deficit. He is justifiably angry that a regressive tax on wages is being used increasingly to pay for ordinary operations of the Government.
Such a tax is defensible if the additions to Social Security reserves are used to increase national saving and productive capacity, thereby helping future generations shoulder the costs of providing retirement benefits for the growing number of retirees.
But the Government is not using the proceeds of the payroll tax that way. It is now borrowing the additions to Social Security reserves to pay for the current operations of the Government. Exclusive of Social Security, the Federal Government budget deficit is huge and is projected to rise in the future.
We can well understand Senator Moynihan's frustration with this budgetary hoax, and perhaps his proposal is merely a tactical device to focus the public's attention on this outrage. But if enacted, the proposal would do serious harm to the economy.
The immediate effect of the $55 billion cut in payroll taxes for 1991 that Senator Moynihan proposes would be to worsen the Federal deficit by an equivalent amount. To offset the potentially inflationary effects of an enlarged budget deficit, the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates, penalizing investment generally and long-term investments particularly. The higher budget deficit and increased interest rates would force the U.S. either to reduce investment at home or to increase borrowing from abroad. In either case, the already slow growth in American living standards would be further eroded. In short, cutting payroll taxes (or any other major tax cut) is the opposite of what is needed under current economic and budgetary conditions.
Although Senator Moynihan did not suggest it, the payroll tax cut could be made revenue neutral if it were linked to offsetting increases in income or excise taxes. Such a proposal would not add to the deficit. But it would wreck whatever chance now exists of successfully reducing the deficit through a compromise package of expenditure cuts and tax increases. If Congress were to use an income tax increase to offset the revenue loss from a payroll tax cut, it would become even harder than it now is to fashion a centrist political compromise that would combine spending cuts with income tax increases.
Simply cutting payroll taxes should be put off-limits because a payroll tax cut would worsen the budget deficit and thereby reduce still further the nation's already abysmally low saving rate. And combining such cuts with increases in other taxes is premature as long as any hope survives of fashioning a deficit reduction compromise. The best hope is that Senator Moynihan's proposal will provoke a review of the nation's currently absurd budgetary proposals. The worst fear is that it might actually be enacted.

HEADLINE: U.S. AGENTS ARREST WASHINGTON MAYOR ON DRUG CHARGES

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who over the past several years has repeatedly denied allegations that he used drugs, was arrested tonight at a downtown hotel on a narcotics charge by local and Federal law officers, the United States Attorney's office said.
The authorities would provide few details of the arrest other than to say that it was the result of an undercover operation and had occurred shortly after 8 P.M. on the seventh floor of the Vista International Hotel, a few blocks northeast of the White House.
One person in Federal law enforcement said the charge against Mr. Barry involved cocaine. But a statement about the arrest issued by the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia said only that a narcotics violation was involved.
 
No Comment From Mayor
About midnight, the 53-year-old Mayor was taken by van from the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to his home in Southeast Washington. He flashed a wan smile as he ducked through the gate leading to his front door and refused to answer the shouted questions of reporters. 
Mr. Barry, who had planned to announce his bid for re-election to a fourth term this weekend, is scheduled to be arraigned before a Federal magistrate on Friday.
Recent polls had indicated that Mr. Barry faced an uphill race, because of politically embarrassing factors like a grand jury investigation into accusations of cocaine use and a report in The Los Angeles Times in which he mocked the political aspirations of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a possible opponent for Mayor.
 
Drug Speech at a School
Most polls have shown that Mr. Jackson, who recently moved to Washington from Chicago, would decisively defeat Mr. Barry. The Mayor has been campaigning hard in recent weeks, making public appearances and trying to raise money.
Tonight's arrest came only hours after Mr. Barry had made an anti-drug speech at a local high school and only two days after he had boasted at a press conference that the city was winning its war on one of the worst drug epidemics in the country.
The United States Attorney's statement tonight said the F.B.I., working with the internal affairs division of the District of Columbia Police Department, had taken Mr. Barry into custody ''as part of an ongoing public corruption probe under the supervision of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.''
One law-enforcement official described the arrest as ''a very carefully planned operation.'' He said parts of it were secretly videotaped ''just to make sure it all sticks in court.''
Mr. Barry's arrest came a day before the scheduled sentencing of his longtime friend, Charles Lewis, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in Washington. Mr. Lewis, a native of the Virgin Islands, was conviced last year of drug dealing on St. Thomas.
Mr. Lewis said in open court last fall that he had provided cocaine to the Mayor on ''more than one occasion.''
Mr. Barry countered by calling Mr. Lewis a ''convicted felon'' and said, ''He'll say anything in court, trying to save his own hide.''
Mr. Barry was visiting Mr. Lewis's room in the Ramada Inn in Washington in December 1988 at the same time that city police officers were on their way to the room to investigate a report that Mr. Lewis was offering drugs for sale. When the officers found that Mr. Barry was present, they abandoned their mission in an episode that has not yet been fully explained.
The Ramada Inn is a block from the Vista International, where Mr. Barry was arrested tonight.
Although the Vista is a luxury hotel, it is in a troubled neighborhood that borders a high-crime area. Employees and guests were unaware the raid was taking place until it was over. ''We had no idea it was going to take place here,'' said Mark Phillips, a hotel manager.
The arrest sent a political shock wave through the city and its governmental hierarchy.
''It is a truly tragic time in our city,'' said Dave A. Clarke, the president of the City Council and a candidate for mayor.
Another member of the Council, Hilda Mason, said she was ''in shock'' and unable to immediately assess the impact of the arrest. ''I'm praying for the Mayor,'' she added.
The recent opinion polls were not the only bad news for the Mayor. In recent months some top aides, including Washington's health commissioner, prison chief and legal adviser, have resignd.
There have also been allegations, all denied, that the mayor used cocaine with Mr. Lewis while on a visit to the Virgin Islands a few years ago.
In the mid-1980's, there were allegations, again denied, that Mr. Barry had used drugs in the District with a woman. A Federal grand jury investigated those allegations at length but handed up no indictment.
Grand juries, reporters and political enemies have delved deeply into the life of Mr. Barry, who has chafed at running the city from behind a big desk and has preferred to visit its neighborhoods, often at night, shaking hands, exchanging quips and dropping in on bars and clubs to hear grievances.
And while the inquiries hurt the Mayor in the polls, until last night's arrest at the Vista International Hotel, no formal action had been taken against him.
 
Denied Earlier Allegations
As Mayor, Mr. Barry oversees a bureaucracy of 33,000 people and a budget of $2 billion in a city with a population of 650,000.
He was born into a family of sharecroppers in the rural community of Itta Bena, Miss. His mother worked as a domestic to support him and his seven younger sisters.
He graduated with a degree in chemistry from LeMoyne College in Memphis in 1958 and earned a master's degree at Fisk University in Nashville in 1960.
His involvement in the civil rights movement began while a sophomore at LeMoyne and continued at Fisk, where in 1960 he organized the first lunch counter sit-ins in Nashville. That same year he and other student leaders met with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., at Shaw College, in Raleigh, N.C. The students, along with Dr. King, established the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which made Atlanta its base and chose Mr. Barry as its first national chairman.
In January 1967, he resigned as head of S.N.C.C.'s Washington office, declaring that ''the civil rights direction of protest is dead.''
''Now we must concentrate on control - economic and political power,'' he said.
After designing a successful program to aid Washington's poor blacks, Youth Pride, Inc, he won election to the city's Board of Education and served two terms as its president, in 1972 and 1974.
 
Elected to City Council
After easily winning election to the City Council in 1974, he became a full-time politician, reaching out not only to blacks but also to other minority groups. He worked, for example, with the Gay Activists' Alliance to develop one of the strongest municipal ordinances in the nation for protecting the civil rights of homosexuals.
His service on the Council almost cost him his life when Hanafi Muslims shot him in the chest during their seizure of the District Building on March 9, 1977. The bullet just missed his heart, and he was back at work by the end of the month.
A year later he successfully ran for Mayor.
In his early years as Mayor, he was frequently cited as one of the nation's leading elected blacks. But then began the series of controversies about his personal conduct, including not just allegations of drug usage but also allegations of marital indfidelity and allegations that he had surrounded himself with corrupt aides. He repeatedly denied the latter two charges, too.

HEADLINE: Fight Over Tax Cut Heats Up As Bush and Moynihan Dig In

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
An emerging battle over whether to cut Social Security taxes heated up today with President Bush sharply criticizing the proposed cut while the author of the proposal, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said he would not budge.
Their statements indicated that Mr. Moynihan's proposal could trigger a fierce political and legislative battle over a sensitive issue.
Mr. Bush called the Senator's proposal to cut Social Security taxes a ''charade'' that would lead to a tax increase or lower retirement benefits. Mr. Moynihan, in his first interview on the subject since he made the proposal three weeks ago, insisted that he intended neither a political trap nor a gambit to force other taxes to be raised. He also strongly rejected the suggestion that he wanted to lower retirement payments. 
Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat, last month proposed repealing the Jan. 1 increase in the Social Security payroll tax, calling it regressive and unfair. He also assailed the Bush Administration for using the $52 billion surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund to finance the Federal deficit.
 
Quayle Exhorts Party on Issue
At the White House today, President Bush repeated the charges his aides have been making for days. ''It's an effort to get me to raise taxes on the American people by the charade of cutting them, or cut benefits,'' the President said of the Moynihan proposal, ''and I'm not going to do it to the older people of the country.''
With both sides jockeying for political advantage, Vice President Quayle also weighed in on what has become one of the hottest topics of an especially slow period in Washington.
In an interview with The Associated Press, the Vice President said: ''Let me tell you something. Cut these taxes the way Moynihan is talking about, you have to cut benefits at some time, and the President and the Republican Party now have an opportunity to show the American people, once and for all, that the Republicans are as committed to the integrity of this Social Security trust fund as anybody.''
 
Moynihan Sees No Budget Link
Senator Moynihan was interviewed by in a telephone call to Jerusalem, where he is winding up a trip for the Foreign Relations Committee to Africa and the Middle East.
''No, no, no,'' the Senator said when asked whether his proposal was a trap to force an increase in the income tax or some other tax. ''It is not fair to say I want to raise taxes to offset the Social Security tax cut.''
The Social Security system, he continued, ''edges on the sacred, and to see its revenues debauched this way is an independent question that stands apart from the budget deficit, a tax increase or any other question.''
 
How It's Being Paid
As of Jan. 1, workers and their employers are each paying a 7.65 percent payroll tax, 6.2 percent for retirement under Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The Social Security rate rose from 6.06 percent last year and the overall rate from 7.51 percent.
The tax is paid on the first $51,300 of wages. The maximum tax this year is $3,924.45.
Mr. Moynihan would repeal this year's increase and reduce the Social Security portion of the tax to 5.1 percent next year, saving workers and their employers as much as $560 apiece.
 
Social Security and Income Tax
He argued that in the Reagan and Bush years the Social Security tax had been increased to balance a cut in income taxes. That is ''inequitable,'' he said, because the poor and the middle class are affected more by the Social Security tax and less by the income tax.
Income tax rates increase the more a taxpayer earns from all sources. Social Security taxes are paid at the same rate by all workers, they are assessed only on wages and not on interest, dividends or capital gains, and they are not paid at all on wages above $51,300.
''We now have the most regressive tax system in the Western world,'' Mr. Moynihan said.
Congress has been in recess since Mr. Moynihan offered his proposal just before New Year's Day. Democrats have reveled in the political discomfort it has caused President Bush and his Republican allies, but no Democrat has yet endorsed the Moynihan plan. The only support Mr. Moynihan has gained has come from a few conservative Republican lawmakers.
The view of most Democrats is that Mr. Moynihan should be applauded for underscoring the inequities of the tax system and the extent to which Social Security revenue is being used to mask the size of the Government's budget deficit. But the Democrats, and most moderate Republicans, also believe that the country cannot afford a tax cut of any kind.
 
Schumer Sees Economic Danger
Reflecting that conviction, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is on the Banking and Budget committees, said a tax cut would drive up the deficit, cause more Government borrowing, soak up private savings and damage long-term economic growth.
Senator Moynihan said he hoped that the President and Congress could get together and agree on ways to reduce the budget deficit, by cutting spending or increasing some other tax. But even without that, he said, the Social Security tax should be lowered. ''If the deficit is increased, that would be bad,'' he said. ''But if we have to go through a small crisis to straighten things out, fine, let's do it.''
Mr. Moynihan observed that he had long supported an increased gasoline tax, but he said he would not stick his neck out and suggest any tax increase now unless Mr. Bush did likewise.
The issue is being driven by partisan politics. Senator Moynihan has embarrassed Republicans by proposing a tax cut. It is the same kind of proposal that helped Republicans win the last three Presidential elections.
 
Help to All Workers Seen
Mr. Moynihan said that a reduction in the Social Security tax would help all workers, while the Bush plan to lower the capital gains tax rate would largely help the wealthy.
The rejoinder today from Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle - that Mr. Moynihan's plan would lead to a cut in Social Security benefits - was similarly a move to capture a Democratic stronghold, the party's long-time advocacy of higher retirement payments.
Mr. Moynihan maintains that the money raised today through Social Security taxes affects future benefits only indirectly. He said he planned nothing that would lower those benefits.

HEADLINE: China Reports Release of 573 Held in Revolt

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The Government said today that it recently released 573 people who had been imprisoned for taking part in the democracy movement last year.
It was the first official announcement since a Government order at the end of June that banned the publicizing of information on arrests and punishments.
The action seemed to be part of an effort by the Chinese authorities to improve their image before the United States Congress reconvenes next week and considers sanctions against Beijing. 
The lifting of martial law in the capital last week was also widely seen as an attempt to improve China's international image and reduce the possibility of new sanctions.
 
Flurry of Arrests and Executions
The official New China News Agency said the lawbreakers had been released ''because during investigations, they pleaded guilty and showed repentance.''
The brief report quoted an unidentified police spokesman as saying, ''Our policy is to educate anyone who can be educated and temper punishment with leniency.''
The report said the spokesman ''hoped that those who took part in the turmoil and counterrevolutionary riots, broke the law and obstinately stuck to the wrong course would understand the situation, repent immediately and plead guilty for leniency.''
The authorities detained thousands of students, workers and intellectuals in June and July, after the military crackdown in early June.
There was never an announcement on how many were arrested, but most estimates started at 10,000 and some were far higher.
After an initial flurry of arrests and executions were reported on television and led to an international outcry, the Chinese leadership circulated an internal document ordering that information about detentions and punishments no longer be publicized.
Since then there have been very infrequent reports, mostly in provincial Chinese newspapers, of arrests or executions.
 
Mistreatment of Prisoners
Some of those arrested were released in the late summer and early fall, and a significant number of students and intellectuals were released beginning in December, say dissidents who maintain an unofficial network among themselves.
The announcement today appeared to refer to those released beginning in December. Most of those released were not beaten by the jailors, and in some cases the guards showed a measure of admiration or respect for the political prisoners, friends say.
But some prisoners are said to have been mistreated in other ways.
One intellectual, for example, was kept in handcuffs constantly for the first 35 days of his imprisonment, a close friend said.
The intellectual had to rely on other prisoners to help him eat, dress and use the toilet.
After his release, his former employer refused to take him back, and no other concern would hire him. Since employers provide housing, the dissident had no place to live, no money to live on and no prospects for a career.
It is not clear how many people are still imprisoned for their role in the democracy movement, but nearly all estimates are in the high hundreds and probably the thousands.
The most prominent prisoners, like Wang Dan, a student leader; Ren Wanding, an essayist, and Liu Xiaobo, a literary theorist, all remain behind bars and nothing certain is known of their condition or treatment.
Almost all that is known about prisoners concerns intellectuals and students.
Very little is known about the many workers who played important roles in the movement, because they and their families were not part of a dissident network that could help them and spread the word about their circumstances.

HEADLINE: Panama-Latin Ties Linked to a Pullout

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Although President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle are opening a round of diplomacy to bolster the Panamanian Government, Administration officials said today that it was unrealistic to expect formal recognition by major countries in the region until the United States invasion force is withdrawn.
The financially strapped and politically mistrustful governments of Latin America are also unlikely to offer much money to Panama, despite Washington's plans to try to enlist their help in economic aid programs, the Administration officials and Latin American diplomats said.
As a result, they said, the Administration's strategy in Latin America is based primarily on the calculation that pragmatism will eventually replace resentment and that regional leaders will begin to support the new Panamanian Government.
 
Too Soon to Visit
In keeping with this approach, officials said the Administration had decided not to press Mexico and Venezuela to receive Mr. Quayle after the two countries said it was too soon after the Panama invasion for him to visit. 
''Time will hopefully bring them around,'' one offical said. ''Gestures like the Andean summit on drugs that Bush will attend in February and Quayle's trips over the next weeks are designed to demonstrate continuity, to put Panama behind and try to get back to what we were doing with Latin America before.''
A Latin American diplomat said: ''The realpolitik of power will take over after a while. And then the Government of Panama, if it manages to produce some sense of economic restoration, will be in business.''
The diplomat suggested that governments in the region were waiting for the United States to take a significant first step to make the new Panamanian Government independent, including withdrawal of its extra troops from Panama and the presentation of an economic aid package for that country.
 
Aid Program Planned
Recognizing this need, Administration officials said they hoped to be able to give Mr. Quayle the outlines of an aid program before he leaves on Jan. 27 for Honduras, Panama and Jamaica, the first leg of his Latin American mission.
Meanwhile, the unwillingness of Mexico and Venezuela to accept a visit by Mr. Quayle has underscored the way in which Mr. Bush has so far failed to rally public support for his Panama policy in the region, even if he has achieved the military objectives he set for the invasion.
About two dozen countries have formally recognized the Panamanian Government of President Guillermo Endara, including most American allies outside the Western Hemisphere. But none of the major Latin American governments are on the list and some, including Peru, continue to maintain that Mr. Endara's Government is illegitimate.
''I think that recognition will accelerate once the departure of U.S. troops accelerates,'' an Administration official said. ''That has been a big sticking point.''
 
Business Goes On
Some Administration officials say that formal recognition is largely symbolic since about 30 governments, including Mexico, are doing business with Panama despite the lack of recognition.
But Government officials, Latin American diplomats and others involved in regional politics said the Panama invasion had derailed Mr. Bush's early efforts to build good will in the region by stressing a commitment to multilateral diplomacy and simply paying more attention to its leaders.
''Latin American governments have always complained that the United States neglects them,'' an Administration official said. ''With all the attention focusing on Eastern Europe lately, and then the invasion of Panama, that feeling has become more acute.''
The Panama invasion has also landed the Bush Administration in the midst of a tangled political situation in the region.
One thread is the historical distrust of North American power ''The fact is that the Latinos are going to be very leary for quite a while as to whether the United States is really going to do what we say,'' said Sol M. Linowitz, who negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977. ''The President has wisely sought to suggest that Panama was not a precedent for unilateral action, but they are going to be guarded and uncertain until we prove through action that this is not rhetoric.''
 
'The Only Safe Course'
Administration officials said some Latin American leaders had privately welcomed the ouster of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. But many are under intense domestic political pressures, particularly from the left, and cannot be seen to be endorsing what some perceive as an act of Yankee imperialism.
''The question for the Latins now is how to react in the face of the obvious joy of the Panamanian people at what happened to Noriega,'' a Latin American diplomat said. ''They are struggling to put together a policy, and the only safe course in the meantime is to be cold to the United States.''
The diplomat said the Panama invasion had also provoked ''a terrible soul searching'' at the Organization of American States, whose political efforts to dislodge General Noriega failed.
''The two guiding principles of the organization - nonintervention and the promotion of dissent and democracy -collided in Panama,'' he said.
A United States official said, ''It is painful for the Latin Americans to accept an American invasion, but it is equally frustrating to know that they were not able to accomplish the same thing through the O.A.S.''

HEADLINE: Approval of Bush, Bolstered by Panama, Soars in Poll

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
As he completes his first year in office, George Bush, helped by overwhelming support for the invasion of Panama, stands higher in the public's approval than any President has at an equivalent point in his administration since John F. Kennedy, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Three out of four Americans say they approve of the job Mr. Bush is doing. This 76 percent approval is a level only rarely achieved by Presidents since World War II, and one particularly rare since the crises of political confidence that were brought on by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal.
In the Jan. 13-15 poll, 13 percent of Americans expressed disapproval of the job Mr. Bush is doing. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points. 
Not since Presidents Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower has an elected President been able to achieve such widespread approval after having been in office for one year. The approval rating for President Kennedy was 79 percent and for President Eisenhower it was 70 percent.
 
Satisfied by Foreign Policy
Neither Ronald Reagan nor Richard Nixon ever achieved this level of approval. In a Gallup Poll in the early months of Jimmy Carter's Presidency, he achieved approval ratings rivaling Mr. Bush's now, but went fairly steadily down after that.
Lyndon Johnson received similar support in the year after he succeeded the slain President Kennedy. But after his landslide election victory over Barry Goldwater, his public approval, too, quickly began to erode.
Tempering the generally positive view of Mr. Bush was a further finding of the poll: When asked whether he or President Reagan had accomplished more during his first year in office, 37 percent said Mr. Bush had and 43 percent said Mr. Reagan.
The view of Mr. Bush among the 1,557 randomly selected American who were surveyed by telephone is bolstered by general satisfaction with his handling of foreign policy (73 percent approve) and, in particular, by strong support for the United States invasion of Panama (74 percent said it was justified) and by the return of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to the United States for trial (54 percent approve).
Approval of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy overwhelmed various domestic doubts about the President and the state of the nation.
Jitters about the economy have increased considerably since Mr. Bush's election, the survey found, with 36 percent of Americans saying they think the economy will get worse. That is an increase of 11 percentage points from November 1988. Only 8 percent said it would get better, the most pessimistic outlook on that question since January 1981, shortly before the start of the worst recession in postwar history. Mr. Bush himself got mixed reviews for his handling of the economy, with half approving but 4 in 10 disapproving.
 
Mixed View of Drug War
On several other domestic issues -improving education, protecting the environment and sheltering the homeless - a majority of Americans said Mr. Bush was mainly just talking about the problem or not doing enough.
On the issue of greatest concern to Americans, drugs, slightly more than half said Mr. Bush has made progress. That view was presumably influenced by the capture of General Noriega, who faces Federal drug trafficking charges. But there was also considerable skepticism, with 41 percent saying they believed Mr. Bush had mainly just talked about dealing with the drug problem.
There is long-term political danger for Mr. Bush in Americans' uneasiness about domestic matters. In identifying the biggest problems facing the nation, only 7 percent cited the area of the President's greatest strength, foreign policy. But one in three cited drugs and two in five identified the economy and other domestic issues.
Mr. Bush's political advisers are delighted about the President's standing in this poll and other recent surveys with similar findings, and they are looking for ways to capitalize on it. At the same time, they recognize the soft spots, so to counter those and to pressure Congress, Mr. Bush has begun talking about what he terms Washington's unfinished agenda.
In a recent speech, he accused Congress of not acting on items he has been pressing for, like a clean air bill and a cut in the tax on capital gains. Democrats on Capitol Hill reject this criticism, but Mr. Bush is likely to continue the theme in his State of the Union Message Jan. 31, senior Republican officials said.
 
Unusual Rise in First Year
Mr. Bush's approval rating has actually risen during his first year, the reverse of the recent trend for Presidents. In the early months of the Administration, about 61 percent of the public expressed approval in several surveys. That rose to 70 percent around the time of local elections in November and then slipped amid criticism that Mr. Bush was passive in the face of upheaval around the world and problems at home. But the slide has reversed in the last two months as Mr. Bush met at Malta with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, helped President Corazon C. Aquino fend off a coup in the Philippines and then sent troops into Panama.
Mr. Bush's support spread broadly in the latest survey. Even 64 percent of Democrats and a remarkable 70 percent of blacks said they approved of the job he is doing.
As various other polls in recent days have also found Mr. Bush winning historically high levels of approval, Democrats have been arguing that the support is, in the words of Ronald H. Brown, the party chairman, ''a mile wide and an inch deep.''
The Times/CBS News survey suggests that part of Mr. Bush's success is that he has given people few reasons to be against him. By this point in Ronald Reagan's Presidency, nearly one voter in five was able to cite proposed budget cuts or the handling of the economy and the budget deficit when asked what Mr. Reagan's principal shortcoming was.
But when asked for Mr. Bush's failing, the only issue that drew strong reaction was the invasion of Panama, with 7 percent saying the United States should not have taken such action.
 
Criticism Is Diffuse
While 14 percent cited some domestic problem as a failing, these views were spread across many different issues, suggesting that the criticism was diffuse rather than focused. The same phenomenon occurred when people were asked to describe Mr. Bush's greatest success. One in four cited the Panama invasion, but after that, support was spread across a wide range of issues.
''George Bush nibbles around the edges rather than throwing ideological bombs,'' Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip in the House, said yesterday. ''This is a marginal Administration. It incrementally moves forward on 70 fronts.''
The Panama invasion was by far the most powerful moment in defining the Bush Presidency, the poll suggests. Three-fourths of those surveyed said the invasion was justified.
But they also said Panama was a special case. Half said the United States should stay out of the affairs of other countries rather than try to overthrow a dictatorship. And most said they believe Mr. Bush shared this view, with 57 percent saying it was not likely Mr. Bush would send American troops into other countries to overthrow dictators like General Noriega.
Past presidents have benefited the way Mr. Bush is now from what they call the ''rally round the flag phenomenon.'' This is the surge of public support that typically accompanies foriegn actions, whether military or diplomatic.
Even failed adventures can produce the effect. President Kennedy reached the pinnacle of public approval for a modern President, 83 percent in the Gallup Poll, shortly after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
 
Nuclear War Fear Subsiding
While Americans remain reluctant to declare the Cold War over, the highest percentage ever recorded by the Times/CBS News Poll, 46 percent, now say it very unlikely that the United States will get into a nuclear war in the next 10 years.
The poll shows that while Americans tend to give Mr. Gorbachev more credit than Mr. Bush for the changes sweeping Eastern Europe, a majority say Mr. Bush deserves at least some credit for them.
Mr. Bush's approval rating has the potential for influencing much of American politics this year. Richard Brody, professor of political science at Stanford University, noted that President Kennedy's high standing helped insulate Democrats from the Congressional losses that the party in control of the White House normally suffers in an off-year election.
Indeed, Mr. Gingrich predicted yesterday that the Republicans might actually gain seats this year. At a breakfast, Mr. Gingrich was also asked what President Bush would do about Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security payroll taxes.
''If the President's popularity is at 80 percent,'' Mr. Gingrich replied, citing the figure of a recent Gallup Poll in the first week of January, ''I think the President can do whatever he wants.''
In another survey, conducted in the second week of January by by The Washington Post and ABC News, the President registered 79 percent approval.
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 13 to Jan. 15 with 1,557 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residences.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adult Americans. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for either Republicans or Democrats in the sample it is plus or minus four percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Grand Juries Can Defend Rights of the Accused

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Sol Wachtler, Chief Judge of New York State and author of ''Grand Juries: Wasteful and Pointless'' (Op-Ed, Jan. 6), knows that the state, through its police force and offices of the district attorneys, has replaced the king as the abusive force against which the grand jury must stand as the protector of the rights of a defendant charged with a serious felony.
While the prosecutor conducts the presentation of a case before a grand jury, a defendant may choose to testify, and may ask the grand jury to call witnesses on his or her behalf and to consider evidence not put before it by the prosecutor. In the Bronx, where I have practiced as a criminal defense lawyer for the Legal Aid Society for three years, approximately two-thirds of those cases in which our clients choose to testify are dismissed outright by the grand jury, or the charges are reduced to less serious misdemeanors. 
Experience teaches that grand juries, composed of ordinary citizens, are capable of evaluating the testimony of defendants, complaining witnesses and police officers with far less cynicism than judges or prosecutors. Hailing from the very communities where the crimes charged are alleged to have taken place, these citizens can see through charges instituted for personal revenge, blackmail or as a result of human error.
And, subject to a police force no less racist than the police in Boston (who were ready to arrest a person of color without scrutinizing the evidence that pointed to the culpability of a white man in the Charles Stuart affair), they are able to balance the credibility of defendants against that of police officers who often will stretch the truth, when they are not lying outright, to justify an arrest motivated by racial or economic prejudice, or by the simple arrogance of law-enforcement personnel toward the average citizen of Bronx County.
Indeed, it is my opinion that more defendants would exercise their right to testify before the grand jury were their lawyers more willing to take the time to present their cases (they do not because, in the Bronx, the Office of the District Attorney maintains an archaic and inefficient grand jury system that can tie up witnesses and defense counsel for hours, if not days), and were they not faced with the threat that unrelated previous criminal records would be brought to the attention of the grand jury by prosecutors more interested in obtaining an indictment than in seeing justice done.
Nor would replacing the grand jury system with preliminary hearings presided over by those same cynical judges (often former prosecutors) preserve the rights of defendants. Faced with conflicting police and defendant testimony in suppression hearings conducted every day in the Criminal and Supreme Courts of New York State, these judges in the vast majority of cases find police testimony to be credible.
Judge Wachtler recently saw his request for an increase in judicial salaries and for hiring of more judges turned down by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's administration. Now he apparently wishes for a transfer of funds by eliminating the grand jury system. It would be a gross injustice to those facing indictment to pare their first line of defense, while increasing the funds of the very system against which their need for defense is so self-evident.

HEADLINE: Ex-Danbury Mayor's Trial: Extortion Tale Unfolds

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Jan. 18

 BODY:
When a former mayor of Danbury, James E. Dyer, was indicted on extortion and racketeering charges last year, few believed that his trial would include testimony as titillating as allegations of payoffs in restaurant restrooms, cash hidden between the pages of The Wall Street Journal and illegal deals cut over coffee in City Hall.
For the last two weeks, however, such accusations have become almost commonplace here in Federal District Court, where Mr. Dyer is on trial.
''This is going to be a great book,'' Mr. Dyer said today, after testimony that he received $30,000 in 1984 and 1985 from the former president of the Danbury Savings and Loan in exchange for not blocking several condominium developments that the bank was building.
Mr. Dyer, who was defeated trying for a fifth two-year term in 1987, was indicted in March and in September by a Federal grand jury on charges of racketeering, two counts of extortion and four counts of filing false Federal tax returns. 
The charges stemmed from Mr. Dyer's role in receiving $120,000 in exchange for helping developers receive city approval for several projects that fueled the explosive growth in this northern Fairfield County city in the mid-1980's. If convicted on all counts, he faces a possible 72-year prison sentence and $1.6 million in fines.
 
Three-Year Investigation
''I have not extorted money from anyone - period,'' Mr. Dyer said after testimony on Tuesday.
The indictments came after a three-year investigation of corruption in the fast-growing and mostly Democratic city of high-tech corporations, condominiums and 70,000 residents tucked in the Berkshire foothills, about 75 miles from New York City.
Mr. Dyer, who is 43 years old, was indicted in September on charges of using his office to extort $60,000 from the developer of the Danbury Fair Mall, Wilmorite Inc. of Rochester.
Among the allegations is that he received $1,000-a-month payments for more than four years. The first payment, a $10,000 stack of hundred-dollar bills, were delivered in an envelope tucked between pages 34 and 35 of The Wall Street Journal, according to testimony last week. Other payments, which were approved by the company, were delivered in Danbury area restrooms, hotel rooms, City Hall stairwells, the Westchester County Airport in Harrison and, once, at a local news conference trumpeting the new mall, witnesses said.
A Wilmorite senior vice president, Alfred Friedrich, testified last week that Mr. Dyer complained in 1982 that everyone was going to be making money on the mall except him. He also asked for $38,000 to help make the down payment for a house, Mr. Friedrich said.
Another part of the September indictment alleges that Mr. Dyer agreed to accept $100,000 from a Waterbury developer, John Errichetti, who was in charge of a $20 million downtown revitalization project that began in 1984.
 
A Means of Thanks
In March, Mr. Dyer, once a rising political star in the state, was indicted on charges that he extorted $30,000 from the Danbury Savings and Loan Association.
In testimony relating to that indictment, Charles Bruno, president of Danbury Savings and Loan, said on Tuesday that he visited Mr. Dyer in his fourth-floor City Hall office on a weekday in March 1984. Mr. Bruno said that he wanted to thank him for his aid in untangling some municipal red tape that had ensnared one of the bank's condominium developments.
 
Figure Scribbled on Paper
In his testimony, Mr. Bruno said that during the meeting, Mr. Dyer was modest. Then, Mr. Bruno said, the mayor pushed a piece of paper across his desk.
Mr. Bruno scribbled ''$30,000'' on the paper and slid it back.
''What do you want me to do for this?'' Mr. Dyer asked.
''I am just thanking you,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''And maybe it's not what you do, but what you don't do.''
The money, which was paid to Mr. Dyer in seven installments over the next year, came from a fund Mr. Bruno had created by inflating a real-estate commission paid by the bank, he said in his testimony. He retired from Danbury Savings and Loan last year. He has also pleaded guilty to a tax fraud charge in connection with the transactions with Mr. Dyer.

 BODY:

The Right Space
Theaters, theaters everywhere, and not a one to play in? Yes and no, at least on Broadway. At the moment, two major shows scheduled for March openings have not yet found or decided on a theater.
''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' starring Kathleen Turner, is to begin its New York run on March 14, but where? No one is saying. Ideally, the show, which is selling out on the road (Wilmington, Pittsburgh, Boston and Philadelphia), would be booked into ''a 1,100-to-1,200-seat theater with an intimate feel,'' said Fran Weissler, the co-producer. It was originally scheduled for a Jujamcyn house, but the five Jujamcyn theaters are currently occupied or booked. The Nederlander organization has several large theaters available - including the Marquis (1,600 seats), which was to house the ill-fated ''Annie 2'' - but all are generally considered more suitable for musicals. However, the organization's Brooks Atkinson Theater (1,100 seats) is also free and is apparently under consideration, as are several Shubert theaters. 
''Lettice and Lovage,'' the English production starring Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack, scheduled to open here March 25, is being co-produced by the Shubert Organization. Bernard Jacobs, the Shubert president, said that no decision had been made yet, but that there would be no problem housing the show - it would go into a 1,100-seat, one-balcony theater ''like the Plymouth, Royale or Ethel Barrymore,'' all currently occupied.
 
Miss Margarida Returns
One of the smallest Broadway houses, the 499-seat Helen Hayes Theater, will house an unexpected arrival early next month. Estelle Parsons is returning in a revival of ''Miss Margarida's Way'' for a limited run of four to eight weeks. The almost one-woman show about a capricious, unpredictable schoolteacher (the audience participates as the class, and there is one other character who walks onstage but does not speak), opened at the Public Theater in 1977, moved to Broadway two months later and earned Miss Parsons a Tony nomination. The drama about political tyranny, by Roberto Athayde, then toured the United States, Europe and Australia, and another tour is planned after Broadway. Bernard Nussbaum, a lawyer, is making his debut as a Broadway producer.
 
Kline as Director
Kevin Kline will not only play the Prince of Denmark when ''Hamlet'' opens at the Public Theater in April; he will also direct the production.
''He had hinted before that he wanted to direct something,'' Joseph Papp said. ''And then he called and said he wanted to direct his own 'Hamlet.' '' (Mr. Kline played Hamlet at the Public in 1986 in a production directed by Liviu Ciulei.) Mr. Papp said he had informed Steven Berkoff, who was scheduled to direct, of Mr. Kline's request. Mr. Berkoff is in London, where he played the role of Herod and directed the National Theater production of ''Salome,'' which is moving to a West End theater this month. He also staged the critically acclaimed ''Coriolanus'' at the Public Theater in 1988. Mr. Papp described him as ''a first-rate director,'' but he added that with Mr. Berkoff's London commitment, ''it would have been a complicated situation.''
 
Nichols Off the Board
On another front, the Public Theater is temporarily short one board member. Mike Nichols, who has been on the board for slightly more than two years, resigned last week.
''There is a certain obligation of board members to raise money - we need to raise $2.5 million -and I spelled out a definite quota this year,'' Mr. Papp said. ''Mike felt that he was not a money-raiser in that way. He'll continue to contribute in his own way, and he'll still be chairman of the 35th-anniversary celebration April 23.''
 
Bete Drole
Stuart Ostrow, the co-producer of ''M. Butterfly,'' has a new show in the wings. ''La Bete: A Comedy of Manners,'' by David Hirson, is scheduled to go into rehearsal at the end of the year and arrive on Broadway in March 1991.
Mr. Ostrow described the three-act show, set in 17th-century France, as having ''a comic-opera feel, although there is no singing; it will be performed in an absurdly high comic style, and the pace is frantic.'' The 10 roles include two major ones for men, and Mr. Ostrow said he is determined to cast American performers. He also plans to add music to the show, as he did with ''M. Butterfly.''
Mr. Hirson, a 31-year-old Yale graduate with a doctorate from Oxford, will be making his Broadway debut as a playwright. Richard Jones, who staged ''Too Clever by Half'' at the Old Vic in London, will direct.
 
An Actor Who Works
John Curless thinks of himself as ''a jobbing actor,'' which he defines as ''an actor who works but has not necessarily made a major television series or become well known.''
After almost a decade in the United States, the English-born-and-trained actor, now appearing in ''Progress'' at the Hudson Guild Theater, said he feels ''part of the American theater, not the British theater in exile.''
And a small part of that feeling is accepting the fact that a job outside the theater (''but I've never waited on tables'') is occasionally necessary. When that happens, he reminds himself of something he was told at drama school: ''They said if you don't like being unemployed, this isn't the profession for you.''
Temporary unemployment and not moving ahead as quickly as one might like were not sufficient reasons to give up the profession, he said. ''The only reason for giving it up is when you stop enjoying it, and that hasn't happened to me.''
 
Sequel for a Black Musical
One of the longest-running black musicals in theater history, ''Mama, I Want to Sing,'' has naturally inspired a sequel, which has been given the same name with ''Part II'' added. The new musical, a contemporary love story, was created by Vy Higginsen and Ken Wydro, the husband-and-wife team who wrote, directed and produced the original, and includes 18 songs composed by Wesley Naylor. It will play in repertory with Part I and a third show, ''Let the Music Play Gospel,'' on weekends beginning Feb. 2. The address is the Heckscher Theater, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street. Telephone: 534-2804.
 
In the Wings
Jon Polito and Priscilla Lopez go into ''Other People's Money'' on Sunday, replacing Kevin Conway and Mercedes Ruehl. . . . Hinton Battle and Christine Andreas will join Betty Buckley in ''Stardust,'' the $2.5 million musical opening on Broadway in April and featuring the songs of Mitchell Parish and composers like Hoagy Carmichael and Duke Ellington. . . . ''The Lisbon Traviata'' will close on Jan. 28.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up 4.6% in '89

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as in November, the Labor Department reported today. Increases quickened for fuel oil and natural gas, while food prices and medical care rose more slowly than in the previous month.
For 1989 as a whole, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 4.6 percent, slightly higher than the 4.4 percent rise in 1987 and 1988 but the steepest since 1981, when it was 8.9 percent.
At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, took the occasion to declare that ''inflation is low and under control,'' suggesting that this meant the Federal Reserve could afford to relax monetary policy further to prevent a wavering economy from slipping into recession. [Page D6.] 'These Numbers Are Low' 
''We are hopeful that they will take a look at this morning's indicators and understand that these numbers are low,'' which would mean ''lower interest rates are justified,'' Mr. Fitzwater said in response to a question at the daily briefing for reporters.
Besides the inflation data, the Government reported today that housing starts fell 8 percent last month. Mr. Fitzwater said that was ''not good news,'' but non-Government economic specialists tended to dismiss it as probably reflecting unusually severe weather. [Page D6.] Mr. Fitzwater's comments came after two Fed governors were described in an article today in The Wall Street Journal as disinclined to reduce interest rates further without stronger evidence that the economy was really deteriorating. The Fed governors' remarks were largely blamed by people in the credit markets for a sharp drop in prices of Treasury securities and a jump in long-term interest rates to their highest levels in more than six months. [Page D12.] G.N.P. Data Due Next Friday, the Commerce Department will make its first estimate of gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1989. General expectations are for a small increase, but few experts are ruling out a possible small decline.
While today's inflation report was no worse than expected, economists said they were considerably less encouraged by it than the White House. They said gasoline posted a somewhat surprising decline that offset big jumps in household fuels. And the effects of freezing weather on Southern citrus and vegetable crops came too late to affect December prices. This suggests that consumer prices in January could jump perhaps seven-tenths of 1 percent before probably easing late in the winter.
Some analysts said they were sobered by the price acceleration in 1989, and while it was not large, they noted that it was driven significantly by factors that could generate a bigger increase this year.
''Inflation is creeping up, boosted primarily by labor costs,'' asserted David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. And he said that if the dollar falls, as appears fairly likely, American employers would be even better positioned to pass along these costs - which have been rising substantially, especially for fringe benefits - to consumers because of less rigorous foreign competition. Mr. Berson predicted that consumer prices would rise by just under 5 percent this year.
 
Less Volatile Figure
But Patrick C. Jackman, a senior Labor Department official, said he was optimistic that inflation would remain moderate, pointing out that when the gyration-prone food and energy components are taken out, the Consumer Price Index rose 4.1 percent last year, substantially less than the figure of 4.7 percent in 1988 excluding these components.
Referring to the argument being made by Mr. Berson and others, including Joel Popkin, a former Labor Department associate price commissioner, Mr. Jackman said, ''It appears the lag between rising wages and rising prices is longer than most of those people thought.''
The tally of inflation at the retail level in December was typical of recent months - though higher than during the summer - and consistent with last Friday's report that prices received by American producers of finished goods climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent for the month. Because of special factors, that report was widely thought to overstate inflation for these goods at the stage just before reaching consumers.
The two gauges do not closely parallel each other, because it takes many months for most producer prices to feed fully into retail prices and because the Producer Price Index includes no directly measured services or imported goods.
 
Food and Shelter Up
In 1989, inflation in the important shelter and food components rose somewhat more than in 1988, but most of the acceleration was caused by sharp increases in the first half of the year in petroleum-based energy, today's report showed. Nonetheless, food prices climbed 5.6 percent, the most rapid clip since 1980, with a number of items posting huge increases: dairy products rose 10.3 percent; eggs, 35.4 percent; fuel oil, 15.5 percent, and tobacco products, 14.7 percent.
Prices declined by small amounts for used cars, house furnishings and women's and infants' apparel.
In December, food inflation slowed to four-tenths of 1 percent, as fruits and vegetables fell 1.3 percent after rising sharply in October and November, while the other important grocery store food groups posted bigger increases than in the month before. Dairy products surged another 2.2 percent, and the index for meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose 1 percent.
Housing prices advanced five-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in November, with fuel oil up 3.8 percent, natural gas up 2.1 percent and electricity rising eight-tenths of 1 percent. Cable television and refuse collection also rose substantially, but telephone charges fell.
 
Decline in Gasoline
Transportation prices edged up a scant one-tenth of 1 percent. A 2 percent decline for gasoline, the sixth decline in seven months, nearly offset the higher cost of buying a new car.
Apparel prices fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, reflecting larger than usual late-season reductions, and this cut the full-year increase for clothing down to seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Medical care rose five-tenths of 1 percent in December, and the 12-month increase, at 8.5 percent, was the highest of any important category.
The category of ''other'' goods and services, which includes tobacco and tuitions, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month.
Excluding food and energy, the December increase was four-tenths of 1 percent, the same as in November.
 
Regional Measures
For the five metropolitan areas for which a monthly Consumer Price Index is calculated, there were increases for the year of 5.8 percent for New York, 5.2 percent for Los Angeles, 4.3 percent for Chicago, 3.9 percent for San Francisco and 3.4 percent for Philadelphia.
The Consumer Price Index, which covers all urban consumers, now stands at 126.1, compared with its 1982-1984 base of 100. Before rounding, the December increase was 0.3974563.
Another version of the index, covering only urban wage earners, rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, also the same as in November, and 4.5 percent during 1989.

HEADLINE: Celebrity Twist to Savings Failure

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In the current savings industry crisis, the collapse of Colorado's Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association would stand out even if one of its former directors were not Neil M. Bush, a son of the President.
The Federal bailout of Silverado is likely to be one of the troubled industry's most expensive, costing taxpayers up to $1 billion to cover mounting losses from the savings and loan's risky investments in ''junk bonds,'' land, office buildings and housing developments.
The precipitious fall of Silverado was partly the result of poor business judgment. When the oil-dependent Denver economy slumped in the mid-1980's, lowering real estate prices, many of the region's savings and loans tightened their belts and curbed their lending for property. But Silverado plunged ahead, investing in speculative ventures in the midst of a declining market. 
 
Ties With Developers
But Silverado's demise also illustrates the kind of close - and sometimes questionable - links between savings institutions and developers that kept risky loans flowing and worsened the industry's troubles. The links between Silverado board members, including Neil Bush, and local developers are being scrutinized by platoons of Government investigators.
The Federal regulators are examining several issues, but the essential question is whether Silverado's directors and local developers were engaged in self-dealing - shuffling loans and investments to make Silverado appear more financially healthy than it really was. [On Thursday, the Office of Thrift Supervision held a closed-door meeting with Neil Bush in Washington, to consider whether he had committed any improprieties during the three years he was a Silverado director. The office's commissioners met into the evening and were not expected to announce their conclusions until later.] Earlier this month, three former senior executives of Silverado, including its former chairman and chief executive, Michael R. Wise, signed orders by the Office of Thrift Supervision that permanently barred them from holding jobs in the industry.
The Justice Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are also investigating the Silverado case.
 
No Sign of Great Wealth
Neil Bush, one of four sons of the President, is a 34-year-old Denver oilman and fledgling entrepreneur, whose modest style of living shows no evidence of significant personal wealth. By all accounts, he is close to his father and has served as a popular and effective fund-raiser in the Republican Party in Colorado.
Neil Bush was invited to join the Silverado board in 1985 and resigned on Aug. 30, 1988, two weeks after his father received the Republican Presidential nomination.
Neil Bush did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. In a recent interview with The Denver Post, he denied doing anything wrong during his period at Silverado. He also denied that he had sought lenient treatment from regulators for the savings association.
''I'm cooperating in every way that I can,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview, referring to the various Government inquiries. ''I have absolutely nothing to hide.''
During his three years as a director, the Silverado board and executives dismissed one auditing firm and approved questionable loans that helped to gild Silverado's weak capital base, keeping regulators at bay.
The institution was finally seized by Federal regulators in December 1988. The Government sold Silverado's healthy operations to the First Nationwide Financial Corporation, a unit of the Ford Motor Company. Those operations are now part of Columbia Savings, the largest savings institution in Colorado, with more than $5 billion in assets.
 
Ties to a Wealthy Borrower
For Neil Bush, the most potentially troublesome issue now under review is his financial ties to a former investor and frequent borrower at Silverado, Bill L. Walters.
Mr. Walters, a high-profile Denver developer whose personal net worth was estimated as high as $200 million a few years ago, was chairman of the Greater Denver Chamber of Commerce in 1987-88. He obtained more than $200 million in loans from Silverado, and purchased $20 million in Silverado securities in 1986, The Denver Post reported. Between 1984 and 1988, he bought $43 million in Silverado securities, the newspaper said.
In 1983, Mr. Walters contributed $150,000 to the formation of a an energy partnership, JNB Exploration, with Neil Bush as one of its partners, according to state records. By contrast, Mr. Bush invested just $100. One of three banks owned by Mr. Walters, the Cherry Creek National Bank, later established a $1.2 million credit line for JNB Exploration.
According to state records, Mr. Walters sold his interest in JNB Exploration in 1986. Neil Bush, who was a general partner of JNB, and James Judd, another general partner, withdrew from those positions last year. Neil Bush has not been associated with JNB Exploration since last May. He founded a new business, the Bush Energy Company, in March 1989.
One key issue, regulators say, was whether Neil Bush approved any transactions between Silverado and Mr. Walters while the President's son was a Silverado director, which would have been improper. He could have retained his seat on the board, but would have had to excuse himself from discussions regarding loans to investors in his energy business.
David L. Paul, the Colorado regulator of savings institutions, declined to confirm details of the loan and stock-purchase transactions between Silverado and Mr. Walters. The transactions were covered in past examinations by regulators, he said, but under state law the results of the examinations may not be publicly released.
Those transactions and others involving large borrowers and senior officers at Silverado have drawn the attention of Government investigators, several industry analysts and consultants said. The Office of Thrift Supervision said last week that it had ''grave concerns'' about some of Silverado's deals.
Industry consultants and executives said the investments in Silverado by Mr. Walters and other large borrowers could have kept the institution's capital above minimum levels required by regulators at a time when earnings from its loans were falling below expectations.
New capital provided by Mr. Walters and others would have permitted Silverado to maintain its active lending practices, which were important to its ability to post profits.
 
Role of Federal Home Loan Bank
Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Topeka, Kan., branch of the Federal Home Loan Bank, said detailed loan examinations conducted by auditors from his bank resulted in Silverado's posting of a huge loss, of more than $200 million, in 1988.
A former staff analyst who worked at the Topeka bank for six months in 1986, James Moroney, said in an interview that regulators under Mr. Mowbray had delayed taking action against Silverado when the questionable transactions and other unusual activities came to light in 1986.
He said an executive under Mr. Mowbray cited Neil Bush's position as a Silverado director as a reason for not cracking down on Silverado management. ''If anything, Neil Bush was victimized,'' Mr. Moroney said. ''He may have thought we were regulators doing our job.''
In an interview, Mr. Mowbray, who left the Topeka home loan bank after Silverado was closed at the end of 1988, denied that Neil Bush's presence at Silverado resulted in regulatory soft-pedaling that kept Silverado open two more years.
''It certainly had nothing to do with my actions,'' he said. ''In retrospect, we probably should have thrown the management out. But nobody had suggested that.''
 
'We Went Too Far'
For his part, Mr. Wise, Silverado's former chief executive, has insisted that the savings and loan made business mistakes but that it did nothing that violated the law. ''It's obvious we went too far,'' he has said. ''But we did nothing illegal or immoral.''

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Behind the 80's Takeover Spree

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE bankruptcy filing this week by Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, the American retailing operations of the Campeau Corporation of Canada, has raised anxieties about what will happen to the economy if the wave of debt-financed takeovers, leveraged buyouts and managerial buybacks of the 1980's should crash in the 1990's.
Champions of the takeover wave have argued that it will bring tremendous benefits to the American economy, as managers, driven by the need to service and pay off debts, employ corporate assets more efficiently, or sell them to those who will. The proponents contend that the run-up in the stock prices of the acquired corporations offer proof of these economic benefits to come. A case like Campeau, whose stores listed $7.5 billion in debts when they filed for bankruptcy Monday, is just the exception that proves the rule, they say. 
But if the proponents of debt-driven acquisitions and leveraged buyouts are right, why wasn't this wonderful discovery made until the 1980's? As Margaret Mendenhall Blair, a research associate at the Brookings Institution, writes in a forthcoming book, ''Debt, Taxes, and Corporate Restructuring,'' the main theories offered by economists do not explain why ''leverage mania'' struck in the 1980's.
One common theory is that the leveraged buyouts are based on the tax advantage of corporate debt over equity. However, she notes, that advantage of debt over equity has been a feature of the tax code for decades, and, if anything, was reduced by the Reagan-era cuts in the corporate tax rate. She also notes, in an article in the new Brookings Review, that other theories, like the disciplining role of debt on management, the excess of corporate cash flow over worthwhile internal investment opportunities, and alleged financial innovations like high-yield ''junk bonds'' existed well before the 1980's. To explain the mystery, Ms. Blair presents a new theory that shows what was different about the 80's and why such explanations as managerial incentives for buyouts or buybacks and tax advantages of debt over suddenly became important in the last decade. The core of her explanation is the upsurge of real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates at the start of the 1980's to levels three to four times as high as any since World War II. That surge coincided with a deep decline in the rate of return on physical assets, especially in manufacturing.
High real interest rates sharply cut the number of investment projects by raising the ''hurdle rate'' over which qualified projects had to jump. So corporations found themselves with more cash flow than they could profitably invest internally.
The high real interest rates also generated stockholder dissatisfaction and stepped up pressures on corporate managers to increase the payout to shareholders. In earlier decades, shareholders were much more willing to leave their money with corporations as retained earnings, thereby avoiding taxes on dividends and instead acquiring capital gains subject to lower tax rates. ''The elimination of the tax advantage of capital gains,'' says Ms. Blair, ''also removed a major incentive shareholders had for encouraging firms to retain and reinvest profits.''
The idea behind her theory, she said in an interview this week, came to her from a remark in a seminar by T. Boone Pickens, the corporate raider who is chairman of Mesa Petroleum. Mr. Pickens said he was on the hunt for companies because shareholders invest for the greatest after-tax yield and he could not give them enough internal growth.
Other business executives find this explanation of the takeover wave satisfying, though academic economists are waiting for econometric models and more rigorous proofs. According to the Blair thesis, however, the earlier postwar decades when shareholders, seeking their greatest post-tax returns, would let corporations hold and reinvest their money gave way to the 1980's when shareholders preferred to have corporations disgorge cash, buy back equities and leverage up the value of their assets. Companies that resisted such pressures often became the targets of hostile takeovers whose object was to break up the company, Ms. Blair found.
The high interest rates, she concludes, led corporate executives to ''opt for more debt in their capital structure, especially if those high interest rates are not accompanied by rapid growth, technological change or other developments that would make the marginal return on new investment for the firms even higher.'' And she sees the corporate restructuring and rush to leverage as another symptom of the shift in the United States economy of the 1980's away from savings and toward debt-financed consumption.
What should policy makers do about this now? Trying to regulate or stifle leveraged buyouts, she believes, might do more harm than good. In any case, the market is now curbing takeovers by marking down or wiping out the junkier junk bonds, emitting alarms of dangers and sending companies like Federated and Allied into bankruptcy.
The most important way to improve real investment incentives, Ms. Blair suggests, is to lower the real rate of interest and thereby bring down the ''hurdle rate'' for new investments. The best way to get real interest rates down, without sparking inflation or relying on a deep recession, would be to bring down budget deficits and encourage private savings.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Broke $1 Billion Profit Mark in '89

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
BankAmerica's fourth-quarter profit of $270 million, or $1.21 a share, was slightly higher than the $265 million, or $1.36 a share, of a year ago. Because profits in late 1988 were swollen by the collection of two years' worth of interest on loans to Brazil and other special items, analysts noted that the latest earnings showed that BankAmerica was continuing to recover strongly from its woes of the mid-1980's.
For all of last year, BankAmerica earned $1.10 billion, or $5.19 a share, up 52 percent from $726 million, or $3.79 a share, a year ago. The bank said growth in consumer loans and residential mortgage lending had been especially strong last year, and losses in those lending activities had been low. 
 
Chemical Banking
At Chemical Banking, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, fourth-quarter profits of $95.9 million, or $1.04 a share, were down 66.8 percent from $288.5 million, or $4.66 a share, a year ago. The fourth-quarter earnings for 1989 were raised by $51.6 million to reflect profits from the sale of bond investments, while the fourth quarter of 1988 was raised by two years' worth of interest on Brazilian loans totaling $205.4 million.
Because Chemical added $600 million to its reserves in the third quarter for loans to developing countires and $300 million for loans at its Texas Commerce Bank subsidiary, it lost $482.2 million for all of 1989, or $8.29 a share. In 1988, earnings were $753.6 million, or $12.02 a share.
 
NCNB
Earnings at NCNB were sharply higher from a year ago, as the company more than doubled in size after it acquired the First Republicbank Corporation of Dallas, which has been renamed NCNB Texas. In the fourth quarter, profits were $136.2 million, or $1.25 a share, more than double the $64.3 million, or 68 cents a share, of a year ago. For all of 1989, earnings were $447.1 million, or $4.44 a share, up 77 percent from $252.5 million, or $2.87 a share.
Despite slowing economic activity in the Southeast, NCNB avoided a big increase in problem loans. Its reserve for loan losses totaled $465.5 million at the end of the year, or 1.35 percent of total loans, up from 1.22 percent a year earlier. Delinquent loans, totaled $446.1 million, or 73-hundredths of 1 percent of up from 72-hundredths of 1 percent a year ago.
 
Bank of New York
Profits at the Bank of New York, the 11th-largest banking company in the country, were $106.6 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.43 a share, up 94.9 percent from $54.7 million, or $1.10 a share, a year ago. Most of the gain was from the hostile acquisiton of the Irving Bank Corporation in November 1988.
For all last year, Bank of New York earned only $50.7 million, or 27 cents a share, down 76.2 percent from $213 million, or $5.12 a share, in 1988. The decline was caused by a $600 million increase in the third quarter in its reserve for losses on loans to third world countries. Since adding that reserve, Bank of New York has aggressively sold its loans to those countries, reducing its holdings by about a third, or $634 million during the fourth quarter.
Dennis F. Shea, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, noted that earnings at Bank of New York and NCNB showed ''lackluster growth in revenues and little loan growth.''
 
Bank of Boston
At the Bank of Boston, profits in the fourth quarter fell to $9 million, or 8 cents a share, from 83 million, or $1.13 a share, a year ago. The company, which is the largest banking firm in New England and the 15th largest in the nation, had previously announced that problems with real estate loans caused it to add $280 million to its reserves for loan losses in fourth quarter. For all of 1989, when its earnings totaled $70 million, the company added $722 million to its loan-loss reserves. Profits in 1989 amounted to 80 cents a share, and were down 78.3 percent from $322 million, or $4.43 a share, in 1988.

HEADLINE: 2d Thoughts On Bank Deal

 BODY:
Bank of New York Company executives are hinting that they are reconsidering the previously agreed-to acquisition of the Northeast Bancorp, a Shelton, Conn., company.
Northeast Bancorp surprised Bank of New York executives earlier this week when it announced a big increase in troubled loans that cut 1989 profits to $632,000, from $34.6 million in 1988. 
In 1983, when the two companies agreed to merge as soon as Connecticut allows acquisitions by out-of-state banks, Northeast's banking market was thriving. But yesterday, J. Carter Bacot, Bank of New York's chairman, said in an interview with reporters that the weakening trend in the New England economy suggested that the Connecticut company faced difficult times.
A December examination of the books at the $3.5 billion-asset Connecticut bank ''suggests that considerably higher reserves may be necessary,'' Mr. Bacot said.
George R. Kabureck, president of Northeast, said he knew ''of no reason'' why the merger should not occur. He said that Northeast would be able to meet the financial standards set in the 1983 agreement, but he declined to comment on whether Bank of New York could back out.
In 1983, the New York company agreed to pay 2.5 times Northeast's book value, or capital.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Forecast

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The United States economy will grow by 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 1990, with one-third of the gain fueled by exports, according to study released Wednesday by the Conference Board. ''Although relying on exports to foreign markets is something new for the United States, it will become a permanent feature of the 1990's,'' said Gail Fosler, chief economist of the New York-based business research group. While growth in the global economy has cooled in recent months, demand in leading foreign countries is growing faster than it is in the United States, the study said.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Vice Chairman to Head International Data Unit

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Although the computer industry goes into a slump now and then and companies fold up or cut back, Axel Leblois thinks the world is still at the beginning of the computer revolution.
''The industry has its ups and downs,'' he said this week, ''but the number of people using computers worldwide is booming.'' This year, that number stands at 200 million, and by the end of the decade it will pass a billion, he said. 
Mr. Leblois's business is providing information about the information technology industry. He is vice chairman of the International Data Group, based in Framingham, Mass., and former president of its publishing division, which issues 120 computer-related newspapers and magazines throughout the world.
Earlier this week, the company announced that he would wear an additional hat, chairman and chief executive of another International Data Group subsidiary, a market research and analysis company called the International Data Corporation.
Mr. Leblois, 41, will succeed Thomas E. Swithenbank, who has resigned to become president of Harte-Hanks Data Technology in Billerica, Mass. Mr. Leblois will continue as vice chairman.
Mr. Leblois, who joined International Data in its French subsidiary, headed the publishing unit from 1986 to 1989. ''During those four years revenues doubled through internal growth,'' he said. ''We entered a lot of new markets throughout the world, in Taiwan, Japan and the U.S.S.R.''
The company's Soviet computer publishing venture has put out five issues of a magazine. ''It's doing O.K.,'' Mr. Leblois said. ''We had some production problems from a shortage of paper, but it's back on track now. Local production costs are low, and it's been profitable since Day One.''
The International Data Group is a privately held company founded by Patrick J. McGovern, who is chairman. Its annual revenues are $500 million, and along with its publishing and market research businesses it operates a unit that produces exhibitions and conferences on information technology.
Mr. Leblois, who grew up in Paris, went to business school there and attended the University of Paris, majoring in economics and philosophy. The latter subject was ''for my personal fun,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed Despite Rally In Blue Chips

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rallied in the final half-hour of trading yesterday, but the overall market finished the day mixed.
After vacillating throughout most of the session, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 7.25 points higher, at 2,666.38. It was down as many as 25 points shortly before noon.
But the broader market fared much worse than the glamour equities, with inflation worries and continuing reports of lower earnings pulling down most stock prices throughout the session. 
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2, with 899 issues lower in price and only 584 higher.
Inflation fears were rekindled by the Government's report of a four-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for December, which was unchanged from November. This brought the total rise for the year to 4.6 percent.
 
Drop in Housing Starts
At the same time, housing starts showed an 8 percent drop for December. Traders said that the mixed economic picture indicated that the Federal Reserve Board would not move soon to lower interest rates. A report that Fed officials saw no need to ease also played a role in the fall, which sent interest rates sharply higher.
Indicative of the weak earnings outlook, Digital Equipment plunged 5 7/8, to 82, after reporting weaker-than-expected results for its second fiscal quarter ended in December. The computer maker reported net income of $1.25 a share, down from $2.20 a share a year earlier and sharply below the $1.66 a share that Wall Street consensus had estimated.
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which slipped 1/8, to 2 7/8, was the most active stock on a volume of 4.9 million shares. The publishing company said that it expected operating profit and cash flow for 1990 to be significantly higher than in 1989.
Monsanto was off 2 points, to 111 1/4. Analysts attributed the decline to investor nervousness over the scheduled release Monday of the company's fourth-quarter earnings.
 
Volume Was Higher
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.79, to 338.19, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index tacked on 0.21, to 187.07.
Volume on the Big Board expanded to 178.6 million shares, from 170.5 million on Wednesday.
Secondary stocks did not benefit as much from the late rally. On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market value index declined 1.89 points, to 366.17, its lowest close since last July 11. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.16 points, to 437.52.
Union Pacific Resources rose 1 1/4, to 77 1/8. The company said that it had cut the price it would pay for domestic crude by 75 cents, to $21 a barrel.
Bank of New York dropped 1/2, to 37 5/8. J. Carter Bacot, the bank's chairman, said that after preliminary examination of Northeast Bancorp, he was less positive about buying that bank. Bank of New York agreed in 1983 to buy Northeast subject to certain conditions, but Mr. Bacot said it appeared that Northeast might have to raise its loan-loss reserves in order to meet those conditions. Northeast plummeted 5 3/4, to 40 1/4, after falling 9 1/2 points on Wednesday.
 
Biggest Percentage Loser
The ailing Bank of New England was the biggest percentage loser, plunging 1 5/8, or nearly 28 percent, to 4 1/4. The bank has been unsuccessful in its search for buyers, and there were reports that an effort to sell some assets was being blocked by regulators.
USAir fell 2 points, to 28 3/4, after the company's chairman said that it might report a loss for 1990 if the trends of high fuel costs and weak revenues continued.
Active blue chips included Citicorp, up 1/8, to 26 1/2; A.T.& T., off 1/8, to 42 3/8; Philip Morris, up 7/8, to 39 3/8, and Alcoa, off 3/8, to 66 1/2.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing at Lowest Level Since '82

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Housing construction slumped in 1989 to its lowest level since the 1982 recession, the Government said today, but many analysts said further decreases in mortgage rates should improve the situation slightly in 1990.
''The drop in December housing starts is primarily due to severe weather in most of the nation last month,'' said John A. Tuccillo, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. The extreme cold caused an 8 percent decline in housing starts in December, bringing them to their lowest monthly level since October 1982. 
For all of 1989 starts fell to 1.37 million units, the lowest since 1.06 million units in 1982. The 1988 total was 1.49 million units.
The housing industry had been sluggish through much of last year as the Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates to slow the economy and curtail inflation. But as concerns grew that the economy might be slowing too much, the Fed allowed interest rates to fall gradually in recent months.
 
Interest Rate Predictions
Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, which looks for 1.45 million starts this year, said the forecast ''is predicated on our belief that rates are headed down.''
David Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, is also counting on a moderate decline in interest rates early in the year to sustain his organization's forecast for 1.38 million starts in 1990.
On the other hand, David Berson, the chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, looks for interest rates to edge up for much of the year and for housing construction to fall slightly.
The report said new houses and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million in December, down from a revised 1.34 million in November and 1.42 million in October.
 
Single-Family Houses
Construction of single-family houses plummeted 10 percent, to an annual rate of 904,000 units, after a 2 percent decline in November. That was the lowest since 862,000 units in December 1982 as the economy began emerging from the recession. But Mr. Berson said that had it not been for the weather, single-family starts would have gone up.
Apartment construction fell 2.4 percent, to an annual rate of 331,000 units, compared with a 15.3 percent decline in November. Analysts said overbuilding in recent years would keep this sector weak.
The overall declines were biggest east of the Rockies, where severe weather was widespread last month. Starts were down 23.3 percent in the Northeast, to 138,000 units; down 10 percent in the South, to 439,000 units, and down 9.8 percent in the Midwest, to 268,000 units. The West recorded the only rise, gaining 3.4 percent, to 390,000 units.
Applications for building permits, an indicator of future activity, edged down four-tenths of a percent in December. During all of 1989, 1.34 million permits were issued, the lowest since one million in 1982.

HEADLINE: White House Says a Drop In Interest Rates Is Justified

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
In an unusual public comment for the Bush Administration on Federal Reserve policy, the White House said today that current economic conditions justified lower interest rates.
''We are hopeful,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary, that the Fed policy makers ''will take a look at this morning's indicators and understand that these numbers are low, and that indicates inflation has remained very steady over the last seven or eight years and that lower interest rates are justified.''
The spokesman was referring to statistics released this morning showing that the inflation rate for 1989, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 4.6 percent and that housing starts fell by 8 percent last month. 
Mild as it was, Mr. Fitzwater's remark was noteworthy because Bush Administration officials have maintained a general policy of not criticizing the Federal Reserve. Previous Administrations have regularly attacked the Fed when the economy slowed down.
 
Improving Economy Seen
Mr. Fitzwater was responding to a question about an article in The Wall Street Journal this morning in which two governors of the Federal Reserve Board, Manuel H. Johnson and Wayne D. Angell, were quoted as having said in interviews that they saw evidence the economy was improving. The Journal interpreted that to mean that the two would not support a further easing of credit.
Mr. Johnson and Mr. Angell have been among the Fed governors who have pushed for somewhat lower interest rates in the last seven months.
On Wall Street, prices of Treasury securities fell today and interest rates rose. Traders said the market was responding in large part to the article.
 
Course Reversed in June
After driving rates higher since early 1987, the central bank reversed course last June. Since then, the Federal funds rate has fallen in six stages by about 1.5 percentage points, to about 8.25 percent. The Federal funds rate, which is controlled directly by the Fed, is the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans.
A natural tension exists between any Administration and the central bank. Elected officials generally emphasize economic growth, especially in an election year, and that often implies lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve, on the other hand, believes it has a mandate to restrain inflation, and that often means keeping credit tight.
Officials in the Reagan Administration often attacked Fed policy. But the current Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, has cultivated warm relations with the Bush Administration. Not only has the Administration not criticized the Fed directly, but comments about monetary policy have been rare.
The strongest Bush Administration statement about the Fed came last summer when Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said that if the country fell into a recession, it would be because the central bank ''erred on the side of caution.'' Mr. Darman subsequently said he had not meant to be so blunt, and he has not spoken out since.
The White House has no direct control over the central bank's actions, but students of the Federal Reserve have observed for years that its officials respond to political pressure.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Decline Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply and long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in more than six months yesterday in a selloff that traders said was largely spurred by comments from two Federal Reserve Board governors that suggested the Fed was not about to ease monetary policy again any time soon.
The comments by Wayne D. Angell and Manuel H. Johnson, the Fed's vice chairman, appeared in an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday.
The comments merely confirmed the view of many money market analysts, who have stressed repeatedly in recent weeks that a weather-induced rise in key inflation indexes is making it difficult for the Fed to ease policy again soon.
Given the market's bearish tone of late, however, the article prompted a new wave of selling. 
 
'The Sentiment Is Terrible'
''The story in The Journal set this thing off,'' one Government bond trader said. ''But the bottom line remains that the Street still has a fair amount of inventory and there are no buyers. The sentiment is terrible.''
Commenting on the market's reaction to The Journal article, Norman Robertson, chief economist at Pittsburgh's Mellon National Bank, said, ''It is one thing when someone like me says the Fed won't ease,'' adding, ''But it is quite another when officials say it.''
Still, Mr. Robertson said: ''Once again the markets have overreacted and distorted the outlook for inflation and the economy. Indeed, the run-up in interest rates over the last month is likely to have a further dampening effect on the economy.''
The Fed officials' remarks also generated a comment from the White House. Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, told reporters in Washington that recent economic reports, including the data released yesterday on housing starts and consumer prices, argued for an easier credit policy.
In addition to the comments from the Fed governors, market participants were forced yesterday to contend with another big jump in long-term Japanese interest rates, which have risen by more than a percentage point since the start of the year. The Japanese rate rise further narrowed the differential between yen-denominated securities and those denominated in dollars. That makes it more attractive for Japanese investors to keep money at home rather than invest in the United States.
Yields on the Japanese Government's 10-year bonds rose 19.50 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.87 percent. On Jan. 2, the yield on the bellwether Japanese issue was 5.79 percent.
''We are seeing the development of a two-tier international economy,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
''Growth in the big creditor countries, Japan and West Germany, is going like gangbusters,'' he said. ''At the same time, there is a slowing in the Anglo-Saxon economies. And rising interest rates in Japan and West Germany will delay improvement in the Anglo-Saxon countries, including the United States.''
The selloff in the the secondary market for Treasury securities yesterday pushed yields on the 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 to their highest levels since late June. In late trading, the bonds were offered at a price of 97 3/4, down 30/32, to yield 8.33 percent, up from 8.25 percent on Wednesday.
Prices of note issues also tumbled, and short-term Treasury bill rates soared. By late in the day, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year Treasury notes were offered at 97 6/32, down 22/32, to yield 8.29 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 98 30/32, down a quarter of a point, to yield 8.22 percent.
In the Treasury bill market, three-month bill rates rose by 13 basis points, to a late offered discount rate of 7.77 percent. Six-month bills were offered in late trading at 7.64 percent, up 12 basis points. And one-year bill rates rose by 14 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.47 percent.
The sharp drop in Treasury prices had a negative impact on price movements in the markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds. Corporate bond traders said that prices of most actively traded issues fell by five-eighths to three-quarters of a point.
Only one corporation, Comdisco Inc., chose to price a new debt offering yesterday.
Through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Comdisco priced $200 million of 9.75 percent seven-year notes. The notes, which mature Jan. 15, 1997, were priced at 99.743, to yield 9.80 percent, 1.50 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the 8 percent seven-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing. The issue is rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary municipal bond market, prices generally slipped by half to five-eights of a point, traders said. Even larger declines were recorded by New York State and New York City issues. Traders said that prices of New York issues fell by from five-eights to three-quarters of a point.
The drop in New York City issues was partly caused by an announcement from Mayor David N. Dinkins and Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman that early next month the city would sell $250 million to $300 million of new general obligation bonds.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply declined in the week ended Jan. 8. The report had no impact on the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Value Up Sharply As Rates Appear to Be Firm

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose sharply yesterday against key foreign currencies in active trading as the market appeared more confident the Federal Reserve would not cut interest rates any time soon.
Firm interest rates tend to support the dollar.
Gold prices declined after gaining overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $410.20 a troy ounce, down $2.30 from Wednesday. 
Currency dealers said the dollar was bolstered by a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal in which comments by two Fed officials suggested they would not support a cut in short-term interest rates unless economic conditions changed.
Both the officials, Manuel Johnson, the Fed vice chairman, and Wayne Angell, a Fed governor, had been in the forefront of a move toward lower interest rates in recent months.
 
White House Comments
Those statements were in contrast with sentiment from the White House, which broke yesterday with its usual practice of not commenting on Fed policy by suggesting that current economic conditions justified rate cuts.
Still, said Ronald H. Holzer, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, ''With the inflation picture looking as bad as it does, the market was anticipating that the Fed had stopped easing.'' The statements by Mr. Johnson and Mr. Angell, he said, ''confirmed it and brought out good buying for the dollar.''
Some dealers said the Fed had tried to thwart the dollar's rise yesterday by selling dollars for yen, but the market ignored that intervention.
In New York trading, the dollar closed up nearly a yen, at 146.35 yen, from 145.40.
Against the West German currency, the dollar rose nearly 3 pfennigs, to 1.7150 marks, from 1.6873.
The dollar was also stronger against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.6435 in New York, down from Wednesday's $1.65235.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.5245 Swiss francs, up from 1.5055; 5.8275 French francs, up from 5.7325; 1,276.75 Italian lire, up from 1,256.50, and 1.17135 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16515.
Gold rose in London to $413.75 an ounce, from $409.75 Wednesday. The late bid in Zurich was $413 an ounce, up from $409.75.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $413.95 an ounce, up from $410.35.
Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.190 a troy ounce, down 6.6 cents. Silver rose in London to $5.26 an ounce, from $5.23.

HEADLINE: Profit Outlook At Times Co.

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that it expected to report earnings of 83 cents to 88 cents a share from continuing operations in 1989. In 1988 the company reported earnings from continuing operations of $2 a share. 
The company said the expected decline largely reflected weakness in the New York region's economy, which affected advertising linage at The New York Times, as well as several other factors the company had previously reported.
These include a charge against earnings that reflected the lower value placed on the company's investment in its Forest Products Group; costs associated with voluntary staff reductions at The Times; organizational changes at McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines, and a charge from a settlement of litigation with home delivery dealers.
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive, said that because of continued weakness in the regional economy and the costs of a new printing plant in Edison, N.J., the company expected 1990 earnings from continuing operations to be only moderately above the 1989 range of 83 to 88 cents a share.
The Times Company said it expected record earnings of $3.35 to $3.40 a share for 1989, including a gain of $2.46 a share from the sale of its cable televison system. The earnings will be reported early next month.

HEADLINE: Arthur J. Goldberg Dies at 81; Ex-Justice and Envoy to U.N.

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Arthur J. Goldberg, who rose from humble beginnings in Chicago to become Secretary of Labor, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and then United States representative to the United Nations, was found dead yesterday morning in his apartment in Washington. He was 81 years old.
Dr. Michael Newman, Mr. Goldberg's physician, said the former Justice died late Thursday or early Friday of cardiac arrest from coronary artery disease. A maid found his body lying on a sofa.
Prof. Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, who clerked for Justice Goldberg and was a longtime associate, said Mr. Goldberg had been active until his death on project to form a committee to monitor human rights developments in Eastern Europe and China. 
 
Turning Point in Life
Associate Justice William J. Brennan, a fellow liberal who served with Justice Goldberg, said yesterday: ''The nation suffered a grevous loss in the death of Justice Goldberg. He served his nation brillantly as Secretary of Labor, Ambassador to the United Nations and Justice of the Supreme Court. Another great contribution was his work as a lawyer in bringing together the major labor organizations of the country.''
Warren E. Burger, the retired Chief Justice of the United States, said, ''As a Justice of the Supreme Court, he was a balanced and thoughtful jurist.''
A wrenching decision that was a turning point in his life occurred in 1965, when Mr. Goldberg gave up his lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court at President Lyndon B. Johnson's urging to assume the U.N. post. It was a decision he later said he regretted.
On the one hand, as Mr. Goldberg said years later, he believed that as U.N. representative he could reverse the Johnson Administration's Vietnam policy and bring about peace negotiations. On the other hand, it meant giving up a judicial position in which Mr. Goldberg's admirers believed he would have made a greater mark on American history.
''In all candor,'' Mr. Goldberg said on the day he was named to the United Nations post, ''I would rather the President had not asked me to undertake this duty.''
Mr. Dershowitz said the Justice had told him, ''Although I would love nothing more than to live out my years on the Supreme Court, America has been too good to me for me to turn down its President.''
Three years later he resigned, citing frustrations and disappointments, including ''the limitations of the scope of my office'' in regard to getting the United Nations involved in a Vietnam peace effort.
In 1970 Mr. Goldberg entered the race for Governor of New York as the Liberal-Democratic candidate, but he was soundly defeated by the Republican incumbent, Nelson A. Rockefeller.
Mr. Goldberg was an owlish, unimposing figure with remarkable energy and legal, judicial and negotiating skills. Johnson praised him in his memoirs as ''a skilled arbiter and a fair-minded man.''
It was in 1961 that the Chicago-born lawyer, then general counsel of the United Steelworkers of America, was named Secretary of Labor by President John F. Kennedy. In 1962, Kennedy named him to the Supreme Court.
 
A Mover in Historic Merger
The self-made son of an immigrant carter, Mr. Goldberg did much, as a union lawyer, to bring about the historic merger in 1955 of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
His legal work plunged him repeatedly into important decisions involving labor and management. Admirers recalled him as the leading labor lawyer of that day. When he was named general counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1948, he became the chief of the staff of lawyers working for its vast membership.
He was involved on behalf of labor in various court cases testing the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, which empowered the Government to obtain an 80-day injunction against strikes that endangered national health or safety. He was also the victor in an important 1949 court ruling affirming that pension issues were a proper subject for collective bargaining.
After the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was formed, he became the main figure to draft rules on ethics. In 1959, he represented the steelworkers in negotiations during a strike that lasted more than 100 days and that led to a contract that was widely seen as a major gain for labor.
As Labor Secretary, Mr. Goldberg was energetic in striving to settle labor disputes. He played a role in the Kennedy Administration's celebrated confrontation with the steel industry. Early in 1962 he helped bring about a noninflationary settlement between the steelworkers and the industry. He prodded the two sides by warning that a strike could seriously upset the nation's economy.
But 10 days later the United States Steel Corporation decided on a price increase, angering Mr. Goldberg and Kennedy. Other steel concerns followed suit. Then, with Mr. Goldberg working behind the scenes, the Administration successfully applied pressure to get steel executives to back down on the price rise. He met with Roger M. Blough, chairman of U.S. Steel, on a day when another steel company revoked its own price increase, and soon U.S. Steel also yielded.
Afterward, on the Supreme Court, Mr. Goldberg quickly became influential as an innovative judicial thinker whose arrival, to replace the more conservative Felix Frankfurter, tilted the Court toward liberal activism.
Authorities have offered different explanations of why Johnson chose Mr. Goldberg for the U.N. The President emphasized his desire to name a distinguished public figure to the post previously held by Adlai E. Stevenson. Others noted Johnson's wish to name his friend Abe Fortas to the Court. Mr Fortas was named to the seat after Mr. Goldberg stepped down.
 
A Reluctant Farewell
Mr. Goldberg said he was reluctant to leave the judiciary for the uncertain world of diplomacy. In making the shift, he became one of the few Supreme Court Justices to quit for reasons other than retirement. Professor Dershowitz said Johnson strongly appealed to Mr. Goldberg's patriotism. ''My President has told me that I can save American soldiers' lives'' by helping to work out a Vietnam peace arrangement, the Justice told his former clerk.
He did make a contribution, largely through dextrous negotiations with Soviet diplomats. But he achieved far less than he had hoped, which was to have a major role in ending the Vietnam War.
After he left the United Nations, he served as president of the American Jewish Committee, the nationwide human rights organization, in 1968 and 1969, and became a member of the Manhattan law firm of Paul, Weiss, Goldberg, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
In 1970, after opinion polls suggested that he would be a strong candidate, he entered the race for Governor of New York. But he proved to be a lackluster campaigner and he was easily defeated by Mr. Rockefeller, a long-entrenched power in state politics.
In 1971, Mr. Goldberg returned to Washington, where he resumed his career. He was called in on international arbitration cases and served in 1977 and 1978 in the Carter Administration as a United States Ambassador-at-large.
In that role he was chairman of the United States delegation to a follow-up conference, in 1977 in Belgrade, on the 1975 Helsinki agreements on human rights. At the 35-nation gathering, he voiced vigorous criticism of Eastern bloc nations on human rights.
That advocacy echoed the lusty assertiveness of his early years, as Labor Secretary, when the Federal Government played an interventionist role in some labor-management matters. Mr. Goldberg felt the Government had an obligation to affirm the importance to the nation of resolving crucial labor-management contract talks with implications for the state of the economy.
With Kennedy's support he acted on his own conviction that the Government itself should be vigorous in trying to settle labor-management conflicts that jeopardize national interests.
Early in his tenure as Labor Secretary, he helped resolve a New York harbor tugboat strike. He also intervened, and became a successful arbitrator, in a dispute between the Metropolitan Opera and orchestra members.
The arrival of Mr. Goldberg - a liberal, though not a rigid one - on the Supreme Court, then led by Earl Warren, proved to be a watershed. It led, in the opinion of most constitutional experts at the time, to a change in the course of the Court's rulings.
While Frankfurter was still on the Court, he was the leader of a five-Justice majority that favored judicial restraint, including respect for states' rights and deference to Capitol Hill.
But as an Associate Justice Mr. Goldberg became a member of a group, usually constituting a cohesive majority of the nine Justices, that extended the Court's writ into what had been deemed the spheres of the states or of Congress. This majority group was often termed activist or liberal.
As a Justice, Mr. Goldberg was also innovative. In 1964, in perhaps his most notable opinion, he wrote for the Court's majority in the case of Escobedo v. Illinois, striking down a conviction in a murder case in which the defendant had been denied the right to confer with his lawyer after his arrest.
Similar decisions ensued, and so did reappraisals of much of the nation's criminal justice system. Many police executives and prosecutors complained that the rulings had placed excessive restrictions on them.
Despite Mr. Goldberg's misgivings about leaving the Court for the United Nations, he had some successes as the United States representative there. Some admirers felt his most significant achievement was his role in drafting Security Council Resolution 242, which was passed in November 1967 after the Middle East war that year.
The resolution calls for ''a just and lasting peace in the Middle East,'' including ''withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories of recent conflict'' and respect for the right of ''every state in the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.'' The measure has been a cornerstone ever since in diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the Middle East.
But he did not succeed in getting the United Nations involved in an attempt to bring about an acceptable end to the confrontation in Vietnam. In addition, behind the scenes, Mr. Goldberg had grave differences with Johnson over Vietnam policies.
 
Exit From Vietnam
But Mr. Goldberg did figure modestly in the history of how the United States came to get out of Vietnam. In mid-March 1968, a time when, as Mr. Johnson put it in his book ''The Vantage Point,'' ''our total situation in Vietnam was under comprehensive review,'' Mr. Goldberg sent Johnson a memorandum. It suggested that the United States stop ''the aerial and naval bombardment of North Vietnam for the limited time necessary to determine whether Hanoi will negotiate in good faith'' in peace talks.
''I read the memo carefully,'' Johnson wrote. ''Goldberg made a strong case for a total bombing halt, but not strong enough. I could not take the risk of such a move at that time. I continued to believe that the North Vietnamese would interpret it as a clear sign of weakness - an indication that we wanted to stop fighting and come home.''
On March 20, 1968, Mr. Goldberg pressed his proposal at a meeting with Johnson and Presidential advisers. He did so at a time when there was much talk within the Administration of how to foster Vietnam peace talks. His suggestion was not acted on at the time, but 11 days later Johnson announced an unconditional and sweeping, but less than total, cutback in the bombing. Talks between the United States and North Vietnam ensued in Paris, and Johnson eventually stopped all bombing of the north.
 
Blind Horse and Wagon
The roles that Mr. Goldberg played in Presidential policy making and international affairs were remote from the world of his boyhood. Arthur Joseph Goldberg's was born Aug. 8, 1908, in Chicago, the youngest of eight children of Joseph and Rebecca Goldberg, both of whom were born in Russia. The elder Mr. Goldberg, a former peddler, owned a blind horse and a wagon and delivered produce to hotels.
After studying at Crane Junior College and De Paul University, Arthur Goldberg entered Northwestern University Law School, graduating at the head of its class of 1929 and earning a doctorate, summa cum laude, in 1930.
He went on to practice labor law in Chicago until 1948, with time out for war service from 1942 to 1944, serving with with the Office of Strategic Services and as an Army officer.
From 1948 to 1961, Mr. Goldberg was the Washington-based general counsel of the United Steelworkers and was active in negotiations toward settling major strikes in the steel industry.
He was also general counsel of the Congress of Industrial Organizations from 1948 to 1955 and in that capacity worked toward its merger with the American Federation of Labor, He was special counsel to the industrial union department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. from 1955 until 1961.
Mr. Goldberg was married in 1931 to Dorothy Kurgans. She died in 1988.
He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Cramer of Chicago; a son, Robert, of Anchorage, and six grandchildren.
Funeral arrangements are incomplete, but Ralph DeStefano, director of Gawler's Funeral Home, said Mr. Goldberg would be buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: U.S. Policy;
A Worried Washington Is Keeping Its Distance

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Soviet experts in the Bush Administration were scrambling late today for information on the fighting in Baku between the Soviet Army and Azerbaijanis, which Administration experts said seemed the inevitable next step in the drama in the Caucasus.
''Gorbachev's show of force was not working,'' a senior Administration Soviet expert said. ''He had to go to another level of force to maintain order, but who knows if even this will be enough. In principle, we are still understanding of his need to restore order, but we don't know exactly what is going on down there yet.'' 
Since the start of the ethnic turmoil in the Caucasus between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, Bush Administration officials have regarded Mr. Gorbachev's situation with a mix of helplessness and deep concern.
Officials said their concern was born of a perception that Mr. Gorbachev looks like a man who has been adjusting the dials on his system only to have them all come off in his hands.
There is a growing feeling in the Administration that the Soviet leader may be approaching a point where he has so many things going wrong at once, or where he becomes so preoccupied with his own survival, that he will prefer to avoid tough decisions on the United States-Soviet agenda that might alienate constituencies or require heavy expenditures of political capital.
 
Virtually No Way to Help
The Administration's fatalism, officials explain, is rooted in several factors. The first is a keen awareness that there is virtually nothing the United States can do to help Mr. Gorbachev out of his present predicament, even if it wanted to. A second factor is an intelligence assessment that while Mr. Gorbachev's power base may be eroding, it remains substantial and there are no immediate rivals to his authority.
The third element is a conclusion that events in the Soviet Union are not likely to create any reversals in Soviet foreign policy and may actually encourage Moscow to make concessions on the central agenda of United States-Soviet relations - arms control.
''The general character of what is happening in the Soviet Union now was not unanticipated here,'' a senior Pentagon official said. ''The major purpose of the Malta summit was to send a signal, before what we expected would be rocky times, that we wanted to see Gorbachev succeed. It is true that some hard-liners have been reminding people that this guy's future is nothing to take out an insurance policy on. But that is just a statement of realism, not policy. The policy is still to take advantage of the opportunities he offers and insure against the downside.''
Administration officials say there is little that they can do to help Mr. Gorbachev, since what he needs most is a theory and practice of federalism that will allow him to loosen the reins of power enough for economic development to flourish while also not unleashing pent-up nationalist and ethnic tensions. Nevertheless, they are taking small steps on the margins to promote American interests and help buttress the Soviet leader.
 
Critical Months Under Way
Administration experts say Mr. Gorbachev's power base in the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet remains solid. He remains relatively weak in the Communist Party Central Committee. Mr. Gorbachev, as Administration experts see it, is planning to use the Communist Party Congress in October to seek to rid the Central Committee of rivals. That makes what happens between now and October ''doubly important,'' said one analyst.
''We are not going to make concessions to get a Start treaty just to help him,'' said one senior State Department expert, referring to the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, ''but if we are able to work out a mutually advantageous treaty in time for this summer's summit with Bush, then it's obviously going to help Gorbachev.''
''A more stable international environment and a more positive U.S.-Soviet relationship can offset some of his domestic woes,'' the official said, adding that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will go to Moscow for talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Feb. 6 with his bags ''full of proposals.''
At the same time, the American Embassy in Moscow, which maintains regular contacts with officials from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, has let it be known that Washington would much prefer that they take up Mr. Gorbachev's recent offer of gradually negotiating a process of secession after the Supreme Soviet passes a law governing such actions instead of pressing for immediate independence.
 
'Why Put Him in a Corner?'
One senior official said: ''What we are trying to get across is the fact that since Gorbachev is moving in the direction that the Balts want, why turn it into a test of manhood? Why put him in a corner? He is letting the Balts go, but he needs an explanation and a process that will allow it to happen.''
Another reason for the Administration's relative aplomb about the situation is a feeling that even if Mr. Gorbachev were to be replaced tomorrow, his successor would probably have to pursue a very similar foreign policy.
''Something that is not going to change whether Gorbachev stays or goes is the basic weakness of the Soviet Union right now - the problems of its economy, military and Warsaw Pact allies,'' said the Pentagon official. ''The threat from any policy reversal is much more in domestic policy than in foreign policy.''
Officials said today that Bruce S. Gelb, the Director of the United States Information Agency, would become the first senior Bush aide to talk with the new Government in Rumania next week. He will also visit Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

State Dept. Team Finds Nations in Afghan Conflict Flexible on Future Rule

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 19

 BODY:
A State Department delegation exploring ways to end the war in Afghanistan completed a weeklong visit to the region today, convinced that the nations involved in the conflict are more amenable to a compromise that would not leave one party or leader in a dominant position.
The delegation, led by Robert M. Kimmitt, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, exchanged views with Saudi, Pakistani and Indian leaders as well as Afghan guerrillas armed and supported by the United States.
A United States official said tonight that the American delegation was impressed by the Saudis' apparent willingness to play a larger role in the region. Saudi Arabia has been a substantial backer of the Afghan guerrillas, supplying not only arms but a range of support services and nonmilitary aid along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Its religious ties to the Islamic Afghan rebels are strong. 
The delegation's visit precedes a planned trip to Moscow next month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, and another this week by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations.
 
Moscow Is Less Concerned
Officials say that although the Soviet Union has stopped short of saying that President Najibullah will be replaced, Moscow appears to be less concerned about what individual ultimately leads a government in Kabul.
Early last year, as the Soviet Union finished the pullout of its troops from Afghanistan after a 10-year stay, American officials predicted that the Najibullah Government would crumble within a few months. But nearly a year later, the American-backed guerrillas seem no closer to military victory.
Mr. Kimmitt said in Islamabad on Thursday that warmer relations between Moscow and Washington had raised American hopes that the Soviet leadership was prepared to reopen negotiations on the future of Afghanistan.
A year ago, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, came to Pakistan but failed to win concessions from the guerrillas. He also could not dissuade Pakistan from continuing support for the rebels and rejecting plans for a compromise that would have incorporated Kabul's current leaders in a new government.
This week, the Americans met Pakistan's Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, as well as President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the Army Chief, Mirza Aslam Beg. In India, Mr. Kimmitt met Prime Minister V. P. Singh, who took office in December, and spent several hours with foreign policymakers including I. K. Gujral, the Foreign Minister, and S. K. Singh, permanent head of the Ministry of External Affairs.
 
Discussions on Relations
Indian and American officials also discussed general ways to strengthen relations between the two nations. An Indian Government spokesman said they touched on specific issues like technology transfers, the spread of missiles, the threat of trade sanctions against India because of its limited access to outside participation in certain economic sectors, and the problems of militancy in Kashmir and Punjab.
The Americans found the new Indian Government willing to acknowledge that Pakistan was not the cause of New Delhi's separatist problems, although some Pakistani politicians may be capitalizing on the issue in public statements. Some Indian politicians and the press routinely blame Islamabad for the unrest.
The American team included Michael E. Malinowski, former United States Consul in Peshawar, Pakistan; A. Peter Burleigh, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, and William J. Burns, deputy director of the State Department's policy planning staff. The group briefed Indian officials at length today on Washington's position.
There are hopes in Washington that India, which has been a strong backer of the Soviet-installed Kabul Government, may be persuaded to relax its inflexible position and act as intermediary in Afghanistan, particularly if Moscow moves toward a political solution.
 
U.S. Ability Overestimated
The official implied that the United States, the Soviet Union and Pakistan have all more or less abandoned the backing of individual candidates for leadership in Kabul.
The offical added that many people had in any case overestimated the ability of the United States to pick and choose among guerrilla groups.
The official said Gulbudin Hekmatyar, who had until recently been getting a major share of American arms, has more or less isolated himself from the rest of the Pakistan-based guerrilla organizations through his persistent disagreements with the rebel alliance's leadership.
On the other side, Moscow is also apparently prepared to withdraw support for the Afghan President, Maj. Gen. Najibullah, if he were to stand in the way of the establishment of a nonaligned Government that did not threaten Soviet interests and allowed the Soviet Union to cut back its costs in Kabul. $300 Million a Month for Moscow Moscow is reported to be spending about $300 million a month, or up to $3.7 billion a year, on military and other aid to the Najibullah Government. Although the United States does not disclose the cost of its support for the Afghan guerrillas, the total annual figure is thought to be about $600 million.
Diplomats in the region believe that the Soviet Union cannot afford to spend sums like these indefinitely if it intends to revamp its economy.
Moscow is also preoccuppied with ethnic unrest within its own borders. But American officials do not appear to believe that the Islamic factor in the civil conflict in Azerbaijan is linked in Soviet thinking to the Muslim rebels in Afghanistan.
Uncertainty still clouds the position of the Iranians, who can intensify Moscow's problems in Azerbaijan and whose intentions in Afghanistan are a concern to not only the Soviet Union but also Saudi Arabia, a rival for leadership of the Islamic world, and the United States.
About 2 million Afghan exiles live in Iran, and their leaders have been unable to form an alliance with the Pakistani-based rebels.

Beret Meets Gold Braid: Generals Out of the Cold

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, Jan. 18

 BODY:
It had neither the drama of the crumbling of the Berlin wall nor the setting of the maritime summit meeting in Malta. But the cloakroom in the Hofburg Palace this week may well merit a place among images that chart the waning of the cold war.
While the generals, admirals and air marshals who run NATO and the Warsaw Pact discussed military affairs in a nearby hall, their hats, heavy in gold braid and authority, were piled on top of each other in what only months ago would have seemed indecent intimacy.
Along with tall French kepis, there were berets in green, blue and black, caps in khaki, white and blue, forage caps of the foldable variety and round-topped Alpine hats with cheerful feathers. Scattered among them were the wide-brimmed caps of senior Soviet officers. 
When the military brass of East and West emerged twice a day from their closed-door sessions, men trained to view each other as enemies jostled and joked as they searched for the hats and heavy coats that would proclaim their rank and protect them from the cold outside.
 
Historic Elbow-Rubbing
The meeting, everyone agreed, was unusual. The United States called it ''an unprecedented gathering.'' Britain said it was ''a remarkable and historic seminar.'' France described it as ''une grande premiere.'' A Soviet general even offered that it was a first ''in the history of mankind.''
The original idea was that the chiefs of staff of 35 NATO, Warsaw Pact and neutral countries - all of Europe plus the United States and Canada - would debate military doctrine. Predictably, in their statements, all said that their armed forces were equipped, trained and structured entirely for defensive purposes.
But the political transformation of Eastern Europe turned the meeting into the stuff of hyperbole. This first gathering of military leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact came as both sides are scrambling to rethink defense premises that have served them well for more than 40 years.
Apart from the meeting itself, which will last another two weeks, the informal conversations over coffee, lunch and dinner are also giving senior officers from East and West the chance to get to know each other, which some delegates consider the most useful part of this exercise in confidence-building.
Competition still exists, though, if only for the credit of proposing the meeting. Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, said the seminar was an ''important and timely initiative'' of the Warsaw Pact. NATO members insisted they suggested it last March. On this, the two sides agreed to disagree.
 
Fewer Echoes of Moscow
The setting for the seminar is appropriately historic. In 1815, the rambling Hofburg Palace was the site of the Congress of Vienna, in which the map of Europe was redrawn after Naopoleon's defeat and Austria became the ruler of an empire that included Germans, Hungarians, Italians and Slavs.
Today, East and West insist that while their objective is to end the division of Europe, the borders defined after World War II will not be altered. Yet the changing ideological map of Europe was more than apparent here this week as non-Soviet Warsaw Pact members spoke in voices that no longer echoed Moscow.
If negotiations under way here on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe are completed on schedule, the Hofburg Palace may be the site of a still more important meeting this year. Washington is thinking of a summit meeting of the 16 NATO and the 7 Warsaw Pact nations. Moscow has called for a 35-nation summit conference that would also include the rest of Europe.
 
Sophisticated Neutralists
Among the countries sending observers to the current seminar on military doctrine are lesser powers like Liechtenstein, San Marino and the Vatican. But the meeting has also served as a reminder that many neutral and non-aligned countries have highly sophisticated defense strategies of their own.
These countries - Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland among them - may seem Western enough when it comes to their market economies and democratic systems. But they sit on the fence between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, and they say they are willing to fight for their right to remain there.
Noting that Sweden has 800,000 trained reservists, 10 percent of its population, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Gen. Bengt Gustafsson, said that his country's goals were to dissuade any would-be aggressor and to defend its neutrality in case of war in its vicinity.
Austria said it would defend its neutrality by mobilizing its forces to deny any foreign power the use of its territory or airspace, while Finland's military chief, Vice Adm. Jan Klenberg, said simply that ''all parts of Finland will be defended.''
Even tiny Malta, the site of the meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sought to emphasize its neutrality. It welcomed moves toward greater disarmament, but said the interests of NATO and the Warsaw Pact should not ''push aside or overshadow completely the concern of states that are outside these alliances.''

HEADLINE: For Mayor Barry, Hope and Promise Crumble Under Weight of Charges

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
There was a time when Marion S. Barry Jr. was a symbol of hope, living proof that the great American dream could come true, that the son of a black Mississippi sharecropper could rise to the top of the heap, could go beyond chopping cotton and waiting tables and delivering papers to being Mayor of the capital city of the United States.
But that was before the rumors started about drugs and infidelity and corruption. That was before the police undercover operation Thursday night at the Vista International Hotel. That was before the Mayor of that capital city was arrested, like any other common suspect, on charges that he had bought and smoked crack supplied by undercover agents who were waiting for him in Room 727.
Mr. Barry remains innocent until proved guilty, and not just of the drug charge but of all other allegations and rumors. 
Still, no single finding of innocence is ever likely to restore the sheen of hope and promise that he gave off a dozen years ago when he first moved into the executive plushness of the Mayor's office on the fifth floor of City Hall, a one-time black militant who had challenged the system, changed it and made it work for him and his people.
 
Too Many Questions Remain
Any finding of innocence would leave too many other questions still hanging, where they have been hanging for years, not just months or weeks.
There are questions about Mr. Barry's nocturnal visits to bars and clubs at a time when the city is all but sinking under the weight of problems with drugs, crime, housing, health and finance; questions about his real estate dealings and the businessmen involved in them; questions about his friendship with convicted drug dealers. There are questions about unexplained hospitalizations, questions about close aides who have gone to prison on various charges of governmental corruption, questions and more questions that he has repeatedly been asked to answer but thus far has not, at least not well enough to keep them from being asked still again.
The day that Mr. Barry became Mayor was a day of triumph for black Americans, especially those who saw political power as the ultimate civil rights goal, and he had hardly been sworn in before he was being mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate at some point, or perhaps a Senator should the District of Columbia become a state.
Today was, in the view of many long-time Barry supporters, as well as many of his critics, a day of genuine tragedy, perhaps even the end, of a public career that had been on the skids for some time.
''This is a very trying time for those of us who have worked for and supported Marion Barry,'' said Jeffrey N. Gildenhorn, a leading Washington businessman who is one of the Mayor's main advisers and fund-raisers. ''When you have put your trust in someone and something this serious comes along, it's just shattering, a tragedy of just the worst sort. It pains to see the city and its people hurt, the Mayor hurt, his family hurt.''
Mr. Barry, 53 years old, arrived in Washington in early 1965, a scarred veteran of the civil rights movement in the Deep South. There he had helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the organization that supplied the movement with youthful shock troops for registering black voters.
He had emerged from a life of poverty that took him from his birth in Itta Bena, Miss., to Memphis, where his widowed mother worked as a domestic. Through pluck and hard work, he become a good student, an Eagle Scout and a graduate of Le Moyne College in Memphis. Later, he earned a master's degree in chemistry from Fisk University in Nashville. It was in his college years that Mr. Barry began to take part in the civil rights movement.
Gregarious, ebullient, impatient, driven by the memory of what it was like to be poor, he immediately struck both friends and foes as a man with a mission.
''He was totally political, totally committed to empowering the people, to getting people elected, not just getting them equality at the lunch counter,'' said Lawrence T. Guyot, a veteran of S.N.C.C. who now lives in Washington, serving as a neighborhood adviser for City Hall.
Mr. Barry, a Democrat in a city of 630,000 people who are mostly black, mostly Democratic, put the political and organizing skills he had honed in the Deep South to good use in Washington. He formed a group to push for home rule for the District of Columbia, set up a job training program for unemployed young people, worked to improve the black community's relations with the police. Then, in 1971, he ran for a seat on the city school board, and won easily.
He remained on the school board for three years, serving as its president at one point. In 1974 he won an at-large seat on the City Council, and in 1976 won re-election with a lopsided 78 percent of the vote.
 
Opposed by Black Establishment
That margin helped convince him that he could be elected Mayor, and in 1978 he announced his intention to run for that job. The city's heavily black political establishment was largely against him in the primary, but that all but insured that he would get a hefty white vote and he won the nomination. That victory, in turn, was tantamount to victory in the general election, since the city has so few Republicans.
No sooner was he in City Hall than Mr. Barry began to solidify his support among the city's blacks, steering housing projects, job programs and other governmental benefits in their direction. At the same time, he began adding to the city's work force, courting labor organizations and senior citizens and saw to it, through zoning and development decisions, that the big money in the city's business community stayed with him.
The result of these moves was the formulation of a solid political core that gained Mr. Barry easy re-election to a second, and then a third, term. People began to refer to him as ''Mayor for Life.''
But despite all this, trouble was building for Mr. Barry, much of it of his own making.
The Mayor, never one to sit behind a desk and ponder programs when there might be hands to shake or backs to clap out on the street, began to spend more and more time cruising about the city in his blue limousine.
''In one sense,'' said his old S.N.C.C. friend, Mr. Guyot, ''Marion is a lot like Lyndon Johnson. He needs to be pressing the flesh all the time, to have constant approval, to be out among the people.''
 
Nightclub Visit, Then Rumors
One night in the early 1980's, the Mayor dropped by a nightclub. The next day there were rumors that he used some drugs while there, an allegation he immediately denied.
That was but the first of a series of drug allegations that began to whittle away at the Mayor's credibility and also led to at least two inconclusive grand jury investigations.
In late 1988 Mr. Barry was involved in an incident at a Washington hotel in which a drug raid on one of the hotel's rooms was called off by police when they learned at the last moment that the Mayor was in the room with the suspect, Charles Lewis, an old Barry friend. Mr. Barry said he had known nothing of any raid in advance, and was only paying a social visit on an longtime acquaintance.
Subsequently the police charged Mr. Lewis with selling drugs in the hotel to people other than the Mayor. At his trial, Mr. Lewis said he had also sold cocaine to Mr. Barry.
The Mayor's strong denials wilted in the face of continuing rumors and accusations. His city, the national capital, was caught up in perhaps the worst drug epidemic in the country, and at times it sounded as if he was part of the problem.
But Mr. Barry was determined. He talked more and more of running for a fourth four-year term. He not only talked about running, he said he would formally announce his campaign this Sunday.
Now, after what happened Thursday night in room 727, that is all on hold.
But whether he runs or does not run is not the ultimate issue, says John Wilson, a member of the City Council who also worked with Mr. Barry back in the days of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
''You've got to remember what they used to say about those of us who worked in the field for 'S.N.C.C.,' '' Mr. Wilson said. ''It was the kind of work that took a special thirst for life, a yen to live fully, to experience. They said we'd never be able to govern as well as we fought.''

HEADLINE: Beyond the Kill in Arthur Kill

 BODY:
Disaster is a timely teacher. The oil spill that has raised havoc at the nature sanctuary around Pralls Island in the Arthur Kill presents a costly lesson in ways to prevent and deal with such destruction. Beyond that it carries a lesson about ways to deal with nature - and the ways nature deals with itself. 
New Yorkers, disheartened by the bungling and the oil-soaked bird carcasses, were also surprised to discover, in the middle of a huge industrial complex, a wildlife preserve where egrets and herons and ibises had been living and breeding as comfortably as they would in a mangrove swamp or an isolated barrier beach.
Mostly, this has been nature's doing. Years ago, when some disruptive dredging stopped and environmental laws started to have effect, the Pralls Island area began to restore itself. Marsh grass grew, sponging up toxic waste from the polluted water and, though often dying in the process, always renewing itself. Wild cherry and other weedy trees sprouted and by the 1970's when the branches were big enough, herons and egrets began to build nests in them, finding plenty of food for their young in the surrounding mud flats and marshes.
Nature had, in effect, already created its own wildlife sanctuary. Then, in the 1980's, the New York City Parks Department came in to acquire and protect the island and it has gone on since, with the New York City Audubon Society and the Trust for Public Land, to make the whole area an official preserve.
Wildlife, as a matter of fact, makes itself at home almost anywhere in the city. Central Park is the major stopping place for migrating birds. Jamaica Bay harbors wild fowl by the thousands and hawks build nests on skyscraper ledges.
To encourage this, environmentalists have been concentrating on saving bits and pieces of city land from development and turning them into urban preserves. There are potential Pralls Islands jammed into unlikely spots all around the city - a small peninsula in the Rockaways, a pristine marsh right off Flatbush Avenue, a fresh water creek at the edge of a huge housing development. Saving them requires money and stubborn attention but nature can do much of the rest.
The oil spill is a heavy setback for nature's careful rebuilding at Pralls Island. But whether recovery takes months or years, the lesson is plain: Give me a fair chance, nature keeps telling us, and then get out of my way. It's worth listening to her.

HEADLINE: Builders of Eurotunnel Have Had No Incentive to Control Costs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your report on the progress and pitfalls of the English Channel tunnel (news article, Dec. 18) misses the mark on an important issue.
The 10 British and French contractors that bid for and were awarded the construction contract were motivated primarily by their desire to design and build the tunnel. Eurotunnel was then set up as a separate company that would own and operate this major transportation facility. The tunnel would be financed by raising equity (1 billion so far) and commitments from banks in the form of loans (5 billion). 
This sequence of events has resulted in an immense problem. The tunnel is behind schedule and substantially over budget. Close to 2 billion has been spent on a project that is estimated to cost 7 billion to 11.2 billion. The problem has been that the builders have had little incentive to control costs. The future owner-operator had no opportunity to enforce competition between contractors at the bidding stage. The cost overruns on materials and construction are now subject to negotiations between parties who have to split the burden or consider having to back out of the project entirely.
Consider an alternative course. A true owner-entrepreneur is chosen among competing bidders interested in the tunnel project. After examining the project's economic and financial feasibility, he decides on the most efficient design from a list of options and solicits competitive bids for the contracts. As owner and operator, he would have strong economic incentives to keep costs down and complete the project on or ahead of schedule.
Choosing owner-operators as the starting point is similar to the situation in Virginia, where the state turned to the private sector to build, own and operate the first private toll road in the United States since the late 1800's (news article, Nov. 20). The state found itself an entrepreneur in Ralph Stanley, former head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration.
The lessons should not be lost on Californians, who are proposing that private entities design, build and operate toll facilities such as bridges, tunnels, roads and rail all over the state. Although the state would own the facilities, the private operator would have the right to charge tolls for their use. The traveling public is then given a choice between free routes that are congested and uncongested (or at least less congested) toll routes. Among the projects considered is another bridge crossing San Francisco Bay.

HEADLINE: Bush Warns Senate on Changes to Clean Air Bill

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
President Bush wrote to leaders of the Senate today warning that he would oppose amendments to strengthen the Clean Air Act if the costs to the economy exceeded ''the already considerable costs'' of the legislation he proposed last year.
Administration officials estimate that the legislation the Senate plans to take up Tuesday would cost industry and consumers $40 billion a year by the year 2000. The President's bill, they said, would achieve almost the same reduction in airborne pollutants at a cost of $19 billion a year.
The President's letter raises the level of an argument that has erupted among policy makers and lobbyists here over the costs and benefits of cracking down on air pollution. Changes in the Clean Air Act are expected to be among the most important and contentious issues Congress will handle this year. 
The Senate bill would require major new programs to curb urban smog, acid rain and toxic air pollution as well as programs that would begin to address the global warming problem. The President's bill would have similar programs, but would not go quite as far as the Senate proposals, whose costs would rise each year as increasingly stringent pollution limits go into effect.
Late this week, White House and Environmental Protection Agency officials circulated estimates that put the cost of the Senate bill at $40 billion a year by the year 2000.
 
'Minimum Tests of Balance'
Mr. Bush said in his letter that the only bill he would accept is one that meets ''minimum tests of balance and reasonableness.'' Among those tests, he wrote, were that the bill maintain the same environmental protection and cost levels of his Administration's bill; that it have controls to lower pollution ''for the least cost per ton of reduced pollutant,'' and that it avoid new taxes.
''The bill,'' the President said, ''should not impose aggregate costs on the economy that exceed the already considerable costs embodied in the Administration's bill.''
But the President's letter did not mention a possible veto of any legislation that did not meet all his standards. Congressional staff aides said today that they doubted that Mr. Bush would veto a clean air bill this year in the face of what is widely perceived as strong public support for such legislation.
Senate aides who drafted the legislation said the Administration estimate of $40 billion miscalculated the cost of new controls. Among other things, they said, the figures overestimated the costs of lowering car pollution.
Public health and environmental groups, meanwhile, contend that reducing air pollution will save the country far more money than it will cost to achieve such reductions.
 
Benefits to Health, Some Argue
A report today by the American Lung Association concludes that the benefits of improved public health would significantly outweigh the costs.
The lung association report was based on a survey of dozens of studies of medical expenses, lost days of employment and premature deaths attributed to exposure to polluted air. It said these costs amounted to tens of billions of dollars a year.
James S. Cannon, the author of the lung association's report, said a range of $40 billion to $50 billion a year for medical costs from all forms of air pollution seemed most reasonable, although one survey cited in the report found that pollution from automobiles alone resulted in health costs to the nation of nearly $100 billion a year.
On Thursday the Business Roundtable issued a report on the legislation coming before the Senate, saying the costs could be as much as $104 billion a year and that the best estimate of the costs of legislation pending before Congress is $54 billion.
The roundtable, an association of executives of big corporations who seek to influence policy making, warned that the higher costs estimated for the Senate bill ''could result in a shutdown or significantly reduced production in United States industries whose total revenues exceed $100 billion annually.''

HEADLINE: Tomisaburo Hashimoto Dies at 88

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Tomisaburo Hashimoto, a powerful official who was convicted in the bribery scandal that swept the Government in the mid-1970's, died of pneumonia today, a hospital official said. He was 88 years old. 
Mr. Hashimoto served in such posts as secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Construction Minister and Transport Minister.
In 1976, while Transport Minister, he was arrested on charges of accepting $34,000 for promoting sales of Lockheed aircraft to a Japanese airline.
 
Appealed to Supreme Court
The Tokyo District Court later sentenced him to a two-and-a-half-year jail term. Mr. Hashimoto, who denied the bribery charges, took his case to the Supreme Court, but the court had not issued a ruling by the time of his death.
The Lockheed scandal broke in 1976 when the American aircraft maker acknowledged that it had bribed Japanese officials to influence their decisions on purchases. The scandal caused a split in the Liberal Democrats that took several years to repair.
Mr. Hashimoto, a native of Ibaraki prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, joined Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, in 1927 after graduating from the department of politics and economics at Waseda University.
 
Many Years in Parliament
He quit the newspaper company after World War II and won his first election to the lower house of Parliament in 1949. He returned to Parliament 12 times before losing in general elections in 1980.
He served in the Cabinets of Prime Ministers Hayato Ikeda, Eisaku Sato and Kakuei Tanaka. Mr. Tanaka, who was also implicated in the Lockheed scandal, is still appealing his case to the Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Bank Sees $1.2 Billion In Losses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation said yesterday that its real estate losses were far greater than had been expected and that it would report a deficit of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter.
In an effort to survive without Government assistance, the banking company, the second largest in New England after the Bank of Boston and 18th biggest in the country, disclosed details of a plan to sell more than a fifth of its assets, about $6 billion worth. It is also seeking buyers for its loss-ridden banking units. Analysts said the independence of the company might depend on its ability to continue to borrow money from institutions and hold on to its consumer deposits. 
''A Federal takeover is entirely possible,'' said Virginia Adair, a banking analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ''And the problem with trying to sell the banks is that nobody wants to buy them without assistance from the regulators.''
 
'Final Nail in the Coffin'
 Gerard S. Cassidy, first vice president at Tucker Anthony Inc., a securities firm, said, ''The final nail in the coffin of most troubled banks is a funding crisis.'' To hold consumer deposits, he said that the Bank of New England was offering interest rates as much as a percentage point higher than neighboring banks in some markets.
In addition to the fourth-quarter loss, the Bank of New England, which is based in Boston, said it would have a $1.05 billion loss for all of 1989. Those losses will reduce the company's shareholders' capital to less than $500 million.
The remaining capital is far below the standard of 3 percent of assets set by Federal regulators for banks. It is a precariously small cushion to absorb any additional losses on the company's $29 billion of loans and other assets.
 
Deposits Are Insured
 But so far, banking regulators who asked not to be identified said there were no immediate plans to close or take over the bank. The banking company is regulated by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve have each had 50 or more examiners at various offices of the Bank of New England in recent weeks, studying thousands of loan documents to decide how bad the losses are.
One result of those examinations has been the expanding estimates of the company's losses that have stunned Wall Street analysts. Nonperforming loans, or loans on which interest is at least 90 days past due, are now estimated at $2.25 billion, up from $1.6 billion in mid-December and $900 million on Sept. 30, 1989.
Losses at the company have resulted mostly from lending for real estate projects. A glut of construction in New England in the last few years, combined with a slowing of the region's economic growth, has caused real estate prices to fall.
While bank regulators have not moved to close or take over the Bank of New England, they are working out details of an agreement that would require the company to raise more capital and improve its management. A few weeks ago, the Bank of New England announced that its chief executive, Walter J. Connolly Jr., had agreed to step aside when a successor was found.
 
Not Borrowing From the Fed
 According to data published by the Federal Reserve, there has not been a sharp increase in loans by Federal Reserve Banks to troubled financial institutions. The Fed loans to troubled institutions averaged only $22 million in the week ended Jan. 17, suggesting that the Bank of New England has not had to turn to the Fed for assistance.
''The fact that they are allowing the company to sell $6 billion of assets suggests that the Federal regulators are prepared to give the company time to come back to health,'' Ms. Merenyi said. If the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had decided that the company's financial condition was hopeless, she said, it would want the $6 billion of assets to remain at the company, so that the Government agency would be less vulnerable to losses.
Bank of New England stock fell $1.50 yesterday, to $2.75 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange, down sharply from its high in the last year of $24.875. Early this week the stock was trading above $7 a share, but its price fell rapidly on reports that losses were rising and that Federal regulators had intervened to prevent the Fleet/Norstar Corporation from buying a large part of Bank of New England. Officials at Bank of New England and Fleet/Norstar declined to comment yesterday on any aspect of talks between the two concerns.
The Bank of New England said Lazard Freres & Company ''is actively pursuing written indications of interest'' concerning mergers and sales of various banking subsidiaries. The company has subsidiary banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine and Rhode Island. As the company's problems mounted, it announced plans last year to sell 53 branches and cut 800 jobs.
The financial plan described yesterday also calls for the sale of $1 billion of leases, $450 million of which have already been committed to GE Capital, a financial unit of General Electric, for an undisclosed amount. Another $670 million of credit-card loans are to be sold, at a price that analysts estimated would be about 20 percent higher than the outstanding loans. The company also plans to sell 95 percent of its home-equity loans, or $1.3 billion, and $3 billion of various kinds of commercial loans. It also plans to sell $500 million of its $1.8 billion of residential mortgages, and $125 million of car loans.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges A Mortgage Rate Drop

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In an address to the nation's home builders, President Bush today hailed the broad decline in home mortgage rates in the 1980's and suggested that rates should be lowered further.
Although the President's message drew loud applause from members of the National Association of Home Builders, many developers expressed concern about savings industry regulations approved by the Administration and Congress last year. Those rules threaten the vitality of the home building industry, and in turn the nation's economy, they said.
In comments to reporters, Shirley McVey Wiseman, president of the home builders' association, called on the President and Congress to alter a new rule quickly that bars a savings institution from lending more than 15 percent of its capital to a single borrower. 
 
Small Builders Scale Back
 That rule and related restrictions have caused many small builders to scale back operations because they lack enough financing to continue projects under development and to begin new ones.
In his speech, which opened the home builders' convention at the Omni Coliseum, Mr. Bush linked the call for lower interest rates on loans to his campaign for a reduction in the tax on capital gains, which he has set as a priority for the 1990 Congressional session, just as he did last year without success.
''A capital gains tax cut will help every American who holds a job or owns a home,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Also vital to home buyer and home builder alike are low and stable rates of interest.''
Mr. Bush, whose Administration has carefully avoided the kind of criticism of Federal Reserve policy that has been typical of other Administrations when the economy slowed, did not mention the Federal Reserve in today's speech.
On Thursday, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said he hoped Fed policy makers would reassess the economy's peformance and conclude ''that lower interest rates are justified.''
The President echoed that theme in his speech to the home builders.
''A 1 percent increase in the interest rate knocks millions of families out of the market,'' he said. ''In the last few years, millions of families could afford a new home because mortgage interest rates have dropped from 18 percent in the early 1980's to less than 10 percent today.''
''And I want to see them come down even more,'' he declared to loud applause from the audience.
Builders attending the convention indicated that the impact of lending cutbacks at savings institutions, largely the result of new rules imposed on the industry, varied widely by region. In California, they indicated, construction financing is abundant from many sources, but builders in the Southwest said lenders had largely shut off loans for real estate development.
Despite the tightening spigot for loans to developers, builders and economists said financing for home buyers remained plentiful. Indeed, many savings institutions have re-emphasized mortgage lending on single-family homes.
The Commerce Department reported Thursday that new home construction declined in 1989 by 8 percent, to 1.37 million units, including single-family homes and apartments, the lowest level since 1982. David Seiders, chief economist of the builders' association, said the total was likely to rise slightly this year, to about 1.45 million units.
But with interest rates rising, making buyers' financing costs more expensive, Ms. Wiseman asserted that the added burden of inadequate capital for construction would ''plunge'' the housing industry into a recession if the lending limit for savings institutions was not raised.
 
Effect of Tighter Restrictions
 Some economists who spoke before the convention said the tougher lending restrictions would eventually force many small builders out of business because savings institutions were their main source of capital for acquiring land and developing homes.
Before the change, which was ordered to force more conservative lending practices at savings institutions, executives in the savings industry were permitted to lend up to 100 percent of capital to any borrower.
Most of the nation's home builders construct fewer than 10 homes a year. The industry, once a leading indicator of the economy's health, marched more in step with the overall economy after adjustable-rate mortgages became widely used in the early 1980's.
Its activity level remains an important part of the economy. For every 100,000 new homes under construction, the industry generates $280 billion, including $38 billion in wages, $1.6 billion in taxes and 1.6 million jobs.
Mr. Bush's speech to the convention was largely upbeat, saying the home building industry would benefit from his economic policies, including a capital gains tax cut.
''The truth is,'' he said, ''there's one housing policy, and one sales strategy, that's better than all others combined - a healthy growing economy with low long-term interest rates.''

HEADLINE: Trustee at Work in Stores' Case

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Creditors' committees are expected to be named next week in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Federated Stores Inc. after a scrutiny of all claims, said Conrad Morganstern, the United States Trustee who is overseeing the case and will designate the committee members.
The formation of the committees from among the 20 to 30 largest of the company's 50,000 creditors is an important step in the bankruptcy process, since all matters proposed under the bankruptcy are subject to the approval of such committees and the bankruptcy judge.
In a telephone interview from Cleveland, Mr. Morganstern said there would be at least two committees representing ''all the creditor constituencies.'' He said he was also considering forming a committee for non-trade creditors, which are mostly banks and investment bankers. 
 
Working Under Pressure
 Mr. Morganstern said his responsibilities in the bankruptcy were ''to supervise it and make sure it fits the laws,'' adding that his office had a huge amount of work to do before Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., the Federal bankruptcy judge, opens the first hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday.
There were 67 Federated entities that filed for court protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code on Monday. The company has 260 stores, 100,000 employees and about 300,000 suppliers.
''We will have to determine the nature and amount of all claims,'' Mr. Morganstern said, ''and make sure there aren't duplications and wrong addresses.''
He said he would soon schedule a debtors' conference, in which there will be questioning of and testimony taken from the top executives of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores, the two American retailers bought by the Campeau Corporation and now operated as Federated Stores Inc.
 
Looking for 'Brush Fires'
 ''We will find out what the financial conditions of the company are,'' Mr. Morganstern said, ''whether there are any brush fires or raging infernos that we must quickly put out.''
He said large creditors, government officials and the press would be allowed to attend the session, which will be held in Cincinnati, Federated's home base.
Campeau borrowed heavily to purchase Allied Stores in 1986 for $3.6 billion and then to buy Federated Department Stores for $6.6 billion in 1988. Together the retailers operate nine chains: Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus and Stern's, which are based in the New York area; Jordan Marsh, in New England; Burdines and Maas/Jordan Marsh, in Florida; Rich's/Goldsmith's in Atlanta; Lazarus, in Cincinnati, and the Bon Marche, in Seattle.
The heavy debt load eventually led to a cash crisis and the filing for voluntary bankruptcy last Monday. Just before the filing, the retailing operations, once known as Campeau Corporation (U.S.), were transferred by the parent Campeau Corporation to a group of trustees, yet to be named.
 
Sources of Money
 The two retailing groups told major suppliers yesterday that there would be sufficient money, from store operations and other sources, to support all store operations. In a letter to suppliers, James M. Zimmerman, president of the Federated and Allied units, said, ''The availability of funds is due to cash on hand, future cash from operations and our substantial working capital, and debtor-in-possession financing.''
Debtor in possession financing is made up of court-approved loans intended to provide money to keep a business operating during bankruptcy reorganization. Campeau had earlier said that it had arranged debtor-in-possession loans of $400 million from Citibank for Federated and $300 million from Chemical Bank for Allied.
Yesterday, company officials said that the Federated unit had a current cash balance of $220 million and does not anticipate drawing from the debtor financing until March. Allied, which has a beginning cash balance of $117 million, would also not need to draw on the financing until March.
The financing arrangements are, however, still awaiting approval from Judge Aug. Federated-Allied lawyers are expected to file the financing arrangements next week, the company said, and the court will then hold hearings.
 
Offering Reassurance
 Trying to reassure suppliers on shipments, Mr. Zimmerman said that any vendor who ships after the bankruptcy filing ''will automatically receive priority status for payments and will receive payments in full.''
''There is no further threat of being frozen, as there was before the bankruptcy petition was filed,'' he said. ''Given the fact that our companies will not be paying interest on most of our debt, this is the most rock-solid time and situation into which to ship.''
In Cincinnati, Carol Sanger, vice president for public relations at Federated Stores, said that both Liz Claiborne Inc. and Leslie Fay Inc., two major suppliers of apparel, had said they would resume shipping on normal terms. Executives of both companies could not be reached for comment.
But some division heads in the store operations said yesterday that they had only about 15 percent to 20 percent of January needs on hand. Many suppliers had canceled shipments when it became clear that the retail operations would be filing for bankruptcy.
 
Congressional Inquiry
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (AP) -The House Judiciary Committee will investigate the bankruptcy filings by the Campeau Corporation's American retail divisions and look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts, Representative Jack Brooks, the committee chairman, said today.
Mr. Brooks, Democrat of Texas, said the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law would hold hearings on the court-supervised reorganization of Federated Stores Inc., the renamed holding company of the Campeau operations, and the potential for more bankruptcies resulting from the debt-financed takeovers of recent years.
''The gold rush is over now, and the time for reassessment has arrived,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''I intend to move quickly in the upcoming session of Congress to consider the lessons of the Campeau bankruptcy, and how LBO bankruptcies will affect consumers, suppliers, creditors and the American economy.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Issues Post Best Gain of '90

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices yesterday posted their best gain of 1990 in a rally that began overnight in Tokyo and continued in the London and New York markets. Dealers said the recovery was sustained by domestic retail investors and professional traders who were covering short positions.
In late dealings in New York, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, were offered at 98 14/32, up 20/ 32 on the day. This dropped the yield to 8.26 percent, from 8.33 percent on Thursday, but the yield remains substantially higher than the 8.17 percent of a week earlier. 
The rise in the price of the long bond came after the issue fell to an intraday low of 97 10/32 in Tokyo before rebounding there to close at 97 24/32. This attracted buyers in London, where the Treasury's long bond closed at 98.
''With yields at their best levels in many months, it was inevitable that retail buyers would materialize,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''What was perhaps a bit of a surprise was that the retail demand first surfaced in Tokyo and then in London before our market opened.''
Those waiting for lower interest rates may have to wait, Mr. Sullivan said, ''because the Fed cannot, and is unlikely to, show any public response to any political pressures to change its policy.''
President Bush again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates yesterday, in a speech to the National Association of Home Builders in Atlanta. In recent days, White House spokesmen have linked current interest rates to signs of a weakening economy.
The Fed's only response yesterday was to drain reserves from the banking system through weekend matched sales. The key Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans, traded at 8 3/16 percent at the time and later declined to 8 1/8 percent. While the Fed's action was linked to technical factors, the decline in the funds rate reflected continued weak demand for credit.
Because of the heavy flow of individual and corporate tax payments early this week, the Treasury's deposits at the Federal Reserve swelled to nearly $7 billion on Wednesday from roughly $4 billion the day before. But Mr. Sullivan expects the Fed to recycle these deposits quickly into the banking system.
Interest continued to grow in the Treasury's auction on Tuesday of $5 billion of 40-year bonds for the Resolution Funding Corporation, known as Refco. The bonds, which are being sold to raise funds to pay debts of the many defunct savings and loan institutions, traded on a when-issued basis to yield 8.47 percent.
Although the Refco bonds would be the first Treasury offering of a straight 40-year issue since 1955, the maturity poses no problem, Mr. Sullivan noted, ''because the 'strippers' have already presold much of the issue.''
In stripping bonds, financial houses offer the bonds' coupons to investors seeking income and the principal to those seeking long-term price appreciation.
On Wednesday, the Treasury plans to auction $10 billion of new two-year notes, which traded to yield 8.14 percent on a when-issued basis. The outstanding 7 5/8 percent notes of 1991 rose 3/32, to 99 20/32, for a yield of 8.15 percent.
Among other representative Treasury issues, the 7 5/8 percent issue of 1993 climbed 8/32, or a quarter-point, to 98 7/32, and a yield of 8.16 percent; the 8 percent issue of 1997 soared 10/ 32, to 98 30/32, for a yield of 8.20 percent; the long notes, the 7 7/8's of 1999, advanced 15/32, to 97 21/32, for a yield of 8.22 percent, compared with 8.09 percent a week earlier.
At the short end of the Trasury market, the discount rate on the 90-day bills fell 6 basis points, to 7.73 percent; the six-month bills lost 4 basis points, at 7.60 percent, and the one-year bills fell 5 basis points, to 7.44 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Dealers said they failed to see any significant flight to quality into Treasury bills following the heavy loss reported by the Bank of New England.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Copper Prices Fall Sharply On Fears of Slack Demand

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures prices fell sharply yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting fears of an economic slowdown, which would reduce demand for the metal.
Copper futures finished 1.7 cents to 3.05 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in January at $1.01 a pound. The more heavily traded March contract settled at 99.30 cents a pound. 
The selloff extended Thursday's more moderate decline and resulted from growing perceptions that copper demand is slackening after more than two years of strong consumption, analysts said.
''What really highlighted the fact that demand is likely to weaken is the recent stock market weakness,'' said James Steel, a metals analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. ''With the U.S. stock market going down and the London and Japanese markets going down also, that's a clear indication that as we go into 1990, demand will be soft.''
Copper demand is closely tied to the nation's economic health, especially to the construction industry, which accounts for more than 40 percent of copper use.
 
Petroleum Contracts Gain
 Petroleum futures climbed sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, led by the February crude oil contract, which expires on Monday.
The buying of crude mainly resulted from concerns about a possible squeeze in supplies of crude for delivery against the February contract, analysts said.
Heating oil rallied and gasoline followed, as temperatures fell in the Northeast after several days of springlike conditions.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 25 to 91 cents higher, with February at $23.67 a barrel; heating oil was 0.26 cent to 1.82 cents higher, with February at 63.66 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.12 cent lower to 0.91 cent higher, with February at 61.62 cents a gallon.
Wheat and soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade, dropping sharply near the close, on selling linked to slack export demand and improved growing conditions for winter wheat and South American soybeans.
Wheat futures sank to their lowest levels in almost four months, extending a decline that began Thursday when large amounts of snow and rain began falling on wheat fields from the Texas panhandle to southern Kansas.
But yesterday's pattern of steep losses only in the March and May wheat contracts indicated the selling was inspired more by slack export demand than by the weather.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Moves Downward; Gold Prices Finish Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The American dollar was mostly lower against other leading currencies yesterday in trading dominated by the Canadian dollar. Gold prices declined.
Analysts reported quiet trading in the United States dollar. Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago, said the foreign exchange markets focused on the Canadian dollar, which had fallen through the week in response to a decision by the Bank of Canada to ease monetary policy and allow interest rates to decline. 
At the close of trading in New York, the American dollar was worth 1.1836 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713 late Thursday and 1.1573 a week earlier. In European trading, the United States dollar closed at 1.1786 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713 late Thursday.
 
Falling Canadian Rates Cited
 ''Interest rates in Canada are starting to ease, while rates in the rest of the world are continuing to move up,'' said Ken Foxcroft, senior vice president at the Toronto-Dominion Bank. ''So a lot of the attraction of investing in Canada is disappearing.''
Analysts attributed some of the American dollar's declines to profit taking before the weekend.
The dollar fell against the British pound. In London, a British pound cost $1.6475 late yesterday, more expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6445. In later New York trading, a pound cost $1.6470, compared with $1.6435 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7105 West German marks, down from 1.7150; 1.5205 Swiss francs, down from 1.5245; 5.8130 French francs, down from 5.8275, and 1,274.12 Italian lire, down from 1,276.25.
 
Late Dollar Rates in Europe
 Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's prices, included: 1.5140 Swiss francs, down from 1.5185; 5.6955 French francs, down from 5.8090; 1.9310 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9130; 1,269.25 lire, down from 1,272, and 1.1786 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1713.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 146.33 Japanese yen, up from 145.66 yen. In late London trading, the dollar closed at 145.60 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 145.93 yen, from 146.35 yen late Thursday.
In New York, gold fell 20 cents, to $410 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $410, down 80 cents from late Thursday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Suspect Israelis Sent Ethiopia Cluster Bombs

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Administration officials said today they strongly suspected that Israel has sent cluster bombs to Ethiopia. They said there were unconfirmed reports that the Soviet-backed Marxist Government in Addis Ababa has already used the weapons against rebels in the northern part of the country.
The officials, who are from the State and Defense Departments, did not say when Israel might have sent the weapons, how many were involved or whether the bombs were American-made or Israeli-made.
''People have described attacks and the consequences of attacks that sound like cluster bombs have been used on more than one occasion,'' an Administration official said, adding that no physical evidence had been recovered. Nor were any casualty figures available. 
Since Ethiopia restored diplomatic relations with Israel in October after a break of 16 years, the United States has repeatedly expressed concern to Israel over that country's intentions to send military hardware to Ethiopia, American and Israeli officials said. Israel is thought to be eager to establish a strong relationship with the Ethiopian Government because it wants its cooperation in allowing remaining Ethiopian Jews to emigrate to Israel.
 
A Variety of Allegations
Several weeks ago, after what Administration officials called ''allegations from different sources'' that cluster bombs or a similarly destructive weapon had been used against rebels, the United States sent a message to Israel asking for clarification on whether it had provided the weapons to Ethiopia.
Israel denied that it was sending cluster bombs, but was less definitive about what it had done in the recent past, an Administration official said. ''There was a little wiggle room on what they have done in the past,'' the official said.
Ethiopian diplomats in Washington were not available for comment today.
The cluster bomb is a canister packed with hundreds of bomblets. After the bomb is dropped from an aircraft, a small explosion opens the canister in midair, and the bomblets are spread over an area that is usually several hundred feet in diameter.
Israel has developed its own version of the cluster bomb, but the United States contends that Israel cannot export the weapon without approval in advance because it was developed using American technology and is therefore subject to American export restrictions.
 
Own Weapons, Israel Says
Israel, however, says that its cluster bomb is based on its own technology and not subject to American regulations.
The United States suspended deliveries of cluster bombs to Israel after they were used against civilian areas during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. No new cluster bombs have been delivered to Israel since then, although the ban was lifted in the last months of the Reagan Administration.
Administration and Israeli officials said the United States has raised the issue of military help to Ethiopia, including allegations about the shipment of cluster bombs, several times and at high levels since the beginning of November. Israeli officials said, for example, that the American Ambassador to Israel, William A. Brown, has discussed the matter with a number of Israeli Cabinet ministers.
Ruth Yaron, a spokeswoman at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, denied that Israel is sending them to Ethiopia. ''Israel does not sell or give cluster bombs to Ethiopia,'' she said.
 
At Carter's Initiative
The subject first came to light last month in a speech and news conference by former President Jimmy Carter after a trip to Ethiopia; Mr. Carter was trying to mediate an end to the long civil war between the Ethiopian Government and rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. The State Department said today that it does not have recent or reliable figures for the number of people who have died in that civil strife. Deaths in great numbers have occurred both in fighting and from famine exacerbated by the confict.
Mr. Carter, speaking in Atlanta at a ceremony honoring Palestinian and Israeli human rights workers, said, ''In Addis Ababa, I was told that there was new hope that the war could soon be ended, because the Ethiopian Air Force had recently acquired cluster bombs from one of our Middle East allies to be used against rebel villages.''
He added that although the United States had sold cluster bombs to ''one or two countries'' to be used only as defensive weapons in case of invasion, ''those allies are manufacturing cluster bombs to be sold in the third world, without further constraint on their use.'' Mr. Carter did not say which countries he was referring to.
In a later news conference, Mr. Carter said he received the information on the cluster bombs from Bush Administration officials. ''It was American officials who said that the Ethiopian Government was quite happy that they had finally acquired cluster bombs, and they thought they could end the war quickly because of the devastating effect of those cluster bombs being dropped on the villages in the north,'' Mr. Carter said. Area of Carter's Sensitivity Mr. Carter's remarks went largely unnoticed at the time. Asked about Mr. Carter's speech the day after it was delivered, Richard Boucher, the deputy State Department spokesman, said, ''I don't have anything on that subject.''
Asked about the issue this week, however, a number of officials said that they would not disagree with what the former President said.
Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman for the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, said Mr. Carter stands by his public statements but would have no further comment on the issue. Mr. Carter might be reluctant to comment further since he probably received the information in classified briefings, Administration officials said.
In addition, Mr. Carter is extremely sensitive about the issue of cluster bombs since it was he who originally approved their sale to Israel, a former aide to Mr. Carter said.
 
Emigration Rights
After Israel and Ethiopia re-established diplomatic relations, Israel agreed in principle to send military hardware to Addis Ababa, including captured Soviet ammunition and spare parts, Administration officials said. In return, the Government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam promised to allow more Ethiopian Jews to emigrate, they said.
There are about 18,000 Jews remaining in Ethiopia, Miss Yaron of the Israeli Embassy said. In 1985, Israeli officials in a secret airlift brought thousands of the black Jews to Israel, using more than $60 million raised abroad.
But Israeli officials have since assured the United States that the military agreement is very modest and that they would not provide Ethiopia with advanced military hardware.
Ethiopia is among several African nations to have recently restored relations with Israel as the Government in Jerusalem sought to end its diplomatic isolation from Africa and establish economic and military relationships.

HEADLINE: WHY PLANE TRAVEL ISN'T ALWAYS FAST

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
USAir Flight 188 from Washington to Cleveland had a perfect record in November. It was never on time.
The flight, with delays averaging 42 minutes from its scheduled arrival time, was the most notorious of the 59 appearing in the latest monthly Federal report on flights that arrive late at least 80 percent of the time, a report that Department of Transportation employees call the list of shame.
USAir, which has taken several steps to correct the delays on Flight 188 and on other flights, had some unique problems. But Flight 188's troubles also illustrate the more common reasons for a sharp increase in air traffic delays last year, despite efforts by airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to improve performance. 
The Government reported last week that the number of delays - defined as planes delayed by air traffic controllers for 15 minutes or more - rose 14 percent last year, to 393,000.
For airlines, the late flights are costly because of added fuel and labor expenses and the more intangible expense of lost consumer confidence. For passengers, the cost is exacted in frustration.
 
Rolling With the Punches
''I've learned to sit back and roll with the punches,'' said Edward J. Sowinski, a Cleveland businessman who flies to Washington twice a month. He said that Flight 188 had never left on time for him, and that delays sometimes lasted an hour and a half.
Mr. Sowinski said he had considered switching to a different airline but is a member of USAir's frequent-flier program and does not want to lose those benefits.
The airlines say the delays are mainly caused by an air traffic control system with outdated equipment and a shortage of controllers. To try to solve the problems, they are taking steps like rerouting planes and adjusting departure times.
For instance, USAir recently rescheduled Flight 188's departure time to early afternoon, when there is less congestion, and changed the plane's itinerary before it reaches Washington. Now the flight arrives on time 77 percent of the time, said Jim Tabor, the USAir executive charged with getting the airline's schedule back on track.
But consumer groups argue that the airlines are not working hard enough. They say that the late flights are a result of unrealistic scheduling, and that airlines tend to accept the problem as a part of doing business. They have called for tougher action against carriers with consistently tardy flights.
Two bills have been introduced in Congress relating to airline service. One bill by Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, would require airlines to tell passengers why a flight is delayed before they board and compensate passengers if a flight is canceled. A similar bill sponsored by Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, would prohibit airlines from canceling flights with less than 24 hours' notice unless they provide alternative service.
USAir flights have been so late so often that the airline could face fines from the Department of Transportation if it does not improve its record soon, a department official said.
USAir accounted for 41 of the 59 flights that appeared on the Transportation Department's list in November, the most recent period for which statistics are available. The airline has been ranked last in on-time performance among the nation's largest airlines for the past four months, with only 64 percent of its flights arriving on time in November.
The Transportation Department official, Marty Langelan, an economist, said the department gives an airline three months to remedy a chronically late flight before taking action. Under coaxing from the Government, airlines have managed to keep particular flights from reappearing on the list of shame. Still, each month, dozens of new flights appear, but no airline has ever been fined.
Despite its poor on-time record, USAir's financial performance has made it well regarded on Wall Street. ''Financially, it's one of the strongest carriers,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst with Dillon, Read.
USAir executives said they are attempting to improve on-time performance for all their flights, even those to small cities in the East, where they often have a monopoly on the route. ''We don't have any throwaway flights,'' said Thomas G. Kephart, vice president of operations services.
 
Special Problems
To be sure, USAir has problems that are unique in the industry. With nearly 3,000 daily departures, USAir has more flights than any airline in the world except Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier. Many routes are in the Northeast, where bad weather and congestion can cause frequent delays. Also, USAir planes must fly as many as eight segments, or flight legs, each day, exposing the airline to more chances for delays.
The airline is also still reeling from its merger with Piedmont Airlines in August, after having swallowed Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1987. For several months, labor contracts prohibited the airline from mixing pilots and flight attendants from USAir and Piedmont, complicating the already knotty art of crew scheduling.
But many of USAir's problems are common to the industry. With fleets expanding, with air traffic on the rise and with only one new airport slated to be built this decade (in Denver), experts warn that all airlines face increasing delays.
While the Government said severe weather accounted for more than half the delays last year, experts also cited a shortage of air traffic controllers, occasional computer failures and the growth of hub airports where flights are concentrated. At such airports, the bunching of flights at certain convenient times frequently leads to delays.
 
Crowded Schedules
Flight 188, for example, was scheduled for several months to leave Washington at about the same time as six other USAir flights, as well as many other flights.
Airlines try to use their planes as much as possible, and when the planes are scheduled so that they stop in many cities, a small delay at the beginning of the day can snowball. For instance, before flying to Washington, the DC-9 that would become Flight 188 flew from Chicago to Philadelphia and then Buffalo, on to Toronto and back to Buffalo before finally arriving in Washington. As a result, it often arrived late in Washington, said Mr. Tabor, the USAir executive.
Ms. Langelan at the Transportation Department said the airlines could help guard against late flights by spacing departure times and lengthening the time planes spend on the ground between flights, especially at hub airports.
In what Mr. Tabor called ''a bow to reality,'' USAir did just that. It revised its entire schedule last month to improve its performance, adding a total of 120 hours daily to its published flight times.
To remedy Flight 188's dismal performance, USAir moved the departure time from 3:35 P.M. to 2:20, when fewer flights are scheduled to leave Washington National, one of the nation's busiest airports. The airline also increased the plane's turnaround time - the time on the ground at Washington - to 39 minutes from 31 and added eight minutes to the scheduled flight time to compensate for stronger headwinds.
Finally, it changed the plane's itinerary earlier in the day, routing it clear of congested airports so that it was more likely to arrive in Washington on time. Instead of flying to cities like Chicago and Philadelphia, the plane is routed through cities like Norfolk, Va., before flying on to Washington.
 
A Tug of War
Mr. Tabor pointed out that within an airline, a tug-of-war is often waged between the marketing and operations departments. ''They want to sell seats, and we're trying to run the airline on time,'' Mr. Tabor said. ''There's a lot of give-and-take.''
More often than not, the marketing department wins. Flights are then bunched during prime hours, creating gridlock in the morning and evening. For instance, American Airlines has 41 departures scheduled within a half-hour in Dallas.
Daniel Smith, director of industry and government affairs for the International Airline Passengers Association, said that although the airlines have begun to space their departure times, they are reluctant to give up popular departure slots. ''The operating expense of running 45 minutes late is well offset by the fact that they have filled up the airplane,'' he said.
 
What People Want
But Stephen Hayes, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group, said the airlines are simply giving passengers what they want. ''People want to leave at 5, 6 and 7 in the evening,'' he said. ''We're responding to market demands.'' Mr. Hayes said the solution lies in expanding and modernizing the air traffic system, not in juggling airline schedules.
Still, hub airports seem especially vulnerable to delays, which can ripple throughout an airline's route system. At least one airline has tried to contain the delays caused by a congested hub by changing the way it schedules flights to help reduce the effect of a troublesome hub airport. To reduce the domino effect, American Airlines has routed its planes from Chicago so that they return directly to that city rather than flying on to a third city.
''We accept that Chicago isn't going to be an on-time hub for quite a while,'' said Dan Knerman, manager of systems operations control for American Airlines. ''At least we can allow the other hubs to run on time.''
United Airlines, the largest carrier at Chicago, has staggered its departure times there and scheduled its flights earlier, said Thomas Lagow, senior vice president for planning. ''We've definitely spread the day out more,'' he said. ''A flight that used to leave at 7 now leaves at 6:45.''
But some people are still not satisfied. Wayne Dimmic, who publishes a newsletter and software program that tracks the most delayed flights and airports in the country, questioned the airlines' commitment to eliminating their chronically late flights.
''The airlines will adjust these flights just enough to get the public off their backs,'' he said. ''If nothing else, they'll change the flight numbers.''

HEADLINE: The City of Mayor Barry: Achievement and Decay

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
On Friday afternoon, David A. Clarke, the chairman of the City Council here, said with evident anxiety, ''The most important thing I want to project to the people of Washington and across the nation is that this city is under control.''
That's not the picture people have been getting. When they think of Washington, many people think no more of the elegant city that Pierre L'Enfant laid out, with its white marble monuments evoking the splendor of ancient Greece and Rome, nor of Presidents and senators and judges.
They think of a febrile city of fear and violence. They call it the national capital of murder and cocaine, this place where the homeless lie disconsolately on heat grates a block from the White House. And now they can talk about a capital city whose Mayor was busted. 
Tonight, close political associates of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. were said to be pressing him not to seek re-election, to resign or at least to seek medical treatment for his own good and that of the city. There were reports that he would announce Sunday morning that he would seek treatment.
 
No Fourth Term, Lawyer Urges
His lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, said Mr. Barry should not seek a fourth term because a campaign would interfere with his legal defense. ''Under those circumstances,'' Mr. Mundy said on WJLA television, ''I believe trying to run a campaign and do the things he must as an accused person would be incompatible with one another.''
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said on an NBC News broadcast that Mr. Barry appeared to have committed a ''moral felony.'' He added that Mr. Barry in private was ''not resisting admitting that a problem exists'' with his legal situation and his political future.
The arrest of Mayor Barry on cocaine charges Thursday night, compounding years of negative television and newspaper images, has solidified for Washington a reputation as unsavory as Chicago's 60 years ago in the era of submachine guns and bootleggers. It has sapped the confidence of people, great and small, who live in this city. For many of the Mayor's supporters in the core of Washington, it left a trail of confusion, anger and hurt. [Page 26.] Home Rule Seen in Jeopardy It has derailed the effort, already going uphill, to win statehood for the District of Columbia, and some worry that it might erode support for the 16-year-old home-rule legislation that ended the era of total Congressional control in Washington. Coincidentally, it was the excesses of another leader -Alexander (Boss) Shepherd, the city's corrupt second territorial governor, appointed in 1874 - that led to a century of rule by Congressional committees here.
Yet in his dozen years in office, Mr. Barry helped preside over Washington's coming of age - its emergence as a world-class center for the arts, an important business headquarters, a city with restaurants of national repute. Pennsylvania Avenue was rebuilt; so was the old downtown area, where hotels and office buildings, clad in the fashionable postmodern idiom, replaced porno shops and pawnbrokers.
Real estate values soared in largely white residential Northwest Washington, which retained some of the leafy calm and civility of small-town life. But there were alarms, too.
Once confined to areas that lawyers and lobbyists seldom visited, the violence began creeping, in the last couple of years, into the Dupont Circle area and toward the luxurious enclaves of Georgetown and Cleveland Park.
Drugs are sold and people are murdered these days eight or ten blocks from multimillion-dollar houses owned by C. Boyden Gray, one of President Bush's advisers, and Benjamin C. Bradlee, the executive editor of The Washington Post, and Pamela Harriman, the philanthropist and Democratic Party figure.
For some of the city's black residents, who constitute more than three-quarters of the population, the Democratic Mayor's ability to speak their language, to identify himself with their troubles, to win the allegiance of their clergymen and to take on the white news media with seeming impunity, was enough, even when he was accused, again and again, of infidelity and drug use.
Others came to consider him an embarrassment even before this week's stunning denouement. One of these was Delicia Jackson, a 24-year-old secretary who said his arrest made her ''as happy as the Fourth of July.''
Barry supporters insisted that he ran the city as well as anyone could in a tough era for cities. Streets were cleared promptly after early-winter snowfalls last year, they noted, in contrast to 1986, when a huge storm paralyzed Washington for three days while Mayor Barry went to the Super Bowl.
''He's managed to provide general services in a reasonable way,'' said Edward C. Sylvester Jr., staff director of the House District Committee.
''I think this city has come back a lot'' since the riots of 1968, said Frank Shaforth, Director of Federal Relations for the National League of Cities.
But others, like Clifford L. Alexander Jr., a lawyer and former Secretary of the Army who ran unsuccessfully for Mayor 15 years ago, before Mr. Barry's time, vehemently disagreed.
''He's been an awful Mayor,'' said Mr. Alexander, who lives on Capitol Hill. ''Those of us who live here are suffering from more murders per day than we'd ever had. We're suffering from failed city services. We're suffering from the fact that people can't hold their heads up as city employees.''
''The issue for most people is renewing their driver's license, potholes, collecting garbage, health care, jobs and equity in the job market,'' Mr. Alexander added. ''If you had a progressive mayor and a person of vision and excitement, he would have turned the city around. He didn't at all. The city has shown economic progress. The haves have done well. The have-nots are ignored more and more.''
Roger W. Wilkins, Clarence J. Robinson professor of American history and culture at George Mason University, added: ''You want good government. You want your taxes to be well spent. You don't want the wheels on your automobile continually pounded to bits with potholes, and you want, when you go to face your city government, you want efficiency and good manners. That's the bare minimum, and we weren't getting the bare minimum.''
It is not that the ''haves'' escape taxation to provide money for the common weal. According to a recent study by the District's own Department of Finance and Revenue, Washington's tax burden was higher than those in any of the Virginia and Maryland suburban jurisdictions around it and higher than that in 50 other large cities. A family of four earning $25,000 a year paid $2,514 in taxes in 1989, as against an average of $2,085 in the 51 cities studied.
While reports of phantom inspection services and disintegrating, vermin-ridden public housing provide staple reading in the local press, the city's work force has increased by 10,000 people in the past six years. With almost 50,000 workers for a population of about 620,000, it has one of the highest ratios of employees to residents of any city in the country.
 
The Backlog of Neglect
The headline in the Washington Monthly magazine a year ago offered a searing indictment - ''The Worst City Government in America'' - and the accompanying article offered a tour of a squalid landscape of inefficiency and neglect over several years of Mr. Barry's 11-year tenure as Mayor: 2,700 backlogged maintenance requests on public housing, although there are 80 percent more maintenance men on the payroll per apartment than the Housing and Urban Development Department recommends; an eight-year wait for a woman trying to get into public housing and subsisting on a $359 monthly disability check; a patient at the city's largest nursing home dying of exposure 50 feet from her dormitory; ambulances losing their way while heart attack victims died.
Most stark, perhaps, is the way people die in the District, which has not only the highest murder rate in the country but the highest infant mortality rate of the nation's top 20 cities. In 1986, Washington had 21.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births. For the first six months of 1989, the figure was 23.8.
''The public health system isn't capable of coping with the need,'' said Joseph Liu, of the Children's Defense Fund, pointing out that severe financing cutbacks forced most prenatal clinics to cut back their hours. ''In other cities there has been a very serious investment in prenatal care and infant mortality rates. They've kept it as a higher priority than Washington has.''
As in other large cities, the failures of the government of the District of Columbia are felt most acutely by the poor, the elderly and the homeless, who need the most help. The big winners, in Marion Barry's Washington, have been the developers.
''The business community under Marion Barry has done better than it's ever done in its life,'' said Mr. Sylvester of the District Committee.
Those who built the buildings grew rich and many gave the money that enabled Mr. Barry to run effective campaigns.
The city's budget fell out of balance two years ago, and some much-criticized bookkeeping legerdemain was required to get it into balance for this year.
Nonetheless, the city and its Mayor have become ''a focus of national ridicule,'' as Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said the other day. That galls blacks like Roger Wilkins.
''I was returning from a speaking engagement in Reno the other day,'' the writer and longtime civil rights worker said. ''I was five miles above southern Utah and I opened The Reno Journal-Gazette and there's an editorial cartoon showing the Mayor as a clown. It makes you cringe. You cringe because the Mayor had become not a symbol of leadership for black people anymore but a symbol for white people of black incompetence and self-indulgence.
''It was a symbol that ranked right up there with all of the symbols that people used to discredit Reconstruction governments in the South a hundred years ago.''
That symbolism, he says, has postponed the day when Washington gets full self-government and made it harder than ever to deal with the drug epidemic that is causing what he called ''catastrophic destruction of black youngsters.'' Instead of giving people here hope, Mr. Wilkins said bitterly, Marion Barry ''turned them cynical.''

HEADLINE: Report Warns of Pollution in Eastern Europe

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
While efforts to restore clean air to the United States have met with partial success, there is a far greater ecological disaster brewing in Eastern Europe, a report on worldwide air pollution said today.
The report, issued by the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based environmental group, warned that gains in the West are quickly being negated by the unrestricted burning of high-sulfur brown coal and diesel fuel that is blackening cities across Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
''Fishless lakes and streams, dying forests, and faceless ancient sculptures all provide sad testimony to the destruction that industrialization has wrought,'' wrote Hilary F. French, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute and author of the report, ''Clearing the Air: A Global Agenda.'' The notion that ''pollution is the price of progress'' has become antiquated, she said. 
Hasty industrialization in the East after World War II, powered by the region's abundance of brown coal, has resulted in air quality reminiscent of London at its Dickensian worst, Ms. French wrote.
The city of Olkosz, Poland, reports one of the highest levels of lead and cadmium in the soil in the world, the report said, and acid rain has turned the panoramic mountains along the East German and Czechoslovakian border into a vast expanse of dead trees.
''The lack of market forces kept these countries from realizing the impressive gains in energy efficiency registered in the West after the oil shocks of the Seventies, and their weak economies still preclude major investments in pollution control,'' the report said.
Richard Mott, director of the atmospheric-pollution program at the Environmental Law Institute in Washington, agreed that air pollution in Eastern Europe is some of the worst in the world. The problem is the price of fixing it.
''The technologies are extremely expensive even by Western standards,'' Mr. Mott said in a recent interview. ''It's a technological luxury we've been able to afford. It's not realistic to think those technologies are going to spring up in the East themselves, despite the enormous need for them there.''
To begin tackling pollution in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, these countries will need Western know-how as well as domestic reform, the report said. ''Now that air pollution and its damaging health and ecological effects have proliferated around the globe, crossing borders with winds, international cooperation is critical,'' it said. ''Nations that receive the bulk of their pollution from other countries have an obvious interest in sharing and financing the technical means to reduce that pollution.''
While the United States has been slow to deal with air pollution on a global scale, European nations have begun to help their neighbors in the East with pollution-control devices.
The report said West Germany is donating $163 million to East Germany for pollution control. Sweden announced it is spending $45 million in Poland over the next three years, mostly to cut airborne pollutants.
Increasing pressure on Eastern countries to improve their air should not hinder domestic reform, argued C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Any investment will create jobs and orders for new products, and it can just as well be for environmentally safe ends, he added.
''If you do it right, you can simultanously pursue environmental and economic objectives,'' Mr. Bergsten said. ''Starting from scratch makes it even easier to accomplish environmentally sound objectives.''
 
Not a Simple Switch
Ms. French warned that Western industrial countries must not simply transfer their pollution-control methods to the East and the third world. She argued that the ''technological Band-Aids prescribed by the regulatory intervention'' cannot deliver their promises of clean air.
Instead, she said, traditional efforts need to be supported by policies that encourage energy efficiency and develop alternative sources that spew out fewer toxic wastes.

HEADLINE: Delaware Tries to Erase Image of Its Poor Health

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 19

 BODY:
Gov. Michael N. Castle has a problem: scientific studies saying that people who live in Delaware are among the least healthy in the nation.
The solution he is offering presents a case study in how government officials must deal with both a problem and the image created by that problem.
''It's a perception problem,'' Governor Castle said in an interview Thursday. ''But perception can become reality if you don't combat it. Frankly, a lot of people here believe that the health problems are not as severe as stated in the studies.'' 
Health is a new concern in Delaware, becoming a major issue with the publication of the scientific data last year. The Governor says, and health experts back him up, that there is nothing within Delaware - no special pollution problem or industry waste sites - that make it an especially unhealthy place. The problem, as elsewhere in the country, involves access to medical care, the quality of that care and the choices that people make in their diets and behavior.
 
He Wants a Solid Message
But he is afraid that the qualified message will not come through to those who hear only casual reports about the studies. One is a report from the Centers for Disease Control that ranks the state first in breast cancer and sixth over all in chronic but largely preventable diseases. The second is a study by the Northwestern National Insurance Company ranking the state last over all in 16 areas dealing with health and related risk factors like smoking and alcohol consumption.
The Governor's concern is that people will hear about the state's ranking and immediately think about the state's chemical and automobile factories that are polluting the environment. Delaware companies release more than 200 million pounds of pollutants a year into the environment, a considerable amount for so small a state, but there are not enough environmental health standards to judge what impact these pollutants have on health. There are only a half dozen Federal air quality standards, and the state has, with few exceptions, always met them.
The Governor, a Republican elected in 1984 and again in 1988, has addressed the issue of health care in speeches over the last month, including his State of the State Message last week. His $1.23 billion budget request for 1991 includes $250 million for health and social services, a 10 percent increase over spending in the current fiscal year, which ends in July.
 
A Mobile Mammography Lab
This month he announced a comprehensive Cancer Control Plan that will have the State Department of Health identify where cancers are most prevalent in the state, assess environmental and behavioral risk factors and establish programs for prevention and early detection. New programs will include a mobile mammography laboratory for use in inner-city neighborhoods and expansion of experimenal programs like health clinics in public schools.
He has also called on Delaware residents to ''abandon their deadly habits,'' adding that of every 100 residents an estimated 28 smoke, 10 abuse alcohol, 60 do not wear seat belts, 50 have high cholesterol levels, 26 are obese and 24 have high blood pressure.
As part of the Governor's public relations campaign to change people's way of living, he said he will ask his Cabinet members to take fitness tests, improve their diets and start exercise programs. ''Three or four won't be happy,'' he said. ''They are not in great shape.''
Experts in both health and communications say Governor Castle is right to confront the state's health problem rather than dodge it. But they add that even if the programs he has announced help reduce mortality rates, the stigma brought on by the state's current low standing in health surveys could have a far-reaching and long-lasting negative social and economic impact.
As a prime example, they say New Jersey and its residents have long suffered from the state's reputation as ''Cancer Alley'' even though statistics have not supported that branding for decades. ''Cancer Alley doesn't exist anymore, but the perception lingers,'' said Dr. Michael Greenberg, professor of public health and a cancer epidemiologist at Rutgers University.
 
Chronic Disease Death Rates
Studies indicated that Delaware has a relatively high mortality rate for several chronic diseases. It has the highest mortality rate for breast cancer and diabetes, the sixth-highest for heart disease and the eighth-highest for cirrhosis, according to a study of 1986 mortality rates published this week in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The state ranked sixth in the nation, based on its overall mortality rate for nine chronic diseases that were surveyed because they are considered to be largely preventable through early detection or changes in diet and behavior. The nine diseases were stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon-rectal cancer and cirrhosis.
The low ranking in the Federal study was not news to Governor Castle, who received a preview copy of the study in November. But he had already been put on the defensive by the study by Northwestern National Life Insurance of Minneapolis.
That study ranked Delaware last among states based upon 16 health factors and related behavior. The health factors included the incidence of chronic diseases, overall mortality rates, infant mortality rates, life expectancy and access to health care.
 
'Low Across the Board'
The style-of-life factors included prevalence of smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise and missed days at school or work. ''Delaware ranked low across the board,'' said David Ordos, Northwestern's manager of research.
Thomas P. Eichler, Secretary of Delaware's Department of Health and Social Services, found fault with the research techniques used in the insurance study. ''We could quibble over statistics and whether or not Delaware is the unhealthiest state,'' he said. ''But the point is we know we have some health problems and we are trying to address them.''
Health officials in nine other states that had high mortality rates in the Federal study also expressed concern about their ranking, but, unlike Delaware officials, most had been aware of their state's problems for many years.
Business groups are already concerned about the impact of Delaware's health problems. ''From a chamber of commerce point of view, it's a real negative when you're trying to relocate businesses and people into the state,'' said Jack A. Nylund, president of the Southern Delaware Chamber of Commerce. ''One of the first questions we always get is, 'How good is your medical care community?' If this label, 'the least healthy state,' sticks, it will have long-range impact.''
 
DEATHS FROM NINE DISEASES
 
Deaths per 100,000 population from corornary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulminary disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer or cirrhosis in 1986.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS SHOW GAINS IN LOYALTY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
The Republican Party enjoyed virtual parity in 1989 with the Democrats in the loyalty of Americans for the first time since just after World War II ended.
Forty-four percent of Americans identified themselves as Republicans or said they leaned that way in 1989, and 46 percent said they were Democrats or leaning so. The figures are based on data from 8,719 interviews in seven New York Times/CBS News Polls conducted through the year. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus one percentage point. 
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken Jan. 13 to 15 of this year, shows that the closeness between the parties is persisting into the 1990's, with 45 percent calling themselves Democrats or leaning toward the party and 44 percent siding with the Republicans.
The percentages show the continuation of a trend that raised hopes among Republicans and concern among Democrats throughout the last decade.
 
Peaks After Elections
In 1980, the Republicans were clearly a minority party, with 34 percent of Americans identifying themselves as Republicans or leaning toward the Republicans, while 53 percent said they were Democrats or leaning toward the Democrats.
The responses in the polls represent the partisan sense Americans have of themselves, not how they are registered or how they voted in any election. Data for the 1980's showed Republican strength peaking in the year after the Presidential elections: 1981, 1985 and 1989. After 1981 and 1985, the Democrats regained some but not all of the ground they lost, only to fall back again after the next Presidential race.
Since modern public opinion polling made such measurement of partisan mood possible in the 1930's, the Republican have been this close to the Democrats only once. That was in 1946, amid the economic upheavals of military demobilization, when 40 percent identified themselves in The Gallup Poll with the Republicans and 39 percent with the Democrats. The Republicans won control of both houses of Congress that year.
But after that, the Democrats opened a large advantage, which persisted into the 1980's.
 
Republicans Attract the Young
Some political analysts have argued that a significant, if gradual, realignment of party loyalties is under way, although others have suggested that as parties have become weaker, party identification is less and less important.
Republicans continued to be strongest among the youngest voters. Times/ CBS News Polls showed that among Americans 18 to 29 years old, 51 percent identified themselves last year as Republicans or leaning that way, while 40 percent sided with the Democrats. In the January poll, the margin was narrower.
Democrats still enjoyed a modest advantage among core partisans in 1989. Excluding the independents who said they leaned to one party or the other, 36 percent of the Times/CBS News Poll respondents in 1989 identified themselves as Democrats, and 32 percent picked the Republicans. This was a dramatic narrowing of the gap from 1980, when 41 percent identified themselves as Democrats and 23 percent said they were Republicans.
It was when the 28 percent who initially described themselves as independent were pressed to choose the party closest to them, a common survey technique, that the Democratic advantage closed to the 46-to-44 margin.
The two parties continue to have distinctly different constituents in the January poll. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed with incomes of more than $50,000 indentified themselves as Republicans, while 39 percent said they were Democrats. At the same time, 53 percent of those with incomes of less than $15,000 said they were Democrats, and 30 percent said they were Republicans.

HEADLINE: Longshoremen Strike in Baltimore, Idling Port, After Internal Dispute

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Port of Baltimore was idled today when dockworkers went on strike. About 2,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association put up picket lines at the port, where 13 ships were scheduled to call this weekend.
Port managers and elected officials warned that a strike of more than two weeks could prompt shipping companies to take their business to competing East Coast ports, dealing the city an economic blow. 
The strike was a result of a dispute between two of the port's five union locals over allocation of jobs under a tentative contract agreement. The rank and file was to have voted on the contract Friday. Economic issues had already been settled; the longshoremen are paid $18 an hour.
 
'So Many Families'
William J. Detweiler, president of Steamship Trade Association of Baltimore, an employers' group, said a prolonged strike would mean ''we're going to lose business, some irretrievably.''
Representative Helen Delich Bentley, a Maryland Republican, said as many as 30,000 people could suffer direct or indirect loss of income because of the strike. ''Unfortunately, so many people are going to be hurt, so many families,'' she said. ''Efforts to improve Baltimore's name will be put way back for a long time.''
Most of the ships due at the port were expected to be diverted to other harbors. About 2,500 ships call at Baltimore each year, but the number has been declining as shippers move to competing ports.
Baltimore has lost 29 steamship lines in the last five years to the port of Hampton Roads, Va. Virginia ports have lured away much of the cargo that moved by rail between Baltimore and the Midwest.
Gov. William Donald Schaefer has said in recent weeks that the state would take over the port's operations if there is a strike, but he declined to comment on the walkout Saturday.
The longshoremen's union in Baltimore is alone in the nation in having failed to reach an agreement on local work rules. The agreement that was to be voted by workers Friday would have eliminated what management says is one of the port's worst problems: rules allowing the union to decide when crews stop work for bad weather.
But the tentative accord prompted a dispute between two union locals, one representing clerks and the other cargo handlers. The agreement would have reduced the number of clerks and increased the number of handlers.

HEADLINE: Police Pension Fund Will Invest in Loans Guaranteed by U.S.

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
For the first time, a New York City employees' pension fund will invest in federally guaranteed bank loans as part of a city effort to promote greater economic growth by making more loan funds available for small businesses.
Under a program announced last week by City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, the Police Pension Fund will purchase $50 million in loans backed by the Federal Small Business Administration that are to be offered by five lending institutions. The banks will use the money they get from the pension fund to make additional loans backed by the S.B.A.
With Harrison J. Goldin, the former Comptroller, joining in the announcement, Ms. Holtzman described the development as ''an example of a win- win'' in which every participant would benefit - the city, the pension fund, the banks and the borrowers, many of which will be minority-owned businesses. 
She said the program, which was set in motion before Mr. Goldin left office on Dec. 31, would create additional jobs by helping small businesses and, ''best of all, potentially generate new revenues for the city.''
 
Lenders in Program
The five lenders taking part in the program are the Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, the Freedom National Bank, the Capital National Bank and the Business Loan Center. Until now, Ms. Holtzman said, those institutions have not for the most part offered such loans.
The portion of the loans guaranteed by the S. B. A. - generally 85 percent of the loan, up to $750,000 - will be put into securities, which the Police Pension Fund will buy for its investment portfolio.
James Gebhardt, the president of the Lieutenants' Benevolent Association and a trustee of the Police Pension Fund, said the fund would receive on its investment ''a rate of return that will be higher than a comparable government note or bond with the same maturity and guarantee.''
Loans to qualified borrowers can range from $25,000 to $1 million and run from 5 to 25 years.

HEADLINE: SUSPECT ARRESTED IN RAZOR ATTACKS

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
After a weeklong search that took detectives to Miami Beach, a Brooklyn teen-ager was arrested yesterday in the razor-slashings of two people, including the actress Viveca Lindfors, as they walked in Greenwich Village on Jan. 13. The police said the suspect was high on LSD and alcohol during the attacks.
The suspect, Peter Bedford, 18 years old, of 543 Third Street in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, was arrested at 4:45 A.M. in a friend's home on Sixth Street, where he had been hiding, said Ronald Fenrich, chief of Manhattan detectives. 
Mr. Bedford was charged with two counts of assault and one count of criminal possession of a dangerous weapon. The police said he is unemployed and was planning to go to college next year. They said he does not have a police record.
The police said Mr. Bedford slashed the two people with a single-edge razor blade in separate attacks on Jan. 13 about 1:30 A.M.
 
'Under the Influence'
''He was high; he was under the influence. He was running down the street acting wildly, and for no reason he slashed the two people without any confrontation, no provocation,'' Chief Fenrich said.
Ms. Lindfors, 69, was attacked in front of the Archives, an apartment building at 666 Greenwich Street. She received 28 stiches on her left ear. Five minutes earlier and three blocks away, 36-year-old Dennis Beal of Manhattan was slashed from his right ear to his chin. Forty stitiches were needed to close his wound.
Chief Fenrich said that before the attacks Mr. Bedford and seven friends had been asked to leave Tek Billiards at Chrisopher Street and Seventh Avenue after a dispute with other customers.
The police said that after the assault Mr. Bedford returned to Brooklyn alone by taxi; obtained money from his home, where he lives with his mother and two siblings, and then flew to Miami Beach with a friend, whom the police did not identify and whom they said was not part of the group at the billiards parlor.
The police said two anonymous phone calls helped identify Mr. Bedford as the assailant. Detectives tracked him to a Miami Beach hotel, only to find he had returned to Brooklyn. The detectives traced telephone calls from Mr. Bedford's hotel to a house in Brooklyn, where they arrested him.

HEADLINE: City Environmental Agency Will Move to Queens

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
In a major step to disperse part of New York City's bureaucracy outside Manhattan, the Department of Environmental Protection will shift its headquarters and half of its 5,000 employees to Queens next fall.
City officials say the planned move to Corona - which will make the department the only mayoral agency besides the Fire Department to have its central offices outside Manhattan -will lower the city's leasing costs and increase the agency's efficiency. They also say it is in line with a policy of bolstering neighborhoods across the city with government workers to fill vacant office space and patronize local shops.
But agency employees who oppose the switch say that it will introduce new inefficiencies. And they warn that the longer commute for many of them will cause some of the department's most experienced and valued professionals to quit. 
The planned move - to the Long Island Expressway and Junction Boulevard - illustrates the economic and morale considerations that municipal managers must juggle in determining the benefits of such shifts. In this case, officials said, the pluses outweigh the minuses.
The officials noted that the main offices of the environmental department's bureaus were now scattered in a half dozen locations in lower and midtown Manhattan. They said this often made it time-consuming and cumbersome for the staff to do business.
The decision to unite in another borough - in two adjacent buildings owned by the Lefrak Organization -was made because ''it was too costly to consolidate in Manhattan,'' said Alan Schoor, first assistant commissioner of the Department of General Services, which arranges quarters for city agencies.
William Cusick, another General Services official, said that besides trying to avoid the high costs of Manhattan rents, city officials now pursue ''the more equitable distribution of city facilities in the five boroughs.''
But Louis Albano, president of the Civil Service Technical Guild - which represents 1,200 engineers, chemists and other professionals in the environmental agency - reported that many of his union members ''have said they would quit if the move was made.'' He said that commuting time for many to the new offices ''will be quite extensive,'' up to two hours each way for those living in Westchester and New Jersey. There is subway service on the E, F, G and R lines within a few blocks of the offices.
He added that replacing such specialists would be difficult ''because the city doesn't offer enough.''
Mr. Cusick of General Services said, ''Anytime an agency makes a decision to move, some employees are going to be unhappy.'' Martha Holstein, a spokeswoman for the environmental agency, said that ''some people say they look forward to the move, it may be closer to where they live.''
A department employee who asked not to be identified held that the efficiencies from consolidating the agency would be negated because of the time lost when her colleagues would have to travel to Manhattan for meetings. Ms. Holstein said the benefits of the move would still predominate.
Employees also said that in one of the Manhattan buildings being vacated, the city spent several million dollars for extensive renovations to enable the environmental agency to move in only two years ago. Mr. Schoor of General Services said other city agencies could use the space in the future.
Much of the Lefrak space became vacant when the Federal Social Security Administration moved a year ago to Jamaica. Mr. Schoor said that the city's base annual rent to Lefrak for a half million square feet would be $9.45 per square foot to start, rising to $13.43 in the 11th through 20th years of the lease. Mr. Cusick said that those figures ''compare very favorably with what's available in the market'' in Queens.
City officials said that campaign contributions to former Mayor Edward I. Koch by members of the LeFrak family played no role in the selection of its buildings. A LeFrak spokesman, Howard J. Rubenstein, said such contributions totaled $3,000 from 1985 to 1989.

HEADLINE: Campus Lief: Wellesley;
Shadow Program Aims to Illumine Life After Degree

DATELINE: WELLESLEY, Mass.

 BODY:
January means winter term and almost no one is on the campus, but more than 150 Wellesley College students are getting some education about life after graduation. The students are participating in the annual Shadow Program, which enables a woman to follow an alumna in the field of her choice for a day in January. Organized by the college's Career Center, the program takes place in seven major cities.
The fields are varied and include working with the editor of Woman's Day in New York and following around the general manager of the Los Angeles Philharmonic or a deputy district attorney who prosecutes homicide cases in Los Angeles. 
Nora Manella, chief of criminal appeals for the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, has held that job for two years and been a Federal prosecutor for seven. ''I thought I had an interesting enough job,'' Ms. Manella said, and she wanted to show her ''shadow'' something besides civil and corporate law.
Her shadow, Brooke Frewing, a Wellesley junior majoring in economics and minoring in math, from La Canada, Calif., saw the sentencing of a convicted kingpin of a major cocaine ring. In addition, the two toured the chambers of a Federal judge. Having already spent time in a corporate law office, Miss Frewing wanted to see ''the contrast between private law practices and working for the Federal Government.''
 
'A Wonderful Field'
Ms. Manella explained that in high school she participated in a similar program, which enabled her to sit next to a judge on the bench for a full day. This experience, she said, ''left a vivid impression.'' In addition, she said, although a ''rigorous academic curriculum like that provided at Wellesley'' is the best training for later life, ''you obviously don't get exposure to various careers, and the program provides a unique opportunity to pop somebody into an environment that they would not otherwise have access to.''
Nancy Bell Coe, general manager for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said she volunteered to be in the shadow program because she thought she worked in ''a wonderful field, and I want everyone to know about it.'' In addition, she said, ''Any networking we can do is all to our benefit.''
Her shadow, Margaret Lo, a senior from Anaheim, Calif., majoring in English with a computer-science minor, has been playing the piano since she was 6 years old and has participated in concerts at Wellesley as well as helped arrange them. But she said, ''I had never really thought about all the behind-the-scenes work involved.''
Ms. Lo spent the day with Ms. Coe as she dealt with logistics and the coming concert series and its repertory. She also attended a rehearsal and a meeting with conductor Andre Previn, and she saw a concert in the evening. Ms. Lo said that while taking music courses and working in the music department office, she ''had been pointed in the direction of arts management.'' But she had thought that that would be very far down the road, after getting an M.B.A. ''But now I'm becoming very interested in this, and it may come sooner,'' she said.
 
Two Types of Students
Callie Crossley, a 1973 graduate who produces the Dr. Timothy Johnson medical segments for the ABC News program ''20/20,'' shows students the studio in New York and, depending on the day, the student may see her editing, researching, meeting with the director or seeing the taping of the program. ''It's supposed to be a workaday day, and that's what I provide,'' said Ms. Crossley, who has been involved in the shadow program since it began four years ago.
Ms. Crossley said she has seen two types of students: those very interested in a field and those who are still in the exploratory stages, ''crystallizing'' the various possibilities open to them. ''I feel very strongly about this kind of opportunity, and if I had that, I would have taken advantage of it,'' she said.
Aniella Gonzalez, a first-year student from Kearny, N.J., who followed Ms. Crossley, said she learned ''it is a plus to be computer-literate because not too many people are,'' noting that a lot of time was spent trying to retrieve a piece that was ''lost in the computer.''
Marcie Schorr Hirsch, who is director of the Career Center and who started the program after she had seen similar ones at other schools, said, ''We all have fantasies about careers, but very few of us actually know what they are really like.''
The students, she said, ''get to go into a day in the life of, and they get not only the cognitive piece of the job, they get the whole thing.'' The alumnae, she said, ''are not at entry level, but people who are a little further along'' and this gives students ''a look into their future.''

HEADLINE: Pastimes;
Stamps

BYLINE: By Barth Healey

 BODY:
The basic idea is interesting enough: Here was a United States postal rate that had endured with only minor interruptions for almost a century, through wars and a vast national expansion.
But research into this modest area yielded glimpses of spectacular inflation, the debasement of paper money and a tax on the better educated.
The rate in question is the 1-cent fee charged for ''drop letters,'' which were left at post offices to be picked up by the addressees. The rate was first established in 1794 when unified postal services finally supplanted the colonial potpourri; it was last ratified by the post office in 1885. 
The rate was low because almost no service was required. It was enough that postal employees retrieve the letters from the drop slot and keep them in a safe place.
But in reviewing the period just before the 1794 reorganization, one is struck by the sharp rate increases that the Government decreed after Independence. According to rate tables, gathered for the first time in Linn's Stamp Almanac, the last British colonial rates were, for example, 8 pence to carry a single letter sheet 60 to 100 miles from its destination. The first ''American'' postal rates lowered the British fees by 20 percent.
Then the inflationary roller coaster started: In 1777, postal rates were raised 50 percent. In April 1779, they were set at double the 1775 rates. In December that year, they were raised again, to 20 times the 1775 rates. Six months later, in May 1780, the rates were doubled again, to 40 times the original basic rate.
One reason for rocketing rates was a lack of faith in paper money, which was being issued by a variety of institutions in various states of financial health. This phenomenon was duly noted in December 1780, when postal rates returned to half what they had been in 1775 - if paid in coin. When rates finally stabilized, the fee to send a letter sheet from 60 to 100 miles was 10 cents; the top rate, for distances over 450 miles, it was 25 cents.
What accounted for such rates, during a period when 25 cents might be a day's wage and a good meal could be had for a few pennies? Mostly it was the high cost of maintaining a mail network to deliver very few letters. Literacy was not high, and commerce was narrowly based.In part, fees constituted a kind of tax on the literate.
With the drop rate pegged at 1 cent, postal history took a new twist: bootleg letters. If it cost 10 times more to mail a letter from Philadelphia to New York, for example, than to just drop it in a box in New York for pick up, it was worth finding someone travelling to New York to carry a letter.
The drop rate endured. There was a 50 percent surcharge, to 1 1/2 cent, in 1815-16 to raise money for the War of 1812, then the fee returned to 1 cent. As mail delivery became more efficient and growing volume reduced per-letter costs, routine first-class rates came down, to 5 cents a half ounce (up to 300 miles) in 1845; at the same time, the drop-letter rate was raised to 2 cents.
Examples of bootleg mail after 1845 are harder to find, but it still cost 40 cents to send a letter from coast to coast, and commercial mailers sometimes found it more efficient to send couriers.
In 1851, the drop-letter rate fell back to 1 cent, but the half-ounce rate was also reduced, to 3 cents for up to 3,000 miles, and to only 6 cents beyond 3,000 miles. Stamps were also being introduced, replacing the hand-written notations of fees paid.
The drop-letter rate changed once more, rising to 2 cents in 1863-65, to help pay for the costs of the Civil War. A black stamp showing Gen. Stonewall Jackson paid the rate. These stamps, known as Black Jacks, form a popular collecting study.
Hobbyists who want to know more about drop letters can write to The American Philatelist for reprints of a profusely illustrated article by Dr. James W. Milgram in September 1980. The address: Box 8000, State College, Pa. 16803. Linn's Stamp Almanac is available from Amos Press, Sidney, Ohio 45365.
A footnote: The basic letter rate of 1851 fell further, from 3 cents a half ounce to 2 cents in 1883, then 2 cents an ounce in 1885. It rose to 3 cents in 1917, and was not raised to 4 cents until 1958 - another long-lived rate, another column, someday. Rather than being taxed, business mailers today get deep discounts: if a company does the postal sorting chores itself, a 1-ounce letter can be sent 6,000 miles from Boston to Honolulu for 11 1/2 cents.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
The Stamps column last week misidentified the man on the 2-cent ''Black Jack'' that paid the drop-letter rate in 1863-65. It was President Andrew Jackson, not Gen. Stonewall Jackson.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Driving 'Miss Daisy' From Here to There and Back

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO; Marilyn Stasio, the author of the Crime column for The New York Times Book Review, is a former theater critic.

 BODY:
After 15 months on the road, the national touring company of ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' starring Julie Harris and Brock Peters and featuring Stephen Root, closes today in New Haven. Charlie Willard, the company manager, will take down the photos in the theater lobby, settle up at the box office, check the company's travel arrangements and head for his cabin in the Adirondacks. He is trying to be philosophical.
''There's a peculiar romance about living under the pull and tug of the road-show moon,'' said Mr. Willard, whose job it was to supervise the administrative details at every stop along the 27-city cross-country tour. ''Its odd glow creates this illusion of intimacy, when you're separated from the realities of your own life. The show defines your identity and becomes your whole reason for being. Whatever town you're in, you never take off your logo showjacket.'' 
As the official representative of the show's producer, the company manager is the person who keeps the production on its feet and moving from city to city. From his catbird seat, Mr. Willard has watched the traditional road change, from a few central arteries on which shows once left New York to cross the country, into a network of local and national routes with more intersections than the old Erie-Lackawanna railroad line. His is also a job built for day-to-day crises, like the one that struck the 17-member ''Daisy'' company in San Francisco, when the death of Brock Peters's wife and the birth of Stephen Root's son disoriented the troupe and left Miss Harris performing in Alfred Uhry's three-character play with two understudies. ''That was the week that was,'' recalled Mr. Willard. ''The life force nipping at us from both ends.''
The 46-year-old company manager, who sports a well-chewed mustache and usually conducts business in a broad-brimmed leather hat, has stared down other life-and-death situations on the road - during tours of ''A Chorus Line,'' ''Company,'' ''The Belle of Amherst'' with Miss Harris and ''Gypsy'' with Angela Lansbury - and kept these and other shows rolling across the country without missing a date. But he had not done it in a long while; not since he left the road in 1981 to become an assistant professor in the drama department of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He was coaxed away from academe for one more shot at the road by Miss Harris, whom he calls ''that rara avis - a genuine theater star,'' and for whom he has a deep affection. Besides, after spending almost a decade on high ground, he was curious about the changes he might find on the road.
''The main thing I discovered,'' said Mr. Willard in one of a series of interviews over the last six months, ''was that nobody is doing the traditional tour anymore.'' National tours used to spin off from original Broadway productions. Although somewhat scaled down for travel, they were produced by the same New York management, financed from profits of the Broadway production, supervised by the original creative team and often featured members of the Broadway cast.
First-class touring companies would play only major theaters in major cities. But in the case of a big hit, management often licensed independent producers to send out additional bus-and-truck companies. Socalled for their original mode of travel, these secondary but fully unionized tours would service smaller cities with productions trim enough to travel quickly on one-night stands and split-week engagements.
''Nowadays, national companies of the big musical hits don't really tour anymore,'' Mr. Willard said. ''They travel to a few big cities, like Los Angeles and Boston, and sit down. Elephantine road shows like 'Les Miz' and 'Phantom' - which are elaborate technical duplications of their originals - are no longer built to move in that swift, old-fashioned, road-show style. I remember a conversation with the company manager of 'Les Miz,' about the old split weeks we used to play. 'Split weeks?' he said, 'We're playing split years.' ''
Mr. Willard was more agreeably surprised to find that smaller cities he was seeing again for the first time in years - Bloomington, Ind., Kansas City, Mo., Wilmington, Del., Louisville, Ky. - had not lost their uniqueness. But he was saddened by the thinning ranks of ''mom and pop'' theater promoters, seasoned box-office treasurers and those colorful advance men producers once sent ahead to beat the drums for a new show coming to town. Though their functions are becoming obsolete because of newer, streamlined business procedures, in some cases, Mr. Willard said, local theatrical entrepreneurs are being ''pushed aside by the big monopolies.'' These large companies now produce most of the road attractions, which collectively earned an impressive $256 million in the 1988-89 season, according to Variety.
The source for these and other changes, Mr. Willard said, can be found in the larger economics of the theater industry. Broadway is producing less ''product'' for export, he noted, which invites longer runs of what is already out there. At the same time, new shows with the legs to travel take so long to recoup their original, multi-million-dollar investments on Broadway that producers are unable to stockpile the significant financing it takes to send out a national company. Rather than wait the years it may take to generate that kind of profit, management often prefers to license the touring rights to one of several large independent outfits like American Theater Productions, PACE Management Corporation and the Nederlander Organization. These producing managements may have no connections to the original shows, but they have considerable knowledge about how the new road works.
''Meanwhile,'' said Mr. Willard, ''as the major national companies get bigger and less mobile, the bus-and-trucks have taken over their one- and two-week cities. That leaves nonunion companies free to move into the old split-week tracks abandoned by the legitimate bus-and-trucks.'' To complicate matters further, noncommercial theater companies of diverse professional quality are often in residence at the same road-stop cities.
For the ''Daisy'' company, these tricky road tracks translated into some awkward logistics: They could not book Chicago or Atlanta, because smaller local companies had been licensed to do the play; and San Diego was out because a major resident theater production was scheduled.
Of more concern to Mr. Willard was the fact that local promoters are much less involved with the shows they present. ''That trend began,'' he said, ''when the traditional touring contract - a 75-25 split of the box-office income between the producer and the local promoter - gave way to the guarantee system, whereby the local promoter pays the producer a fixed amount, regardless of boxoffice proceeds.
''In order to meet these stiff guarantees, the promoter is under pressure to fuel his huge subscription series, which has become his money machine. The producer hides behind the guarantee, the presenter cowers behind his subscriptions, and nobody goes near the show.''
There are still many people on national road stops who love the theater, Mr. Willard said, and who take the time and care to tend shows properly. Among those ''steely independents,'' as he calls them, he mentioned local promoters in Baltimore and Boston who personally welcomed the ''Daisy'' company, worked on the show's local publicity and watched some performances. But for a number of reasons - computerized box offices, season subscriptions and the overall tendency toward centralization - many of the new faces that Mr. Willard met on the ''Daisy'' tour were buried up to their noses in computer printouts.
''The road,'' he said, ''is a much more polished and orderly place for this new breed of promoter, with their subscription lists and fax machines. Some of the old promoters - you used to have to meet them in a phone booth. But for all their marketing skills, many of these new people are not authentic theater animals. Like my old mentor, Jack Schlissel, was fond of saying, 'Some of these guys might as well be in lingerie.' ''
One happy surprise was the new generation of young professionals he discovered working in his own field. ''There is much more camaraderie today among road-show managers,'' Mr. Willard said, in part because of the apprentice program administered by their union, the Association of Theater Producers and Managers. ''The apprentices I've taught over the years are now full-fledged managers and criss-crossing all over the country,'' he said proudly. On the late-night phone network, their trade talk ranges from a hot tip about a tax scam being pulled by a theater out west to the information that a breakfast cereal called Birchermusli has appeared on a room-service menu in Grand Rapids.
Mr. Willard's main fear about going back on the road - that regions of the country would appear homogenous to him, after a decade's absence - proved unfounded. ''I was really heartened,'' he said, ''to see the different audience reactions to 'Daisy,' even among small cities in close proximity to one another.'' After watching the distress of elderly audiences in St. Petersburg, Fla., when Miss Daisy ended her days in a nursing home, he prevailed on his producers to allow Julie Harris to make a reassuring final bow without her makeup and gray wig.
''No matter how this country might appear to the traveler who stops at generic Holiday Inns and fast-food restaurants on the Interstate,'' he said, ''there are genuine regional and social differences out there, and a touring show must be sensitive to them.''
There are also thrills and chills. ''It still stirs the soul,'' he said, ''to arrive in a cold, empty theater at 8 A.M. and to be proudly flying your own little flag in that same space by 8 P.M. Seeing the scenery go up, watching the lights being focused, always brings back that primal sensation that you are, after all, putting on a show.
''And for all the changes that have come to pass under the road-show moon, there is still that one and only rock-solid and completely dependable rule in the commercial theater: sooner or later, the show always closes.''
 
GOODNIGHT, SWEET BOX OFFICE
 Charlie Willard, a company manager for many road tours, discovered some changes along the old routes when he took out the national company of ''Driving Miss Daisy'' 15 months ago. He also found that some of the familiar signposts were down.
 
 ''What I miss most of all on the road are box offices. And box office treasurers. And tickets - I mean, actual hard tickets that you can hold in your hand.
''There are no box offices on the road anymore. Oh, to be sure, there are still dimly lit rooms connected in some way to the lobbies of theaters. But they are closed up tight all day and apparently no one would think of actually buying a ticket there.
''These rooms flicker to some dim life about 7:00 every evening when a team of people arrive breathlessly trailing sheafs of computer printouts and a handful of computer-type tickets which they spread out on a table. Someone else arrives with a shoe box of 'will call' seats and sets up on a card table at the opposite end of the lobby.
''If you ask to see the 'deadwood' [tickets for unsold seats] for the performance, you are regarded with a look that dates you in some prehistoric era. For the fact is, deadwood is no more. Without those dead seats in your fist - capacity less remaining dead seats in hand equals tickets sold, is how it went - there is a terrible feeling of loss of control.
''The entire matter of selling and managing tickets to a show - once a finely practiced skill, if not an art - is just one more computer printout. Even the managers have gone from out front to backstage, where there is enough voltage to support their computers.
''Box offices were where you hung out, got a cup of coffee in the morning, picked up your mail, made your phone calls and read the papers. No point in being out front anymore if there are no box offices to hang out in.''

Want a Seat? They're Going For a Song

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Anybody want to buy a house? Or a seat? With share prices weakening last week as interest rates rose and housing starts hit a six-year low, the most depressing news at the New York Stock Exchange may have been the year's first sale of a seat in that august body. The price: $390,000, the lowest tab since 1985.
The record price of $1.15 million was paid on Sept. 21, 1987 - just ahead of the crash - when the Dow Jones industrial average was 2,492.82. Last week, after a bumpy ride, the Dow ended down 11.31, at 2,677.90. While many smaller stocks had rougher times - the American Stock Exchange market value index fell to a six-month low - the fact stock prices generally are high while seat prices are low shows that customers can do well even if brokers are being squeezed. And squeezed they are, trading fewer shares for smaller commissions. 
Rising interest rates from London to Tokyo also account for some of the depression on the Street. In this country, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, below 8 percent as 1989 ended, was up to 8.27 percent by Friday, when President Bush, speaking to the National Association of Homebuilders, declared he was for lower rates. Any other message would have been unthinkable in that forum, but it was nonetheless viewed as a broad hint to the Federal Reserve to back off and stop worrying so much about inflation.
The day before President Bush spoke, the Government reported that housing starts in 1989 fell to the lowest level since 1982, with an especially rapid drop in the Northeast as the year ended. Part of that may be weather-related, but another part reflects the tide of red ink at real estate lenders. Shares in the Bank of New England, by far the worst hit, fell $4.50 last week, to $2.875, amid rumors of more bad news. Whether the Fed can do much about that slump is another question. Interest rates could drop to zero without any new condos being built in much of Connecticut.
Maybe, just maybe, none of that is very important. Various real estate markets have run into trouble at different times in the past decade, without causing much alarm on Wall Street. Now, however, home prices are falling around New York and Boston, where many money managers live. ''Perspective is always toughest when the pain hits a little too close to home,'' said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. Nationwide, ''the housing market is not caving in,'' he said, adding that a better-balanced economy may result from ''the elimination of excesses in residential real estate markets.''
Builders will be forgiven if they see a lot of excesses as having vanished long ago. In 1982, when interest rates were sky-high and there was a recession, builders put up 320,000 apartments in buildings with five or more units. Last year, with rates much lower and no recession, the total came to 317,000.
Just how low would the figure go if we did get a recession, or if the recent rise in rates continued? The White House clearly would rather not find out. Fed-bashing season, it would appear, has arrived.

Will Tokyo's Slide Snowball?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
It is becoming a regular reflex to check the Nikkei 225 - Tokyo's closely watched stock index - early in the evening in New York. Since the beginning of the year, it has been plunging with regularity and has helped bring down many other major markets.
It seems fairly certain that if the declines continue in Tokyo they will continue elsewhere. But what is still open to debate is whether this Tokyo slide will be just a sharp correction or will snowball into a crash. 
One way to examine the question is to look at the bond market, whose sudden drop in Tokyo helped touch off the equity slump. Slumping bond markets elsewhere, including in Britain and France, are also contributing to the January chill in the markets.
This is the third time since 1985 that a global bond market slump has been set off by a sudden and sharp jump in Japanese interest rates.
The first time was in the fall of 1985, after the United States and its economic allies decided in the Plaza accord to force down the exchange value of the dollar, which was at record highs. In about four weeks, from mid-October to mid-November, interest rates on three-month yen deposits in Europe went from 6.5 percent to 8.12 percent while the yield on the 10-year Japanese Government bond, on a semi-annual compound basis, zipped up from 5.8 percent to 7.15 percent.
The move to tighten by the Bank of Japan came when the dollar, after dropping initially after the Plaza accord was announced, began to rise against the yen. But in about a month, with the yen again gaining on the dollar, interest rates had fallen and the bond market reversed. And there was no significant decline in the stock market.
The next jump in rates was, yes indeed, the one that preceded the October 1987 crash on Wall Street. It started in August, when the Bank of Japan was worried about inflation. Looking back, Nicholas Sargen, director of bond market research at Salomon Brothers, said there was no measurable sign of inflation in the price indexes. The Bank of Japan, however, focused on the rise in Japanese land prices and the ''speculative bubble in equities,'' in Mr. Sargen's words. Interest rates went from 3.94 percent to 4.95 percent on three-month yen deposits in Europe and from 4.44 percent to 7.16 percent on the 10-year Government bond from the end of August to Oct. 16. By the end of November, rates had fallen back to about where they had been, after the Bank of Japan eased up following the crash.
The third rate jump began in the middle of last month with three-month yen deposits at 6.5 percent and the 10-year bond at 5.37 percent. By Friday, three-month deposits had risen to 7 percent while the 10-year bond was at 6.4 percent. There have been stronger signs of inflation now than in 1987, although it may be subsiding a bit. Mr. Sargen again believes that the Bank of Japan has based its tightening move on rising land prices and the high stock prices in Tokyo. The bank's aim, he said, is to curb ''future inflation.'' In addition, the central bank is worried about the very weak yen, which was the problem in 1985.
The unknown is how long it will take for this rate increase to unwind and how much damage will be done to stocks in the interim.
Mr. Sargen said that the big difference between this episode and the one in 1987 is that there is not - at least now - international disagreement over policy, as there was among the United States, Japan and West Germany in the year of the crash.
Still, Mr. Sargen said it could be April or later before the Bank of Japan sees enough reassuring numbers on inflation to cause it to let interest rates come down some. And the weak yen could even prompt another ratcheting up in interest rates.
This means the pressure on the stock market could last much longer and the cumulative impact - both in Tokyo and abroad - could be significant.
The Nikkei is now at 36,836.54, having posted a rise Friday for the first time in five trading days. While the Nikkei 225 is down 5.3 percent for the year, Friday's level still implies that investors expect the interest rate jump to unwind quickly, limiting damage to the stock market. But if interest rates remain at this level for some time, the risk is that the Nikkei could fall much more.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Reassessing Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
When the Iron Curtain ripped open, investment managers rushed through, seeking profits in the chaos of Eastern Europe. Shares in Hungary and Germany funds have been sold and plans are in the works for Poland and Berlin funds.
''With the outlook in Europe so bullish, everyone's trying to get in the door at the same time,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser who said he had been contacted earlier this month by three international investment managers interested in setting up German funds. West Germany is widely viewed as a proxy for direct investment in the Eastern bloc. 
But even as some fund managers are trying to capitalize on Eastern Europe's social and economic upheaval, money managers say most investors would be better off moving carefully until some of the dust settles. For them, the best bets at the moment, advisers say, are international mutual funds that have European holdings.
Speculative investors and people interested in filling the high-risk part of their portfolio are likely investors in the new, closed-end funds. But such direct investment would be risky for most others, investment strategists say.
Eastern Europe opened for investment so recently that no one is sure what will happen, and investment managers are still experimenting with ways to tap into opportunities there. And, they say, don't expect quick returns from a region whose infrastructure has languished since World War II and whose experience with a free market economy is rusty at best.
''Direct investment would be a mistake now,'' said John Storkerson, a securities analyst with Putnam International Advisors in London, part of the Boston-based Putnam Companies.
Further, advisers say, the share prices of closed-end single-country funds are likely to drop as more funds are started up. Prices on these funds, which trade on listed exchanges like common stock, are set by supply and demand, and fund shares trade at a premium or discount to the value of the securities in their portfolios.
For example, the Germany Fund is trading at an 85 percent premium to its net asset value. At that rate, investors ''are buying guaranteed underperformance over the long term,'' Mr. Herzfeld said.
Returns on the fund, which is publicly traded, took a nose dive early this month when its sponsor, Deutsche Bank, unveiled plans for a second Germany fund. The price recovered, but investment returns may drop again as the field becomes more crowded.
Assessing other new funds is more difficult. Bear Stearns & Company, which handled the underwriting for the First Hungary Fund, raised $180 million for the closed-end mutual fund through a private placement that closed last October. But the fund is not publicly traded and performance data is not available. So far, there have been no resales, said Brian V. Murray, a managing director at Bear Stearns.
The Berlin Fund, sponsored by Masterfund Inc., a private investors' group in New York City, filed registration papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-January. Norberto Mehl, the fund's president, called it a closed-end mutual fund for long-term investors, but would not elaborate.
Sponsors of the Poland Fund, Alliance Capital Management, in New York City, would disclose even less about their plans. The name has been registered with the S.E.C., but Linda Finnerty, a spokewoman, would not say when the fund will be launched.
Given all the uncertainties with the single-country funds, money managers say investors interested in Eastern Europe should consider mutual funds that focus on European companies. Some of them, with their 1989 performance, as gauged by Lipper Analytical Services, are: the G.T. Europe Growth Fund, part of the G.T. Global Growth Series, which returned 40.71 percent; the Fidelity Europe Fund, which returned 32.33 percent, and Merrill Lynch EuroFund A, which returned 25.48 percent, and its EuroFund B, which returned 24.23 percent. Lipper's international fund average, which includes 79 international funds, returned 22.25 percent over the same period.
Another way to bet on the Eastern bloc is through European companies. Companies with a track record doing business behind the Iron Curtain are best positioned to profit from the pent-up demand there. One company Mr. Storkerson likes is Fiat, the Italian car maker.
Hakan Castegren, investment manager for the Ivy International Fund, in Boston, likes smaller companies positioned to fill moderate-sized capital goods orders. In Scandinavia, he favors Atlas Copco, producers of compressors and mining equipment, and Ericsson, a telecommunications company.

HEADLINE: Forging a Global Empire in a Sluggish Market

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
These are not the easiest of days for the Marriott Corporation, the largest hotel company in the world. The company's chairman, J. W. Marriott Jr., is recuperating from open-heart surgery. The Marriott hotel in Panama endured a harrowing seige during the United States invasion last month. Business at some of the company's lodging properties has been so sluggish that the company last month announced a $150 million write-down. And the company's stock has been flat for several years.
But these generally unrelated events pale against the new task that Marriott has set for itself. As part of a massive corporate restructuring, the company announced last month that it would lop off about $1 billion worth of businesses unrelated to hotels to concentrate on expanding its core lodging business.
Specifically, Marriott plans to expand into a far-flung global empire with hotels dotted across Europe and the Pacific Rim. It is stepping up its push into the budget segment by increasing construction of a variety of lower-priced motels. And it talks grandly about snapping up hotels that have faltered in the current soft real estate market and slapping the Marriott name on them. It is also setting up a beachhead in the ''senior life'' market with new, extended-care residences that combine apartment living with nursing home care. 
''When I think about the lodging business, I see a $50 billion industry and we are approaching about $4 billion,'' said William R. Tiefel, the president of Marriott Hotels and Resorts. ''So we have a rather modest representation in the total industry. I'd like to see numbers twice that and I think there's opportunity.''
Marriott recorded $7.4 billion in revenues in 1988, almost half of it in lodging, and was running at about the same pace last year. With some 451 properties and 118,000 rooms in the United States and 26 countries, it is the world's largest hotel operator. Over the last decade, it has been one of the most aggressive developers of hotels, due in large part to its practice of selling its properties as soon as they are built to investors, who pay Marriott a one-time development fee and an annual fee to manage the hotel. The technique frees up cash for Marriott to build and sell again.
But the strategy may not work so well in the current real estate slump. The hotel market is already severely overbuilt. Tax benefits in the mid-1980's for real estate investments led to free-wheeling lending to hotel developers by savings and loan institutions. Although demand for lodging climbed throughout the 1980's, the number of available hotel rooms increased even more dramatically, to 2.9 million today, according to Laventhol & Horwath, a Philadelphia-based consulting firm. As a result, industrywide occupancy rates fell steadily through the decade, to 63 percent, down from an average of 68 percent at the beginning of the 80's. Many weak properties have gone under, and with real estate investments less attractive under the 1986 tax reforms, the hotel boom came to a crashing halt.
Today, real estate financing is harder to come by. And that could also make it difficult for Marriott to sell off properties to raise the $1.5 billion a year it says it needs to build new hotels. ''To the extent they cannot sell off hotel properties on a consistent basis, it may mean that they end up owning them,'' said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''That means less capital for future expansion, which means they will have to lower their growth rate and their earnings could suffer.''
Marriott, however, argues that its properties have performed better than most, making them more attractive to investors. So far, the company's sales efforts have not been hampered. Over the last 12 months, Marriott has sold some $1 billion in hotels, about equal to previous years' sales. But in the last year or two, it has been forced to look for new investors to replace traditional ones like insurance companies and tax shelter investors. One promising new source is overseas investors, particularly the Japanese. Last November, Marriott sold four all-suite hotels for $100 million to a group of Japanese investors, and last September it entered into a joint venture with a different Japanese group to develop and sell $400 million worth of hotels in Europe. It is negotiating with yet another Japanese group for the sale of its $300 million convention center in San Francisco.
To Marriott's delight, the Japanese have been willing to forgo immediate cash returns for a greater stake in a hotel's later capital appreciation. But other investors have not been so willing.
So Marriott has had to structure its deals in different ways. For instance, it now accepts lower management fees, taking more of its return in tax benefits, so that investors can receive more of the cash flow from a property. While this does not affect Marriott's total return on a deal, it does reduce the company's reported net income in a given year.
In addition, some investors now demand that Marriott guarantee returns, particularly in the early years of a project. To cover any shortfalls between what it promises investors and what a hotel actually returns, Marriott sets aside more funds in reserve, thereby reducing the money it has to devote to new construction.
''We're not concerned about finding people to buy hotels. For us, it's a matter of how you structure the deal,'' said William J. Shaw, Marriott's chief financial officer. ''For instance, we didn't used to have to guarantee returns. But now, investors are concerned about getting guarantees for the first two or three years and we're providing them.''
But that is also why Marriott is taking write-offs against fourth-quarter 1989 earnings. Many of those $150 million in reductions stem from lower-than-expected occupancy rates at some properties, which, in turn, forced the company to live up to its guarantees or to loan investors money to cover their debt service on the properties with banks.
And Marriott's exposure to the vicissitudes of the real estate market are only going to increase. Under the recently announcecd restructuring, Marriott will sell its In-Flite Services, the airline catering group, to a management group for $570 million. And its 600-unit Roy Rogers fast food franchises and 434-unit family restaurant division, which includes Bob's Big Boy, Howard Johnson's and other brands, are also on the auction block. Marriott hopes to use the proceeds to pay down its $3 billion in debt.
But dependence on lodging will increase. ''My concern is with the economy,'' said John J. Rohs, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company. ''Unless someone has repealed the law of cyclicality as it relates to lodging, their overall corporate business might be vulnerable to a slowdown.''
Marriott executives, however, argue that the restructuring rids the company of low-growth areas. The company would be left with only lodging, which in 1988 accounted for $3.1 billion of sales, and the $3.2 billion contract services group, which focuses on institutional food programs for hospitals, schools and corporations, and also includes Host International airport restaurants, toll-plaza restaurants and the new senior living retirement communities.
''By restructuring and spinning off 20 percent of our busineses, it's fair to say that we'll be able to spend more top management time on the areas that have high growth potential,'' said A. Bradford Bryan Jr., a Marriott executive vice president.
 
QUICK! HIDE IN THE WASHING MACHINE
It was 3:30 A.M. on Dec. 20, when Roger Conner, Marriott's public relations executive, was awakened from a sound sleep by the telephone. The United States had invaded Panama, said the caller, from the security desk. ''Our hotel there was front-and-center in some way,'' recalled Mr. Conner.
For a company not accustomed to being caught in a war zone, this was the start of a gruelling round-the-clock crisis. Mr. Conner and the other executive involved in handling the crisis, William R. Tiefel, Marriott's president of hotels, arrived at work within the hour find that the company couldn't get a phone line through to the hotel. According to news reports, 40 guests from the Panama hotel had been taken and released in an initial wave of hostage taking.
As American Telephon and Telegraph worked to get an open line through to the hotel, Marriott executives with Washington contacts placed frantic calls to the State Department and the Pentagon urging that the United States military in Panama get to the hotel and secure it.
At about 9:30 A.M., some of the Dignity Battalions loyal to Panama General Manuel Noriega burst into the hotel and demanded that Daniel Sarria, its manager, hand over the keys to the rooms of the 27 American guests. When Mr. Sarria refused, he was taken away, along with two journalists.
By about noon, an open phone link had been established and Mr. Sarria, who had escaped from his captors and returned to the hotel, began to hide the Americans, mostly journalists or flight crews from Eastern Air Lines. Spanish-speaking Americans were put into employee uniforms, others were hidden in laundry hampers and washing machines.
Through the day, Dignity Battalions showed up at the hotel, but never took control.
Meanwhile, Mr. Conner and his staff fielded some 200 calls from the press and friends and families of the hotel guests. ''We kept a speaker-phone in Daniel's office and every half hour or 15 minutes, he'd give us updates on where the Americans were, which we relayed to the family,'' Mr. Conner said.
Some of the calls were quite unexpected. Mr. Conner was startled by the large number of callers claiming to be paramilitary operators who had organized troops that could storm the hotel for Marriott.
Then, night fell. ''We'd hear gunfire through the speaker-phone and not know what was going on,'' Mr. Conner said. By midnight, the American troops arrived. The next day, as American soldiers stood guard, 36 Marriott employees and 27 Americans scrambled aboard two Marriott food service trucks, which whisked them to safety. The 13 other guests had already left.

HEADLINE: Raise 'User Fees' on Alcohol To Reduce Drinking-Related Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The King of Beers Raises the Ante'' (Dec. 24), describing Anheuser-Busch conveyed the beer giant's marketing muscle. Tactfully omitted, though, was the enormous human and economic toll related to drinking - 100,000 deaths and $135 billion each year. 
Anheuser-Busch dominates more than the beer market. According to our analysis of industry data, it accounts for 23 percent of all the alcohol Americans consume. Surely the King of Beers must share the blame for these tens of thousands of preventable deaths.
The enormous death toll linked to alcoholic beverages has spurred former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, as well as dozens of health, consumer and parent groups, as well as elected officials, to support public policies that would reduce drinking-related problems. One key policy change would be to increase Federal ''user fees'' on alcohol (the Federal tax on beer - less than 3 cents a can - has not been raised since Harry Truman was President).
August A. Busch 3d might be bullish about his company's future, but growing citizen outrage, state and Federal budget deficits and a population with fewer people in the heavy-drinking college-age group all suggest that the sluggish beer market will be a shrinking one in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: Another Challenge of the 90's: Managing Information Technology

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Conspicuously missing among the challenges of the 1990's addressed by the three deans (''Shifting the Focus at B-Schools,'' Dec. 31.) is management of information technologies.
We are considered an ''information society'' characterized by rapid technological changes. The problems and tasks of the country revolve around planning, organizing, and managing the complex information flows emanating from the operations of business, government and social institutions worldwide. The success of an organization will depend on how well it mobilizes information technology to improve its overall performance in a competitive marketplace with fast-blurring national boundaries.
We have high regard for students. But their best-made career plans go awry when they are confronted with the rapidly changing situation in the job market, particularly since the supply often overshoots the demand. The time lag between their choice and the reality of the business world often works to their disadvantage. A more fundamental reason for not simply being demand-driven is that business schools must be on the forefront of analyzing the needs of society with a longer horizon. It is by anticipation, innovation and adaptation that we will offer the needed leadership in the wake of newer technologies in the 1990's.

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:

COMPANIES
 
Jumping In Where A.T.& T. Fell Down
Where telecommunications software engineers stumble, ad men rush in. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company's competitors moved quickly to exploit last Monday's breakdown in A.T.& T.'s long-distance network. ''An important message to everyone whose telephone is the lifeline of their business,'' said a full-page ad from the U.S. Sprint Communications Corporation. ''Always have two lifelines.'' Other advertisements featured the Sprint access code that A.T.& T. operators initially refused to provide. The MCI Communications Corporation took a lower-key approach. ''The facts speak for themselves,'' said Kevin Sharer, MCI's executive vice president. ''Large companies need more than one long-distance company.'' But MCI and Sprint also depend on complex computer programs, similar to those that failed at A.T.& T. A.T.& T., for its part, hopes to make amends with a Valentine's Day discount.
 
Reorganizing the Campeau Empire
The affairs of the Campeau Corporation's American retailing divisions are now under the direction of a Cincinnati bankruptcy judge and a former Federal Reserve chairman. A Monday bankruptcy filing will keep 260 Federated and Allied stores open while the company reorganizes. Campeau named G. William Miller chairman and chief executive of the retailing operations Tuesday. He has been president, chairman or secretary of nearly everything - the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury Department, Textron Inc., his own merchant banking firm - except a major retailer. At Federated Department Stores and Campeau, he has been a director. 
* Most Bloomingdale's shoppers might scarcely notice the effects of Campeau's bankruptcy filing, but Wall Street's financiers will. The First Boston Corporation, with hundreds of millions of dollars at risk from financing Campeau's deals, removed William E. Mayer as its chief executive. Many of Campeau's junk bonds are worth a fraction of their original value, leaving several other investment firms with heavy losses.
 
Spinning Off, Close to Home
Tele-Communications Inc. plans to spin off its cable programming operations, but not spin them very far. The nation's largest cable company said Friday that both companies would remain under the command of John C. Malone, T.C.I.'s tough president. The move was a hit on Wall Street, where T.C.I. stock rose 2 5/8 to close at 17 3/8. The reaction in Washington is another question. Members of Congress who have cited T.C.I.'s size as a strong argument for tighter cable regulation might ask whether two T.C.I.'s are any less of a threat than one.
 
Singing the Fourth-Quarter Dirge
The chorus of fourth-quarter earnings reports last week sounded like a dirge: International Business Machines, down 75 percent to $591 million; Digital Equipment, down 45 percent to $155 million; Texaco Inc., down 3 percent to $287 million, and the AMR Corporation, down 67 percent to $39 million. David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, called corporate earnings ''one of the victims of a soft landing.
 
Layoffs and Buybacks
* Merrill Lynch & Company began laying off more than 3,000 people Thursday. Several top executives and investment bankers are being dismissed.
* The Consolidated Rail Corporation plans to buy back more than a third of its shares for about $1.3 billion, or $43 to $53 a share. Conrail's stock price has risen on takeover talk.
 
Bank Blues in the Northeast
The Bank of New England lost $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, the worst in a series of weak performances by major banks. Citicorp also had deep losses, while earnings at the Chase Manhattan Corporation and J.P. Morgan sharply declined. The Bank of New England, buffeted by real estate problems, hopes to rescue itself by selling nearly a fifth of the company. Outside the Northeast, several banks, including BankAmerica and NCNB, reported surprisingly strong gains.
 
ECONOMY
 
Two Views on Inflation
The White House and the Federal Reserve do read the same economic reports, don't they? Last Thursday's news that the Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in December prompted a Presidential spokesman to declare inflation under control. He advised the Federal Reserve to stoke the economy by lowering interest rates. In a speech Friday, President Bush called for lower interest rates. But the Federal Reserve seemed more concerned about fighting inflation than providing further stimulus. For the year, the C.P.I. climbed 4.6 percent - the highest rise since 1981. Economists say higher food and fuel prices resulting from December's cold weather will be evident in January.
 
Trade and Other Weaknesses
The trade deficit continues to worsen. November's $10.5 billion gap was the largest in 1989. Economists see little hope for improvement. ''I think it reflects a serous problem in competitiveness,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic advisor for the WEFA Group.
* Other figures from last week tended to point to weakness: 1989 housing starts of 1.39 million, the lowest since 1982; industrial production up four-tenths of 1 percent in December despite higher, winter-time electrical output and the end of the Boeing Company strike. But car sales for Jan. 1-10 rose a healthy 29.8 percent over a year ago.
 
Well, OPEC Must Be Happy
The United States is bound to depend more than ever on imported oil. As domestic production suffered a record annual drop last year, imports surged to 46 percent of the nation's needs - second only to the 47.7 percent total in 1977. Oil prices are too low to encourage drilling, and supplies in the United States are becoming harder to find. The nation's thirst for foreign oil is likely to aggravate the trade imbalance. Oil imports cost about $49 billion last year, about 44 percent of the deficit. Energy efficiency has been improving, but lower energy prices have weakened the drive for conservation. And the stronger the seller's market for oil, the easier the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries finds it to avoid divisiveness and limit production.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
%U.S. Coming Apart in Chips
Woe to America's motorists if OPEC members ever learn to cooperate like the Japanese chip producers. The collapse of U.S. Memories, a joint American venture to make computer chips, leaves Japanese manufacturers as unified as ever. The major Japanese producers announced plans to cut back the supply of memory chips used in personal computers and appliances. A glut of these chips has lowered prices. The glut also convinced American chip-makers that their consortium couldn't recover its investment. But the Japanese took the fate of U.S. Memories as another bit of evidence that American businesses were too short-sighted to successfully compete.
 
A Merger, and New Money
* Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical company owned by the French Government, agreed Thursday to buy the Rorer Group Inc. for $3.14 billion, or $73 a share. Rorer is to be merged with Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceutical operations, creating a company with combined sales of of $3 billion in 1989.
* The Japanese Export-Import Bank, which has aided underdeveloped nations, is considering low-interest loans to help three underdeveloped American states. The Governors of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi have discussed loans that probably would be used for roads, ports and business parks. The loans would be the first in an industrialized nation.
 
La Scala on the Amazon
Nashville has a replica Parthenon; Tokyo has its own Eiffel Tower. Now Manaus, Brazil, is trying to lure tourists 1,000 miles up the Amazon by restoring its 1896 copy of Milan's La Scala opera house. The Teatro Amazonas is a rain-forest apparition, a monument as vulnerable to termites and decay as the Manaus economy was to a plunge in the price of rubber. The American monuments of the 1980's - corporate headquarters, mansions, museums - may prove more durable than the junk-bond boom that that helped build many of them. But the rise, the near-fall and the revival of Manaus and its opera house offer a reminder of the force of economic cycles.

Drawing Strength From the Fed

 BODY:
It turned out to be an up week for the American dollar. While it was buffeted by news of the jump in the November trade deficit, the dollar was pushed higher by the growing belief that the Federal Reserve, concerned about inflation, would not be lowering interest rates any time soon. Firm interest rates tend to support the dollar. More support came from continued indications that the Bundesbank would not push interest rates any higher in West Germany, where the mark is felt to be strong enough. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was heading down, down, down. The Bank of Canada gave its first signal that it would let high interest rates there start to drop. In response, the Canadian dollar fell 2.3 percent against the American dollar, to 84.48 cents, from 86.40.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
In Washington, It's the Year for Clean Air

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UPON its return this week, the Senate will immediately face the moment of truth on strengthening the Clean Air Act, a goal that has eluded Congress for a decade.
Failure to act soon, the advocates of strong legislation warn, would condemn the nation to widespread deterioration of air quality.
Some describe the stakes as even higher. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said Congress's ability to enact clean-air legislation this year is ''a test of our ability as a society to come to grips with problems that are part of what is now the most dangerous threat to our nation and our species.''
Each year since 1980, legislators have tried to amend the law. Each year they have failed in the face of conflicting regional interests; powerful, well-financed opposition by industry and, during the Reagan years, a hostile White House. 
But President Bush, far from hostile, put forth his own broad proposal last year. Industry is still spending large amounts of money to fight specific proposals, but corporate leaders are taking pains to voice support for a stronger law. And while some Midwestern states that would bear a substantial economic burden continue to voice opposition, they are isolated politically.
If, given the active encouragement of the President, the enthusiastic support of the majority leader and the Speaker of the House, the demands of the public for cleaner air and an industry that gives at least lip service to a more stringent law, Congress cannot pass strong legislation this year, it is hard to see how it could at any time in the foreseeable future.
''Who is going to vote for dirty air?'' asked Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate's environmental protection subcommittee.
But there will be some obstacles. One is a dispute over costs and benefits that has already erupted here. On Friday, Mr. Bush sent a letter to Senate leaders warning that he could not accept a bill whose costs exceed those in his legislation. Administration officials said the cost of the Senate bill to industry and consumers would be about $40 billion a year by 2000. The President's bill, they contended, would achieve virtually the same goals for about half the cost.
The House of Representatives must also approve legislation this year, and a House subcommittee has reached a compromise that removes one longstanding obstacle to action on auto emissions.
The existing law has produced modest improvements in air quality and has held in check the clouds of pollution that would otherwise have been spewed into the atmosphere. But the statute, passed in 1970 and last amended in 1977, left some major pollution problems unaddressed and proved inadequate to deal with others.
The Senate bill, like the President's legislation and a bill pending in the House of Representatives, would address several forms of pollution: Acid Rain The 1970 law required industry to clean up pollution in the immediate vicinity of its source. Many polluters, particularly big, coal-fired power plants, did so by sending emissions through tall smokestacks, which dispersed the pollutants over a wide area. Sulfur and nitrogen oxides are transformed chemically in the atmosphere and return to earth as acidic rain, snow and dust. This pollution, much of it emanating from the Midwest, has been found to damage freshwater life and buildings in the Northeast and Canada, and it may be detrimental to human health.
The Senate bill and the Bush legislation would require that by 2000, 107 big power plants in the Midwest reduce sulfur emissions by 10 million tons a year, or about half the amount they are now releasing. After that, total sulfur emissions could not exceed the levels of 1980. It would also require that nitrogen oxide emissions be reduced by 2 million tons by 2000, a somewhat deeper cut than envisioned by the Administration's proposal. The legislation would give utilities credits for reducing pollution below required limits, and these credits could be sold or traded to other polluters.
 
Smog
Volatile chemical vapors from auto exhaust and similar pollution from industrial and commercial sources, reacting with sunlight, create the smog that chokes many urban and suburban areas. Smog was limited by the law's requirements that car manufacturers install devices to reduce tailpipe emissions. But with a rapidly growing number of cars on the road each driving more miles, the requirements have proved inadequate. More than 100 major cities now exceed the maximum permissible smog levels at some point during the year.
Under the Senate bill, car makers would have until 1995 to reduce their vehicles' hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions to levels currently required by California. They would have to make a second round of emissions cuts by 2000. The Administration called for only the first round of reductions but also proposed requiring auto makers to produce a certain number of cars that run on fuels that pollute less than gasoline.
 
Toxic Chemicals
The 1970 law called on the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate hundreds of dangerous chemicals such as benzene and butadiene. The agency has taken action on only eight chemicals, however, in part because the law's mandate is ambiguous and agency officials have been unable to devise an effective regulatory approach.
The Senate bill would require polluters to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce emissions of the 187 chemicals deemed most dangerous to health over the next seven years, twice the number of chemicals proposed by the Administration.
 
Global Pollution
The Senate bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by imposing stricter fuel efficiency standards on motor vehicles. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the industrial gases that scientists believe are causing long-term warming of the globe by trapping heat from the sun. The bill would also ban all emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals that deplete the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect.
These provisions would add up to major progress in cleansing the skies. They also would cost a lot more than the $35 billion a year the country is currently spending to improve air quality.
Corporate spokesmen and some Administration officials are saying the cost of the Senate bill would hurt industry's ability to compete in international markets.
''I don't want to be harsh, but that is a lot of nonsense,'' replied Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island and co-sponsor of the legislation. ''We will be able to keep a lot of people healthy by cleaning up the air and spend a lot less money on medical bills.''
The American Lung Association issued a report on Friday that concluded that the health costs associated with air pollution are now $40 to $50 billion a year, more than the cost of the Senate bill. The association's estimate does not include the costs of damage to buildings, crops and forests.
But the costs of the new requirements would fall unequally on different areas of the country and different industries. The brunt of the acid rain costs, for example, would fall on a handful of Midwestern states. The changes could cost jobs in states like West Virginia that produce high-sulfur coal. These states ask that the costs be shared by the whole country. States that have already reduced pollution demur, saying they should not have to pay for cleaning up a second time.
Such issues will produce spirited debate. Some Senators have threatened to filibuster. It seems unlikely, however, that, after 10 years of spinning in place, Congress will fail to act on clean air now that all the political signs are in proper alignment.
''If Congress doesn't succeed this time, I don't know what it will take for them to succeed in the future,'' said S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Control Officers. ''All that is left for them to do now is political posturing and horse trading.''
 
A FEW ADJUSTMENTS ARE CALLED FOR
If the Clean Air Act amendments now being taken up by the Senate become law, the effects would soon be visible in the lives of most Americans. Many proposals involve motor vehicles, which cause much of the nation's air pollution. Here are some likely repercussions:
* Electric bills for many customers in the Midwest would rise as public utilities are forced to install expensive scrubbers or shift from high-sulfur coal to more costly low-sulfur grades. There is some dispute over how much electric bills would go up, but in some cases the increase would be 20 percent or more.
* The price of automobiles would go up as new equipment required by the amendments to cut exhaust emissions and to recover gasoline vapors during refueling is installed. Estimates of the costs vary, but they would probably be about $250 per car by 2000, or, as a Senate staff aide noted, about the cost of one power window.
* Service stations would be required to install special suction devices on pumps, also to catch gasoline fumes.
* Cities that do not meet the standards on air quality would be required to set aside car pool lanes on the biggest commuter arteries. Employers would also be required to set up car pools.
* Large cities not in compliance with the air standards would have to switch their bus fleets to fuels like methanol or natural gas that pollute less than gasoline. The change would have to be accomplished by 1994.
* To reduce the carbon dioxide pollution that is contributing to the greenhouse effect, manufacturers would have to build cars that require less gasoline per mile driven. Each car-maker would have to achieve an average of 33 miles a gallon by 1996 and 40 miles a gallon by 2000. Auto fleets now average about 28 miles a gallon.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Senator Dole's Jackpot Question On Foreign Aid Stirs Up Congress

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SENATOR BOB DOLE set off a stormy debate on foreign aid last week by saying aloud something that has only been whispered on Capitol Hill: Given the limited resources the United States has for foreign aid, wouldn't it make sense to cut by a mere 5 percent the grants made to Israel and the four other largest aid recipients, reallocating that money to Eastern European countries and Panama?
Why did such a furor result from a suggestion that only involved $330 million out of a foreign aid budget of $14.6 billion? Because the proposal was not just about this year's international assistance budget.
It was also about who should have the right to determine where foreign aid goes - Congress or the Administration. In addition, it was about Israel, and whether the $3 billion it has been receiving annually as the largest American aid recipient should be re-examined. And finally, it raised the issue of how the United States is going to help the nations of Eastern Europe from a foreign aid pie that does not seem able to grow larger. 
Ever since 1985 and the imposition of the Gramm-Rudman deficit spending ceiling, the foreign aid budget has remained largely fixed. It would be nice if the budget could be enlarged, said Mark L. Edelman, Deputy Administrator of the Agency for International Development. ''But that just isn't going to happen,'' he said. ''If we want to increase one country, we are going to have to take it from another.''
That means the Administration faces nearly impossible choices. ''We're now forced to decide which women and children get to be in the lifeboat,'' said Mr. Edelman. ''Who knows what will happen next year. Will Albania ask for aid? Will Outer Mongolia? Will Cuba? Who would have guessed Eastern Europe this year?'' He continued, ''We now have a foreign aid crisis and my hope is that because of it, Congress will re-examine the constraints and limitations it has imposed on foreign aid allocations.''
This raises another of Mr. Dole's points. What complicates life for the Administration is not simply that so many new countries are deserving of foreign aid, but that Congress each year insists on choosing which countries will get aid and how much they'll get, leaving the Administration with little discretion or flexibility when the world suddenly changes.
The process of putting the bill together begins each year in January when the President submits his budget to Congress; then, various Government agencies suggest where they think the money should be spent. A season of horse trading then begins among the Administration, Congress and various lobbies, ''earmarking'' exactly who will get what. By the end of the year, a spending bill is worked out.
 
'Where Was Bob Dole?'
Mr. Dole suggested that the President exercise his authority within the foreign aid legislation to override some designations and reallocate funds to make more aid available to Eastern Europe. That authority is only to be used in exceptional cases. The Administration hailed the proposal, which it had discussed with Mr. Dole ahead of time. But few in Congress are ready to give the Administration such freedom.
''Where was Bob Dole when the earmarking was going on?'' asked Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who leads the House subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which oversees foreign aid. ''When the foreign aid bill was in conference I was fighting mightily to resist Senate earmarks. I don't remember one minority member raising his voice in that conference against earmarks. I would suggest that Mr. Dole ought to get involved in the process beforehand rather than sneaking around afterwards and trying to change the arrangements.''
Mr. Dole's proposal was viewed in some pro-Israel quarters as a veiled attack on their lobby. Many Congressmen think Israel's annual $3 billion allocation has become an entitlement program Jerusalem takes for granted, and they quietly cheered Mr. Dole's suggestion to do something about it.
But this argument ignores the fact that foreign aid in general is unpopular, and that specific constituencies are needed to push the whole program through. ''Aid to Israel is the locomotive that drives the whole foreign aid train,'' said Douglas M. Bloomfield, a former lobbyist for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. ''If you take the locomotive off the tracks, what happens to the rest of the train? When it comes time to actually get the foreign aid bill passed, if you stood outside the door of the conference room and took away the friends of Israel, you would be awfully lonely.''
This may be true, some Congressional experts say, but if aid to Israel were reduced slightly and the difference spread around Eastern Europe, would Israel's allies stop lobbying for aid?
Mr. Dole's suggestion may also have had a diplomatic objective.
His proposal surfaced only days after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d ''hit the ceiling,'' according to an official, after reading comments attributed to an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel suggesting that Mr. Baker was not serious about advancing the Middle East peace process. Mr. Baker, who has devoted a great deal of time trying to advance Mr. Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank, had his department issue a statement the next day saying that ''there are many other areas in the world clamoring for his attention'' and that unless he sees ''the kind of impulse that will produce change in the Middle East'' he may not have much time any more to devote to that part of the world. Mr. Shamir got the message and came out the next day to express appreciation for Mr. Baker's efforts.
Nevertheless, the observation by the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, that Senator Dole's proposal was ''well worth looking at'' may be seen, in part, as a reminder from the Bush Administration to Israel that if it does not get more serious about its own peace plan, not only the Administration's energies - but also some resources - may be directed elsewhere.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Prof. Moynihan Wakes the Class With Truth About Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, Ph.D., was a professor before he became a Senator. Although his recent proposal to cut Social Security taxes has turned out to be a clever political stroke that has embarrassed President Bush, it was meant mostly as a teaching device. Angry and frustrated that no one seemed to be listening to his economics lessons, the New York Democrat chose a sharp political instrument to make these blunt points about economics:
* Despite Republican claims, Federal taxes overall were not cut in the Reagan-Bush years. What happened was the burden of taxation was shifted from the income tax to the Social Security tax. Counting their employers' share, nearly three-quarters of all Americans now pay more in Social Security taxes than they do in income taxes.
* One result is that the expenses of Government are financed more by a tax on the poor and the middle class and less by a tax on the wealthy. Another result is that surplus revenues in the Social Security system are being used to mask the deficit in the Government's operating budget instead of being used as they were intended, to guarantee pension benefits for today's workers when they retire. 
Those are facts, but most taxpayers seem not to have grasped them. A New York Times/CBS News poll found that 64 percent of adults believe that they and their families pay more in income taxes than in Social Security taxes and that 78 percent would prefer a cut in the income tax to a cut in the Social Security tax. The telephone poll, conducted Jan. 13 to 15 with 1,557 adults nationwide, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Moynihan's proposal to reduce the Social Security tax by more than $60 billion over the next two years is not likely to become law. But even if he loses that battle, he seems to have won his personal war by calling attention to the way the system works. His proposal created such political waves that it has gained an inordinate amount of attention in recent weeks.
Ronald Reagan and George Bush were elected in large part because of their opposition to tax increases. But Federal tax revenues now stand at just under 20 percent of the gross national product, the same as at the beginning of the 1980's.
Income taxes were indeed sharply lowered. The top rate for individuals is 28 percent now, down from 70 percent at the beginning of the 1980's. The corporate rate also dropped substantially. As a share of Federal revenue, personal income taxes fell by 6 percent during the Reagan years and corporate income taxes fell by 23 percent.
At the same time, the share of Federal revenue coming from Social Security taxes rose 23 percent. As of Jan. 1, workers and their employers each pay 7.65 percent on payday, 6.2 percent for retirement under Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. The tax is paid on the first $51,300 of wages. At the beginning of the last decade, the total payroll rate was 6.13 percent on the first $29,700 of wages.
Economists agree that if employers did not have to contribute their share, workers could demand and generally receive most if not all of that money in higher wages. Thus, they maintain, the payroll tax rate now is effectively 15.3 percent.
Unlike income taxes, which are levied at higher rates as a taxpayer's earnings increase, Social Security taxes are not only cut off at $51,300 but are also paid at the same rate by all workers and apply only to wages - not to interest, dividends, capital gains, rental receipts and other forms of income that are enjoyed largely by the well-to-do. This year, the maximum payroll tax will total $3,924.45.
What that means is that a husband and wife earning $30,000 each, say a pair of schoolteachers, pay more in Social Security taxes than a single person who earns 10 times that much. That person would not pay any Social Security tax at all if the income is from investments rather than a salary.
The other notion that Senator Moynihan is trying to drive home is that the growing surplus of Social Security revenue, $65 billion this year and a projected $200 billion or more by the turn of the century, is being used to mask the size of the deficit in the Government's operating budget. The main reason why the overall Federal budget deficit has decreased in the last few years is not so much because of reduced spending as it is because of increased Social Security revenues. And they will increase further; in 1993, the Government will collect about $100 billion more in Social Security taxes than it will pay out in benefits.
Using today's Social Security revenue to pay for everything from jet fighters to thumbtacks is, in Mr. Moynihan's view, a perversion of the reason given in 1983 for scheduling periodic increases in the payroll tax. That was done primarily to guarantee benefits for the generation of workers that will retire early in the next century. The Senator was a member of the Presidential commission that established the new rates.
The way the Social Security system works is complicated and often misunderstood. The idea that workers' payroll taxes are placed in a trust fund to pay for their own retirement is a fiction. Social Security has always been a pay-as-you-go system. Each generation of workers pays Social Security taxes to finance the older generation's retirement.
When more money is received in Social Security taxes than is needed for benefits, as is the case now, the surplus is used to buy Treasury bonds. If there were no deficit in the Government's day-to-day operating budget, all the surplus could be used to buy Treasury securities held by private lenders. Those lenders' money would then be invested in plants, equipment and other productive private enterprises, stimulating growth in the entire economy.
 
Stoking the Economy
The theory behind the payroll tax increases that began in 1983 was to allow more money to be invested in productive ventures so that the economy would grow, making it easier for the children of baby boomers to meet the huge cost of pension payments. The Government will have to tax or borrow enough in the next century to meet retirement obligations in any case, but the stronger the economy is, the easier that task will be.
President Bush, embarrassed by having been one-upped on a tax issue, charged last week that Senator Moynihan's proposal for a payroll tax cut was a ''charade'' that would lead to a tax increase elsewhere or lower retirement benefits. The Senator strongly opposes reduced pensions, but said he would accept an increased income tax or a higher gasoline tax if the President would go along.
Other Democrats, while delighting in the discomfort the proposal has caused the President, have declined to sign on to the Moynihan plan. They say that a cut in Social Security taxes, like any other tax cut, would force the Government to borrow even more than it already does, draining private savings and seriously damaging the economy.
Mr. Moynihan agrees with the economics of that analysis. But he added in an interview, ''If we have to go through a small crisis to straighten things out, fine, let's do it.''
 
A CRUTCH FOR THE BUDGET
The surplus funds collected by Social Security are being used to offset a significant share of the budget deficit.

A DENT IN THE PAYCHECK
If employer contributions are included, most people pay more in social security and payroll taxes than they do in income tax. Here are relative 1990 tax burdens at different income levels for a married couple with two children. Figures assume both partners work and have equal earnings, all in wages; itemized deductions equal to 20 percent of income, and no claim for child care credit.

HEADLINE: Why So Rigid on Eastern Europe?

 BODY:
Eastern Europe's courageous effort to leap from controlled to market economies creates a desperate need for Western help. It would be tragic if ideological rigidity blocked that aid.
The question is whether the West should lend money for public as well as private investment projects. It should. But at a recent East-West meeting to create an Eastern European development bank, the U.S. and Britain reportedly said no. This is no time for pointless intransigence. It can only jeopardize fragile political and economic reforms. 
The insinuation of market forces into centrally controlled economies will be painful. Consumers and producers must be weaned from government subsidies. Prices will soar; bankruptcies and unemployment will become commonplace. The West can't eliminate this pain. But it can dull the hurt.
A wise way to help was outlined in October by President Francois Mitterrand of France. The West could create a development bank that would extend loans in exchange for democratic reforms. The bulk of the loans, all agree, should go to the private sector. The disagreement is whether loans should also go to governments - for highways, dams and other public investments.
The Bush Administration evidently fears that public investments will inevitably overwhelm the new development bank's limited resources. It also fears a repeat of the 1970's, when Eastern Europe squandered Western loans.
But there has now been a dizzying set of economic and political changes. The 1970's are a poor guide to the 1990's. Private enterprise cannot emerge without suitable public infrastructure. Investments in both sectors are necessary. And Eastern Europe cannot do it alone.
Making wise loans will not be easy. With only primitive markets to guide the way, investors will be unable to discriminate productive from wasteful proposals. The absence of suitable copyright, patent and other legal protections compounds the problem. That is why a development bank to negotiate safeguards makes good sense.
To ease its task, the bank should be saddled with few rules. The West can rightfully insist that assistance be conditioned on democratic political reforms and viable economic policies. That means eventually creating workable price systems and convertible currencies.
Beyond these basic requirements, the bank's directors will have to appraise private and public projects on a case-by-case basis. But to eliminate public projects arbitrarily is to impose an ideological litmus test that makes no sense when the larger goal is to preserve budding democratic reforms.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By CARL SOMMERS

 BODY:

Entry to East Germany
Q. Now that travel between the two Germanys is unrestricted for German citizens, what are the requirements for foreigners traveling to and in East Germany? Will I still have to exchange a certain amount of money for each day I am there? - V. H., Putnam Valley, N.Y.
A. East Germany has dropped the requirement that foreigners entering the country convert to East German marks the equivalent of about $15 for each day in the country. Otherwise, East Germany has retained its entry requirements.
Those traveling to East Germany must first book hotel accommodations through an American travel agent. Those staying at private residences must apply for permission through a travel agent or the East German Embassy (Embassy of the German Democratic Republic, 1717 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036; 202-232-3134). Hotel bookings can take 10 days to several weeks; approval for a stay at a private residence takes up to eight weeks. When travelers enter East Germany and show vouchers confirming their arrangments for accommodations, they will be given a visa, cost about $8. Visas are good for one entry only. Travel inside East Germany is not restricted, except that travelers must stay in the hotels or private residences listed on their visa applications. 
Despite the numerous new crossing points along the East Berlin-West Berlin border, Americans still must enter East Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie or the Friedrichstrasse subway station. On showing their passports, Americans get a permit for a day trip. Americans traveling by car or train through East Germany en route to West Berlin get transit visas at the border. Such drivers must stay on special routes marked ''transit.'' Those flying into West Berlin do not need visas.
 
Carry-On Bag Dimensions
Q. I need to have a case constructed for the photo gear I take along on my travels. What is the largest size permissible for carry-on luggage? - M. M., Pinellas Park, Fla.
A. It is difficult to specify dimensions if you will be storing your case in the overhead compartment, as there are at least 15 types of aircraft used by the major airlines, and the overhead compartments of each are a different size. But airlines require that heavy items like camera cases be stored under the seat, for the safety of passengers. The size of the space under seats is standard: the total of the measurements of the length, width and depth of a bag must not exceed 45 inches; but bear in mind that the space under airline seats usually is not more than 9 inches.
 
Ice-Skating in Europe
Q. I will be living in Europe this winter and spring and would like to attend some ice-skating competitions. Could you tell me about events coming up? - E. S., New York, N.Y.
A. Listed below are the major competitions coming up in Europe. Whenever possible, where to get tickets and their prices are included. National figure skating associations are provided in other cases; they will be helpful in providing ticket information. Telephone numbers include country and city codes for calls from the United States.
The European Figure Skating Championships will take place Jan. 30 to Feb. 4 in Leningrad. U.S.S.R. Skating Federation, 8 Lazhnetskaia, Moscow 119871; telephone, 7-095-201-0854.
The Nordic Figure Skating Championships will be held Feb. 10 and 11 in the Helsinki Ice Stadium (Helsingin Jaahalli), at 11-13 Nordenskioldinkatu; 35-80-418122. Tickets, $9 to $13, will be sold at the stadium.
The Sofia Press Cup competition takes place Feb. 16 to 18 in Sofia, Bulgaria, with ladies' and men's figure skating and ice dancing. Bulgarian Skating Federation, 18 Tolbukhin, 1000 Sofia; 359-2-8651. The Basler Cup, an international ice-dancing competition, will be held Feb. 17 and 18 in Basel, Switzerland. The events will be at Margarethen Park, telephone 41-61-35.95.95. Tickets are $6.70 a day, $15 for both days.
A junior ladies' figure skating competition will take place in Brassanone, Italy March 30 and 31. Italian Ice Skating Federation, 44/B Via Piranesi, 1-20137, Milan; 39-2-76110261.
In Gdansk, Poland, an international senior ice-dancing competition March 30 to April 1 also includes junior ladies' and men's pair skating and juniors' ice dancing. Polish Figure Skating Association, 6A Lazienkowska, 00-449 Warsaw; 48-22-289806.
In Grenoble, France, a senior ice-dancing competition will be held April 5 to 8. Tickets, $13 to $21, are available, starting next month, from Serge Bouquet, 40 Boulevard Clemenceau,38000 Grenoble, France; 33-76-54.67.80, as of February 1990. Credit card payments will be accepted by telephone.
 
Argentine Money Exchange
Q. I am getting conflicting messages about the best method of changing money in Buenos Aires and whether to take money in cash or traveler's checks. - W.G.S., Westport, Conn.
A. Since Dec. 15, the exchange rate has been freed in Argentina. This means the rate may vary greatly from day to day, but there should not be much difference among the various exchange offices and banks. Since banks in Argentina are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, one of the exchange houses in the financial district around San Martin and Corrientes Streets is probably the best bet. Most big hotels have an exchange window offering a competitive rate. There is also an exchange window on the right as you leave customs in the Buenos Aires airport. Buying australs, the national currency, before leaving the United States is not recommended because the rate changes so rapidly.
It is a good general rule for the sake of security to use traveler's checks, but many travelers to Argentina find it convenient to bring American cash, in a variety of denominations, 1-, 5-, 10- and 20-dollar bills. Many merchants still prefer dollars, and some goods, such as and the silver and old jewelry in Buenos Aires's antiques markets, are priced in American dollars. The singles can be used for tips.
Another bit of advice: take enough money to cover all your expected expenses and don't count on being able to use credit cards in Argentina; many establishments do not accept them when inflation soars. Moreover, it may not be a good idea to use them, because you will not know the exchange rate at which you will be billed when the transactions are calculated; the exception is major hotels, many of which which set rates in dollars.

In 1985, at the age of 81, weakened by heart trouble and with fading vision, William L. Shirer returned to Berlin for the first time in nearly four decades. It was the occasion of President Ronald Reagan's controversial visit to a World War II cemetery in Bitburg, West Germany, where German soldiers, including members of the SS, were buried. Mr. Shirer had accepted an invitation from his former employer, CBS, ''to comment on German reaction . . . and see how the Germans were faring forty years after the end of Hitler.'' He left the country profoundly depressed. He was alarmed that Mr. Reagan had chosen to excuse the Nazi war dead as ''victims'' of the evil of ''one man,'' when in reality, Mr. Shirer had always believed, the German nation was deeply complicit in Hitler's crimes. But Mr. Shirer was far more disturbed by what he took to be the attitude of the German people, by what he considered their eagerness to forget, even in some cases to forgive, the Nazi past. (He will not, one assumes, be much encouraged by the present enthusiasm for German reunification.) For Mr. Shirer, facing the German past is not only a moral necessity, it is a thread that has run through his entire adult life. That is nowhere clearer than in ''A Native's Return,'' the third and final volume of his lengthy memoirs, ''20th Century Journey.'' He writes of his experiences since 1945, virtually all of them in the United States. But even here, his thoughts seldom stray far from the Germany that he covered in the 1930's and 40's as a radio correspondent for CBS and that he chronicled in 1941 in his first book, ''Berlin Diary.'' Much of this new memoir consists of meditations on the great evil he had witnessed in his youth, the enormity of which he still cannot fully comprehend. Much of it consists of recapitulations of pieces of Nazi history, which he has spent much of his adulthood reconstructing. And much of it consists of an account of the writing and reception of his celebrated 1960 book, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' which remains the cornerstone of his large reputation.
Wading through this sprawling autobiography makes clear, however, that Mr. Shirer's preoccupation with Germany is not just a reflection of his fascination with the Nazi past. It is also a reflection of his own difficulties in coming to terms with the America he encountered when he returned home in 1945. Above all, perhaps, it reflects his enduring bitterness at having been dismissed by CBS in 1947 and blacklisted throughout the broadcasting industry for the next 15 years - an experience that shattered his professional life, his financial security and many of his personal relationships and that ultimately helped push him toward the writing of his most famous and successful books.
Mr. Shirer's account of the CBS incident is the most original and important section of this shapeless but intermittently interesting book. Like his colleague and close friend Edward R. Murrow, Mr. Shirer returned to New York after the war as one of the most honored figures in broadcast journalism. For several years he was a popular, successful and well-paid radio commentator and newspaper columnist, much in demand on the lecture circuit. Then suddenly he found himself removed from the air and, in effect, fired by CBS. He has, he claims, never understood why. A clue to Mr. Shirer's plight, although he himself does not identify it as such, may be his relatively benign view of the postwar Soviet Union. Mr. Shirer opposed containment and many of the other cold war policies the United States was embracing in 1946 and 1947, and he spoke openly of his scorn for what he considered hysterical fears of Russian militarism and domestic subversion. Nothing in his past and nothing in his public statements suggested that he had ever been a Communist, a fellow traveler or even a serious dissident. But in the superheated atmosphere of the late 40's, being simultaneously an important public figure and a critic of cold war orthodoxy was, apparently, enough to destroy his career.
Mr. Shirer's recounting of Edward R. Murrow's role in his demise at CBS may come as a shock to those who revere Murrow as the saintly patriarch of broadcast journalism. Murrow, a vice president of CBS at the time, clearly acquiesced in Mr. Shirer's ouster, probably in response to pressures from nervous sponsors and William Paley, the head of the network. But Murrow also, apparently, made vigorous efforts to defend himself and the network from criticism by actively blackening the reputation of a man who had been a close friend for more than a decade. ''What had they done to Ed Murrow up on the nineteenth floor amid the nineteen vice presidents?'' Mr. Shirer asks. ''I was appalled by his disregard for the truth.'' Years later, after Murrow himself had been eased out of CBS in the wake of his own belated attack on McCarthyism, he offered Mr. Shirer a muted apology. And as he died of cancer in the 60's, he attempted to effect a reconciliation. But while Mr. Shirer is generous in his assessment of Murrow's many accomplishments, his stark account of the CBS imbroglio is harsh and unforgiving.
Nothing in Mr. Shirer's account of his subsequent life matches the passion and vividness of his story of the events of 1947. He describes in almost gruesome detail his long struggle to make a living by writing books, lecturing and pursuing other consistently unsuccessful moneymaking schemes. He discusses the inception of each of his books, recapitulates something of their contents and then offers an exhaustive and tedious commentary on virtually all his reviews, domestic and foreign (a commentary suffused with resentment toward academic historians, who have generally held his work in light regard). He gives a somewhat embarrassing description of his extramarital affairs and a painful account of the breakup of his long marriage (although he seems to draw only a faint connection between the two). He meditates on the world around him, not (as in the previous volumes of his memoirs) as a journalist who was actively involved in events, but as a solitary writer living mainly in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts and forming impressions by reading newspapers and watching television.
Here, as in the earlier memoirs, Mr. Shirer is generally reticent about revealing much of his own inner life. In the reportorial tradition, he prefers to comment on the behavior of others and keep himself in the background. But this is by necessity the most personal of his books, and even if inadvertently it conveys a sense of the character and values that have shaped his career. In many ways, Mr. Shirer has remained throughout his life what he was in his youth: a small-town Midwesterner with a straightforward, vaguely populist view of the world; a man who has never had much patience with the pessimism and ambiguity that suffuse Eastern intellectual life; a writer who has never offered much of an interpretation of the great events he has described, but has viewed them through the prism of his own basic decency and apparent innocence. He has responded to the great evils he has witnessed in the 20th century with a simple and in many ways appealing bewilderment, as things to be carefully and patiently chronicled but never to be truly understood. Even his own less epochal travails in the 40's and 50's he views with seeming incomprehension; there can be no rational explanation, he appears to believe, for intelligent people behaving so badly.
''Whatever happens now, and whenever,'' Mr. Shirer writes at the close of this book, contemplating the end of his long and eventful life, ''I am glad to have lived through the turbulent, tumultuous twentieth century.'' The millions of readers who have found in his many books a compelling picture (even if seldom a compelling explanation) of some of the century's great events have reason to be glad of that as well.
 
FEAR OF REUNIFICATION
 Even William L. Shirer, who has kept Europe under a magnifying glass for 60 years, admits to surprise at the suddenness with which the nations in what used to be the Soviet bloc ''have freed themselves from 40 years of Communism.''
But Mr. Shirer - who concludes ''A Native's Return, 1945-1988,'' the third volume of his memoirs, ''20th Century Journey,'' with two visits to the Soviet Union - is wary, he said in a recent telephone conversation during a vacation in Sarasota, Fla. The revolts in Eastern Europe, he said, ''have exposed the bankruptcy of Communism, which could not feed its people, could not clothe them properly or find them homes. But it is going to be terribly difficult for them to change themselves into market economies and political democracies. In the next year or two they are going to face terrible economic problems, especially Poland and Rumania.''
The Germanys pose special problems. ''The first problem will be the eruption of pro-Nazi interests in East Germany,'' he said. Reunification may be inevitable, he added, ''but our so-called Western allies are much more against it than they are saying publicly.'' Why? ''They're frightened. West Germany is already the strongest economic power in Europe, and combined with East Germany, it would be the strongest military power. The Warsaw Pact is dead. Germany would no longer have to rely on Washington or seek our advice.''
Mr. Shirer, a radio journalist, came late to writing: CBS let him go when a sponsor withdrew its support during the so-called Red menace blacklists of the late 1940's.
But despite his 85 years, his weak heart, poor eyesight and failing hearing, Mr. Shirer maintains momentum: Bantam Books has bought his next work, ''The Last Days of Tolstoi.'' He expressed annoyance that Little, Brown, the publisher of ''A Native's Return,'' turned down ''Tolstoi.'' But then he chuckled: Little, Brown had also refused ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' the best seller on which his reputation rests.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: The Dunbar Apartments;
Switching to the Rental Track in Harlem

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE best news for the Dunbar Apartments in Central Harlem may be the city-sponsored rehabilitation activity around it, which gives a lift to the area's rental market and helps secure the Dunbar's future.
The Dunbar's future is no new concern. This is a full square block of 536 apartments in six red-brick, walk-up buildings that John D. Rockefeller Jr. developed to wide acclaim in the 20's. It was the first large cooperative project in the country built for occupancy by blacks, although it became a rental in the Depression. Manhattan's first large garden-apartment complex, it was named for Paul Laurence Dunbar, a black poet who lived from 1872 to 1906.
The Landmarks Preservation Commission was eloquent about its significance to black social history in 1970 when it was designated a landmark. A list of its tenants reads like a Black Who's Who, the commission said: Countee Cullen, poet; W. E. B. DuBois, editor; A. Philip Randolph, labor leader; Paul Robeson, singer, actor and athlete; Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, dancer, and Matthew A. Henson, North Pole explorer. 
Ira Kellman, a lawyer with property interests elsewhere in Manhattan, bought the Dunbar two years ago this month from another entrepreneur who had acquired it from the Goldome Bank for Savings.
Goldome had failed in its efforts to bring about a co-op conversion, which a tenant committee fought. The property was sold after $11.8 million in building improvements paid for by the bank.
Dunbar Associates - with Mr. Kellman, Gary L. Nave, a real estate owner and manager, and Lawrence Bernstein, an accountant, as general partners - bought the property for $5.65 million, or $10,500 an apartment, of which $3 million was cash. After two years, operations are about breaking even, Mr. Kellman said.
For Harlem, the Dunbar saga has become a test of whether, in the hackneyed catchwords of housing parlance, market forces can turn around a troubled property. Will the Dunbar ever return to co-op status as the housing reformers of John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s day advocated?
The Dunbar is bounded by 149th Street and 150th Street, and by Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard (Seventh Avenue) and Frederick Douglass Boulevard (Eighth Avenue). The side streets around it are filled with buildings undergoing rehabilitation under the city's 10-year housing plan, a plus for the neighborhood's ability to attract wage-earning new tenants.
Long years of stable rents put the complex in dire straits when the inflation of the 70's struck. The downward spiral never led to abandonment, but deferred maintenance caused other problems. So did the lack of an adequate security system, and the innumerable doors off the central courts.
To build such apartments today on free land would cost perhaps seven times what Dunbar Associates paid for them. Preservation is a civic concern, but previous efforts to stabilize the Dunbar's future in the 80's ended in disappointment.
AT one point, an $11.8 million rehabilitation was undertaken by the city and the mortgagee, the Goldome Bank for Savings. But tenants resisted a plan to convert the building to a co-op, which would have increased their monthly costs.
Subsequently another owner, Edward I. Penson, head of a management firm that also managed the Vandeveer apartments in central Brooklyn, tried to run the development as a rental. But he had trouble raising financing and decided eventually to sell.
Vacancies had been accumulated for years in hope of a conversion. Dunbar Associates also has conversion as a longterm goal, but it has spent money to put the vacancies in shape and rented them out at market levels.
Mr. Kellman said he is hopeful that the development can also be run successfully as a rental. With improved rent collections, evictions of long-delinquent tenants and rentals of vacancies, the monthly income has greatly improved.
Some 1,200 building violations have been dealt with, he said, and a system for handling maintenance complaints has gone into effect.
But at best, it is hard to run the Dunbar apartments successfully as a rental. In 1988 the 140 rent-controlled apartments were renting for an average of $40 a room a month, and the 340 occupied rent-stabilized apartments rented at an average of $80 a room. At $40 a room, a controlled tenant in a five-room apartment would be paying $200 a month.
Housing managers estimate that it costs about $90 a room a month - or about $360 a month for a four-room apartment - just to operate and maintain a building, without either taxes or debt service. No privately owned building can be expected to run long without financing, or debt. The Dunbar pays low taxes because the rehabiliation work done in the 80's qualified for abatements under the J-51 program.
For the new owner, the hope lay in vacancies, and what they could command on the market. There were 56 vacancies when Dunbar Associates bought the property. There have been 70 more since, through turnover and court action against long-term rent delinquents.
Now, with the renting program, there are 120 new tenants in the upgraded apartments, paying close to $160 a room per month, or roughly $650 for a four-room apartment and $750 to $800 for a five-room. Incoming tenants typically earn $25,000 to $40,000. If there is normal turnover, new vacancies should average about 25 a year, Mr. Kellman said.
THE ability of the Dunbar to attract tenants able to afford those rents encourages the owner to think that a conversion is possible. They would be better off, he claims, devoting $60 or $70 a month of their housing budget to mortgage payments, building a stake in their housing, rather than pouring it all into rent.
Meanwhile, Dunbar Associates investors have yet to see any return on their money, he said, although $500,000 was returned to them at the time of the refinancing.
They have gotten a $9 million mortgage on the property from the Ensign Savings Bank, however. The loan included money usable only for certain building improvements. One has already been done: $220,000 was spent to remove 2,400 linear feet of asbestos.
There is $1.3 million left for landscaping and window replacement. The Dunbar has 4,200 old windows. There also is a problem with the landmarks agency. To meet the strict specifications of its window code, the Dunbar would have to spend $1.2 million for custom-extruded windows. Robert Ecker, vice president of Ecker Manufacturing Corporation of Mount Vernon, N.Y., a leading manufacturer and installer of replacement windows, said that only smaller buildings, typically in prestigious neighborhoods with higher-income tenants, have been buying new windows that meet the Landmarks Commission's standards.
''The metal frames must match the rolls and curves of the old wood frame beneath it,'' Mr. Ecker said. ''We've done it at 39 Fifth Avenue and in a dozen buildings in Brooklyn Heights.''
To do it at the Dunbar Apartments would result in costs that the tenants can ill afford, Mr. Kellman said. The most he is willing to pay for window replacement is $800,000, or about $185 a window. The owner is still negotiating with the commission's staff, which only in recent months has shown a disposition to compromise. But the two sides are still apart. Meanwhile, many tenants have drafty windows.
Most of the rest of the budget for improvements is to be used for landscaping in the rundown central garden court, the pride of the development in the early days. Brochures from the 1930's show it as a verdant vista through an arch off Seventh Avenue.
Among those looking forward to the work is Leon Campbell, the 52-year-old manager of the Dunbar for the last five years, who has 22 years of building management experience.
''Tenants here have been through a lot,'' he said. ''They were very mistrustful. But they believe what they see. We just completed a laundry room - that helps. You've got to have patience and perseverance, you've got to keep your word and provide service. And if you can't, you've got to tell them why.''
He said he doubted that any conversion to a co-op could be undertaken successfully in less than five or six years.
The improvement program and the new management apparently havesucceeded, at least for the time being, in stabilizing relations with tenants, strained during the 80's. The management says that active tenant organizing has ceased. ''Things are peaceful now,'' said William K. DeFoussett, a 69-year-old retired State Department security guard, whose parents brought him to the Dunbar in 1927, when he was 7 years old. He and his wife have lived in it continuously since 1947.
As a rent-controlled tenant paying a rent he would not disclose, Mr. DeFoussett is not among the most likely purchasers in any new conversion. But asked if he would ever consider buying his apartment, Mr. DeFoussett replied, ''I might buy for my son.''

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: As-of-Right Construction;
Kalikow Opts for a 58-Story Lower Manhattan Hotel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
PETER S. KALIKOW did not want to spend any more time going through the complex approval process necessary to build a 29-story office building in lower Manhattan. So he decided to go the easier route and build a 58-story hotel instead.
Because the hotel is being developed as of right, with much less space than the office project, it was subject to less municipal scrutiny. But the slender, glass-sheathed shaft is sure to have a greater esthetic impact on its surroundings, including St. Paul's Chapel, the 18th-century landmark where President Washington worshiped.
The 584-room hotel, across from the World Trade Center, is to be 588 feet high, making it one of the tallest in New York City. Mr. Kalikow, the developer, who publishes The New York Post, expects that it will cost about $85 million and be finished by the end of 1991. It will occupy an L-shaped site bounded by Fulton, Church and Dey Streets and by the former headquarters of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company at 195 Broadway, which Mr. Kalikow also owns. 
Designed by Eli Attia Architects of Manhattan, the Kalikow hotel will have a curtain wall of gray glass and about 380,000 square feet of space. The lot is zoned for a floor-area ratio of 15, with a bonus of up to 20 percent for the creation of open space.
''It shouldn't be a surprise that a 15 F.A.R. zone can produce a large building,'' said Con Howe, executive director of the City Planning Department. ''It is across the street from the world's second and third tallest buildings. And it was never raised as an issue that the site was inappropriately zoned.''
Mr. Kalikow bought the whole block from A. T. & T. in 1983 for $93 million. The next year, the telephone company moved to its new headquarters at 550 Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, and Mr. Kalikow undertook a restoration and renovation of the older structure, a project supervised by Mr. Attia. Two small buildings on the west side of the block were demolished.
The old A. T. & T. headquarters, girdled by layer after layer of colossal Ionic columns, was designed by William Welles Bosworth and built in three phases from 1912 to 1923. At first, the Kalikow team planned a floor-by-floor expansion of the 195 Broadway building - in effect, a late fourth phase.
Then the plan changed. ''The natural use for that site is a combination office building and hotel,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''We felt five years ago that the downtown market needed at least one or two more hotels.'' But marketing studies and hotel-chain executives disagreed. ''The consensus was that a hotel would never make it,'' Mr. Kalikow said.
With that, the plan changed again and an office project returned to the table, meaning an enlargement of the building. Although a dozen hotel rooms could fit in floors of 6,000 or 7,000 square feet, that would not be enough space for a large financial-district commercial tenant. What was needed were floors closer to 18,000 square feet.
At the time, however, city planners were talking about treating the entire block as a single zoning lot, since the tax lots were under common ownership at the time of the 1961 Zoning Resolution. On a single zoning lot, the bulk of 195 Broadway - vastly overbuilt by modern rules - would have effectively foreclosed any development on Church Street, to say nothing of such large floors.
One proposal to get around this limit was to close Dey Street and rebuild it as a pedestrian passage, at Mr. Kalikow's expense. The developer would have owned the north half of the street and been able to use the air rights from the street for his new structure.
BUT Mr. Howe, of the planning agency, said planners ''thought that it was a terrible precedent to de-map a street that would continue to feel, look and act like a public street.'' Mr. Attia recalled that water-supply officials objected to having high-pressure lines under private property.
The next tack was to buy 154,000 square feet of air rights from St. Paul's Chapel of Trinity Parish, directly across Fulton Street. With them, Mr. Kalikow would have constructed a 29-story building, with floors of about 17,000 square feet, matching 195 Broadway in height and bulk, but not in materials. Mr. Attia proposed textured and colored glass to emulate the basic three-story grid of the original building.
''We felt that we should express the architecture through means that are contemporary,'' he told the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1987. ''Adding a building to line up with and echo 195 Broadway will also reinforce the independence of the church, providing a soft, neutral background.''
Commission members, who were reviewing the air-rights transfer because of St. Paul's landmark status, objected that the facade of the new building was merely a glass curtain wall. The architect then deepened the facade and included painted aluminum among the materials. But the commission still balked. With that, the plan changed again and the hotel was reborn. Mr. Kalikow, who believed that the demand for a downtown hotel had grown since he first envisioned one, asked Mr. Attia to sketch an as-of-right building. (City planners had determined that the block could be treated as separate zoning lots - meaning that the west parcel would not be penalized for the bulk of 195 Broadway.) ''We decided to make a statement that had nothing to do with 195,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''I said to Eli, 'Let's stop trying to blend in.' And he said: 'You remember the monolith in ''2001?'' That's what I see there.' ''
Mr. Attia acknowledged that the new design bears no relationship to 195 Broadway and makes no attempt to create a sympathetic setting or background for St. Paul's Chapel. ''An as-of-right building assumes certain detachments from those concerns,'' he said, adding that ''as-of-right buildings are part of the fabric of Manhattan.''
Because the project does not require special permits or variances, Community Board 1 took no formal position, although there were objections to the tower's height and proportions. Brian Principe, a partner of Mr. Attia, described the meeting: ''They asked, 'Is there anything we can do about it?' We said, 'No, this is as-of-right and we're here only as a courtesy.' So they asked, 'Well, then, what are you charging for parking spaces?' ''
WITHOUT the air-rights transfer, the project was no longer subject to review by the Landmarks Commission. ''I was rather startled that he didn't come back with a revised design,'' said David F. M. Todd, the commission chairman, ''because the ground on which we found ourselves unable to give a complete, supportive report really had more to do with material choices than with form, composition or the disposition of elements.''
But that was just the point for the developer. ''Eli and I, through the 1980's, were the leading advocates of glass buildings,'' Mr. Kalikow said. ''I cannot stand new stone buildings. I hate them. One Ninety-five is different. That's a Greek temple. But I can't build a building like that today.''
With construction now under way, Mr. Kalikow has turned to the details of the hotel, where the basic rate will probably be close to $210 a night.
On the eighth floor of 101 Park Avenue, the skyscraper in which the developer has his offices, is a full-scale mockup of two rooms, all the way down to flowers on the table and extra pillows and blankets.
Mr. Kalikow has studied the rooms as if he might have to stay in one.
''I've got to be able to do this,'' he said, sitting in a bedside chair, propping his feet up on the bed and turning his gaze toward the television cabinet across the room. And speaking of the chairs, he said, ''I'm unhappy with the size.'' He ran his hand over the sharp edges of the bedside bureau and said, ''These are going to be rounded.'' He confessed one disappointment: He could not get glass doors for the showers and had to settle for curtains.
Mr. Kalikow may operate the hotel himself. ''I'm not aiming for that, but if I have to, I will,'' he said, smiling as he added, ''I know more about hotels than I know about newspapers.'' A big operator might be a liability, he said, because ''you're judged by the worst hotel in the chain.'' He mentioned a hotel in Atlanta and its presidential suite, saying: ''If I had a rent-controlled apartment in the Bronx that was like that, I'd be in jail.''
Asked why he lavished such attention on so many fine points in room decor, Mr. Kalikow answered: ''I'm going to build 600 of these. I only have to get one right. The other 599 will follow.''

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Teen-Agers and the Trap of Affluence

BYLINE: By Roger Keizerstein; Roger Keizerstein, a clinical social worker who specializes in the treatment of children, lives in East Setauket.

 BODY:
I SIT in the back row of the Seaport deli, that twilight hub of East Setauket, alternately reading a newspaper, picking at a plate of fried seafood and surveying the comings and goings of teen-agers who casually drift in and out.
These teen-agers are casualness in motion. They enter the deli barefooted or in tennis sneakers, wearing long baggy shorts or pants rolled up to their knees. Their shirts, usually seeksucker or flannel, hang loosely below their waists. Their hair is styled in uneven new-wave cuts that have a peculiar symmetry. They are never encumbered by pocketbooks or wallets, carrying their cash and car keys in hand. 
The girls are pretty and the boys are handsome, in that clean-looking, rosy-cheeked, well-cared-for way. When they speak they stretch their vowels slightly and their tone is never definitive, even when ordering food. They never talk about intense subjects that arouse emotions, like politics or romance. They are mostly quiet and patient. After receiving their food, they pull away from the deli in Saabs, Volvos and BMW's.
I believe the casualness comes from affluence and stability. Their lives haven't been touched by urban crime and poverty or the economic fretfulness and congestion of old suburbia. Within two square miles of the seaport is a harbor full of boats and sails, a forest of ancient towering trees, farms with horses, cows and chickens, and nurseries filled with row upon row of colorful flowers. In this bucolic paradise, who wouldn't be casual and carefree?
I wonder, though, if these teen-agers understand the vast differences between the world in which their parents came up and the world they face beyond the cozy confines of their small, countrified world. Do they know that the house that they're living in today cost approximately eight times the price their parents paid for it 20 years ago? Do they know that the average American car costs $12,000? Do they know that the price of borrowed money is twice as much as it was in their parents' day?
I suspect not. I suspect that they go on weeklong school ski trips to Utah and Colorado, and participate in summer enrichment programs in France and Italy, with the same casualness with which they get in and out of their shiny new cars. Maybe they should go skiing in the western Rockies, visit the Eiffel Tower and view the frescoes of Michaelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. These are surely enriching experiences, or at least they could be. They might even serve to make some of these teen-agers better people.
But I wonder if these young people aren't being misled, set up for a big fall. How many of them will be able to continue this kind of life style, independent of their parents, after graduating from college or professional school? How many will even be able to afford their own apartment and car? What the economy giveth to one generation, from another it sometimes taketh away.
If I were a parent of a teen-ager in an affluent town, I'd be ambivalent about how high a lifestyle I'd want my children to lead, although I might be tempted to raise them in a luxurious fashion for psychological reasons that might not be very sound. Many parents overindulge their children to compensate for what they didn't have as children and to compete with other families. The motivation behind these reasons is a recipe for trouble.
We are living in a society in which many of our ills are the result of having too much, as opposed to too little. It is very hard for young people who have been given so much and have high material expectations to face a life in which the flow of milk and honey is temporarily discontinued, or even halted.
So many young adults are returning home after completing their education and competing briefly in the job market, and staying home into their middle and late 20's because they can't tolerate giving up the life style to which they'd become accustomed. Living at home at this stage is damaging to one's self-esteem and may lead to overdependency.
That's why when it comes to raising children, I fall on the side of modesty and restraint, although one parent's modesty and restraint is often another's extravagance and overindulgence. Nonetheless, I believe it's better to be pleasantly surprised by getting more than you expected than bitterly disappointed by getting much less than what you were brought up to so casually receive.

HEADLINE: Enrollment Slips at Many Private Schools

BYLINE: By PRISCILLA VAN TASSEL

 BODY:
PRIVATE elementary and secondary schools in New Jersey have experienced some slippage in enrollments as they try to cope with a declining school-age population and a slowdown in the economy.
A recent survey by the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools, an organization of some of the state's most prestigious private schools, shows that nearly two-thirds of its 58 member schools are enrolling fewer students this academic year than last.
Although overall enrollments for association members decreased only 1.3 percent and most schools have lost just a handful of students, the downturn represents a departure from other years, when growth occurred even though the number of school-age children was declining in the overall population. In general, schools in or around urban areas were hardest hit. ''We've been feeling pretty flush in New Jersey in recent years because the economy has been booming,'' said Edward Lingenheld, president of the association and headmaster of the Rutgers Preparatory School in Somerset. ''But people are paying tuitions with discretionary income, and on their list of priorities, tuition for their children's school might be on the list of touchables.'' 
To bolster their enrollments, many schools have begun aggressive new marketing campaigns and established contact with real-estate agents and relocation companies. Some schools are focusing on improving relations with alumni in the hope of attracting their children and extra donations while others are turning to parents of enrolled students as recruiters.
Tuition plans that permit parents to make payments monthly rather than twice a year are becoming more common, and enlarged scholarship funds are also becoming more common, as schools try to cushion the cost of a private education.
With the median tuition approaching $9,000 for a private day high school and $14,000 for a boarding school, a number of educators are concerned about the pessimistic economic forecast.
''Am I worried about it?'' said Arlene Gibson, headmistress of the Kent Place School, a girls' day school in Summit. ''Sure, everybody's worried about it. You watch it very carefully, and especially you watch, because of where we are, what is happening on Wall Street, at A. T. & T. and the drug companies.''
Last spring, Kent Place, with a tuition of $8,700 for the upper grades, was facing 24 vacancies for this academic year, mostly in its upper school. The mood on campus was somber as faculty members pondered how they could continue offering, as part of the school's rigorous curriculum, advanced placement classes with as few as four or five students taking part.
But by the fall, Kent Place was able to open with a balanced budget, thanks to some late acceptances and a new admissions director, who over the summer followed up all inquiries and got in touch with real-estate offices and corporations that were relocating families to the area. School officials say they did not lower standards to meet their goal. ''The board decided that rather than changing the type of student we were looking for, we'd just tighten our belt a little,'' Mrs. Gibson said. ''If you change the tenor of a school, I don't think you ever get that back.''
Nationally, girls' schools have had a particularly hard time maintaining enrollments, as an increasing number of students opt for a coeducational setting. Even with a student body of 447 this year, Kent Place is still substantially below its peak enrollment of 501 students in 1983. But instead of sweeping its identity under the mat, Kent Place has decided to aggressively market its single-sex status.
''Instead of acting as if we're incidentally a girls' school, we're letting people understand why that is important to them,'' said Mrs. Gibson, who has organized a group of girls' day schools at the national level to publicize the advantages of girls' schools.
One private school that has opted for coeducation in part to ease its enrollment difficulties is the Admiral Farragut Academy in Pine Beach, the nation's first preparatory school to focus on naval training. The $11,500-a-year boarding school officially opened its door to women this month, although none are expected to enroll in the program until the fall.
''Demographics was a consideration,'' said Capt. Robert Matthies, the superintendent of the 170-cadet academy. ''If you take the pie and take the small sliver that wants a quasi-military program and then divide that in half because you're only talking about boys, then you're down to a very small segment of the market.''
Because of the academy's specialized nature, school officials are not counting on the shift to coeducation to totally solve their enrollment difficulties - there was a drop of 53 cadets this year alone - so they have begun to market themselves in areas as far away as the Bahamas and South America. Their efforts are not dissimilar to those of most boarding schools, which are casting their nets wider and wider around the country to draw quality candidates with diversified backgrounds.
 
Wider Geographic Pool
''There is no question that we're doing more traveling than we used to,'' said Philip Pratt, director of admissions and a mathematics teacher at the Lawrenceville School. ''All of the boarding schools are.''
Enrollment at Lawrenceville, at 761 students this year, has never been higher, in part because of the school's decision three years ago to become coeducational.
Day schools are also drawing from a wider geographic pool. The 652 students at the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood commute from 69 communities as far north as Rockland County and as far south as Union City and Hoboken.
The school, which has shown enrollment increases, has begun emphasizing a multicultural curriculum to reflect the area's changing population. More than one in four Dwight-Englewood students are members of minorities, with the largest growth occurring among Asian-Americans.
''One of the reasons our numbers are increasing slightly is that I would think and hope our school would be perceived as welcoming a diverse population,'' said Dr. James Van Amburg, the school's headmaster.
 
Shorter Waiting Lists
An increase in interest in private education among Asian-Americans also helped the Newark Academy in Livingston to fill vacancies last August. For the school, whose enrollment is still slightly off from a high of 495 five years ago, changing demographics has meant shorter waiting lists for many classes.
''We're aware that the pool of candidates is lower now than it used to be,'' said Dr. Allan Strand, the Newark Academy's headmaster.
Shorter waiting lists are not surprising, considering that New Jersey's school-age population has declined 28 percent since 1972. Private school officials hope that an increase in the birth rate, which is already affecting public elementary schools throughout the state, will ease enrollment shortfalls in private high schools by 1992.
Whether the increase in the general population will result in increased private school enrollment is unclear, however, especially since more than half of the elementary schools belonging to the New Jersey Association of Independent Schools have reported declines in enrollment.
One way private schools assess the impact of the economy is through their re-enrollment statistics.
 
Study Yields Surprises
''If there is softness in the economy, the tendency is for a considerable increase in attrition from currently enrolled students,'' Mr. Lingenheld of the Rutgers Preparatory School said. ''We haven't seen that; knock wood.'' Enrollment at Rutgers Prep has climbed back to its peak level of 1982.
Several years ago, when enrollments were slipping, Rutgers and two other private schools in the area shared the cost of a $50,000 market survey on independent education and how their schools in particular were perceived. The study resulted in few surprises, but it did lead to a renewed commitment to reduce attrition and convert inquiries into applications.
Rutgers Prep also sought to ease the financial strain of its $8,300 tuition by tripling its scholarship fund for middle-income students and seeking corporate scholarships for disadvantaged students.
 
Stricter Standards Pay Off
Other schools are using parents as their selling agents. At Gill/St. Bernard's School in Gladstone, volunteer parents conduct biweekly telephone drives to recruit new students and identify concerns of parents of already enrolled students. The school has also raised its admissions standards, imposed a dress code and emphasized good citizenship.
The stricter standards are apparently paying off. This year Gill's enrollment rose by 45 students to a total student body of 357, the largest increase of any school in New Jersey. A dramatic drop in the attrition rate of students from a high of 48 percent four years ago to 14 percent was largely responsible for the growth.
''When you are in an economic crunch and things are not going well, the tendency is to lower standards,'' said Christine Gorham, Gill's headmistress. ''That may be a short-term solution, but in the long term you'll be in trouble. People send their children to independent schools because they want to get something special for it.''
Gill's dramatic comeback is still more the exception than the rule. At the Mount St. Mary Academy in Plainfield, where enrollment is down 20 students this year, school officials are toying with the idea of offering a seventh and eighth grade or becoming a seven-day boarding school, instead of a five-day institution.
In Montclair, officials of the Montclair Kimberley Academy cite an increasingly transient business community and a growing popularity of public schools as prime reasons for their 52-student enrollment decline in the last three years. At the Neumann Preparatory School in Wayne, where enrollment had been as high as 300, there are now 172 students, despite a change to coeducation several years ago.
In the end, no marketing effort or internal reorganization could save the Atlantic Friends School in Brigantine. Faced with a faltering Atlantic City economy and a dwindling student body, the 89-year-old school shut its doors for good last year.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Why Be Surprised At the Budget Crisis?

BYLINE: By Richard A. Zimmer; State Senator Richard A. Zimmer, Republican of Delaware Township, is on the Senate Revenue, Finance and Appropriations Committee.

 BODY:
IN the words of New Jersey's Yogi Berra, it's deja vu all over again. A newly elected governor, who had predicted on the campaign trail that he could balance the state budget without a tax increase, is dropping hints that higher taxes might be necessary after all. He says he has discovered new information that was unavailable to him before the election.
Time will tell whether Jim Florio, like his two predecessors, will become a proponent of higher taxes early in his term. But there is no doubt that New Jersey faces an enormous budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year. This shortfall wasn't caused by an unexpected post-election decline in tax revenues. It was preordained by decisions made when the current budget was adopted last July 1 and confirmed by data publicly available long before Election Day. 
The state is in its current cash bind because the budget for fiscal year 1990 (which began last July 1 and ends this June 30) was based on unrealistic revenue estimates of the Treasury Department's Office of Management and Budget. These projections were roughly $200 million higher than those of the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services.
Some of us on the Senate Appropriations Committee argued unsuccessfully last spring that even the Office of Legislative Services estimates were too optimistic because they did not fully take into account New Jersey's economic slowdown, which was already under way.
We were soon proved correct. Revenue from almost every major tax came in below expectations from the very beginning of fiscal 1990. By Election Day, publicly available figures from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Legislative Services showed the shortfall at more than $100 million for the first four months of the fiscal year.
Even with the recently imposed emergency budget measures, there is grave doubt as to whether we will see anything close to the $250 million budget surplus with which we were supposed to end fiscal year 1990. That means there will be less to roll over into the budget for fiscal year 1991, a budget that is already guaranteed to be a fiscal nightmare.
Last year we finally exhausted the huge budget surpluses that had fueled explosive state spending growth since the mid-1980's. To avoid election-year tax increases and layoffs, this year's $12 billion budget was balanced with one-shot fiscal gimmicks that in many cases actually pulled revenue out of future budgets. They include:
* $110 million from accelerated sales tax collections on leased property.
* $65 million from increased income tax withholding.
* $77 million from accelerated collection of insurance premium taxes.
* $246 million from the ''Rainy Day Fund,'' supposed to be used to balance the budget in a recession.
* $100 million from the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
* $120 million from court-ordered windfall profits taxes.
* $45 million from an urban property insurance fund.
Besides coming up with new money to replace this one-shot revenue, next year's budget must also address these mandated state spending increases, among others:
* $550 million to fully finance the school aid formula.
* $160 million for new public employee salary contracts.
* $120 million for pensions, Social Security, health insurance and other fringe benefits.
* $120 million for correctional facilities.
* $140 million for medical assistance.
* $25 million in property rentals.
* $25 million for programs for the developmentally disabled.
* $15 million in debt service.
* $10 million for the Division of Youth and Family Services.
To these obligations could be added $628 million in capital spending urged by the Capital Budget and Planning Commission. (Virtually all capital spending was suspended by the fiscal year 1990 budget.) None of these projected spending obligations are surprises; they were all identified by the Office of Legislative Services last May. As a result of last year's fiscal legerdemain, we now must come up with several hundreds of millions of dollars in tax increases or spending cuts before we can spend one dime to deal with a softer economy, school financing obligations expected to be imposed by the State Supreme Court, property tax relief or urban aid, not to mention a host of campaign promises.
During the budget debate, I warned my colleagues that we were only pushing our fiscal problems into future years. But a year is an eternity in politics, especially when an election is imminent.
Now that the future is here, what should we do about it? The most obvious answer is to raise taxes. The better though more difficult course is finally to address the spending side of the fiscal equation.
We should begin as Jim Florio has proposed, with an in-depth audit of state government. Even after a period of relative austerity, there is still a lot of nonessential state spending that an aggressive audit can identify. We should get rid of ''perks'' like the personal use of state cars, not just for the money they cost, but for the message they convey, that resources are plentiful enough to cover wants as well as needs.
But, to effect major economies, the new administration must cut more than perks. It must eliminate popular but nonessential programs.
In the long run, neither tax increases nor program cuts will result in long-term fiscal equilibrium unless we restrain so-called ''formula driven'' spending - like education aid, pensions and medical assistance - that grows faster than revenue.
Ultimately, we need permanent institutional constraints against government profligacy. We must cap state spending increases and payroll growth. We need a permanent ''Rainy Day Fund'' to keep us from having to increase taxes during a recession, as well as a ''Sunny Day Fund'' to return a share of unanticipated surpluses to the taxpayers.
All these reforms have long been pending in the Legislature under the sponsorship of leaders of both parties, but they will not be realized without Jim Florio's leadership. They would be salutary if enacted as statutes, but would be most valuable as constitutional amendments impervious to repeal by later legislatures.
Thomas Jefferson was right when he said that, instead of depending on the good intentions of politicians, we should ''bind them down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.'' That is the most reliable protection against future budget ''surprises.''

HEADLINE: Questions on Closing A Dental School

 BODY:
The recent article on the closing of the Fairleigh S. Dickinson Jr. College of Dental Medicine raises some fundamental questions about the responsibility of a state for encouraging and maintaining private institutions for the benefit of its residents.
Although technically not state-related, all private institutions in New Jersey, except a handful exempted by a discriminatory grandfather clause, are state-controlled in the sense that they must have their offerings approved by the Department of Higher Education. They all depend for a major part of their budget upon tuition grants for New Jersey students and upon specific grants from the department for various projects. 
In addition to this, Fairleigh Dickinson had received special funds that enabled it to maintain its dental school and to train dentists there at considerably lower cost than it will cost to train them at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. Over the years, this state relationship maintained a high-quality program that benefited our faculty, staff and students as well as the residents of Bergen County. The vast majority of all these categories were New Jerseyans. Why junk all of this?
The excuse given was that the state was producing too many dentists. This argument, of course, assumes that dentists produced in New Jersey all set up practice in the state and that no one trained elsewhere could move into the state, a dubious premise at best. The real reason was that Fairleigh Dickinson's nonstate operation was competing with the University of Medicine and Dentistry for a diminishing pool of students, that there was a short-term fiscal crisis in Trenton, and that the Department of Higher Education could now afford to expand its dental program since the passing of a new bond issue.
Gov. Thomas H. Kean and Chancellor T. Edward Hollander had worked long and hard to upgrade state institutions. If one of the two dental schools had to go, they had no hesitation as to which one it would be. Fairleigh Dickinson was given an ultimatum: no more money to continue a quality program, but should you decide to close, we'll be happy to bankroll that operation.
What is the responsibility of the Governor and the Chancellor toward private institutions? In upgrading the facilities, equipment and faculty salaries of state colleges while keeping the tax-subsidized tuition artificially low, a great service has been done to the state. But a great many difficulties have also been visited upon private institutions, already hard hit by a soft economy and a shrinking student pool.
In addition to what would be normally a difficult situation, more and more corporate dollars have also been siphoned into state institutions.
A $27 million fund-raising campaign for the University of Medicine and Dentistry overlapped our own $12 million effort.
One needs to remember that the good health of both private and public education is deeply affected by public policy. Aside from Princeton, no New Jersey institution of higher learning can stand alone. To take the attitude that what happens to private institutions, to their students staff and faculty, is of no concern to the state is to forget that all the foregoing are residents, voters and taxpayers. One can only trust that Mr. Kean will appreciate more the value of private institutions as he takes up his new duties as president of one of them, even though it is one of those few excepted from the authority of the Department of Higher Education.
A merger or affiliation of some kind between the two dental schools not only would have been a kinder and gentler solution, but also, in the long run, would have saved tax dollars and preserved a program of quality and of national prominence.

HEADLINE: What Shapes a New Apartment House?

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
THE 13-STORY St. Andrew Hotel guarded the northwest corner of Broadway at its intersection with Amsterdam Avenue and 72d Street for half a century until it was pulled down during the Great Depression to make way for a two-story retail development that, in those hard days, paid a better return than old hotels.
Over the years, the complex became just another ''taxpayer,'' a building just big enough to carry the property taxes until something better came along.
Now the stores are gone and the Alexandria, a 202-unit condominium scheduled for completion in September, is rising on the spot. As the latest of a new generation of condominiums to rise along Broadway between Columbus Circle and 96th Street in the last seven years, the project is also a kind of map to the minds of today's apartment-house developers, a textbook on the Manhattan real estate market and a guide to how new buildings are shaped by economics, profit potentials, housing needs and zoning.
The developers for the $100 million project are William Zeckendorf Jr., for the Zeckendorf Company, and Peter Malkin and his W & M Properties, along with Arthur G. Cohen, a well-known real estate investor, and a partner or investor group the other principals identify only as SCC 72nd Street Association. 
Every new apartment project is built on a set of developer's assumptions worked out before the first concrete is poured. But as private partnerships, builders are under no obligation to reveal their secrets, and most discuss the internal affairs of a project only in the expectation of publicity.
Thus a willingness by the Alexandria's developers to share their thinking, up to a point, offers a chance to explore a process that produces, for most buyers, a fait accompli - this big, that view, so many dollars, take it or leave it.
The partners believe that the Alexandria - the name reflects the faintly Egyptian design elements of the building's multicolored brick and decorative ironwork - represents a third generation of Upper West Side apartment buildings. The first was made up of the big, multibedroom prewar buildings that dominate the neighborhood and give it its distinctive character. The second emerged after World War II as the boxy, glass and brick buildings filled with studios and one-bedroom apartments for singles and young couples. Now, in the third, bigger apartments are needed for an aging cohort of baby-boomers with children who are stretching for more space.
To reach this conclusion, the developers surveyed the market performance of the 2,000 other new condominiums in the Upper West Side, including Zeckendorf's own Columbia, Princeton House, Copley and Park Belvedere, and decided that the neighborhood was ready for more two-, three- and four-bedroom aprtments.
''We know all the buildings we've done and from looking at the Manhattan market which units have been doing well in primary sales and in resales and which untis have not performed well,'' said William Lie Zeckendorf, William Jr.'s 31-year-old son, who is running the day-to-day operations on the project, with Anthony Malkin, 27, who is Peter's son.
''If you look at the apartments that have been built on Broadway in the last seven years, 80 percent of them are studios and ones'' and the rest are twos,'' he said, referring to the number of bedrooms. ''Threes and fours are virtually nonexistent.''
The Alexandria, designed by David Childs of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, will in contrast be 47 percent two-, three-and four-bedroom aprtments, 44 percent standard studios and one-bedroom untis and 9 percent one-bedroom duplexes.
''The traditional base for the Upper West Side was the larger prewar apartments, so this type has tended to be underbuilt since the war,'' the younger Mr. Zeckendor said. ''We believe there is a significant market for the trade-up buyer in this area, and our design reflects that.''
But no one should believe that the big prewar apartments like those along Riverside Drive and West End Avenue are making a comeback. Their big dining rooms are a thing of the past in today's eat-and-run world, and the space they took has been given to more bathrooms - one per bedroom is the rule at Alexandria - and closet space.
Only one apartment, the 24th-floor penthouse, will contain a maid's room - another emblem of Upper West Side gentility. it will be tiny, as tradition dictates. But unlike the airshaft view that the maid's rooms in the old Riverside Drive co-ops offer, the one in the Alexandria will have the best view in the building, south down Broadway.
A health spa, including a 50-foot pool in the ''lower level'' - basement is a world not found in the New York developer's lexicon - will be open to owners only, a departure from many other buildings, whose developers sell memberships to outsiders to help carry the extra cost. A small, landscaped interior courtyard will be accessible from a workout room on the street level above the pool.
The services will be provided by 24-hour doormen, a daytime concierge, to receive deliveries, a resident superintendent and a staff of four or five porters, according to current plans. Mail will be left in lobby mailboxes, and each floor will have a garbage-compactor chute.
The partners paid $21.5 million for the 17,000-square-foot site. That is close to $1,300 a square foot and therefore at the middle to high end - the range is typically between $1,000 nd $1,500 a foot - for prime locations offering a combination of retail and residential development, brokers said.
The location, a major factor in values and apartment pirces, is rated as good, even very good, but not prime like Central Park West or Fifth Avenue. It offers views down Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue toward Lincoln Center and midtown from its south and east sides, and to West End Avenue, Riverside Drive and the Hudson River, from upper floors on its west side.
The intersection has the IRT subway station a hundred paces across 72d Street, crosstown bus service, Central Park two blocks to the east, Riverside Park two blocks to the west and an absence of high-rise contruction to block sunlight and sky on all sides.
Immediately across Broadway are Sherman Square and Verdi Park, a sliver better known a few decades ago as ''needle park,'' a notorious drug bazaar. The developers contributed a third of the $150,000 cost of fencing, planting and lighting it in hopes of erasing that memory from the minds of potential buyers. On a recent rainy day, one bedraggled idler still haunted the sidewalk beside the composer's diminutive statue, hissing: ''Smoke, smoke.''
The partners hope the archeitectural environment around their building will also be a marketing draw. Across Broadway and Amsterdam stand the Van Dyck and the Severn, two venerable co-ops. On the northeast corner of 71st and Broadway is the Dorilton, a landmarked 1902 Second Empire-style apartment building.
Directly to the north along Broadway stands the immense stony bulk of the Ansonia, a Broadway landmark whose twin turrets the Alexandria will respectfully salute with a lighted octagonal cupola of its own.
''One of the most interesting things about that area is the development that was done at the time of the Egyptian revival,'' said Mr. Childs, the archeitect. ''And that became the basis for the motif of the building, not only in the column decorations, but in the doors and in the grillwork, the entrance, the lighting fixtures and up to that lantern at the top of the building.''
Following Mr. Child's design, the owners have taken some pains to match the florid oranameted styles of their neighbors by including subtle lotus leaf ornamentation and $1 million in ironwork on the columns and multicolored brickwork of the project.
The Alexandria site, with a zoned floor-area ratio of 10, would not allow the developers the bulk they wanted to build their big apartments (floor-area ratio is the number of square feet in a building allowed for each square foot of lot size). So they bought air rights from five adjoining walk-ups on the 72d Street site and transferred them to the project.
The partners refused to disclose how much the development air rights cost them, citing the confidentiality of the sellers. Brokers estimate that such rights would sell for $30 to $50 a square foot, or $6.7 million for the 168,000 feet of development rights, assuming the price was about $40 a foot.
The building will thus contain 297,000 square feet, giving the site an effective F.A.R. of slightly more the 17, with setbacks starting at the 16th floor.
The purchase of the air rights brought another advantage to the partners - the right to put windows in the projects's western lot-line walls with views to the west that they afford, greatly increasing the appeal of the apartments.
The corner site, given its central location at a major intersecton, is important to the developers for reasons other than the convenience to transportaton for the new tenants. It is also a prime retail location, in keeping with the practice of the Zeckendorfs and other developers of putting retail space along the ground floors of residential buildings to sweeten the economic mix.
Real estate experts like to regard ground-floor retail space as a way of subsidizing land costs. It is not unusal for developers who retain ownership of street-level retail space, as the Alexandria partners will, to sell the space later, after values rise, to an investor.
Assuming that the Alexandria's 12,700 square feet of street-level retail space rents for a net price of $100 a square foot, said Albert Bialek, a major commercial real estate broker in Manhattan, the annual rent roll would amount to $1.2 million for the street-level space alone, while 7,800 square feet of second-floor retail space might fetch $400,000 a year net, brokers estimated, and 9,000 feet of basement retail and storage space an additional $300,000 a year.
An investor would buy that space on the bais of a 9 percent rate of return on the purchase price, Mr. Bialek explained, or $14.1 million, while on the same basis, the upper level and basement space might sell for an additional $7 million.
Mr. Bialek, whose company is Albert Bialek Associates, pointed out that many residential buildings are being developed in good commerical areas where high rents can be had for retail space. ''Without the stores,'' he said, ''these buildings wouldn't work.''
The younger Zeckendorf, when presented with this analysis, said only, ''I would not argue with that,'' but added that he thought he could get better than a 9 percent basis on the retail space. He added that the partners expected to retain ownership of the store space in the Alexandria, but noted that the retail space in the Copley and the Columbia had in fact been sold to investors.
As for an Alexandria retail tenant, the word among other brokers is that HMV Records, a British company, has contracted to rent the entire retail space, putting a huge record, tape and video store just a few blocks north of the big Tower Records store at 66th Street.
But the partners insist that no agreement has been reached among several retailers they said were interested in the space.
''There is no other large block of modern retail space on the Upper West Side,'' side Peter Malkin, whose W & M Properties is the lead leasing agent for the space. ''The size of the retail space was one of the considerations in designing the lobby entrance on 72d Street, keeping the retail and the residential as separate as possible, because when you get over to the lobby you are in a very quiet residential neighborhood.'' (The address will be 201 West 72d Street.) Besides the ground-level space, the stores will have 7,800 square feet of second-story space on a kind of mezzanine that will be visible from the street, and 4,500 square feet of basement retail space.
Finally, an additional 4,000 square feet of basement space will be divided into storage space for condominium owners to rent.
As for buyers of apartments, the market on the Upper West Side is as varied as anywhere in New York, the younger Mr. Zeckendorf said. It includes first-time buyers seeking small apartments, trade-up buyers looking for more room, expanding families needing several bedrooms, empty-nesters moving from large apartments to a smaller one, and investors who buy to rent.
Sales prices have not yet been determined, the partners said, but they estimated that apartments would go for $375 to $475 a square foot, slightly higher than prevailing prices in other condominiums in the area. Sales are scheduled to begin in April.
Assuming that the low end iscloser to $425 a square foot, since prices tend to creep up during construction, that translates into $250,000 Studios, $370,00 for a one-bedroom duplex, $450,000 for the smallest two-bedroom, two-bath unit, $830,000 for three-bedroom corner units and $1 million for a 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom apartment with 80 feet of a yard-wide terrace overlooking the intersection of Broadway and 72d Street.
In the midtown condominium market, foreign investors have become major players, as the ownership lists of many buildings in that area show. American investors have been discouraged from such investments because losses on the carrying charges of the apartments can no longer be deducted from income from other sources unless the investor can demonstrate an active, day-to-day role in managing the property.
William Lie Zeckendorf said that the Alexandria would not have a special marketing program in Japan, where most of the city's condominium-investors live, or elsewhere overseas. However, he said, ''people in Japan will be aware of this building.''
The buyers will have 10-year tax abatements on their condominium, thanks to the developers' purchase of 202 tax-abatement certificates from a low-income project on Staten Island, called Davidson Court, under the city's 421a program. The abatements cost $25,00 each, with the money used to pay for building low-income housing. The developers will make it back on the builing during construction and by being able to ask for higher prices for the under-taxed units.
To buy the $450,000 two-bedroom apartment with a 20 percent, $90,000down payment and a 10 percent fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage would require a minimum annual income of about $136,000, assuming that the lenders hold to their rule of not allowing a borrower's mortgage and interest costs to exceed 28 percent of gross income. A still higher income, to allow for taxes, would be needed once the building's 421a tax abatement is fully removed after 10 years.
The people who buy these expensive apartments often wonder how much the developers will pocket for their labors. Although all developers set profits targets when going into a project, the developers of the Alexandria declined to be specific about their hoped-for return. The accuracy of any estimated profit figures arrived at by outsiders would above all depend on how long the apartments take to sell, since short-term constructions loans are expensive and each month debt eats into profit.
The project is being built with a five-year construction loan of $107 million for Chemical Realty Group, a subsidiary of Chemical Bank, under a participating mortgage deal that guarantees the lender a share of the profits.
Some numbers are known, and if others are assumed to be in line with development costs at similar sites, an estimate of the project's profitability can be made. The developer puts the land cost at $21.5 million and the construction costs at $200 a square foot, with ''hard'' costs of concrete, labor and the like at about $120 a square foot and ''soft'' costs of interest, commissions and marketing at $80 a foot.
The developers have also put in the 421a tax abatements at $25,000 per apartment, for 202 apartments.
Adding in the assumed cost of $40 a foot for air rights from the adjoining low-rise buildings brings the total development cost to $92.7 million. With a 3 percent fudge factor typically included for such projects, the total cost would be $95.5 million.
On the other side, the developers will sell their 206,000 square feet of net residential space an estimated average of $425. That would produce $87.5 million, plus approximately $20 million for the retail space once it is fully leased, assuming the partners decide to sell it, for a total of $107 million in total potential revenues.
That warks out to a profit of about $11 million, very close to the $50 a square foot thatmany developers set as their target when they start a project. In rough terms, profits at that level wold represent a gain of $29,000 onthe smallest studio apartment, depending on whether the project's soft costs include brokers' fees, and $100,000 on the big four-bedroom corner apartments.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Those Awful Shuttle Fares

BYLINE: By DONALD L. PEVSNER; Donald L. Pevsner is an attorney, consumer advocate and travel industry entrepreneur based in Miami. He was assistant general counsel of Air Florida.

 BODY:
On Wednesday morning, Jan. 3, weekday Shuttle passengers on the Washington-New York and New York-Boston routes received a nasty New Year's present from the glitzy self-promoter Donald J. Trump. His Trump Shuttle raised its one-way weekday fares by an unprecedented 20 percent, to $119 from $99, thereby exacerbating the already excessive unrestricted air fare gouge that presently afflicts most of the nation's business (and many other) travelers. Its principal competitor on these busy routes, Pan American World Airways Inc., promptly matched the Trump Shuttle's increases.
Airline economics are complex, but understandable - so it's worthwhile taking a close look at the economics of the two shuttle routes. 
Pan Am's systemwide domestic costs for the second quarter of 1989 (the most recent figures available) were 8.1 cents a mile, meaning that it cost Pan Am 8.1 cents on average to fly each seat, filled or empty, one mile throughout its domestic system. On the airline's shuttle routes (191 miles New York-Boston; 215 miles New York-Washington), with their short length and extra costs for standby airplanes and crews, knowledgeable sources estimate that the costs rise to about 20 cents a mile.
Figures for the Trump Shuttle are not available, partly because Mr. Trump's acquisition of the Eastern Airlines Shuttle operation is relatively recent, and partly because the carrier has asked the Department of Transportation for a waiver that would permit it to keep its mandatory quarterly financial reporting confidential. Trump officials argued that a waiver was necessary to avoid ''severe competitive disadvantage,'' should Pan Am discover its rival's costs. But I submit that the real danger for Mr. Trump lies in the traveling public's discovery of the magnitude of his company's fare-gouging if the data become available.
With these airlines charging $119 for one-way weekday fares, I estimate that both the Trump Shuttle and Pan Am realize weekday yields of 52.8 cents a mile for the New York-Boston flight and 46.9 cents a mile for the New York-Washington run. These figures are arrived at after subtracting from gross revenues offsets of 8 percent for the Federal transportation tax and a further 10 percent for an aggregate of travel-agent commissions, minor weekday-fare dilution from the carriage of corporate employees enjoying secret bulk-fare deals, and - on Pan Am only - carriage of Federal civilian and military employees for a ''sweetheart'' $49 fare. Given the aforesaid 20 cents a mile estimated operating costs, both of these carriers should break even with load factors - percentage of seats filled - of only a minuscule 37.9 percent on the New York-Boston route and 42.6 percent on the New York-Washington route.
But weekday shuttle load factors average about 55 percent. Simple arithmetic therefore reveals that break-even air fares on the two routes are $69.45 to Boston and $78.18 to Washington. Even allowing for the lower - $79 - weekend fares, there is still no excuse for charging weekday passengers fares that produce unconscionably high gross profit margins of 31.1 percent to Boston and 22.5 percent to Washington.
The fact that, in my estimate, Mr. Trump overpaid by about $100 million (of a total $365 million acquisition price) when he bought the shuttle and its assets should not justify these high prices, particularly since the premium mainly bought him the ancillary benefits of participating in a rank, anticompetitive duopoly whose very existence is against the public interest.
How do both greedy carriers get away with the gouging? There are no more takeoff or landing slots available at either La Guardia in New York or Washington National Airport, so no new competition can enter that shuttle route. The insidious Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 removed all Government controls on domestic air fares on Jan. 1, 1985, thereby eliminating the sound Federal oversight that mandated ''just and reasonable'' fares. Gates at La Guardia, National and in Boston are impossible to secure for any new entrant into the market. And there is a pervasive mind-set in the airline industry that non-discretionary, mostly business, travelers are victims ready for skinning, under the argument that they have to travel and they don't pay for their own tickets anyway.
The only equitable remedy for airline fare-gouging, nationwide, is long-overdue Congressional restoration of Section 404(a)(1) Federal Aviation Act authority over domestic air fares, and the prompt imposition of equitable fare caps to limit the appetites of the major-airline oligopoly. The Department of Transportation continues to exercise such control over unrestricted economy-class international air fares - and what is good for the international passenger is equally good for that passenger's beleaguered domestic counterpart.
Although the Department of Transportation remains firmly opposed to capping domestic air fares, even in the most egregious cases, the agency will have to do what Congress directs. In the meantime, I strongly urge this agency to issue quarterly press releases describing, in readable form, the actual costs and yield breakdowns of the nation's major carriers. This information is public record now and should be available to the general public - not just to those airline industry executives whose employers can afford to pay $1,130 a year to subscribe to Aviation Daily, a trade publication where the data are published.
In the interim, prospective shuttle passengers can vote with their feet for Northeast Corridor transportation relief. Amtrak costs as little as one-third as it takes to get there by air shuttle.
An old Wall Street maxim applies, to both Trump and Pan Am: ''You can be a bull or a bear - but you shouldn't be a pig.'' Congress should eliminate the ''pig factor'' and impose fare caps quickly.

HEADLINE: NORTHEAST NOTEBOOK: Houlton, Me.;
Historic Square In a Comeback

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
MORE than $2.5 million from public and private sources has been spent in the last few years to fix up Market Square, the downtown area of this northern Maine town of 6,700 people. The area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a fine example of turn-of-the-century commercial architecture, said Charles Upton, the town's Director of Community Development.
But it is the configuration that makes Houlton's downtown especially distinctive. The buildings encircle the square, setting off the downtown from other parts of the town and preserving a small-town flavor. The major highways through town, Routes 1 and 2A, bypass the square. 
Market Square was built by the military in the 1800's. Perched on a hill some 45 feet above the Meduxnekeag River, it was where troops were mustered for the Civil War. Later, as the lumber and potato industries developed in the area, Houlton became a center for commerce, and handsome three- and four-story buildings were built around the square.
Around 1900, this bustling community was thought to have had more millionaires per capita than any town except Averill, Mass., Mr. Upton said. Millionaires Row, a section of fine, wood-frame homes near the square, was built around that time. But the downtown declined in the 70's, as did the potato industry, and many businessmen closed their shops in the square. By 1979, when the town began planning a downtown revitalization, 50 percent of the floor space was vacant. Work began in earnest in 1986.
The town received $725,000 from the state and raised $1.4 million more through bonds to replace all the storm drains, sidewalks and streetlights. It also planted trees along the streets.
As was the hope of town leaders, the public improvements spurred private investment. About $400,000 has been spent to renovate a third of the buildings, and many are now historically accurate. Town leaders hope all the buildings will be renovated before long. They also are encouraged by the number of new businesses moving into the storefronts and upper-floor offices. Little ground-level space is vacant now.
Mr. Upton said more than 30 percent of the new businesses have been started by young people able to pay the $3 to $5 a square foot rent downtown, but not the $6 or $7 plus maintenance and snow plowing in a strip-shopping center on Route 1.
The homes on Millionaires Row also are still standing and most are in fine shape. Residential property values here have increased, but still seem a bargain compared with southern Maine. Brokers here say houses on the market range in price from $25,000 to $125,000.

The New Organized Crime

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN J. STEIN; Benjamin J. Stein, is a lawyer, writer and economist living in Los Angeles. He was a speechwriter for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford.

 BODY:
John Gotti, you poor, obsolete loser. You've missed the boat. You forgot Willie Sutton's lesson - go where the money is. Just before Christmas, when I was in New York, I saw on the local news a story about the police in Queens ''busting'' a gambling ''bank.'' A veritable army of police cruisers were outside a pitiful-looking building next to a bakery. Inside, a few equally pitiful-looking men and women in polyester and T-shirts sat on ratty couches while a policeman showed the camera stacks of $20's the gambling bank allegedly had taken in recently.
Breathlessly, the announcer talked about how the take was in the tens of thousands of dollars, and how the raid marked a major coup in the war on organized crime in New York City. 
If it's true, it's a joke. ''Organized crime?'' Next to a bakery in Queens? With guys in T-shirts running it? With a take of tens of thousands? From betting on football games?
Forget it. That's a heartbreakingly small joke. The real organized crime, the riskless kind that pays off in the hundreds of millions and billions, is across the river, in lower Manhattan, on Broad Street, on Wall Street. It's across the continent, in a gleaming marble cube on Rodeo Drive.
The only truly meaningful kind of taking of other people's property, the kind that adds up to enough to support an army - of lawyers - is being done by the American financial establishment, at least the tawdriest part of it, and the American stock company establishment at its saddest. It's so big, so perfectly safe, that it has redefined ''organization'' and ''crime'' in the Western world.
Example: the sale of fraudulent bonds. This has been done in a small way in the whole history of the Republic. But in the last decade, it has been lifted to unheard-of levels.
What, after all, were the bonds of Campeau, issued for hundreds of millions of dollars within the last two years, with many of them now close to worthless? What were the hundreds of millions of Merv Griffin and Resorts International bonds that were issued within the last 12 months and are already in default? Or the bonds for Seaman Furniture or SCI Television or Gillett Holdings?
Of course, the most astute buyers in the world, who might have read every word of the prospectus, who may have studied law at Harvard or accounting at Wharton, might not have been fooled by those bonds. But those bonds weren't sold to eagle-eyed financial types. No, they were sold to savings and loans and to insurance companies, to banks - and basically to the stockholders of those companies. Those stockholders did not know, and often still do not know, that their money was used to buy those bonds. Worse yet, they were sold to the taxpayers who support Federal deposit insurance for the savings and loans that went broke because of their collapsed ''junk-bond'' holdings. In every meaningful sense, phony bonds were sold to people without a clue to what they were buying.
Unethical? You bet. But the sellers got 4 percent. The lawyers who drew up all the indentures got $400 an hour and a bonus for quick work. The executives of the banks and savings and loan institutions got promotions and favors. But no one goes to jail when the savings and loans go down the tubes. No one gets rubbed out in a clam bar in Little Italy over the fallout.
Then there are the executives of public companies who simply give themselves multimillion-dollar wages even as their companies are falling into insolvency. Look at the losses of failed savings and loans. Read about the salaries of the men who got institutions like Centrust Bank, Imperial Savings and Loan and Silverado Savings and Loan into trouble. Those men (and a few women) were paying themselves some of the highest salaries in America even as, it is alleged, their companies were being wildly mismanaged.
John Gotti, you poor devil, those savings and loan guys and others like them at some entertainment companies know the score. Just consider Steve Ross, chairman of Warner Communications Inc., who is paying himself about $200 million over the next five years.
Why bother to sell numbers or drugs or prostitution? Just write out a check with the stockholders' money, made payable to yourself. Have your lawyers certify that it's fine. That's American business today, John, and you missed out.
Or buy your company away from your stockholders at less than its real value. Use the stockholders' money to hire the lawyers and bankers to help you take away their money. Go ahead. It's cool. It happens every day. No one gets shot.
Or buy a piece of your company. Or award yourself a control block of preferred shares. Or use your company's working capital to buy bonds and get tips on takeovers in return, as many of Drexel Burnham Lambert's players are alleged to have done.
That's modern organization. That's modern crime. The Securities and Exchange Commission won't bother you. There will be a private plaintiffs' suit, but it will get settled - with the money of the stockholders - and you get away clean and rich.
And you don't have to give a thing in return for all that money in this new world. The old-style organized criminal had at least to deliver gin or prostitution. But the new way, the Wall Street way, means you don't deliver a thing. You run the company into the ground, you take from the stockholders unreasonably. You sell a worthless bond, and nobody lays a hand on you.
It is a lesson for you, John Gotti. If you have young relatives, don't teach them the fish wholesaling business, and forget linen supply. If you want to do someone a favor, try corporate finance at a big-name school. Try calling in some favors in Vegas to get them started in mergers and acquisitions at a big firm in Beverly Hills or New York. The world has changed. Be in finance. Be in management of a public company. They learned from you and now you can learn from them.

HEADLINE: Aspen: The Call of the Wild

BYLINE: By Jon Bowermaster: Jon Bowermaster is co-author, with Will Steger, of ''Saving the Earth: A Citizen's Guide to Environmental Action,'' to be published by Knopf in April.

 BODY:
THE SUN FIRST PEEKS OVER the Continental Divide just after 6 on New Year's Day, and particularly at this hour, it seems there could be no more beautiful place on earth than the Roaring Fork Valley - red-tinged clay, bright white snow and a pure blue in the sky that only high altitudes can produce. Below, the narrow streets of Aspen, Colo., are empty, yielding no signs of the previous night's parties. Instead of whoops of frivolity there is only the squawking of jays and nutcrackers. 
Still, the morning tranquillity can barely disguise the tremors of celebration that have rocked the town all week long. Sleeping soundly under goose-down Duvets in multimillion-dollar ranches and $2,000-a-night hotel suites is the biggest concentration of rich and famous people in perhaps the world. They gathered here, in this small town in the Rocky Mountains, to witness the end of the 80's. The glitz contingent has become part and parcel of every story and conversation about Aspen. And every season it grows larger. Whether recited alphabetically (Irving Azoff, Ed Bradley, Cher, Michael Douglas, Chris Evert, Jane Fonda, Melanie Griffith, etc.) or by genre -movie stars (Nicholson, Hawn, Schwarzenegger); moguls (Tisch, Walton, Murdoch); socialites (Bass, Guest, Hunt); media (Ziff, Walters, Steinem); musicians (Simon, Henley, Van Halen, Buffett); models (Paulina, Christie) - the list of regulars leaves the same impression. That this community of 6,000 year-round residents has become the wintertime place to be. ''I get to work out, ski, meet a lot of beautiful women, go to great restaurants and hang out with my friends,'' says the Hollywood producer Don Simpson. ''Every day is a party.''
The rich and famous make their most concentrated ascendance between Christmas and New Year's, when the population of the normally peaceful end-of-the-valley triples, and the roar of private jets breaks the stillness with regularity. And this year's scene, by all previous standards, was unmatched. Marvin Davis flew in an entourage of 40, including Gregory Peck and Sidney Poitier; Dustin Hoffman and Calvin Klein brought their families. Barbara Walters, Lee Iacocca, Don Johnson, Adnan Khashoggi - they came to drink in the natural beauty of the place, and to get drunk on the scene. Nouveau riche groupies, starlet wannabes and assorted hangers-on roamed the downtown mall in high heels, furs and diamonds. Nonskiers sported $2,000 ski suits. Press agents called the local papers to announce the comings and goings of their ''clients.'' (One L.A. p.r. man worked the phones the day before New Year's Eve desperately trying to find a party for a couple of his rich-but-nobody clients. ''They're in Aspen and it's not happening for them,'' he moaned.) Over all, such intermittent invasions take up just a few weeks each year, but their effect - on both the world's opinion of the place and the town's own state of mind - lasts year long. The result has been a predomination of acquisition over preservation. Hundred-year-old Victorian houses have been bought, torn down and replaced by modern mansions that cover every inch of quarter-acre lots. Houses built on spec are furnished right down to the towels and the books. One-bedroom condos go for $500,000, to commodity brokers from Los Angeles or bankers from New York; there were some 50,000 landings last year at Aspen's tiny airport, more than half of them by private planes. And Range Rovers - at $40,000 each - are so ubiquitous that a serviceman flies in once or twice a week from Denver to do warranty work. Accompanying all this are the accouterments of money and leisure - caterers, florists, expensive restaurants and boutiques, and security guards.
YET DESPITE THE KNOCKOUT aura of the place and the quiet beginning to this new decade, things are hardly peaceful. Scratch the surface of the glitz and you uncover a small town - albeit a rich, high-profile one - wrangling very publicly toward the 21st century, trying its damnedest to maintain the beauty, diversity and hipness that made it a world-class community in the first-place. Led by a four-term mayor some call a dictator, Aspen has banned smoking and neon and will soon vote on becoming the first town in the world, perhaps, to ban the sale of fur coats. A local newspaper columnist has suggested a ban on bans.
In the meantime, real-estate prices have doubled in the last three years. Affordable housing is virtually nonexistent. (Last year, single-family homes in the United States cost on average $111,755; in Aspen, $937,000.) Traffic jams snarl the two-lane highway that leads into town. Air pollution is increasing. Minimum wage is about $8 an hour, yet ''help wanted'' ads are plentiful.
As a result, the one-time hippie haven is becoming increasingly homogenized, more conservative; more a place for the haves and less a place for the have-nots, whose ranks include schoolteachers, lawyers and other members of the middle class. The classic ski bum has all but disappeared. ''I want my plumber to live in Aspen,'' says George S. Stranahan, tavern owner and founder of the Aspen Center for Physics. Indeed, locals are scared that the town will soon become the exclusive hangout for the fabulously rich and that their end of the valley may be nothing but an opulent ghost town during much of the year, with the million-dollar second homes shuttered, the streets quiet and lifeless.
While insisting that ''spirited public debate'' has always been a part of Aspen's charm, Mayor Bill Stirling says that lately it's turned vicious. A shrill faction of longtime locals - joined by a handful of newcomers who would like to close the gate behind them - rages constantly against new growth, furious that their home has become known as a ''salt lick for celebrities,'' ''a petting zoo for the rich and famous.'' Hopeful developers from out of town are harassed by threats of injunctions, lawsuits, gossip, even violence. The nearly nonstop contentiousness has the outgoing city manager advising applicants for his post to think twice.
But maybe the most eloquent expression of Aspen's current state surfaced soon after the 90's had begun. The pizza maker at the ultrachic Mezzaluna restaurant announced in broken English that he was soon leaving town for Beverly Hills. ''It's just gotten too expensive here,'' he said.
ASPEN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A special place. The Ute Indians called it ''The Valley of the Thunder River,'' and used it for a summer camp. The first miners-to-be crossed the 12,000-foot Independence Pass on snowshoes in the winter of 1879, dubbing their new home Ute City, then Aspen, after the wispy, white-barked trees that climb the steep rock canyon. By the 1890's - thanks largely to a Macy's department store partner, Jerome B. Wheeler - Aspen was home to literary clubs, polo matches and skiing, on barrel staves. The grand opening of his Hotel Jerome, on Thanksgiving eve 1889, was attended by society from around the globe and Aspen became known worldwide as the Silver Capital.
In the late 1800's, the silver market, thus Aspen, collapsed. The town sat abandoned, its buildings crumbling, until the late 1940's, when the Chicago industrialist Walter Paepcke set out to revitalize it. Paepcke's vision was of another kind of boom town, a mecca for 20th-century thinkers and outdoors lovers, sort of a winter and summer camp for the elite. He financed a ski resort, and started the Aspen Institute for the Humanities and the Music Associates of Aspen, local institutions that today boast international reputations.
The creeping problems affecting Aspen today have surfaced over the last two decades. Many locals blame the ''Freak Power'' political movement of the early 1970's - highlighted by a much-publicized run for sheriff by the renegade journalist Hunter S. Thompson - which encouraged successive administrations of staunch no-growthers. They adopted stringent zoning laws, effectively throttling development. But, ironically, by clamping down on new building, the new rules essentially closed the valley and drove real-estate prices sky high, thus setting the stage for creating the nouveau riche boom that now threatens to swallow the town.
During the nationwide recession of the early 1980's, the City Council loosened its chokehold, and new building erupted. Councilman Stephen S. Crockett blames much of the current overdevelopment on that loosening of strictures. ''It didn't work, and they essentially gave away the ranch,'' Crockett says. ''We could stop granting all construction here tomorrow, and there would be enough permits left to allow building for another two and a half years.''
Perhaps the growth wouldn't rankle so much if it wasn't so ostentatious. Take Frederick (Ted) and Suzanne Field - he's the Marshall Field's department-store heir - and their $16.3 million house on Aspen Mountain, for example. Reached by a freestanding 50-foot elevator, it boasts 8 bedrooms, 9 baths and 27 televisions (including one in the sauna). Cross-valley on Red Mountain, Leslie Wexner, owner of the Limited, has built a $26 million, 25,000-square-foot manse. Not one to be topped, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, is constructing a 55,000-square-foot palace in nearby Starwood. Producer-actor Michael Douglas and partners are soon to start developing 6,400 acres six miles out of town.
Marvin Davis, (Continued on Page 28) the oilman who runs the movie studio 20th Century-Fox and whose family owns almost half the Aspen Skiing Company, takes the town's approach to growth in stride. (Though he's owned the company since 1981, this Christmas was his first visit to Aspen.) ''Look,'' he says by speaker phone from Los Angeles, ''everybody's got a bit of heaven they'd like to protect from the outside world, but they just can't protect Aspen anymore. I don't think the town can hold back the growth; it's going to expand in spite of itself.
''I can't believe what people are paying for real estate. And there's no reason or rhyme, other than there's this desire to be in Aspen.''
Among year-rounders, however, there is no such thing as a pro-development stance in Aspen. Everyone is antigrowth - in varying stages from slow- to no- .
Dick Butera represents one faction of no-growther - the kind that has already gotten a piece of the rock and wouldn't mind seeing the gate to the valley closed to new development. Onetime president of the Hilton Head Company in South Carolina, he moved to Aspen in 1981 and now owns a fitness club and a real-estate company. His wife, Julie Anthony, who manages their Aspen Club, once explained to Psychology Today why they settled in the Rockies: ''In Aspen clothing stores, the sizes are smaller because the men have narrower waists and the women have better figures. My husband and I were here two weeks before we saw a fat person or a pimple.''
Butera admits there are people in town - ''oldtimers,'' he calls them - who are being passed up by the current boom. But he wonders if the town isn't really better for the changes. ''We've got three fabulous health clubs, a first-class hotel, the gondola, high-speed lifts, bike paths all over. The town is cleaner, all the electric wires are buried, the bus service is extensive and free, public swimming pools are fabulous. The school system is better, Alcoholics Anyonymous is packed full, so are the churches. I don't know what else a society is supposed to do.''
He also insists it is just a small minority who think Aspen's vaunted ''sense of community'' is threatened by the influx of the superrich. ''Out of the 10 public officials in office in Aspen now, 8 of them were hippies,'' he says. ''As a result, we've had a lot of looney stuff going on, which was part of our character. Our past two mayors posed nude in calendars. But the town is changing. Not for good, not for bad, it is simply changing.''
Councilman Crockett represents the more virulent strain of Aspen's no-growthers. He says: ''The ski culture, the quality-of-life culture, is being eroded by people capitalizing on the real-estate boom - people who think with their wallets and are motivated by a different set of values than those who gave this town its original character and substance.''
A 20-year-resident, Crocket was elected last May, running on the ''Endangered Species'' ticket, and his vision of Aspen's future is bleak. ''The melting-pot aspect of this community is one thing that made it so unique,'' Crockett says. ''The new money has no desire to integrate into the community. They want to be waited on and catered to, they don't even want to shovel their own walks. It's the opposite of when in Rome do what the Romans do - it's more like, buy Rome, and make the Romans wait on you.''
THE BATTLE THAT best exemplifies the struggle for the soul of Aspen is the fight over a five-star hotel to be built at the foot of Aspen Mountain. The subject has dominated public meetings and barrooms for nearly a decade, and a hotel is still nowhere near to being built, despite the fact that there is a gaping, blocklong hole in the ground where it is supposed to be. Every weapon - referendum, lawsuits, populist coalitions, even a recent bomb threat - has been used to combat the project and no end is in sight. The current developer, Washington-based Mohamed Hadid (in conjunction with Ritz-Carlton), is back in court to get construction approved.
Two previous developers went bankrupt. The property was bypassed by some of the country's biggest developers, reportedly scared off by the town's reputation for ''spirited public debate.'' Hadid swept the property out from underneath the feet of Donald Trump in 1987, paying $42.9 million for a package that includes 80 valuable acres scattered around town. (Trump had bid $17.5 million for the hotel site alone.) But typically, Trump has not conceded. He's still in litigation with Hadid, arguing he has first claim on the land.
Hadid's real-estate portfolio comprises mostly D.C.-area office buildings and he is a partner in three other Ritz hotels. So far the Aspen purchase has been nothing but a drain on his pocketbook at a time when it has been reported that his office-building empire is crumbling. He bought the land after just a couple visits to town.
''He fell in love with the beauty of the place without understanding the process,'' says Mayor Stirling. ''He's the kind of guy who just wants to be noticed.''
Hadid made himself highly visible in town, buying a big house, throwing lavish parties and touring the streets in his Bentley convertible. But his efforts to get a 292-room Ritz-Carlton built have been stymied at every step by the City Council, which is now putting the issue back to the people. One of the issues on a Feb. 13 special ballot will be whether Hadid should be allowed to build the hotel as planned, or one 25 percent smaller. Hadid insists that he won't build a smaller hotel and has asked the courts to grant him construction approval. He says he's bent over backward to appease the town and its planners, going through hundreds of meetings, a handful of redesigns and promising plenty of ''bribes,'' including building a public ice rink. ''I'm tired of spending and I'm tired of giving,'' said a worn-sounding Hadid on New Year's Eve, two days after his suit against the city was announced. ''I've already spent $13 million. The problem is that they don't rule by long- term plans, they rule by emotion.''
Dick Butera offers one reason why there has been so much opposition to Hadid. ''The untold story is the 21,000-square-foot convention center that is in that hotel,'' Butera says. ''I don't want to sound elitist here, but that spells Shriners with hats and beer cans up and down the streets.'' Butera, for one, would actually prefer that if anybody were to build a hotel in Aspen it be Trump.
''I'd build something much more in keeping with the town,'' says Trump, who has visited Aspen several times, though he doesn't yet own any property there. ''And they'd love to have me. I've been sort of an Aspenite, as much as you can be an Aspenite. I go there with my family every, uh, every chance. I'm out there a lot.''
In the next breath, Trump admits he would ''make more in one day in Atlantic City than I can make in 10 years in Aspen.'' Then why Aspen? ''Because it's a place I go to. Because I'm there, that's the only reason.'' That's exactly the kind of attitude that frightens longtime Aspenites. Hadid laughs at Trump's insistence that he will be Aspen's newest hotelier and adds that no matter what happens with the Ritz-Carlton project he's in Aspen for the long run. The pair of superegos bumped into each other during the recent holiday week and had a brief, smiling conversation. ''He asked me when I was going to finish that hole in the ground,'' relates Hadid. ''I said, 'Donald, at least I have a hole.' ''
THE 800-POUND GORILLA in the midst of all this is the Aspen Skiing Company, founded in 1946. Composed today of three of the valley's four skiing hills (Aspen Mountain, Snowmass and Buttermilk) and two hotels (the Little Nell and 50 percent of the Snowmass Club), it is the community's biggest employer (2,000 during peak season) and cash generator (1.2 million skier visits in 1988-89, times an average $30 per lift ticket). No matter how contentious things get, no one ever forgets that 60 percent of the town's revenues are generated during the five-month ski season and that skiing is still the main reason people come to town. Many locals think the ski company is most to blame for fostering the image of a glitzy, elitist Aspen.
''It's easy to beat up on the ski company,'' says Bob Maynard, its fourth president in the last decade. ''In people's minds it's 'The Company,' the bad guy. It's like being mad at the Government.''
The latest chapter in the Aspen Skiing Company history began when Marvin Davis bought 20th Century-Fox in 1981; the movie studio had purchased it for $48.6 million in 1978, an invasion that in itself made some locals uncomfortable. It made others very rich. Fox agreed to pay $45 per share to stockholders at a time when the stock was selling for $24.
When Davis (and his then-partner Marc Rich, the oil-trader-cum-tax-fugitive) bought the movie company for $722 million, the package included two high-profile resorts, Pebble Beach and Aspen. The paper chase that followed is a classic example of how Davis has become a billionaire - by bringing in partners to help pay off leveraged debt, and using profits from the sale of various assets to buy down his own risk. Soon after he bought Fox, he spun off the stock or assets of Pebble Beach, Aspen, Coca-Cola Bottling Midwest, Hoyt Theaters (an Australian chain) and the real estate under the movie-company lot into a joint venture with Urban Diversified Properties Inc., a subsidiary of Aetna Life & Casualty. The bottler and the movie theater chain were then sold off.
In December 1983, Davis took on more partners - three real-estate cronies from Chicago and Denver - and the limited partnership, dubbed Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray , bought out Aetna's half-interest in Aspen, Pebble Beach and the Century City land operations. Then they bought out Fox's half-interest. Chicagoan Tom Klutznick was named to oversee the resorts. In 1985, in a final move to raise money and distribute risk, the partners sold half of the Aspen Skiing Company to the Crown family of Chicago. When he first became involved, says Klutznick, ''it was the biggest disaster I'd ever seen at a resort. This was a community that in a sense had made itself kind of a private club and was using the facilities to serve its own interests. They wanted a little utopia and did not really want tourists there, or even outsiders. So we got rid of a lot of employees and managers, and in 1987 brought in Bob Maynard. By then the table had been set - the company, the mountains and the company's position in the community had all been dramatically improved.'' (Continued on Page 42) It was just before May- nard's arrival that the company made its most disastrous public-relations gaffe, incurring the most serious community wrath, when it announced the nation's first $35 lift ticket and simultaneously doubled prices for resident passes. Local agitation was so high that Mayor Stirling flew to Washington to complain to Colorado's Congressional delegation.
Since then, the company has made several moves to ingratiate locals. Resident passes have returned to their original price. Plus, locals over 70 now ski free at Buttermilk, and college students home for the holidays get reduced lift-ticket prices. But the most visible change the company made was in the other direction, a high-gloss ad campaign, begun in 1988.
The $1.25 million print and radio campaign was a distinct move away from typical ski resort advertising, which, in print at least, tends to be dominated by red ski parkas, gleaming smiles and knee-deep powder. Created by Hal Riney, originator of well-known ads for Perrier and Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers, the campaign focuses on Aspen's natural beauty and brags up the valley's three mountains, 100 bars and restaurants, and 200 shops and boutiques. The ads are beautiful. They also border on the pretentious, leading critics to accuse the company of pandering to the rich.
Klutznick admits having second thoughts about the campaign. ''I was willing and supportive of taking the high road,'' he says, meaning a presentation of Aspen as ''a gentle, spiritual, warm environment.''
''But at the same time,'' he continues, ''part of our success in the winter stems from the people we've attracted. I can't apologize for the fact that we attract jet-setters and Hollywood stars. Should I tell Rupert Murdoch not to come next year? You want me to stop the direct flights from Los Angeles? Those people are part of the image of Aspen.''
Bob Maynard adds that while glitz is an inherent part of Aspen, it is a smaller part than most make it. ''If a writer comes into town for a day, that's what he writes about,'' Maynard says. ''It's easy. Skiing with Jack Nicholson - everyone's going to read that. In the long run, that probably helps us; I don't mind it. But some of us feel very strongly about pushing other aspects of Aspen, so that there's a balance. It's not that we're antiglitz, let's just not leave out the other parts. Some people actually come here because the fishing is good.''
ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOT Aspen's civic leaders - if not yet its visitors - quaking in their ski boots is not the current glory days, but the years that stretch ahead. Several complicated roadblocks stand between the town and future serenity.
Lack of affordable housing may be the town's biggest headache of the 90's. It has made it extremely difficult for the booming boutiques, restaurants, hotels and even the ski company to attract help. The new $35 million Little Nell hotel - and other employers - are busing help from as far as 70 miles downvalley, from Silt and Parachute, Rifle and Basalt. (In a Robin Hood-meets-the-80's tale, some employees living in housing set aside for them have illegally rented bedrooms to tourists, a kind of take-from-the-rich, rent-to- the-rich parable.) Several plans are on the boards to build employee housing; the county has a goal of building 100 affordable units in 1990 and at least that many in 1991. Some want to see that doubled. At the same time, taxpayers are revolting at the idea of their dollars being spent for the benefit of the profitable businesses in town. And it's not just the minimum-wage employee who is suffering. The last director of the town's art museum, for example, left in part because she couldn't find a two-bedroom apartment for less than $2,000 a month. Transportation in and out of the valley - especially since so much of the town's employment base must now commute - is the other big concern. Highway 82 - known locally as ''Killer 82,'' for the myriad car wrecks that claim lives each winter - is a two-lane road that winds southeast for 40 miles from Glenwood Springs, alongside roaring rivers and between close canyon walls. Because of congestion, during a winter storm it can take two and a half hours to travel. Along its narrowest stretches, expansion to four lanes will cost an estimated $2 million per mile. Plus, the increased commuting is causing more air pollution and the county is wrestling with a clean air bill that could cost $500,000.
Forecasts for slowing growth are bleak: the Colorado Department of Highways Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Highway 82 predicts 34 percent commercial growth in Aspen by 2010, 80 percent commercial and population growth in Snowmass Village, and 56 percent more cars entering the valley. But perhaps the most immediate threat is that the nonprofit organizations that are the base of the town's cultural heritage are getting fed up. The International Design Conference in Aspen, Music Associates of Aspen (sponsors of the Aspen Music Festival) and the Aspen Institute have all considered moving to other communities, largely because the city has grown too expensive to house visitors, faculty and students. Last winter, the Aspen/Snowmass Repertory Theater had to cancel its season because no affordable lodging could be found for employees. (Included in the Feb. 13 referendum that will decide whether Hadid's hotel should be approved as designed, whether to ban fur sales and which Highway 82 segment should be expanded, is the fate of a bond issue that would fund student and faculty housing for several nonprofit groups.) David T. McLaughlin is president of the Aspen Institute, which sponsors international conferences on political philosophy and policy issues. Though its year-round base is in Queenstown, Md., it operates in Aspen from mid-June to Labor Day and holds a couple of seminars in January and March. This summer the institute celebrates its 40th anniversary with a major symposium to be attended by national and world leaders. ''It's a rather significant event and here we're sitting not knowing if we'll have facilities to house it,'' says McLaughlin. The institute's current residential facilities are worn, and badly in need of renovation. But that won't happen anytime soon because of the struggle between the City Council and Hadid. Hadid owns the land, but he's not going to put any money into renovation as long as his dispute with the town over the Ritz drags on.
McLaughlin insists the problem is one of priorities, that the Council has been so absorbed fighting developers that it has ignored the town's roots. ''It's not like any political process I've ever witnessed,'' he says. ''The Aspen Institute convenes leaders from all over the world. We discuss monumental problems like arms control. Yet we can't seem to use our convening power to get anything done in Aspen.'' He maintains that the institute, as well as the other not-for-profits, are committed to remaining where they are ''as long as we can have facilities there that meet our minimum requirements.'' But he adds: ''Are the facilities adequate today? No they are not.'' And without improvements, he says, ''we have a very limited future in Aspen.''
THERE IS SOME SENTIMENT that the town's very feistiness -at one time an attraction - is starting to wear thin. The endless battles have taken their toll. Longtime residents are moving on, newcomers growing increasingly agitated. And if the town didn't have enough squabbling on its plate, in early December a band of locals - under the banners of the Citizens Recall Coalition and the People's Rights Organization - began collecting signatures on petitions to recall Mayor Stirling and three of four councilmen. Tom Klutznick thinks if matters are left completely to the current crop of elected officials, things may take a grave turn. ''I think they would like to see a very formidable gate put up across Highway 82 entering the community,'' he says, ''with representatives of the extreme left as the gatekeepers, determining who can come in and cannot and under what circumstances. They would probably issue visas of very short-term duration.'' Councilman Crockett would no doubt supervise the construction of such a barricade. As added fuel for his political stance, the small downtown house he has rented for 17 years was recently sold to a couple from Los Angeles, for $500,000. He's not sure where he's going to move. ''You know, I get accused as a politician of trying to make war, not peace,'' Crockett says. ''That's because I don't think there is room for peace here. Go back in history. Ask the Apaches or the Utes how successful they were in protecting their culture by compromising, by making peace. Their advice today, I'm sure, would be, 'It's war. Kill.' ''

HEADLINE: A Tearful Mayor Barry Pledges To Seek Help for 'Weaknesses'

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
His personal and political life shattered by a criminal charge that he smoked crack, a repentant Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said today, in public and in tears, that he had ''weaknesses'' and would seek help for them.
''I'm going to find a way to begin to heal my body, mind and soul,'' the Mayor announced in a brief statement that, while legally and politically circumspect, seemed as much a personal confession and a catharsis as anything.
Mr. Barry did not actually say he had a drug or alcohol problem or disclose what kind of help he would seek or where he would seek it. In past grand jury testimony he has denied ever using drugs, and an open acknowledgment of a narcotics problem could leave him open to charges of perjury and weaken any claim he might make that he had been entrapped by the Federal agents and local police officers who arrested him.
 
Wife Says He Needs Help
But Mr. Barry's wife, Effi, standing beside him at St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, near their home, said somberly that her husband had a problem and that he needed help. 
The Mayor's press secretary, Lurma Rackley, said, ''The most serious problem involves alcoholism.'' She said she did not know if he had a drug problem.
Nor did Mr. Barry talk about his political plans, thrown into turmoil by his arrest Thursday night at a local hotel after undercover agents said they filmed him smoking crack.
The pressure on him to quit has intensified in the last day. Federal prosecutors say they have additional leverage now that Mr. Barry's old friend Charles Lewis has been sentenced to 15 months in prison on charges of distributing and possessing cocaine at a hotel here a year ago. In a plea bargain with prosecutors, Mr. Lewis said he had used drugs with the Mayor several times; Mr. Barry paid several visits to Mr. Lewis at the hotel but has insisted under oath that he neither bought nor used drugs there.
Aides and friends, many of them ministers who spent the weekend counseling the Mayor, said he was suffering from drug and alcohol abuse and would seek help. They said he had been talking to Dick Gregory, the former comedian who now is a health counselor, and was considering entering either the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., or a clinic in the Washington area.
The aides and friends also said that while Mr. Barry was under pressure to resign as part of a plea bargain with prosecutors, he might well refuse. He is a proud man, they said, intent on seeing out his full term. If he resigned he would be replaced by the chairman of the City Council, David A. Clarke, a political enemy.
 
Special Election Is Possible
If he does resign, a special election will be held on the first Tuesday 114 days after the formal resignation. No special election would be necessary if the Nov. 6 general election fell within the 114-day period.
Jay B. Stephens, the United States Attorney, has indicated that Mr. Lewis's cooperation with the authorities could lead to further charges against Mayor Barry, who is still the subject of a grand jury investigation. In an emotional statement at his sentencing Friday, Mr. Lewis said he had once felt ''that because I used drugs with other professionals, with others in government, with the Mayor of this city, that I should lie to protect them and myself.''
Mr. Stephens has suggested that as he considers how to proceed with the investigation, he would look favorably on a decision by Mr. Barry to resign.
While Mr. Barry remained ambivalent - tormented, some of his friends said - about the possibility of resigning, there was little doubt that he would forgo a bid for re-election for a fourth term as Mayor of Washington.
''I don't think he intends to step down,'' said Bishop H. Hartford Brookins, of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, a close adviser who said Mr. Barry's statement was prompted by dependence ''upon some kind of drugs and alcohol.''
''I think he will not run for mayor again,'' the bishop added. ''He wants to leave office with a measure of appreciation,''
 
Resign, Say 57% in Poll
In a Washington Post poll published today, 57 percent of the 661 Washingtonians polled by telephone the night after his arrest said Mr. Barry should resign and 76 percent said he should not seek re-election. The Post said the margin of sampling error was plus or minus about four percentage points.
At least four present or former members of the City Council, including Mr. Clarke, plan to run for the Mayor's job, whatever his plans. All are Democrats, and all are considered to have a chance of winning.
The winner of the primary is likely to face Maurice Turner, the former Police Chief, in the general election in November. He is one of the few Republicans given a chance in this overwhelmingly Democratic city.
There is one other important political factor. The Rev. Jesse Jackson moved to Washington from Chicago last year, leading to talk that he might be interested in running for mayor. He has said repeatedly that he would never run against Mr. Barry, an old ally in the civil rights movement, but there is heightened speculation now that his position may change.
He was unavailable for comment today, canceling a public appearance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where he had been scheduled to speak before the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education. An aide said he had laryngitis.
In the Post poll, 42 percent of the registered voters said they would vote for Mr. Jackson if he ran, far more than for any other potential candidate.
 
Administrator in Charge
Pending his trial on the drug charge, the Mayor has turned over most of his duties to the city manager, Carol B. Thompson. An experienced administrator, she has the authority to take over almost all government functions except signing legislation and executing some contracts.
Ms. Thompson, 38 years old, who graduated from Smith College and holds a master of arts in public administration from New York University, was formerly Deputy Mayor for economic development and before that served as Mr. Barry's chief of staff.
 
Past Denials Put Aside
Until this morning, Mr. Barry had always denied adamantly, often angrily, that he had any substance problem. But at 9:30 A.M., in a church Sunday school room across the street from his home, fixed in the glare of television lights and in the crowding presence of 100 or so reporters and old friends, he put aside those denials in a flood of tears and crushed hubris.
''How I wish I could trade this hour!'' he lamented.
The hour, perhaps the most humbling of all in a once shining, always proud public career that began 30 years ago on the civil rights battlegrounds of the Deep South, was brought on by the Mayor's arrest in a hotel in the heart of the capital, a city beset by one of the worst cocaine epidemics in the country. Undercover agents said they videotaped him there smoking cocaine given him by a model whom police described as a former girlfriend of the Mayor's. The agents said the model was cooperating with them.
 
Confession and Apology
Originally, the hour was to be used by Mr. Barry to announce that he would seek re-election to a fourth term. Instead, he found himself making a confession to the public and then making what seemed to be an apology to his wife. All in all, he said, nothing he had ever experienced, not even the poverty and racism of the Old South, had been as difficult.
''This time,'' he said, his cheeks glistening with tears, ''I've come face to face with my deepest human failures. I've had to look my human weaknesses straight in the eye - had to realize that God made Marion Barry the same as He made other people, a flesh and blood creation who rises and falls just like any other human being.''
''It's not Marion Barry, the Mayor, that counts,'' he went on. ''It's Marion Barry, the person.''
His confession out, the Mayor managed a smile and broke into the sing-song cadence often heard in black churches in the South. His friends scattered throughout the room responded with soft interjections.
''I realize I'm going to have to walk this journey by myself,'' Mr. Barry began. ''Amen!'' a friend intoned. ''It's going to take Marion Barry walking this journey.'' ''Tell it, brother.'' ''But I say to others who have pain and hurt as I am, 'Join me, brothers and sisters; we can make it.' '' ''Well!'' ''We can make it.'' ''Well!'' ''We will make it.'' ''Amen!'' 'Burden That Has Been Lifted'
The Mayor then turned to his wife, standing beside him, who had endured not only the slings and arrows of his political fortune but also the rumors of his narcotics addiction and womanizing.
''Effi has been with me almost 12 years now as my wife,'' he said, haltingly now.
''And she's just great,'' he added, leaning over to give her a kiss.
Mrs. Barry, who once described her husband as a ''street dude,'' took the podium. Until that point, she had been almost totally unanimated except for a brief moment when she stroked her husband's hand. But now she came alive, promising that she and their 9-year-old son, Christopher, would stay at his side.
''Marion,'' she said, ''for you to admit to the world that you have a problem, that you need to deal with your problem to make yourself whole again, is truly a burden that has been lifted from our souls. And I know that for our family this is just the beginning.''

HEADLINE: On-the-Air Diary of a Passage Toward Death

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Once a week here on the evening news, television viewers are making the acquaintance of a man with AIDS, hearing firsthand about his fears and frailties and watching his jaunty passage toward death.
Even in San Francisco, a city more sophisticated about AIDS than any other in the nation, ''Paul Wynne's Journal,'' as the segment is known, is stunning television, shocking for some viewers, illuminating for others and invigorating for its dying star, a broadcast journalist in years past.
''This is potent stuff,'' said Harry Fuller, the news director at KGO-TV, the local American Broadcasting Company affiliate, who was braced for a flurry of criticism from viewers that has not materialized. ''The first night, we watched in my office, and hardened news reporters were in tears.''
The first segment began with a tape of Mr. Wynne in his days as an husky, handsome entertainment reporter, before his 1987 diagnosis. Then the image switched suddenly to Mr. Wynne in the newsroom today, seated at a computer terminal. Slowly, he swiveled his chair and turned toward the audience, unrecognizably gaunt, his bright blue eyes deep in their sockets and his cheeks hollow. 
''This is the face of AIDS,'' Mr. Wynne said.
 
In Praise of Courage
Then he flipped through some recent snapshots of himself and wrinkled his nose in displeasure. ''The holiday photos I didn't send the folks,'' Mr. Wynne said.
The debut of the on-the-air diary, on Jan. 11, was greeted with rave reviews from Bay Area television critics and scores of telephone calls and letters, the vast majority praising the station for its courage and Mr. Wynne for sharing his ordeal with hundreds of thousands of strangers.
Like the journal itself, the reaction has been intensely personal. A reviewer wrote in The Oakland Tribune that he knew no one who had AIDS and had been ''personally insulated from this tragedy'' until now. A viewer from San Jose sent her telephone number, saying she was a ''stay-at-home with arthritis'' and suggesting Mr. Wynne ''call any time if you'd like someone to talk to.'' Another viewer mailed him a crocheted afghan.
''I wonder if any other market in the country would accept what I'm doing so graciously and warmly as the Bay Area,'' Mr. Wynne said.
 
The Viewers Can Choose
Mr. Fuller said he had no misgivings about putting Mr. Wynne on the air, although he designed the broadcast so viewers had a choice whether they wanted to watch it. The segment is introduced before a commercial, so people know exactly what is coming and have time to shut off their sets or send their children from the room.
''I don't believe in ambush news,'' Mr. Fuller said. The second segment of Mr. Wynne's journal, seen here on the Thursday edition of the 6 o'clock news, dealt with the bigotry that homosexuals encounter in the age of AIDS. Mr. Wynne tells the story of two friends, gay but not ill, who are consigned to the foot of the table at a fancy dinner party by a hostess who serves them off paper plates while the other guests eat off Limoges china.
''Did she think their silverware would contaminate her dishwasher?'' Mr. Wynne asked, surrounded by elegant props that he borrowed from Gump's department store.
The segment is more glib than painful, which Mr. Wynne said is true to his personality. ''One of the reasons this works is I know how to crack a smile, make a joke,'' he said. ''I'm someone people will let in their homes, on a subject they might not want in their homes. Let me make friends with them first, and then I'll move on to tougher issues.''
 
Hardships Are Chronicled
In the weeks and months to come, Mr. Wynne plans to show viewers the contents of his medicine cabinet, full of pills and potions since his diagnosis. He plans to describe what daily life is like for a 47-year-old man who is sometimes so weak that ''just stepping onto a curb is a major proposition.''
He plans to tell viewers about losing 55 pounds and the subsequent months when he hid in his apartment because ''I didn't want to be seen as another emaciated, pale AIDS person shuffling down the street.'' He plans to itemize the financial impact of his disease, which dissuades him from drawing a regular salary from KGO because it would jeopardize his government benefits.
He plans a list of the most undiplomatic things people have said to him, including his father's observation that he ''looked like a cadaver.'' He plans a critical evaluation of obituaries in the era of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He plans to talk about friends who have died and those who have been ''widowed.'
He plans to remain on the air until he runs out of things to say or runs out of energy to say them. ''I may end up doing the last few from a hospital bed,'' Mr. Wynne said.
 
Help With a Legacy
Mr. Fuller said there are no specific plans for how the series will end. ''It's up to him and how he feels,'' the news director said. ''Paul wants to leave a legacy, and we want to help him.''
There is a paradox in Mr. Wynne's current success, which comes after five years of unemployment. He had been an entertainment reporter on three local television stations from 1972 until 1984, until a former news director at KGO chose not to renew his contract. Since then, he received no offers for on-the-air work, in large part, several local television executives said, because his frothy style was not much in demand.
The idea for the AIDS journal was tossing about in Mr. Wynne's mind recently when he was visited by a friend and former colleague, Lorne Morrison, a cameraman at KGO. Mr. Morrison approached Mr. Fuller, who jumped at the chance to break ground. Mr. Wynne said he has ''been walking on air ever since.''
All those involved in project were wary that viewer response might be hostile, even ugly. Mr. Wynne immediately got an unlisted phone number to avoid homophobic hate calls. ''I don't want some nut calling at 3 o'clock in the morning,'' he said.
 
Stereotypes Are Resisted
Mr. Wynne was also frightened to open a package that arrived at the station the other day, thinking it might be a bomb. Instead, swaddled in white tissue paper, he found the afghan.
The letters, too, have defied expectation, with only one unpleasant one in the first batch of 30. ''If he had lived his life according to God's word he would not be experiencing the results of sin,'' the offended viewer wrote. ''Whatsoever a man soweth he shall also reap.''
Mr. Wynne took account of religious fundamentalists in the opening segment, saying they would likely be infuriated by his presence on mainstream television. ''Good!'' he declared. ''That alone will keep me alive and kicking for another year.''
But among the letters to the station are several from people who identified themselves as fundamentalists and quarreled with Mr. Wynne's stereotype. ''The ones who hate you are not true Christians and only succeed in making the rest of us look ugly and bigoted,'' one such letter said.
Mr. Wynne's eyes brim when he considers the wondrous, unexpected things that are happening to him, the impact he is having on thousands of strangers and they on him.
''I feel smothered with love,'' he said. ''And I am so glad to have a reason to get up in the morning.''

HEADLINE: Haiti Deports Some Opposition Leaders

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The military Government of Haiti has begun expelling political leaders and at least one presidential candidate was reported in hiding today, a day after the imposition of a state of siege.
The Haitian leader, Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, who seized power 16 months ago, said he ordered the state of siege late Saturday, curtailing a range of civil liberties, ''to protect democratic accomplishments against terrorism.''
But opposition leaders said General Avril was moving to take back a promise to hold free elections this year, beginning with municipal elections in April. In Washington, the State Department said General Avril's actions ''put at risk the democratic transition in Haiti.'' 
A State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said, ''Such actions undermine the confidence voters must have to participate in a credible electoral process as well as the confidence of the international community in Haiti's commitment to that process.''
 
'We're in Shock'
Opposition members in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, said dozens of Haitian Government critics were rounded up and beaten Saturday night and this morning. The capital is apprehensive, they said in telephone interviews, and many people are staying home.
''We're in shock,'' said Jean-Claude Roy, the leader of a small opposition group called the Union of Haitian Constitutionalists. ''We don't know what to expect next.''
One of the exiled leaders, Dr. Louis Roy, who was a principal author of the country's latest Constitution in 1987 and who has campaigned for free elections, arrived in Miami at midday and was taken to the home of friends without speaking to reporters. Jean-Claude Roy, who is a nephew of Dr. Roy, said his 74-year-old uncle was taken away from his home in Port-au-Prince on Saturday night by three men wearing civilian clothes and armed with submachine guns. He said no explanation for the expulsion was given.
The first of the Haitian leaders forced into exile, Hubert de Ronceray, who was a presidential candidate in elections in November 1987 that ended in a massacre, and was expected to be a candidate this year, arrived in Miami on Saturday night. At a news conference here today, Mr. De Ronceray declared: ''There is no possibility of democracy with Mr. Avril. He's a dictator.''
 
Leader in Hiding
Another opposition leader, Silvio Claude, a Baptist minister who was a presidential candidate in 1987 and was expected to run again, fled from his house to a secret location when authorities knocked on his door Saturday night, associates said.
All three political leaders had fought the Duvalier family dictatorship that collapsed on Feb. 7, 1986, when President Jean-Claude Duvalier was forced to leave the country and went into exile in France. Mr. de Ronceray and Mr. Claude had been been arrested and harassed by Mr. Duvalier. Dr. Roy had been forced into exile in Canada by Jean-Claude's father, Francois Duvalier, early in the 30-year Duvalier rule.
General Avril served as a close aide to both Duvaliers and was an adviser to Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy, who took power when Jean-Claude Duvalier fled. The general's rise to power was greeted with skepticism by many Haitians, but their fears that another dictatorship was taking shape were placated by repeated pledges that General Avril would lead the country to democracy.
The Associated Press reported tonight that six other political leaders have been expelled, including Max Bourjolly, the second in leadership of the Haitian Communist Party.
The Avril Government indicated in a statement on the Government radio station that the state of siege, which is to be in effect for 30 days, was prompted by the slaying of Col. Andre Neptune, his wife and a servant by unidentified assailants on Friday night. The bodies were found in Fontamara, a Port-au-Prince neighborhood, about 100 yards from Mr. de Ronceray's home. The colonel was a member of the 1,100-member Presidential Guard, which is General Avril's main power base and which defeated a coup attempt last April in a two-day battle with other army units.
 
Violence Is Common
Political killings and terrorist violence have become common in Haiti since the collapse of the Duvalier dictatorship. The violence is believed to be the work of Duvalier loyalists, including former and present members of the army, who oppose free elections. The country's political leaders say they believe General Avril is merely using the killing of the colonel as a pretext to move against them.
''He wants to spoil the elections,'' Jean-Claude Roy said. Jean-Claude Bajeux, a left-of-center political leader who has been prominently involved in human rights issues, told The Associated Press in an interview in San Juan that Haiti was witnessing steps calculated ''to keep Avril in power as dictator.''
''There will be elections, but they will be a farce, a nomination by the army,'' he said.
General Avril raised new doubts about his intentions on elections in an interview this month in the Government-run newspaper, L'Union, when he said that Haiti was ''undergoing one of the most severe economic crises in its history,'' and added that it was ''hardly desirable that elections take place.''
 
General Visits Taiwan
A week ago, General Avril returned to Haiti from Taiwan, his first trip outside the country as chief of state. At the airport, he fiercely criticized Dr. Roy and two other civic leaders who had cautioned the Taiwan Government in a telex message that the Haitian people were not aware of the reason for General Avril's visit and that any agreements with him would not be binding.
On the eve of the general's return to Haiti, huge piles of human excrement were found outside the offices of several political and labor organizations.

HEADLINE: Old and New Help Clear Hurricane-Felled Trees

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WITHERBEE, S.C., Jan. 20

 BODY:
Amid the shattered grandeur of the Francis Marion National Forest, Buddy, Prince, Duke and Joe took a break the other day from the logging operations that are clearing trees felled by Hurricane Hugo. It was lunchtime, and on the menu was a mixture of oats, corn and molasses.
The four are Percheron draft horses, pressed into service to help haul wind-snapped pines from thousands of acres of the national forest.
As the horses nibbled contentedly, the air was filled with the sounds of helicopters, saws and tractors. The reasons horses are being used along with advanced logging techniques have to do with the sometime conflicting demands of economics and conservation as man battles a calamity that will take nature decades to undo. 
Loggers operating tractor-like skidders, large cranes and lifters marveled at the sight of horses being used in a logging technique that had not been seen here in more than 50 years. #70% of Park's Trees Felled Four months after Hurricane Hugo, both the low-techlogging by horses and the high-tech logging by helicopter are being used to clear the 250,000-acre park, which lost about 70 percent of its trees. But the condition of the once-dense pine forest represents a small part of the devastation caused by the hurricane, said Jack Gould, South Carolina's head forester.
Mr. Gould said he and other foresters had determined that the hurricane, which hit Charleston, S.C., with winds of 135 miles an hour on Sept. 21, swept through a total of 4.4 million acres of privately and publicly owned timberland in the state.
''We estimate that we lost 6.7 billion board feet of timber throughout the state,'' he said. ''That's more timber than was lost in Hurricane Camille, the Yellowstone fires and the eruption of Mount St. Helens combined.''
The $4.3 billion logging industry is South Carolina's third largest business, Mr. Gould said, and employs 30,000 to 40,000 people. Reforestation will take 6 to 10 years, and it will be at least 50 more years before nature completes the restoration.
Mr. Gould and others said the logging industry is thriving now, with the work force swelled by farm workers idled by crop losses from the hurricane and by out-of-state loggers.
 
Forest Fire Danger Seen
''It's not instant death,'' said John Jamison, who operates the Umphleet Mill in McBeth, northeast of the national forest. ''It will be six months to two years before the real problems hit.''
Many fear that even before the economic impact is felt, wildfires feeding on the hurricane debris that litters the forest floor in piles up to 10 feet high will cause another disaster.
The area had 27 fires after the hurricane last fall, as against an average of 10 for that time of the year.
The timber salvage efforts have become that much more urgent, said Glenn Stapleton, the United States Forest Service ranger in charge of the eastern half of the Francis Marion forest. The peak fire season is mid-February to early April.
''If a wildfire gets into that, it could burn 50 or 60 miles inland, Mr. Stapleton said. ''And you aren't talking about days, but weeks before it stops.''
 
Longer and Hotter Fires
Dick Cox, director of fire management for the United States Forest Service's southern region, said such fires burn longer and hotter than those in forests with standing trees.
For this reason, the Forest Service quickly got bids from logging companies to harvest the fallen timber.
At the same time, Mr. Stapleton said, they tried to prevent damage to the soil from heavy equipment that would hamper natural regrowth in sensitive areas of the forest, including the nesting areas of certain species of birds. Among the 50 logging operations now going on in the national forest are those using ''low-impact'' techniques involving horses and helicopters.
Unlike tractors and skidders, horses do not leave ruts in the ground and do not damage trees that are still standing. And the helicopters lift the cut logs by a 250-foot cable, eliminating the need for heavy equipment on the ground.
John Reed, a wizened Tennessean, brought his Percherons into the forest to pull timber from an area that is the main habitat of the red-cockaded woodpecker, an endangered species.
''We're usually ridge-runners in the Great Smokies or up in Maine,'' Mr. Reed said, noting that logging by horses is more common in mountainous areas. ''But we can work on this flat land, too. It's a little slower, but I'll take these old horses over a machine any day.''
Mr. Reed and his crew of five men and four two-horse teams are logging prime, long-needle pine from an area that the Forest Service rarely allows to be logged. The mill that won the bid on this parcel with the promise of bringing in low-impact logging techniques is owned by Joe Cantley and specializes in heart-of-pine flooring, which uses dense, knot-free wood from the very center of the tree.
 
'It's Working Out Fine'
''People told me I was crazy when I told them I was going to bring horses in here,'' Mr. Cantley said. ''But it's working out fine, and other operations have come around offering Mr. Reed three times what I am paying him to get him on their parcels.''
Nearby, the Georgia-Pacific Corporation is using the more expensive method of logging by helicopter to pull fallen 85-year-old loblolly pines from an experimental forest area. Joe Watkins, the engineer on the project. said such costly techniques were more common in logging hardwood trees, which have a higher value than conifers.
But the Forest Service requirement that the operations on the experimental forest use low-impact methods and Georgia-Pacific's need to supply a nearby mill made it necessary to reach out to the Oregon-based Columbia Helicopter Company for a helicopter big enough to lift 28,000 pounds.
As the twin-rotor copter hovered noisily over the forest, loggers on the ground scurried about hooking cables to fallen logs, then hooking the cables to a hauling collar that dangled from another cable extending from the helicopter. The copter hauled the logs more than two miles to a loading area where they were put onto trucks.
Mr. Watkins said Georgia-Pacific would store some of the logs at its plant in nearby Russellville and send other logs to four other mills from Virginia to Florida. But it was the Russellville mill, which makes plywood and employs 90 people, that was most in need. He said devastation was so widespread there was a fear the company could not get enough raw material.
Similar logging operations are taking place on on state and private land as well as the national forest. Mr. Gould, the state's chief forester, said he hoped that 25 percent of the fallen timber could be salvaged statewide. But even so, he added, the loss to South Carolina's economy will run into the hundreds of millions.
But the loss for people like the Charleston novelist Josephine Humphreys and her 15-year-old son William, who are birdwatchers, is beyond dollars. Ms. Humphreys said she and her son often sought the serenity of the national forest for bird watching.
''My son just gets sort of depressed looking at all the snapped and snagged trees,'' she said. ''I try to tell him that he will now get to watch a more dynamic process of rebirth, but the fact that it will take years and years doesn't seem to move him very much.''

HEADLINE: A Poor Way to Save

 BODY:
President Bush's misguided urge to cut the tax on capital gains finds a dubious companion in his ''family savings plan.'' Floated during the 1988 campaign and now being readied for submission to Congress, it shares at least two faults with the gains tax: it is weak medicine for America's low savings rate, and it would create new budget problems for the future.
The family savings plan is a slimmed-down Individual Retirement Account, the tax break for personal savings sharply curtailed by tax reform in 1986. The big difference is that I.R.A.'s offered an immediate tax break. The family savings plan offers less incentive to save because it offers a less certain break sometime in the future. 
Before reform, all taxpayers could take as much as $2,000 off their taxable income each year if they put it into an I.R.A. No tax was due on the deducted income until the savings were withdrawn, after retirement, and interest or dividends earned by the account accumulated tax-free until withdrawal. Since 1986, only taxpayers with limited incomes who are not covered by company pension plans have been eligible for an I.R.A.'s alluring up-front benefit.
The basic idea of the Bush plan is a long-term savings account on which the earnings accumulate tax-free and would not be taxed on withdrawal. Unlike an I.R.A., money placed in the account would not be deductible from current income. Mr. Bush is expected to limit his plan to savings for designated ''family'' purposes, like education or buying a home. And to avoid favoring the rich, he may make taxpayers with higher incomes ineligible. The idea of reviving the I.R.A. in some form already has strong backing in Congress. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, has a plan for a new I.R.A. with an up-front benefit like the old one; he offers it as a tax break for the middle class, to balance the President's capital gains break for the well-to-do.
Representative Charles Schumer, Brooklyn Democrat, proposes a variation that would commit taxpayers to future saving, with an option for payroll deductions. And Senator William Roth of Delaware offers a version closer to the President's.
The Roth and Bush plans ask that taxpayers trust Congress not to change the law again before they get the promised benefit. That's trusting a lot. Five different tax incentives for savings have been written and rewritten in the past 16 years.
But the idea is flawed anyhow. Pre-1986 I.R.A.'s probably stimulated some savings, but it's uncertain how much was simply old savings transferred into a new shelter. The Bush plan, with its narrower focus, would presumably stimulate less.
Further, the tax exemption for interest and dividends earned would mean loss of future tax revenue. The Administration says these losses would be more than offset by increased tax collections generated by higher savings and investment and a more vigorous economy. That's debatable.
If Mr. Bush is serious about a tax incentive for savings, let him admit that it has a cost now, and not lay the cost off on future taxpayers. If he's not, let him at least acknowledge that the surest way to improve savings is still what it has been for years now: reduce the budget deficit.

HEADLINE: A United Europe Seems Closer Than Ever

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Bush Administration has finally found its vision, and it is a good one. The vision, expounded by President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d during and after the summit talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Malta early in December, is of building a peace order for the industrial world by developing three concentric spheres of unity: the Europe of the Economic Community, where the Administration has renewed America's historic support for European federation; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, where new joint political arrangements are needed, and the greater Europe of East and West, including the Soviet Union and the United States. 
This vision is practically identical to President Gorbachev's vision of a ''common European home.'' Now that Mr. Gorbachev has come out for NATO - and for a stronger political NATO that could become a substructure of the common home - East and West should be able to work together toward this goal.
This is an extraordinary political configuration. It means that the door is open to the realization of the hopes of international unity that were dashed after 1945. What is more, these hopes can be realized on a much higher and more mature basis, by encompassing institutions that have meanwhile been built up in the European Community and the Atlantic-Pacific system.
Even so, the vision will not take care of itself. Persistent diplomatic efforts, backed by Congress and the public, will be needed.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
State Of the Drug War

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the past month, the U.S. Government's ''war on drugs'' won two victories.
In Panama, the dictator accused of facilitating the international movement of narcotics was overturned, cornered, arrested and is in jail.
In D.C., the Mayor long-suspected of being the nation's most celebrated crack smoker was entrapped, arrested and will enter treatment and Agnew-style plea bargaining.
Both victories followed invasions: one of a nation, the other of individual rights. 
In Manuel Noriega's case, the invasion was justified by his declaration of war and threat to U.S. lives.
In Marion Barry's case, the inability of a prosecutor to get a grand jury to indict was no justification for the sleaziest kind of entrapment.
A former girlfriend of the target was induced or coerced to set him up; the U.S. for the first time became a party to the sexual seduction of an elected official, creating the circumstances for the commission of a crime. In an act more familiar to K.G.B. blackmailers than F.B.I. agents, the misdemeanor was recorded by cameras hidden in the bedroom.
The publicity-grubbing U.S. Attorney goes on television to characterize the charge as ''corruption,'' as if it were a Federal offense to be a poor role model. (Good prosecutors persuade grand juries to make charges in an indictment and then shut up until trial or plea.) With that prosecutorial misfeasance noted (and where is the A.C.L.U.?) the fact remains that Marion Barry has been an embarrassment to drug fighters. In this city, the widespread assumption has been that the Mayor was a drug user; the message was that you could do drugs, deny it, ''handle it'' and get away with it.
Now that is reversed: every would-be drug bigshot on the streets knows that the fuzz busts bigshots, too.
The same convincing message has been sent by the Colombian Government to the Medellin cartel. Drug lords who declared war on the Government only six months ago are now suing for peace, offering to stop their killings if the Government will protect them from extradition to the stern U.S. Evidently the cartel believes it is losing; the Barco Government is making no deals.
All this is unmistakable progress in the ''war.'' A year ago, some liberals predicted defeat because the emphasis was on law enforcement rather than addict treatment. Some conservative economists joined in the defeatism, waving the white flag of legalization - a route that would put cheap, mind-destroying chemicals in millions of school knapsacks.
Drug czar William Bennett denounces the defeatists, is counterdenounced by academics, but plugs ahead on all fronts.
How do you measure progress, or lack of it, in a war? The casual use of cocaine has been declining, but the addictive use of the cheaper crack rages on. You could deduce from this that the rich get cleaner and the poor get more addicted, but tolerated casual use has often been the bridge to addiction.
Blowing coke may be down but crack-caused violence is up. Murders are increasing on the streets of Washington (we call our hometown Intifada West). Lawmen suggest this gangland turf warfare is caused by a tightening of the market, but put this area down as no progress.
Anti-drug spending is rising. Last year, we upped it by 50 percent; this year, Bill Bennett asked for 24 percent more and will get half that in the coming budget.
Is the money going in the right direction? The strategy, as I see it, is to spend the most on enforcement and prisons, limiting availability, raising prices and scaring addicts into treatment. This increased demand for treatment should create pressure for its supply - and greater local response.
Meanwhile, ''the war on drugs is not a metaphor,'' as the President told the Defense Secretary. Despite the flap about our warships off Colombia, we will see more of our military stopping drug-runners - especially at our Southwest border, formerly known as the Mexican border.
That escalation of the use of the military will be part of the second phase of the drug war strategy to be announced at the end of this month.
A computerized law enforcement intelligence center will be proposed to disseminate information that can be used in court, which the C.I.A. cannot do. The headline will be the death penalty for murderous kingpins. (Never put the story in the lead.) The war is far from won, and a lust for testing is a danger, but our doggedly optimistic drug czar has earned a vote of confidence. These early victories put us at ''the end of the beginning.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Beyond The Jackpot

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
If anybody doubted it, recent polls show that Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, was right as well as crass when he said the death and destruction of the Panama invasion had won President Bush a political ''jackpot.'' As poker players know, while the winners crack jokes, the losers can only say ''deal!''
The new polls show Mr. Bush's popularity rating higher than any President's since John F. Kennedy scored 83 percent, right after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Earlier this month, Mr. Bush won the approval of 76 percent of respondents to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll, and 79 percent in a similar survey by The Washington Post and ABC News. 
The conquest of Panama and the capture of Manuel Noriega clearly were major elements in Mr. Bush's high ranking. Not only did 74 percent of respondents to the Times/CBS Poll term the invasion justified. They also were largely responsible for the President's strong approval rating -73 percent - in the general handling of foreign policy. That's an increase from just over 50 percent last November.
Since 54 percent of those queried reacted favorably to the return of General Noriega to the U.S. for trial, events in Panama appear also to have influenced public approval - by 54 points - of Mr. Bush's otherwise invisible progress in ''dealing with the drug problem.''
The rest of the Times/CBS Poll hardly gives Mr. Bush cause to crack jokes - or does it? Sixty percent believed he had made little progress toward the ''kinder, gentler'' nation he talked about in his campaign. Only 37 percent thought he had prevented new taxes, rather than just making promises.
Americans' confidence in his handling of the economy was shown to be shaky at best; 36 percent - up from only 25 in November - thought things would get worse against only 8 percent who looked for an economic upturn. Such pessimism had not been registered since 1981, just before the Reagan-Bush recession, the worst of the postwar period.
Mr. Bush got bad marks on environmental protection, with only 24 percent approving his minimal efforts, and on education, where all but an underwhelming 16 percent believed he had ''mainly just talked about'' improvements rather than accomplishing them. Even on the drug question, and even after the bagging of General Noriega, 41 percent of respondents said the President was mostly jawboning rather than getting things done.
What's behind this phenomenon of a highly popular President, so many of whose efforts in office the public low-rates? For one thing, as Lee Atwater knows, never underestimate the rally-round-the-flag effect that always bolsters a President who sends the troops into action abroad - never mind the reasons, the resulting casualties or the ultimate consequences. This national glorification of violence ought to give supposedly peace-loving Americans pause; but it never does.
The Times/CBS Poll tends to validate, moreover, some other unpalatable ideas about American politics. It suggests, for instance, that in judging their leaders American voters do not place a high priority on specific accomplishments - Mr. Bush is popular despite fears about the economy and doubts about his leadership on important domestic matters.
That reinforces a lesson too often ignored by Democrats who keep calling for ''a new party position'' or a ''return to the center,'' etc. In the electoral politics of this country, personality almost always counts more than issues.
It may be also that Americans have come to count on all Presidents to take care of foreign policy (where they give Mr. Bush high marks) but no longer believe that any President can accomplish much in the tangled underbrush of domestic affairs (where they rate Mr. Bush poorly). Given the long-term progress in the cold war that has happened on his watch, and his short-term success in Panama, Mr. Bush appears strong where American voters want their President to be in charge. As long as he meets that test, they demand little from him at home.
That's mostly what they've had from George Bush, which may be the most ominous implication of these polls. The more a President does or even tries to do in difficult domestic affairs, the more likely he is to outrage one or more powerful interests or constituencies; but the less he attempts, the less he risks rocking the boat or pulling down his approval rating - and the more his opponents are reduced to crying ''deal the cards!''

HEADLINE: New Police Chief Brings a Sense of Loyalty That Left Rift in Houston

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
One of Lee P. Brown's last acts as police chief here, before starting work as the New York City Police Commissioner on Monday, was to dismiss four officers involved in two highly publicized and widely criticized shootings of civilians.
In dismissing the officers, Mr. Brown leaves Houston as he entered it - with the ill will of the officers under his command.
Since he accepted the New York job last month, Mr. Brown has stressed that ''New York is not Houston,'' and that he has no plans to transfer any policies from one city to the other. Mr. Brown, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has said his actions in Houston are not a blueprint for what he will do as head of the nation's largest police force.
But one thing he is likely to take is his loyalty to the mayor who hired him, even at the risk of angering his officers. During his seven years in Houston, which included some of the toughest economic times the city had ever seen, Mr. Brown did not take issue publicly with Mayor Kathryn J. Whitmire when she proposed staff and salary cuts. 
And when a study by his office last year found that the city needed 1,000 more officers, Mr. Brown was criticized for planning the release of that report just after the re-election of Mrs. Whitmire.
 
A Badge of Integrity
''The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the city,'' he said after his appointment was announced. ''We may disagree many times, about many things, but it serves no purpose for me to go out raising questions in public.''
Mr. Brown's supporters describe such loyalty as a badge of integrity. ''Lee Brown has a very strict sense of ethics for himself,'' said Tom G. Koby, an assistant chief of police under Mr. Brown. ''Good, bad or indifferent, that Mayor is his boss.'' Mr. Brown had sharp words with the Mayor about raising officers' salaries, but scrupulously kept those discussions private, Mr. Koby said.
''The officers really would have liked for him to get up there and beat on the table,'' Mr. Koby said. ''But Brown is never going to do that.''
Mr. Brown's critics, in turn, say such loyalty is misdirected. ''He was more concerned with posturing for his own benefit and the Mayor's benefit than for the men and women who were out on the street,'' said Mark R. Clark, the president of the Houston Police Officers Association, one of Houston's two police unions. ''He's no more than another politician.''
The tension between the chief and the rank and file dates back to his appointment by Mrs. Whitmire in 1981. Mr. Brown, then the Public Safety Commissioner in Atlanta, where he oversaw the investigation into a series of child murders, came to Houston as an outsider in a clubby department.
 
A Review of Department
He brought a reputation as a maestro of bureacracy, who played his plans close to his chest and often talked in police jargon so thick it baffled listeners. The Houston police, in turn, had a national reputation as a lawless, racist force, particularly after a Hispanic prisoner was beaten and drowned by several officers in 1978.
Mr. Brown's first act was to ask for a thorough review of the department -something he is likely to do in New York, too. He decided that the Houston police force was too insulated, and began sending both management and beat officers to seminars across the country for exposure to other departments' operations.
After several years of trying some modest changes, Mr. Brown tried to develop ''a philosophy of management,'' Mr. Koby said. As a result, police executives, managers and other guests addressed seminars about the future of the department.
''We had spent time and money on faster cars, newer computers, enhanced communications - but all this took us further and further away from the community,'' remembers Capt. Bill Young, a director of the Neighborhood Oriented Policing program, which grew out of those sessions.
 
Helping to Cut Crime
Such policing is not a new idea, but it was new to Houston. In theory it keeps overworked officers from becoming ''robots, responsible to a dispatcher, responding from call to call to call,'' Captain Young said. The policy, as it works in Houston, is meant to reserve a few hours in each officer's week for walking the streets, meeting people and making plans rather than just responding to calls. While the approach taxes resources, Captain Young said, in the long run it can help cut crime.
He gives as an example an apartment complex heavily used by crack dealers. Officers spent hours with the apartment managers, eventually persuading them to evict the dealers. Before the evictions, the police received 13 calls a day from the complex, he said. Now they get about three.
Critics call the program a good idea, poorly executed.
''On paper it's great,'' said Mike Howard, president of the Houston Police Patrolmen's Union, another union, ''and if we had the manpower and other resources to do it, it could be great. But we don't.''
 
Changed the Image
Local command stations were another outgrowth of Mr. Brown's brainstorming sessions. Houston has always had one command station. Located downtown, it is far away from many residents in this city, which spans 550 square miles.
The plan is to build five smaller command stations with separate dispatchers and jails. ''Under the old system,'' Captain Young said, ''if your kid gets picked up for shoplifting, you have to pick him up downtown. If your car is towed it's likely to be towed downtown. This way we put the services where the problems are.''
The first of the five stations, on the west side, has been open for two years. The second is under construction. The changes brought praise for Mr. Brown from Houston residents and law-enforcement groups nationwide. ''He made the policemen visible and accessible even when their numbers were way down,'' said State Representative Al Edwards, a Democrat. ''And he himself made a big effort to be out and around giving speeches to community groups and meeting with people all the time. He changed the image of the department very dramatically.''
But that newly burnished reputation was hurt recently by a rash of incidents. Last fall, two officers shot and killed motorists after traffic stops, two others were found guilty in rape cases, one was arrested for heroin possession, one was charged with coercing sex from a prostitute, one was reassigned amid charges of harassment and two officers' houses were searched as part of a drug investigation.
The two shootings brought the most public outcry, and on Wednesday Mr. Brown dismissed the officers involved. One, Alex Gonzales, had already been indicted. But two officers accused of standing by while Officer Gonzales pulled the trigger were not indicted. The case of a fourth officer accused in another shooting has not yet been presented to the grand jury.
Though the dismissals have brought praise from the Mayor and black residents here - both shooting victims were black while the officers were white or Hispanic - many officers expressed outrage that three police officers were dismissed even though they had not been indicted.
''I don't know why in the world when he's going to New York he took these eleventh-hour actions,'' said Mr. Clark, of the Police Officers Association. ''He felt like he needed to clear the slate out and it was easier for him to do the wrong thing than to do the right thing.''
Mr. Brown's call on Thursday for the establishment of a Civilian Review Board evoked similar anger.
Until that time he had opposed one on the ground that it would tie the hands of the police chief in disciplining officers. It was the one issue on which he openly clashed with Mrs. Whitmire. But he said the version he was endorsing would leave final authority in the hands of the police chief.
''It's almost like he's taking a few last shots at us as he's walking out the door,'' said Mr. Howard, of the Patrolmen's Union. ''Maybe he never really wanted to be here in the first place.''

HEADLINE: For Gov. O'Neill, Bitter 3d-Term Prospects

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Gov. William A. O'Neill, whose popularity soared with the economic boom of the mid-1980's and sank as financial woes rocked the state government last year, will face the toughest battle of his career when he seeks re-election to a third term in November, supporters and opponents say.
In the cluster of northeastern states that were identified so strongly with the regional resurgence and so battered as the decade closed, Mr. O'Neill is so far the only incumbent Governor who has said he will seek re-election in what appears to be a new economic era.
In Massachusetts, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, another once-popular Governor whose approval rating soured in part because of budget troubles, has said he will not run again. In New Jersey, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, barred by the State Constitution from a third term, has left that state's deep financial problems to Gov. Jim Florio, who was inaugurated last week.
And in New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, struggling with what could be a $2 billion budget gap in the fiscal year beginning April 1, has declined to say whether he will run for a third term. 
 
Overshadowed by Other Governors
Mr. O'Neill, a former bar owner who has cultivated an image as an ordinary man, was consistently overshadowed through his nine years in office by the governors next door. But he said in a recent interview that he now believed his lack of grandise claims and grand ambitions for higher office in the boom years might be a blessing.
''We never talked about the miracle of Connecticut,'' he said, referring to the ''Massachusetts miracle,'' a claim of prosperity that haunted Mr. Dukakis after his failed bid for the Presidency in 1988. ''We talked about the 'land of steady habits,' and that's exactly what we are, very steady.''
Even Mr. O'Neill's staunchest supporters concede, however, that as a candidate, he will have to be far more than a steady incumbent at the helm to win re-election.
Since last June, when he signed into law the biggest one-year tax increase in state history to shore up a faltering state budget, his popularity has appeared to decline.
His opponents have attacked him as a doddering symbol of failure, heading an administration that should be left where it flourished, in the 1980's. Last month The Hartford Courant, the state's biggest newspaper, portrayed Mr. O'Neill on its editorial page as the recipient of an annual gift from the voters: this year it was a noose.
And his popularity might slip even more with the state facing a possible $125 million shortfall in the fiscal year that ends June 30 and a possible $400 million gap in the next fiscal year.
 
Challengers Are Encouraged
The daunting numbers have encouraged challengers in Mr. O'Neill's own Democratic Party, including Representative Bruce A. Morrison. Republicans, who have controlled the governor's office for only four years since 1955, say they believe 1990 will be their best chance in decades, especially if Mr. O'Neill stays on the ticket.
''He has well-defined high negatives,'' said the chairman of the State Republican Party, Dick Foley, using pollsters' jargon to describe the Governor's popularity problems. ''If I had my preference, I'd run against O'Neill.''
Mr. O'Neill, a 59-year-old former three-pack-a-day smoker who suffered a heart attack in his first term, has said repeatedly that only a decline in his health will forestall a re-election bid. And while he has promised in speeches to run again, he has yet to file the papers for his candidacy, a fact that has led some people, including Mr. Foley, to believe that Mr. O'Neill may still ultimately withdraw if he thinks he cannot win.
''About April 1 he's going to look at the polls again, and he's going to get sick,'' Mr. Foley said.
 
Fighting to the End
But Mr. O'Neill also seems to be going out of his way in recent weeks to demonstrate that he will not go down without a fight. Last month, for example, he forced a cross-border confrontation with New York - often politically popular in a small state dominated by larger neighbors - when he refused to allow fares on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad to be increased on the Connecticut side of the border.
After two weeks of threats and bluster between Mr. O'Neill and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and the New York City bus and subway system, the authority agreed to keep the old fares in place for Connecticut and make up the revenue difference by postponing some improvements in service and scrapping an advertising campaign.
Earlier this month Mr. O'Neill went on the attack again, announcing a plan to put state police officers on drug patrols in Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford, the state's three largest cities.
Arguing that drug crime was rampant and that the local police were unable to cope, Mr. O'Neill imposed the plan without getting any prior agreements from the local police unions about such sticky issues as jurisidiction, benefits and overtime. Hartford police officers picketed in protest last Thursday, giving Mr. O'Neill's plan wider news coverage across the state than the idea received when it was first announced.
 
Budget a Top Concern
Still, Mr. O'Neill's central problem, politicians and economists say, remains the state budget, which is sicker than Connecticut's overall economy. Although the housing market has slumped and there is fear of worse to come, the unemployment rate is still only 3.4 percent. And the state's tax rate, even with last year's increases, remains the sixth lowest in the country, according to a recent nationwide survey by Money magazine.
What has happened, budget experts say, is that states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, which expanded their budgets in the 1980's to compensate for the withdrawal of Federal aid under the Reagan Administration, have all become subject to greater budget fluctuations - and perhaps political turmoil - because their tax bases have shrunk.
In Connecticut, for example, the size of the state budget grew by about 275 percent in the O'Neill years - from $2.5 billion in 1980 to $6.9 billion this year. There have been huge increases in spending for health care, prisons and road and bridge rebuilding.
And because Mr. O'Neill has adamantly refused to consider an income tax and there is less Federal aid, Connecticut's bigger budgets have had to rely more and more on a particularly volatile revenue source: its 8 percent state sales tax, which can fluctuate wildly in revenue as consumers decide to spend money or not.
 
No New Taxes Planned
Mr. O'Neill, who is to open the General Assembly session on Feb. 7 with the presentation of his budget, has already said that it will not contain new taxes. For the Democratic-controlled Assembly, most of whose members are also facing election campaigns this fall, the session will thus concentrate on which state services to cut - and if state employees must be laid off, how many. Few legislators expect much good news to take back to their districts as campaign ammunition.
But Mr. O'Neill says he still believes that the tide, seemingly so strong against him, will turn. Sitting at his desk in the Capitol, he recently said that if he could still reach voters ''at the kitchen table,'' as he once did, he would prevail.
''They have to start thinking, and they will, sitting at the kitchen table or the breakfast table: 'Say, wait a minute. We know this guy. We know what he can do. He's been there in good days, and he's been there in bad.' ''

 BODY:
After months of bitter verbal sparring, labor and management at the 70-year-old Daily News began the collective-bargaining process last week on negotiations that both sides say are apt to save the paper or sink it.
''It could be thumbs up or thumbs down on the future,'' James Hoge, the New York paper's publisher, wrote in a recent annual report sent to employees. Contracts for all 10 of The Daily News's labor unions expire at midnight March 30.
Company and union leaders say they do not want a strike, which could mean the end of the nation's largest metropolitan newspaper and cost New York City several thousand jobs and millions in taxes.
''We're ready to negotiate a contract,'' said George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella organization that includes all the paper's unions. 
 
Seeking Radical Change
But Mr. Hoge is demanding radical change from what he characterizes as overmanning, featherbedding and rampant waste. He is underscoring his seriousness by preparing to produce a paper during a strike. Mr. Hoge has been saying for months that he is determined ''to regain management control of manufacturing and distribution operations'' - a dramatic shift in the balance of power toward management and a very different approach than was taken in past contracts.
For instance, the current contract defines precisely how many people must be assigned to a press, depending on such things as the number of pages. In the past, The News negotiated in that context, seeking to reduce the manning level required by the contract.
But not this time. John T. Sloan, who is acting as spokesman for The News during the negotiations, said last week that the company now would seek union acknowledgement of management's right to decide press staffing in all situations as well as a host of other things - like hiring and the right to take disciplinary actions - that are determined by the present contracts and long tradition.
Mr. Sloan declines to say how much The News hopes to reduce costs but says the goal is to change salary, overtime, benefits and other compensation expenses from about 50 percent of revenues to about 25 percent, the industry average for large papers. To accomplish this would require more than $100 million in annual savings. That would make The News highly profitable by industry standards.
Mr. Hoge says that, once ''management control'' is achieved, the Chicago-based Tribune Company, which owns The Daily News, will invest up to $500 million to build a modern color printing plant that both union and management agree is essential to the paper's long-term survival.
Last week, the process of exchanging contract proposals between the paper and the unions began, with negotiations to follow.
Mr. McDonald and other labor leaders say management's unusually harsh, confrontational approach to the negotiations suggests that the Tribune Company does not intend to own the paper for very long.
The unions were dismayed when The News hired King & Ballow, a Nashville law firm that specializes in tough labor negotiations and has a reputation among labor unions of being particularly aggressive.
 
Concessions and Profits
According to the union scenario, which Mr. Hoge vigorously denies, management intends to wring huge concessions from the unions to make the paper profitable and then sell it to a buyer who will operate it cheaply on existing equipment. Or, if there is a strike, union leaders fear the company will say labor killed the paper and close it with minimal shutdown liabilities.
In the early 1980's, the Tribune Company sought to sell The News but reversed itself and declared its commitment to continue publishing. But in negotiations throughout the 80's, the company has sought manning reductions, generally accompanied by buyout offers.
Union officials fear that in these negotiations the company will be very stingy with buyout offers and similar inducements. Many of the newspaper union leaders say they do not believe the Tribune Company will invest in a new printing plant, regardless of union concessions, because New York's economy is too uncertain. They note that The New York Times Company has postponed plans for color presses to print the daily paper, though The Times is proceeding with another plant to print some Sunday sections in color.
And the unions have not been persuaded by The News's recent acquisition of industrial sites in New Jersey and Long Island, which the paper has offered as evidence of its sincere intention to invest in new presses.
The paper's union leaders make no secret of their worry. Because the same unions represent workers at The Times and The New York Post, any substantial concessions at The News are apt to be sought by the other papers. The Times is already seeking changes in a six-year contract due to expire in 1993. Contracts at The Post, like The News, expire March 30, but no decisive action on The Post contracts is expected until settlements are reached at The News.
Though union leaders will not confirm it, they have apparently been working with the Kamber Group, a public relations concern, for the negotiations - an unusual step that reflects their anxiety. The News has hired John Scanlon, a public relations specialist.
 
Eager for Public Support
Both sides are eager to win the sympathy of the public, especially advertisers and city leaders, which could prove critical in a strike.
''We will not sign or ratify any contracts until everybody reports they are satisfied,'' Mr. McDonald said then.
Solidarity may well become an important issue as The Daily News has identified New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union No. 2 and the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union - the pressmen and the drivers - as principal targets because they are responsible for a majority of what the paper says is unnecessary expense. A key aspect of The News's strategy seems to be to crack that solidarity.
The first concrete glimpse of The News's plan came Jan. 14, when the paper made its contract proposals to the deliverers union. The union, representing 688 of the paper's 2,466 unionized employees, is generally considered the paper's most powerful because in a strike, many say, The News could not be distributed without the drivers.
 
A One-Year Contract
The union's president, Michael J. Alvino, declined to give details of the proposal, except that The News was seeking a one-year contract, rather than the usual three-year agreement. A person associated with the unions, who said he had seen the proposal but asked not to be identified, described it as ''completely rewriting the contract.''
And Mr. Alvino confirmed that The News's proposal stated that the paper is seriously considering converting to independent contractors for delivery of papers sold by single copy, as opposed to home delivery. About 80 percent of The News's 1.2 million circulation is sold through racks or newsstands.
Under this plan, the drivers would be given the first option to buy the right to deliver papers along a particular route, transforming many of them from employees to entrepreneurs.
For the paper, such a change would greatly reduce the number of driver employees and also create a commodity - the routes - that could be offered to people willing to deliver the paper during a strike.
Mr. Alvino said selling routes was calculated to divide the union and would ''help some individuals but not the majority.''
While Mr. Alvino has said repeatedly that the drivers union would not make any separate deal with The News, his union has traditionally acted independently of the other unions and only joined the allied council last year.
Mr. Sloan, the News spokesman, declined to discuss the proposal.
 
Labor Practices
The News has sought to isolate the pressmen and driver unions by portraying them as engaging in more abusive and unreasonable labor practices than the other unions.
For instance, Mr. Sloan said that while the contract might require 15 men to run the presses on a given night, often only about 10 will show up, but they will sign in for the five others in what is called ''the buddy system.''
Though management has the right to make a worker roll-call, Mr. Sloan said any discipline of that sort results in work slowdowns.
Because fewer than 10 people are actually needed to operate the presses, Mr. Sloan said, it is customary for several pressmen to go home after a couple of hours, though they are paid for the full shift. And if there are problems and resulting overtime, all 15 signed-up workers are entitled to it.
''I think it's just a smokescreen,'' said John P. Kennedy, president of the pressmen's union. ''The manning levels have been in place ever since the equipment has been running.''
Mr. McDonald of the allied council noted that The News already has the power to insure that a full press crew is on hand, but has lacked the management will to enforce the existing rules.
The News also accuses some of its unions, especially the pressmen, of effectively shutting out minorities from jobs. Mr. Sloan said the 410 employees in the pressmen's union at The News include no women or blacks or Hispanic workers and no Asian-Americans or Native Americans.
Mr. Kennedy said he never heard of a woman seeking a job in the pressroom, which is particularly dirty work; he asserted that ''the door is open'' to minority workers.
 
Control Over Hiring
The News maintains that the problem with the pressmen and some other unions has been that the company does not control hiring for those jobs, as it does with unions like the Newspaper Guild, which covers such jobs as reporters.
One of the company's objectives is to assert control over all hiring, and Mr. Sloan said one outcome of that would be an increase in minority representation. In areas where management controls hiring, The News says that 27 percent of the work force are women and 21 percent are from minorities.
Newspaper analysts say the Tribune Company has decided that the time is ripe to force workplace efficiencies at The News that have become common at papers in other cities as newspaper unions have gradually lost ground over the last two decades.
The News says it has lost $115 million during the last decade. It says the paper had no profit on $420 million in revenues in 1989.
Some newspaper analysts say the Tribune Company needs to bring The News's operation in line with its other, quite profitable newspapers, such as The Chicago Tribune and The Orlando Sentinel in Florida. They say anything short of significant profits would be a drag on the company's overall earnings, which in turn would affect the price of Tribune stock.
''It's a critical issue for stockholders,'' said Lisa Donneson, an analyst at County NatWest Securities in Manhattan.
Mr. Hoge, the News publisher, said that even in a city that is generally considered the most pro-union in the nation, readers and advertisers will not support what he characterized as inefficiencies that no modern company could tolerate.
But newspaper union officials are casting the struggle as perhaps the crucial test of the New York labor movement and vow that the Tribune Company will learn just how strong a union town New York still is.
They argue that The News is trying to roll back on contracts and work practices that have been won through decades of collective bargaining.
''We are prepared to negotiate manning levels, but on new color equipment,'' said Mr. Kennedy of the pressmen's union. Mr. McDonald and other union leaders said the concessions The News appears to want must be accompanied by an ironclad guarantee to build a new plant and based on the high-tech equipment to be used there.
The company has insisted that it must first have the concessions on existing equipment in order to justify a huge new investment.

HEADLINE: Listing Shows Homeless Sites To Aid Census

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
New York City has made its first concerted effort to list the places where homeless people spend their nights, in the hope of guiding the Census Bureau to those who live in shelters, subway stations, parks, doorways and abandoned buildings - and who would otherwise go uncounted.
The list, based on two surveys taken last year, has more than 2,100 sites. More than half are in Manhattan, although the borough has only 20 percent of the city's population.
On the list are 326 shelters, public and private, whose combined population or capacity is 29,612 people. In addition, there are as many as 1,687 locations, on and off and under city streets, where up to 5,783 people were counted - in the middle of the night -by police officers, transit workers and other government employees. 
 
'There Are Many, Many More'
''This is a very limited snapshot taken by non-enumerators in a limited amount of time,'' said Linda Goldsmith, deputy director of computer information services in the City Planning Department, which prepared the survey.
''If we found these people, we know there are many, many more,'' she said.
In March, the list is to be used by the Census Bureau when it sends out hundreds of enumerators to conduct a special and limited count of the homeless population.
''What we're not doing here is a census of the homeless,'' said Dr. Kenneth C. Meyer, the assistant regional census manager in New York.
Instead, he said, its importance is that ''this may give us the first handle - if not on the numbers - on the magnitude of the problem.''
The count will provide information that has never existed: for each census tract (typically 10 to 20 city blocks), there will be an enumeration of people living in shelters and on the street.
The special count will also add homeless people to the population tally for specific city blocks. There might be wide political implications, especially on the local level, when the census is used for redistricting.
There will be important economic implications, too, in the many instances in which government aid is apportioned by census figures.
Although the special count is a nationwide effort, in which every municipality was asked to devise a list of shelters and street locations for the Census Bureau, New York City's site inventory stands out because of its size, complexity, detail and scope.
And yet, as census officials and city planners acknowledge, thousands of people will go uncounted.
 
'A Moving Target'
For example, many New Yorkers go through episodic homelessness, having friends or relatives house them between periods on the street. If they happen to have found temporary lodging in March, they will be skipped. Also, many homeless people take great pains to obscure their condition. They might easily elude an enumerator's cursory glance.
''By its very nature, a site inventory is a moving target,'' said Roberta Lentz, program director in the city's 1990 Census Project.
The survey's limitations have raised suspicions and fears. Despite the government's disclaimer, advocates for homeless people worry that the count will be seen as a census, boiled down to a single, unrealistically low number.
If Census Bureau enumerators were to visit every site and find roughly the same number of people, and if they were to visit every shelter and find them all operating at stated capacity, they might count about 35,000 people. But the Coalition for the Homeless believes the true number may be at least twice that high.
 
'Cynical Politicians'
''The more New Yorkers who are homeless are counted, the better it is for all New Yorkers, homeless or otherwise,'' said Robert M. Hayes, chairman of the coalition.
''Our abiding anxiety,'' he said, ''is based on the near certainty that cynical politicians who want to ignore the massive scale of homelessness across the country will misuse this limited exercise,'' to diminish the problem.
And, he said, it is ''almost inevitable'' that the results of the count will be misrepresented and oversimplified in news accounts - that the count will be mistaken as a real measure of the homeless population.
That fear is heightened, in a way, by the evident effort and diligence that went into the site inventory, because the results appear authoritative and more comprehensive than they are.
 
List Shows 326 Shelters
As Mr. Hayes leafed through the 200-page list, he said, ''There are obvious places that were missed, but this was a bona fide effort.''
The list shows 326 shelters, in which as many as 29,612 people can be housed. There are 142 in Manhattan (with 14,132 people), 85 in Brooklyn (7,959 people), 48 in the Bronx (3,882 people), 45 in Queens (3,247 people) and 6 on Staten Island (392 people).
In addition, the city counted 1,775 people in 202 places throughout the transportation network.
No one was counted at Grand Central Terminal, which closes at 1:30 A.M., but 104 people were observed at the ferry terminal on Staten Island, 86 at the ferry terminal in Manhattan, 64 in Pennsylvania Station, 61 at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, 39 at La Guardia Airport, 29 at Kennedy International Airport and 20 in the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal.
 
Homeless in the Subways
Some 20 homeless people were counted on A, E, F and No. 1 trains and in the Astor Place, Bedford Park Boulevard, Broadway-Lafayette, Broadway-Nassau, Delancey Street, Fifth Avenue, Grand Central, Second Avenue and Spring Street stations.
In addition, 1,547 homeless people were counted in 963 ''off-street locations,'' meaning parks, playgrounds, vacant lots, housing projects and even the steps of Federal Hall on Wall Street. Fifty people were counted in 26 spots throughout Central Park. Others spent their nights on bridges, railroad trestles and Hudson River piers.
The city prepared a list of 522 street locations, where 2,461 people were counted in doorways, sidewalks, heating grates and the seating areas in the median malls along upper Broadway.
Another list was prepared of 152 abandoned buildings, schools and theaters where homeless people are believed to be living.
 
Began Preparing the Inventory
''The whole effort is to make sure that the Census Bureau has some clue where to send enumerators,'' said Philip Wallick, director of computer information services in the City Planning Department.
Early last year, in response to the Census Bureau, planners began preparing the inventory. The survey ran from March 20 to 24 and was supplemented by a second canvass, from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3.
Survey takers were given forms to fill out the street name and house number or cross streets, as well as a box labeled ''Number of Homeless Persons Observed.'' The workers were to note homeless people that they came across in their rounds between midnight and 2 A.M., but not search for them.
The special census count is to begin at 6 P.M. on March 20, when teams of enumerators will go the shelters - armories, church basements, hotels, homes for runaways, lodging houses -to count and interview residents. That first phase runs until midnight.
From 2 to 4 A.M. on March 21, enumerators will go to the street and off-street locations on the list, take a count and note people's age, race and sex.
From 4 to 6:30 A.M., they will wait outside abandoned buildings that the city has identified as likely to house homeless people. For safety's sake, the enumerators will not go inside. But they are supposed to interview anyone entering or leaving the building.
Finally, from 8 to 11:30 A.M. that same morning, families who are living in shelters or being housed in hotels will be interviewed and counted.
Enumerators will not be allowed to leave predetermined sites, even if they spot homeless people nearby. As it is, there may not be enough time or money for the Census Bureau to visit every site identified by the city, Dr. Meyer said, and the point of the March exercise is neither to canvass the city nor count every homeless person.
''We will try to get to every shelter and hotel or motel,'' he said. ''The more people we can count in the shelters, rather than the streets, the better the count is going to be. We're encouraging governmental units to encourage as many homeless as possible to go into the shelters.''
But Ms. Lentz, of the city's census project, said: ''You just don't know what outreach might do. It might have a boomerang effect. People might not go to the shelters that night. How would they believe that this is an innocuous undertaking and that there is no one spying on them? We walk a very fine line there.''

HEADLINE: Ethnic and Disabled Actors Ask for a Chance

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
''For those of us living and working in this city,'' said the playwright Jules Feiffer, ''writing in the realistic or naturalistic mode for whites only has become unreal and unnatural.''
Mr. Feiffer was speaking at the beginning of the second conference of the Nontraditional Casting Project, a nonprofit organization that seeks to promote greater participation by ethnic minorities and the disabled in the theater.
His words were echoed - by turns with fist-shaking anger, sly wit and impassioned oratory - throughout the two-day conference that ended on Saturday. It was held at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. 
The conference attracted about 150 theater people, ranging from Colleen Dewhurst, the president of the Actors' Equity Association, and Bernard Jacobs, the president of the Shubert Organization, to Linda Bove, a deaf actress who is a regular performer on ''Sesame Street,'' and Cochise Anderson, an American Indian actor who traces his ancestry to the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes.
 
What the Project Is Doing
Since the project's founding in 1986, the problems of blind, deaf and wheelchair-using performers have been added to its concerns. In the last few years, the project has held symposiums in various parts of the country, distributed a book and videotape, and developed a casting file of 3,000 actors representing ethnic minorities and the disabled.
Groups represented at last weekend's conference ranged from the Perseverance Theater of Douglas, Alaska, and the Mixed Blood Theater Company of Minneapolis to Theater by the Blind in New York and the Market Theater of Johannesburg.
Most of the actors, speaking at one of nine panels, simply asked for greater opportunities to appear in theatrical productions.
''Rarely does a Native American Indian woman get to play the roles written for her, and since she is not hired to play other roles she's mostly unemployed,'' said Donna Couteau Brooks of the Sac and Fox nation in Stroud, Okla. Ms. Brooks appeared in the movie ''Prizzi's Honor.''
 
Trying to Forestall Business
Michael Schwartz, a deaf amateur actor and practicing lawyer, drew laughter and applause when, after describing the equal-employment-opportunity provisions of the bill on disabled rights now before Congress, he said: ''Let's do it voluntarily. Let's not go to court and make people like myself rich.''
Some actors said it was especially galling not to be given a chance to portray the ethnic or disabled minorities they represent, and to see white or able-bodied actors get those roles.
Kitty Lunn, an actress who made numerous television commercials before a disabling fall in 1987, told of the distress she felt when she was rejected for the role of a disabled character and learned that it had gone to an able-bodied actress.
''They think I'll be too much trouble,'' she said with a laugh. ''In addition to two boards and a passion, I may need a ramp.''
 
A Conflict of Desires
A number of participants were troubled by a conflict between their desire to work in their own cultural tradition and their wish to play other roles.
Seret Scott, a black actress who has appeared on ''Miami Vice'' and ''The Equalizer'' and recently at Center Stage in Baltimore, was overcome with emotion as she described how upsetting it had been to accept the roles of Hispanic and American Indian characters ''when I knew that would deprive a Hispanic or Native American actor of a job.''
Mr. Anderson said, ''I want to be both an Indian actor and an actor who happens to be Indian.''
And Nestor Serrano, a Puerto Rican actor who is a regular cast member of the NBC series ''True Blue,'' said: ''I'm not embarrassed to play a Hispanic. I just don't want to be limited to playing Hispanics.''
 
A Caveat on Casting
Speaking about casting restrictions, Tisa Chang, the artistic producing director of the Pan-Asian Repertory Theater in Manhattan, said she would not wish to include a Caucasian actor with a group of Asian actors to represent a Japanese-American family. ''I simply do not see Japanese-American families being portrayed with an integrated cast,'' she said.
A number of conference participants offered hope for the future in several areas, including grants, nontraditional casting and new works featuring minorities.
Jessica Andrews, the new director of the theater program of the National Endowment for the Arts, said her goal was that 50 percent of the endowment's grant-making theater panel ''should be people of color.''
Ruth Mayleas, a program officer for the arts at the Ford Foundation, said the extent of cultural diversity on the staff and the board of a theater company had increasingly become a criterion for foundation grants.
 
A Playwright Surprises Himself
Mr. Feiffer said the lead in his new play, ''Elliot Loves,'' scheduled to open on Broadway in June, is a Hispanic woman. ''I didn't know I could write for a Hispanic,'' he said, ''but before that I didn't know I could write for a woman.''
Jean Schiffman, representing several theater groups in the San Francisco Bay Area, said the American Conservatory Theater had employed nontraditional casting in every one of its major productions this season.
And Lucia Puccia, a blind actress who has appeared in a number of Off Broadway productions, said, ''I hope I will have a successful career, but at worst perhaps I will be a role model for another blind actress who makes it.''
At the end of the conference, Sharon Jensen, the executive director of the project, said a consensus had been reached to pursue several objectives. These include the designation of regional representatives to work with a national office, the creation of a theater workshop to introduce directors to a company of talented ethnic and disabled actors, the establishment of a national research program to document critical and public response to nontraditional casting, and the search for other means to encourage cultural diversity throughout the theater.
 
Breaking Classical Barriers
As several participants pointed out, cultural diversity can be encouraged in the casting of the classics.
Chuck Smith, an associate director of the predominantly black Chicago Theater Company, said he had been repeatedly frustrated by casting directors in the Chicago area telling him that black actors were infrequently chosen for the classics ''because they can't handle the language.'' To ''disprove that myth,'' he said, he set up a daylong audition for minority actors to let them show how well they could handle scenes from Chekhov, Noel Coward and Shaw. Local directors were invited. ''We had at least 250 actors audition and about 100 casting directors showed up,'' he said. ''It was a historic day. I saw actors getting hired as they walked off the stage. We got rid of that myth about black actors.''
And Benny Sato Ambush, the artistic director of the predominantly black Oakland Ensemble Theater, said he was recently approached by an actor who uses a wheelchair who thought he should play the title role in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar.'' The actor said: ''Caesar was an old soldier with war wounds. Why not put someone in the part who really knows what war wounds are?''
Mr. Ambush said, ''You can bet I'm going to remember that.''

HEADLINE: Why the Fed Is Largely Uncriticized

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
President Bush and his spokesman last week broke his Administration's policy of keeping quiet about the policies of the Federal Reserve.
But the statements of the President and his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, about the need for lower interest rates were mild compared to the sharp attacks on the Fed by officials in previous administrations when the economy was flagging in an election year.
At the week's end, senior Administration officials said the Bush and Fitzwater remarks were not meant as a direct challenge to the central bank but as a reminder that the Bush Administration wants interest rates as low as is possible, consistent with restraining inflation.
 
Rates Remain High
Although the Fed has allowed interest rates to fall somewhat in the last seven months, they remain abnormally high in relation to the rate of inflation.
Until last week, the central bank had received unusually little criticism from the White House and Congress as an election year begins, given the weakness of the economy and the fact that interest rates are unusually high by historical standards. Three-month Treasury bills are paying about 7.75 percent and 30-year Treasury bonds are around 8.25 percent, while the inflation rate has held steady for years at about 4.5 percent. 
The reluctance of politicians to take on the Fed is in large part a result of the high regard they have for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and of their hope that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues can perform the extraordinarily delicate feat of slowing the economy enough to avert high inflation without causing a recession.
 
No Political Pressure
The relative absence of criticism also reflects the acknowledgement in the White House and Congress that elected officials have let the budget deficit get out of hand and, for better or worse, have surrendered economic policy to the central bank.
Even legislators from states and districts that for all intents and purposes are in a recession say they are under no pressure from constituents or interest groups to take on the Fed.
The view of the Federal Reserve governors and top staff members is that a lack of political arm-twisting gives them freedom to fine-tune the economy that they would not otherwise enjoy.
But, gun-shy from past experience, they fear the statements by Mr. Bush and Mr. Fitzwater are the first signs that the truce flags are coming down.
''I enjoy the absence of Fed-bashing,'' one governor said a few days before the President spoke. But he added, perhaps prophetically, ''I don't think it's a long-term phenomenon.''
In his first public statement on the matter in almost a year, Mr. Bush told the National Association of Homebuilders in Atlanta on Friday that ''low and stable interest rates'' were essential to a growing economy. He did not specifically mention the Federal Reserve.
 
Fitzwater's Remarks
The day before, Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration hoped that new statistics showing a steady inflation rate and a faltering housing industry would persuade the Fed to loosen credit.
Some politicians suggested that Mr. Fitzwater's remarks laid the groundwork for the Administration to shift blame to the Fed if the economy slides into a recession. But top Administration officials disputed that view. One observed that Mr. Greenspan resented political pressure and would be less likely to loosen the reins on credit if the Administration kept speaking out.
In any case, the mood now is quite different from that in 1980 and 1982, the last times the economy was weak in an election year.
In 1980, a repeated theme of President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign was his attacks on the Federal Reserve for its ''ill-advised'' policy of raising interest rates to retard inflation. Mr. Carter's Treasury Secretary, G. William Miller, himself a former Fed chairman, complained that the central bank was ''not communicating'' sufficiently with the Administration.
 
Reagan's Complaint
Similarly, in early 1982, President Ronald Reagan blamed the Fed for a monetary policy that caused capital investment to decline. Speaking of interest rates as the midterm election drew near, he told an audience, ''If that string hadn't been pulled for so long and so hard, we might not have had the depth of the recession that we've had.''
Reagan Administration officials like Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, were even harsher in their criticism, and many lawmakers campaigned on platforms of seeking lower interest rates.
By contrast, President Bush and his top economic policy makers agreed early in the Administration not to attack the Fed in public, a senior official said. They have generally stuck to that agreement, even though most economists believe the economy is growing little, if at all.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady explained the reasoning behind not challenging the Fed. ''People in the United States and around the world generate a higher level of confidence, which leads to economic growth, if they don't feel that there's a big war going on between the economic authorities inside the United States,'' he said.
 
'Inflation Genie'
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said, ''The Administration realizes that while the goal is to maximize growth, letting the inflation genie out of the bottle is very costly later on.''
Once or twice before last week, the Administration's vow was broken. In his first week in office, President Bush told an interviewer, ''I don't want to see us move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.''
Even that mild comment raised eyebrows in the markets. ''There was a suspicion that this Administration, dominated by Texans and with all the Texas real estate and energy problems, would be less anti-inflation than Reagan,'' said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. ''People were waiting for signs that they would turn on the printing press.''
Then in August, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, pointedly criticized the Fed for keeping credit too tight. ''If we do have a recession,'' he said, ''I think it will be because they erred on the side of caution.''
 
Darman Pulls Back
That caused a stir for a few days. Mr. Darman said later he had not intended to use such strong words. He has not spoken out publicly on the subject since.
Asked in an interview today on the ABC News program, ''This Week,'' what policies the Fed should be following, Mr. Darman replied, ''I would like to stay out of that debate in the theory that they will do something wiser if I stay out of the swirl.''
This does not mean the Bush Administration and the Fed have not at times been at odds. Early last year, they disagreed over how to deal with the third world debt and the problems of the savings industry. Over the summer, one official said, Administration economists tried hard to convince Mr. Greenspan that signs of inflation were largely the result of one-time increases in oil and food prices and not a general overheating of the economy.
Then, in October, the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the central bank, decided not to lower interest rates immediately after the meeting of finance ministers of the seven leading industrial countries because Fed officials did not want to be perceived as succumbing to Administration pressure to drive down the value of the dollar.
 
Value of Socializing
Those differences were smoothed over in private. Mr. Greenspan knew many officials in the Administration from when they worked together for President Gerald R. Ford, and they continue to socialize together.
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Brady meet nearly every week for breakfast, often joined by other officials. Mr. Boskin said staff relations between Administration economists and those at the Fed were smooth and cooperative.
''I do express my views to the chairman,'' Mr. Brady said. ''I do it forcefully and privately, and I intend to keep it that way.''
''I admire Alan Greenspan,'' he continued. ''That doesn't mean we don't have our differences; we do. The Fed has a special view about the containment of inflation, and at the same time it is not unmindful of the necessity for growth. We have a special feeling about growth, but we have a very strong eye on inflation. I would say the differences are between the 40-yard lines.''
 
Greenspan Is Careful
For his part, Mr. Greenspan has been careful not to criticize President Bush's policies in public, although, according to colleagues, he believes strong measures including tax increases are needed to lower the budget deficit.
In Congress, where lawmakers with strong interests in farming, small business and construction railed in years past against high interest rates, Mr. Greenspan is treated with respect bordering on reverence.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee, has led the drive to make Federal Reserve procedures more accountable. But he precedes every discussion with strong praise of Mr. Greenspan and the current Fed policy.
And the Democrats who control Congress say they prefer to blame President Bush for the economic slowdown. They fear that too much talk about the Fed's role would give the President an escape hatch.
 
A Positive Influence
Many lawmakers also concede that Mr. Greenspan may be the only official in Washington with a positive influence on the economy, and they are grateful that times are not worse.
''Can you imagine, if it was the President or Congress who had control of monetary policy?'' asked Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits on the Banking and Budget Committees. ''Look at how Congress and the President have handled the budget deficit.''

HEADLINE: Tokyo's Wary Money Managers

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
It takes only one shout of, ''It's the Japanese; they're buying!'' in a Wall Street dealing room to throw traders into fits of nervous activity. It is easy to understand why.
The Japanese buyers are a group of money managers at Tokyo's big banks and insurance companies who control the largest pools of investment funds in the world today, multibillion-dollar symbols of Japan's economic strength.
Their buy or sell decisions can send financial markets gyrating in New York, London or Frankfurt. Every time the United States Treasury sells bonds to finance America's huge budget deficits, the anxious question in Washington and on Wall Street is whether the Japanese will buy. If they do not, interest rates are likely to rise. 
 
Widespread Influence
While their influence is greatest in the stock and bond markets, these conservative Japanese money managers are also large investors in American real estate, Western works of art and even such American finance houses as Shearson Lehman Hutton and Paine Webber.
These powerful money men have been called the ''gnomes of Tokyo,'' successors to the ''gnomes of Zurich,'' the Swiss bankers once believed to hold sway over world finance. Like those secretive Europeans, Tokyo's money managers are generally regarded on Wall Street with fear and envy because of their vast influence over the markets.
But in interviews with the tiny group of managers who make the international investment decisions for two of Japan's largest financial institutions, the Nippon Life Insurance Company and the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, these corporate bureaucrats did not speak of their power. Rather, they talked of how they felt hamstrung by the very size of the funds they control.
''Bigness itself has become a problem,'' said Kozo Nogami, general manager of Nippon Life's international securities investments division.
Mr. Nogami and his counterparts at Mitsubishi Trust described how they can move the tens of billions of dollars they have already invested overseas only in tiny increments, because a large move could destabilize the markets, create a panic and end up causing them losses.
 
'It Would Be Suicide'
That concern is a sober counterpoint to people in Japan who have advocated that the Japanese money managers consider dumping their Treasury bonds to punish the United States when it threatens protectionist actions.
''Those remarks are ridiculous,'' Mr. Nogami said. ''It would be suicide because we would end up losing so much money.''
The risks are awesome. Nippon Life, the biggest insurer in the world, has $164.3 billion in assets, with more than $30 billion invested abroad. Mitsubishi Trust, the largest trust bank with $209 billion in total funds, has $14 billion in international investments.
The money managers acknowledge that they are in the midst of a major shift in their international investment strategies. First, they are putting less money into bonds - largely American - and more into foreign stocks. Second, they are buying more West German stocks, because Germany is expected to benefit from the opening of Eastern Europe and the European Community's move to a single barrier-free market in 1992.
Shinpei Ohashi, the 39-year-old chief manager of Mitsubishi Trust's treasury and securities division, said that as much as 20 percent of the new capital his group invests overseas goes to West Germany, compared with 5 percent a year ago. Similarly, Nippon Life will put more than half its new capital for overseas investment into West Germany.
 
Cautious Newcomers
Despite the vast sums they control, the money men themselves emerged in the interviews as a distinctively Japanese breed of cautious newcomers to the turbulent global markets, methodical and disciplined in their ways but disconcerted by the volatility of this new realm.
The Japanese also provided a telling contrast to their Western counterparts. In the United States, the financial markets are regarded as a bastion of individualism, a place where hot-handed money managers can lay down huge bets and reap part of the rewards if they are successful. They are business stars, highly paid and mobile.
The Tokyo managers are duty-bound bureaucrats in the traditional mold of the regimented Japanese ''salaryman.'' They are means by which the group expresses its will.
For the Japanese, there is no fast track. They can move only slowly, by seniority, up the corporate ladder of prestige and pay, rather than being rewarded in proportion to the returns they earn with their portfolios. A 45-year-old section chief overseeing the investment of $10 billion or so might earn $100,000 a year, at the most, compared with many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a successful American fund manager, who could be nearly 20 years younger.
 
Cadres of Generalists
An American money manager may dart from firm to firm, selling his specialized skills to the highest bidder. The Tokyo managers typically remain in their assignments only three or four years before getting shuffled to another department. This method develops cadres of strong generalists, but not the kind of specialists that some Japanese executives acknowledge are necessary in an area as tricky as international investment.
For instance, Makoto Toda, a chunky, amiable man who heads Nippon Life's international planning department, has a law degree from the University of Michigan and has built his career as an international expert.
But several years ago, he was suddenly appointed head of a provincial branch 60 miles west of Tokyo, managing 800 housewifes who sold insurance door to door. (Insurance is sold almost exclusively by women in Japan.) The job, he noted tersely, ''was not at my request.''
Although the Japanese managers put safety above all else and think of the long term, they acknowledge that they have inadvertently become some of the globe's largest risk-takers. They have a conservative buy-and-hold strategy but because their overseas holdings are so huge, they run enromous risks that swings in currency rates will undermine the value of their portfolios.
''We buy and hold and hope,'' said Shigeru Noma, a short, trim 38-year-old who heads the international stock department for Nippon Life.
 
Overnight Losses
Every night they go to bed with the prospect that if the dollar declines just one yen on currency markets while they sleep, they can suffer tens of millions of dollars in losses in their American investments before they sit down to their first cup of coffee. They have struggled without success to protect themselves from such swings.
The declines, to be sure, remain paper losses unless the securities are sold. But the concern in Tokyo is that the swings make the value of the overseas portfolios highly unpredictable.
For example, Japan's life insurance companies suffered combined paper losses on their foreign investments equivalent to an astounding $30 billion from 1985 through 1987 because the dollar lost about half its value against the yen.
''We are running out of examples to follow because we are the first investor in world history to have $30 billion of currency risk,'' said Keiji Tsuda, a slight, intense man who has a degree from Duke University and heads Nippon Life's international bond portfolio. ''There may be a system for handling that, but nobody has found it yet. I think it's impossible.''
 
Too Big for Most Markets
Another problem these investors face is that they are simply too big for most of the world's financial markets. Outside of New York, Frankfurt and London, the markets simply cannot absorb the capital the Japanese have to invest.
''Even if we put all the time needed into researching these other markets, we just couldn't invest enough to make it worth our while,'' said Yuya Saijo, a confident 34-year-old who manages a slice of the $14 billion that the Mitsubishi Trust invests abroad.
Mr. Tsuda added: ''We're like a big oil tanker. We can't change direction rapidly, and we can only work in the widest area of the sea.''
Nippon Life and Mitsubishi Trust are two primary repositories of the spectacular wealth that accumulated in Japan during the 1980's because of the country's huge trade surpluses.
In addition to collecting premiums from policyholders, Nippon Life manages corporate pensions. Mitsubishi Trust takes deposits, manages assets for both individuals and corportions, and also oversees corporate pension plans.
 
Largest Single Stock Owner
Huge as their assets are, the official figures understate the real value. Nippon Life, for instance, is Japan's largest single stock owner, holding 3 percent of all shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That stake is worth about $125 billion - about three times the value at which the shares are carried on the insurer's books. The books show what Nippon Life paid for the shares.
It was hard to square the visions conjured up by the unprecedented wealth of these institutions with the scene in the large, open, conspicuously unadorned dealing rooms of Nippon Life and Mitsubishi Trust on several days recently.
In typical Japanese fashion, the senior executives sat at large metal desks, all the same, at the head of parallel rows of other metal desks facing each other under fluorescent lights. They were occupied almost exclusively by men in blue suits, almost all of them young; it was hard to spot a face that looked more than 45 years old and most seemed in their 20's. Women, who generally dressed in identical company outfits, did clerical work and fetched tea.
Japan's financial institutions are so new at international investing because during most of the postwar years the Government hoarded capital at home to rebuild and then modernize Japanese industry.
 
Markets Awash With Surpluses
Insurers and trust banks used most of their capital for making loans to industrial concerns. But with Japan's markets awash in surpluses during the 1980's, the Government liberalized its rules and the institutions began looking to foreign markets.
The executives conceded that they had been remarkably naive in their first big moves overseas.
''Theoretically, the logic was that we could reduce our overall risk by spreading out investments over many different countries,'' explained Tokuo Banba, chief manager of international investments for Mitsubishi Trust's pension fund division. ''But practically speaking, people just looked at the interest-rate differential and thought this was an easy way to get a higher return.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Japanese Rate Surge Felt in U.S.

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
For the first time since Japan became a financial superpower, the market for its Government bonds is playing a critical role in the movement of interest rates in the United States.
Market participants in the United States began to monitor the Japanese market closely only about two weeks ago. Last week, daily increases in Japanese interest rates were followed by a rise in American rates. On Friday, a rally in Tokyo was followed by a rally in the United States. 
Over the last month, long-term interest rates have risen sharply in Japan. As a result, analysts say, the focus on Japan in the American credit markets is likely to remain intense, at least for the next several weeks, even though the market for Japanese Government bonds is only about half as large as the Treasury market. Turning Away From Treasuries? The reasons for the attention are more parochial than global. Because of the run-up in Japanese rates, fears are mounting that Japanese investors will lose their appetite for the new Treasury notes and bonds that will be sold at next month's quarterly refunding auctions.
''It becomes an iffy question about whether or not you buy Treasuries when spreads between Japanese and American interest rates get to the point where they are now,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''I don't know what Japanese investors will do, but they very well may stay away from these auctions. The market has a legitimate thing to be worried about.''
Including the latest run-up, Japan has experienced three sharp increases in rates since 1985. The current one began in mid-December after an aggressive shift in monetary policy amid worries about inflation.
 
A Narrowing Spread
During the current run-up, yields on 10-year Japanese Government bonds have risen by more than a percentage point, to 6.73 percent on Friday. By comparison, late last week yields on the United States Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes stood at 8.23 percent. At those levels, the spread, or difference, between the two issues is about as narrow as it has been in the last 10 years.
In an analysis published in the current issue of Salomon Brothers' weekly ''Comments on Credit,'' the firm's economists note that Japanese rates surged in the fall of 1985 and again in the fall of 1987. But the current rise is different.
''Do I recall a monetary tightening and a sell-off in the Japanese bond market having as dramatic an impact on other markets?'' asked Nicholas Sargen, an international economist at Salomon. ''No.''
Mr. Sargen said fears about inflation in Japan are overblown. Still, he said that further increases in Japanese rates are possible before a substantial downward correction occurs.
''This market has a history of big sell-offs that last for four to six weeks,'' he said. ''Those tend to correct over about the same amount of time.'' Mr. Sargen added that Japan's debt markets could remain unsettled until critical parliamentary elections are held in mid-February, and perhaps longer. 2 Reports Awaited Aside from developments in Japan, two economic reports to be released on Friday could alter the decidedly bearish mood in the credit markets.
Preliminary data on fourth-quarter economic growth and on durable goods orders during December are scheduled to be released. A number of analysts expect that the data may revive the notion that the economy is quite weak.
''I think that output was flat in the fourth quarter,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank, ''and it would appear to me that the first quarter is not going to be any better than the fourth. And orders have slowed, and will slow in January as well.''
Despite the recent run-up in interest rates, Mr. Fine said, ''nothing has changed except the timing of the next easing move by the Federal Reserve Board.''
''I still think we will see the overnight Federal funds rate, currently at 8 1/4 percent, down to 8 percent within a month,'' he said.
Because of continued strong demand from retail investors and a light new-issue calendar, the drop in prices of Treasury issues in 1990 has had only a limited effect on tax-exempt municipal bond prices.
Indeed, prices of municipal issues have held up well, even though in the past eight months commercial banks have quietly sold more than $6 billion worth of bonds from their portfolios.
Banks, which have been largely prohibited from buying municipal bonds since the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, have been selling bonds as a way to shrink their balance sheets to shore up capital ratios, as well as taking profits to offset losses in other areas.
Since the bonds that have been sold have been readily absorbed, market analysts said the selling was not yet a source of concern.
 
'Should Be Watched'
Still, ''it is something that should be watched,'' said James F. Lynch, editor of the New York-based Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory, a newsletter that tracks developments in the industry.
''Most of the selling by the banks has been from institutions in the Northeast,'' he said. ''If the region's real estate problems continue to grow, more bonds may be sold, and could become a source of new supply that the market has not been anticipating.''
Still, since banks can deduct 80 percent of the interest costs on bonds they bought before 1986, analysts said there probably would not be much more liquidation of these securities.
''Most banks are holding on to what they have by their fingernails,'' said George D. Friedlander, manager of municipal bond research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
The Bundesbank's Partial Success

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With its aggressive strategy to strengthen the mark, the Bundesbank of West Germany has shown again why it is considered the most skilled of the West's central banks and a primary player in the economic future of Europe. But not everything has gone according to plan.
The mark now stands at its highest level against the dollar in almost two years, thanks to the Bundesbank's interest rate increases all last year, capped by a 1 percent rise in October, and the central bank's surprising dollar-selling two weeks ago, an action that helped send the dollar down by more than four pfennigs. On Friday, the dollar fell to 1.7105 marks, from 1.7150 marks the previous day.
But the Bundesbank has failed so far in its central goal: strengthening the mark against other major European currencies. Even the Italian lira, which was devalued earlier this month, was down by less than 1 percent against the mark last week, and the French franc has appreciated. 
And the central bank's unexpected intervention the first week of the year may have backfired somewhat by being more disruptive than anticipated, analysts say.
 
Keeping the Pressure
Bundesbank officials have made it clear that they intend to keep the pressure on West Germany's European trading partners to devalue their currencies or to slow their economic growth by raising interest rates to maintain parity with the mark. Either move would help the West Germans shrink their record trade surplus with Europe.
The Bundesbank could also still move to raise interest rates another notch if it concluded that this would be useful in a parallel effort to curb the wage increases that will come out of the crucial labor negotiations with metal workers next month.
For the dollar, this strategy means even more downward pressure will be coming, against the mark and other European currencies. This could add to inflation in the United States, as imports become more expensive. And if the stronger mark, along with the promise of the economic opening of Eastern Europe, continues to divert foreign capital from the United States to West Germany and Europe, interest rates here could rise.
 
'Uncooperative Policy'
Some of the analysts contend the Bundesbank is being self-centered, refusing to account for the effect of its policy on the dollar, the United States, Japan and other economies, the European Monetary System or the goal of a single market in Europe.
''From an international point of view, it is a very uncooperative policy,'' said David Morrison, the chief international economist at Goldman,Sachs & Company in London. ''The Bundesbank decided to do what they wanted to, and the rest could lump it.''
But other analysts are less worried. They contend that for now, the strategy is helping the United States, whose Treasury has favored a weaker dollar to help lower the American trade deficit by making imports more expensive and exports more competitive. Norbert Walter, the senior economist at Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt, said, ''I haven't seen much complaint about the Bundesbank moves.''
The Bundesbank strategy is no secret. The central bank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, and members of the Bundesbank board have said they want the mark to be stronger.
 
Opening of Borders
In this effort they have been helped by the opening of Eastern Europe, which has lured investment to West Germany and helped strengthen the currency. The Bundesbank also took advantage of the lowering of interest rates in the United States and the resulting downward pressure on the dollar.
One reason for a stronger mark is the desire of West Germany to make its exports more expensive and thus reduce the trade surplus with its European trading partners. The surplus is growing annually and adding to global trade tensions.
A second reason is the Bundesbank's anti-inflation fight. A stronger mark, in this case against the dollar, makes many of the countries' imports, which are priced in dollars, less expensive.
And another reason is the critical labor talks ahead between industry and the 3.5 million metal workers represented by IG Metall. A new increase in interest rates would give a signal to industry that a generous contract will be more difficult to offset with profits because the economy will not be growing as fast.
 
Realigning the System
The Bundesbank contends that the best way to achieve its strategy is through realigning the European Monetary System, which could be forced by a strengthening mark. Such an adjustment would devalue the other currencies in the system, including the French franc.
But the Bundesbank has been frustrated in this goal because its trading partners, especially France, and members of the West German Government do not want a realignment. The French Government has been willing to push up interest rates along with the West Germans, keeping the franc in line with the mark and slowing the French economy to maintain its anti-inflation policy.
The West German Government does not like the idea of a realignment now because it could slow the movement toward monetary union and the fixed exchange rates that are possible after the economic unification of Europe begins in late 1992.
''A realignment of the E.M.S. is not on the agenda because the major players do not want it,'' Mr. Pohl acknowledged recently.
 
Higher Interest Rates
The next best alternative is to maintain pressure by raising interest rates and keeping the mark strong. When countries like France then follow by raising their rates, their economies will be slowed. With slower growth, the West German surplus could be curbed because fewer exports will be bought abroad.
The startling selling of dollars on Jan. 4 was also an effort to keep the mark strong by heading off the rapid appreciation of the dollar on Jan. 2 and 3 and by dampening the idea that the dollar would stage a January rally like it did in 1989. The dollar had risen to 1.7350 marks on Jan. 4, from 1.6910 marks at the end of last year.
The intervention came as the dollar was around 1.73 marks, well within the range of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks believed to be set by the Group of Seven, which includes the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. This intervention is what made the move to push the dollar lower so surprising and raised questions about whether the Group of Seven was setting a new lower range for the dollar.
 
More Effect on Market
John Lipsky, the director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London, said the Bundesbank probably was trying to make sure the market did not think it was acquiescing in a higher dollar, and therefore, a weaker mark.
He said the bank's selling had much more effect on the market than intended because it coincided with large orders to sell dollars, which led to frenzied selling that pushed down the dollar to 1.6785 marks in late trading in New York on Jan 4, from 1.7224 marks on Jan. 3.
The sharp fall caused confusion in the market and more volatility than the Bundesbank would have wanted.
''When the Bundesbank intervened, people felt that it made sense,'' said one official who understands the bank's strategy. ''But you never know the reaction of the market. And, maybe if the Bundesbank had known how the market would react, the position might have been different.''

Super Bowl Nears And Theories Fly

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THERE are just five trading days until the Super Bowl is played, and unless share prices rise this week the outcome could be bad news for San Francisco and for stock buyers.
Or it will be if two Super Bowl indicators work this year, as they did in 1989. One uses the stock market to forecast the results of the football game. The other uses the results of the football game to forecast the stock market. 
There is absolutely no reason to think a football game should have anything to do with the stock market. But while there are thousands of market indicators, many of which make a lot more sense, few are better known on Wall Street than the Super Bowl theory. And it is hard to find one with a better record.
The idea of using the market to forecast the football game is more recent. First mentioned in this column a year ago, it prophesied that if the Dow Jones industrial average rises from the end of November until the game is played, the team whose city falls later in the alphabet will win.
Last year, it correctly predicted that the San Francisco 49ers would beat the Cincinnati Bengals. That gave the indicator a record of being right in 13 of the last 15 years, failing only in 1982 and 1986.
The Dow was at 2,706.27 at the end of November, 28.37 points higher than its close last week. Unless it manages to regain that lost ground this week, the market theory forecasts a win by the Denver Broncos over San Francisco.
The much more widely followed Super Bowl indicator holds that a 49ers victory would be a bullish market indicator, because the San Francisco franchise came out of the old National Football League. A Denver win, on the other hand, would provide a bearish signal, because that team used to be in the American Football League.
Such ideas are, of course, nonsense. Still, proponents of the theory note that in measuring market performance from Super Bowl to Super Bowl, the theory has failed after only 2 of the 23 Super Bowl games. Those failures came after the games in 1970, when a Kansas City (A.F.L.) win was nevertheless followed by a rising year for stocks, and after the 1987 win by the New York Giants, when the October market crash decimated stock prices.
It is, of course, a hallmark of the indicator invention game to change the indicator's rules to produce as good a record as possible. Both of the failures of the Super Bowl theory can be finessed away by a simple June rule. In each of the years it failed, it worked from the Super Bowl through the end of June. In 1970, the market was down 14 percent from Super Bowl time through June; in 1987, there was a 15 percent rise over that period.
So the newest version calls for following the indicator and cashing out at the end of June if it worked, while waiting for the next Super Bowl if the market is down as of June. If that does not work this year, no doubt someone will come up with another modification to prove that in retrospect it really worked again.
One reason for the popularity of the Super Bowl theory is that in recent years the old N.F.L. teams have dominated the game, having won 5 in a row coming into this week's showdown, and 12 of the last 15. For understandable reasons, Wall Street prefers bullish indicators that might persuade customers to buy stocks.
The good news for the bulls is that there are other indicators of a more conventional if less popular nature that may show prices are ready to bounce. By last Tuesday, options players were signaling a rarely seen sort of bearishness, said Bernard Schaeffer, a principal in the Investment Research Institute in Cincinnati, which has a service for traders called Market Intelligence Fax. The volume in put options, a way to bet on lower prices, exceeded 95 percent of the volume in calls, a bullish play, over three trading sessions ending Tuesday. Normally, far more calls are traded.
From the beginning of the 1982 bull market, Mr. Schaeffer said, options investors have been that negative only three times, on June 15, 1984; Sept. 13, 1985, and Dec. 4, 1987. Within a month of each of those dates, stock prices exploded upward.
''It's an extreme in negative sentiment by a group of traders who tend to be quite emotional and quite wrong at turning points,'' he said.
Not all sentiment indicators are that extreme, and there are indications that professional money managers, in contrast to options speculators, are talking a more negative game than they are playing. Just back from talks with West Coast money managers last week, a Morgan Stanley & Company strategist, Byron Wein, described the managers as ''apprehensive and kind of bearish on the market, but fully invested,'' and compared them to a person carrying a large cash deposit to the bank, fearful that a mugger lurks in every shadow.
Nonetheless, Mr. Wein remains among the shrinking band of bulls, arguing that the next surprise to hit Wall Street will be a realization that the economy is not as bad as many think, and that profits will be better.

HEADLINE: New Rules Forcing Cuts by Builders

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Most housing analysts concluded months ago that fewer first-time home buyers, a slowing economy and rising land and development costs would curb home construction this year and next. But builders in many regions are starting to slash operations even more deeply than they had planned, because of tough new lending policies Congress forced on savings and loan institutions in August.
The regulations came in response to past abuses and mismanagement in the savings industry, which has suffered hundreds of failures in recent years, prompting the Government to undertake a rescue that may ultimately cost $300 billion.
Analysts have said that much of the fraud-related losses stemmed from lending for land purchases and development of housing. 
As a result, a wave of caution has spread to hundreds of commercial banks. In several interviews here, where the National Association of Homebuilders is winding up its annual convention, developers glumly recounted stories of bankers reducing or halting new lending for land purchases and housing development.
By all accounts, the most turmoil has stemmed from a new rule that bars savings institutions from making loans equal to 15 percent or more of their capital to a single borrower. Before Congress approved the new laws, the limit was 100 percent of capital.
 
Limit Is 'Pretty Scary'
''The lending limit at the thrifts is pretty scary,'' said Alvin T. Schwartz, president of the Double S Companies, a home builder in northern Delaware. Mr. Schwartz said he will build 150 homes this year, compared with 200 in 1989.
In other changes, savings institutions must raise their capital to 6 percent of total deposits by 1993. Perhaps as many as 2,000 institutions expect to meet that standard, but many plan to do it by letting their deposits shrink and cutting back on new loans.
Savings and loans are also barred from investing any of their equity in real estate projects - a practice that became common in many areas after the Federal Government deregulated the industry in 1982.
That rule change has hit hardest in California, Oregon and Washington, where many large institutions with considerable capital often joined with builders to finance and develop home construction. The Western states are expected to show the strongest demand for new housing in the next two years, and considerable demand is also predicted in the Midwest, economists told the builders.
 
Congress Seen Moving Slowly
Despite the mounting complaints of home builders, Congress seems unlikely to move quickly to ease the new lending standards. Public opinion could, however, swing in favor of the builders after a few years if prices and apartment rents escalate, said Barbara Alexander, a managing director and housing analyst at Salomon Brothers.
A recession in the housing industry that could cut housing starts by 100,000 a year would either arrest price declines for existing homes or push prices higher in many parts of the country, Ms. Alexander said.
She said such a shift in prices would eventually be likely to persuade voters and Congress to heed the home builders' call for more liberal lending rules. But that would probably not occur for at least three years, she said.
In a speech to the builders, Ms. Alexander estimated that housing starts, including single-family homes and apartment buildings, will average 1.2 million a year through 1994, or 500,000 below what the industry would have produced without the lending constraints.
The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that housing starts fell 8 percent in 1989, to 1.37 million, the lowest level in seven years.
 
Lower Estimates Expected
Many economists had predicted that new starts would be flat to slightly higher in the next few years. But some economists told reporters at the convention that they were likely to lower their estimates because of recent rises in interest rates and the financing difficulties of builders.
Ms. Alexander said a large company typically needs to borrow $140 million to finance a 1,000-unit development with an average sale price of $200,000 for each home. Under the new rules, only about 15 savings institutions are large enough to be allowed to make a $50 million loan to a builder, she said.
''We are hearing increasing reports from builders, including some very large companies, that are having problems'' obtaining loans, she said. She said one California bank, which she did not name, will only make loans based on conservative appraisals set at 1987 prices. Her remark drew gasps from some in an audience of more than 200.
That approach means builders must put more equity into new projects to keep pace with land costs, fees imposed by local governments and other expenses that have risen sharply since 1987.
 
Builders' Thirst for Funds
William C. Apgar, head of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said that in time the financial system would close the gap in meeting the builders' thirst for funds. He said nearly 12 million housing units would be constructed during the decade, down slightly from the 13 million of the 1980's.
With many private investors also wary of real estate financing, particularly in the Southwest and parts of the Northeast, some builders are looking to individuals and financial institutions in Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Canada and elsewhere for loans and equity.
A survey conducted earlier this month by Ernst & Young, the big accounting firm, indicated that 30 of the nation's 100 largest home builders had borrowed recently from abroad. Patrick M. Schaefer, a partner in the firm's Dallas office, said developments in the mid-Atlantic states had obtained the most foreign money.
One builder in Southern California, Jim Deane, said four Japanese investors are backing his new housing development in Riverside, about 90 miles east of Los Angeles.
Mr. Deane cautioned builders that it took three years to cultivate his ties with the Japanese partners and that any land deals or projects requiring quick action were not part of the discussions.

HEADLINE: U.S. Set to Ease High-Tech Curb On Eastern Bloc

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Under intense pressure from American business and Western European allies to relax curbs on exports of high technology to Eastern Europe, the Bush Administration said today that it would work toward opening the door.
The change could open markets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to American companies, especially for those that make computers and telecommunications equipment.
The decision on a softer line was recommended Friday by a committee of the National Security Council, which has been debating the matter since the third week of December.
''Obviously, it's a reaction to changes in Eastern Europe, and obviously it's because we want to continue to support those changes,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said today. 
The relaxation announced today does not affect curbs against technology transfers to the Soviet Union. The American proposal includes safeguards, including spot inspections, intended to insure that the Eastern European countries do not ship the technology on to Moscow.
These countries would be offered roughly the same degree of freedom to acquire Western technology as now applies to China, a senior American official said.
The proposal will be the basis of the American negotiating position at a meeting in Paris next month of the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom.
Some analysts said the American proposals for safeguards might draw objections from other Cocom members.
The Administration had been resisting calls for looser trade rules, as the American military warned that any relaxation could enable Moscow to divert technology to its military and become a stronger potential adversary.
The plan calls for the easing to take place in stages and to affect first Hungary and Poland, then East Germany and Czechoslovakia, and finally Rumania and Bulgaria, the senior Administration official said.
No details were disclosed, but American officials said the new approach would allow the sale of computers two and three times as powerful as those now approved for export to the East bloc.
 
Eased Military Threat
Noting an apparently eased military threat from the Soviet Union, Mr. Fitzwater called the decision ''a prudent change that will not jeopardize critical strategic interests.''
The decision has the blessing of President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, one top Administration official said.
A proposal before Cocom that is now likely to go forward is a bid by U S West, the regional telephone company based in Denver, to build a cellular telephone system in Hungary, one official said, Industry Is Glad An industry group that has been among the most ardent backers of easing the policy was encouraged by the Administration's decision. ''We're glad that they finally succumbed to Cocom pressure and put a significant proposal on the table,'' said Debra L. Waggoner, manager of international trade policy for the 3,500-member American Electronics Association.
In addition to computers and telecommunications equipment, rules on exports of machine tools would be loosened. Machine tools cut or shape metal parts used in an array of products, from appliances and vehicles to aircraft and construction materials.
Much of the additional business in machine tools is likely to go to West German, Italian and Japanese companies, which hold competitive advantages over American companies.
Britain's Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Nicholas Ridley, in a conversation with a small group of reporters, said he was delighted that Cocom would soon discuss the proposed liberalization. Eventually, he said, Eastern European countries might be able to trade with the West ''the way Britain trades with the United States.''
 
Technology Trade Rules
Cocom, which was formed 41 years ago at the height of the cold war, includes all the Western European nations except Iceland, as well as Japan and Australia. It tries to adopt uniform rules covering transfers of technology to Communist countries.
Traditionally, the United States has been the most reluctant Cocom member on liberalizing trade. Its allies, led by West Germany, have warned that with democratization and market-based economics spreading in Eastern Europe, Cocom risks collapse if it does not show more flexibility.
At a meeting of senior officials in Paris in October, the United States was isolated, 16 to 1, in a Cocom vote on easing curbs on machine tools.
The relaxation announced today is linked to the ''establishment of proper safeguards for Western technology,'' said Dennis E. Kloske, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration.
 
Coordinated Position
''We will have a coordinated position with Cocom allies which will assure that we have a common policy towards Eastern Europe,'' he added.
Under the new American approach, to qualify for the more advanced technology Eastern European countries will need to adopt legal and administrative frameworks for protection of the technology against diversion. The United States would seek to advise on the safeguards.
American officials said they would insist on spot-inspection certification by the governments of the users of the products.
But some analysts see these demands as possible sticking points at next month's Cocom meeting. ''The allies may consider these demands too onerous,'' said Paul Freedenberg, a former top Commerce Department export control official and now a trade lawyer in Washington.
On the other hand, what is said to be continued close linkage between military and security services of the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies has raised questions about the effectiveness of efforts to keep the technology out of Soviet hands.
''There are people within these governments who will be actively subverting the assurances,'' said Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based research group opposed to liberalization.

For the first time in 14 years, spending on corporate research and development in the United States has not even kept pace with inflation, raising concerns that the nation is lagging in its efforts to hold a competitive edge in high technology.
Many economists and corporate research executives say the decline is particularly troubling because, at the same time, research money is increasingly being shifted from basic research to development of specific products, reducing the chances of fundamental breakthroughs.
What is more, they say, a smaller portion of research is being done in large laboratories, where resources can be pooled, limiting the opportunity for significant advances.
 
Report to Be Released
The decline will be reported in a survey by National Science Foundation economists to be released within a week. The report will show that although spending rose to $68.8 billion in 1989 from $66.5 billion in 1988, when adjusted for inflation the change represents a decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent, the first drop since 1975. 
Economists and corporate research directors say the portion of research money spent on basic research, as opposed to product development, has been falling from its historical level of approximately 10 percent in many industries.
The decline in United States corporate research spending, which follows several years of slowing growth, has been attributed to a variety of factors. They include higher interest rates, which have made it more expensive to raise money for research; an increasing focus by corporate managers on short-term profitability, and the cost-cutting that accompanies corporate restructurings, mergers and leveraged buyouts.
 
Effect of Takeover Era
The era of hostile takeovers has reshaped corporate thinking on research and development, said William J. Spencer, the Xerox Corporation's executive vice president for research and development. ''We've moved from research and development as being a corporate asset to where it's what a corporate raider looks for first,'' he said. ''They can make significant cuts and get cash flow. I haven't seen a takeover yet where they increased research and development activities.''
Research spending is crucial to assuring that corporations develop innovative products and bring them to market quickly. Since World War II American corporate research and development programs have created a remarkable variety of advanced products and technologies, including the transistor, drugs, lasers and advanced jet aircraft.
But now, ''Research and development is becoming less prominent in American companies exactly at the time when it should be becoming more prominent,'' said Charles F. Larson, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, a Washington group that represents the research centers of major corporations. He said such spending should rise if the United States was to remain competitive with other nations.
 
Japanese Keep Spending
Experts say Japanese companies, flush with cash, keep increasing research spending at a brisk rate. As of 1987, the most recent year for which comparative figures are available, the growth of research and development spending among Japanese companies was more than three times that for United States companies, statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show.
In this country, there is no general agreement that restructurings have been bad for research. Some scholars and corporate research managers argue that the decline may instead represent increasing efficiency by research laboratories. They say there is no definitive link between merger activity and the falloff in spending on research.
Economists say the experience of Xerox illustrates the problem of companies that find it difficult to translate spending on basic research into profits quickly.
Xerox, under pressure from its Japanese copier competitors and in danger of being acquired by a hostile bidder, has reduced its research in basic physical sciences by roughly a third. It has transferred scientists to work in systems and software - research areas that are likely to have an immediate product payoff. Previously, the money was going toward research in basic semiconductor physics; such research might have yielded advances toward denser, faster chips that could have run a new generation of computers.
Xerox's increased emphasis on product development reflects its frustration with basic research in the last two decades. Attempting to enter the computer industry during the 1970's and 1980's, Xerox pioneered basic computer science research at its research center in Palo Alto, Calif.
The research produced significant advances, including an experimental computer language, an easier-to-use computer interface and basic technology permitting computers to communicate with one another. But many of the scientists doing this basic research later left the company to start a wide range of businesses based on those developments at Xerox.
 
Expanding Xerox Ideas
Companies like Apple Computer, Adobe Systems and Grid Computer have all built sizable businesses based on ideas pioneered at Xerox. Meanwhile, Xerox itself could never successfully translate the fruits of its research into products to make it a significant force in the computer industry.
But not everyone at Xerox is happy about its shift away from basic research. ''The premier laboratories in the country are all under pressure,'' Dr. Spencer said. ''If this continues we won't have laboratories where a transistor, laser or superconductor can be invented any longer. Instead people will tend to get pulled into product development.''
The Eastman Kodak Company, long a leader in research, reorganized in 1986, shrinking its central laboratory and transferring its work into operating divisions. Previously, research had been organized by scientific disciplines, like physics and chemistry.
Now it is organized along product lines, like photography and data storage. And the company's research and development spending fell to $992 million in 1987 from $1.06 billion in 1986; it rose in 1988 because of the acquisition of Sterling Drug.
The downturn in corporate spending on research is even more alarming to some economists and researchers because of extensive cuts expected in military spending, which has historically provided the largest part of Federal financing for research. The integrated circuit, which controls all modern electronics products, was developed in the late 1960's as part of a military program to squeeze more electronics into the nose cone of the Minuteman missile.
 
Military Applications
And, like many companies, the Pentagon has shifted the money it still provides away from basic research and more toward work that can be directly related to military applications, research executives said.
''There's clearly a shift away from the kind of funding that resulted in great ideas in the 60's and 70's,'' said Samuel Fuller, who heads research and development at the Digital Equipment Corporation. He said entire lines of products, from the personal computer to the engineering work station, grew out of basic computer-science research financed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a small Pentagon office.
As a consequence of the changes in Pentagon spending, he said, American universities, which have been expected to take up the slack in basic research as corporate researchers have moved toward product development, may increasingly find that they are starved for money.
Economists say that shifting money back to basic research from product development may be less profitable for a company but more useful for the nation as a whole. As one example, the discovery, during basic research at the International Business Machines Corporation, of materials that conduct electricity without resistance at higher temperatures may lead to important advances in energy transmission, computing and transportation. But it will not be immediately profitable to I.B.M.
 
'The Most Value'
''From the point of view of the country, basic research has the most value,'' said Kenneth Flamm, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''But it's also the most difficult to turn into profits for an individual company.''
Economists say the downturn in research spending indicates that a steadily worsening national trend shows no sign of reversing. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, corporate research and development spending increased dramatically. Since rising at an average annual rate of 12.7 percent between 1976 and 1985, the growth rate has steadily declined.
''We ought to regard these statistics as warning flares,'' said Roland W. Schmitt, president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and formerly senior vice president for science and technology at the General Electric Company.
The trend may be only part of the problem. In recent years, as the emphasis has shifted to product development, many of the foremost research laboratories in the United States have lost some of their effectiveness. Some research managers are concerned that this will mean less basic research and therefore fewer breakthroughs.
 
Effect of Bell Breakup
For example, the breakup of the Bell System in 1984 has reduced the size and, some argue, changed the focus of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's prestigious Bell Laboratories. Some economists argue that Bell Labs has cut back significantly on basic research as a result of the divestiture. But A.T.&T. officials dispute this charge, saying the laboratory has not lost its influence in the six years since the breakup.
The purchase of RCA by the General Electric Company has resulted in the scaling back of the David Sarnoff Laboratories, which did much pioneer research in television. The lab was donated to SRI International. At the same time, G.E. has cut spending on basic research and development, and company-financed research as a whole remained flat at $1.2 billion in 1987 and 1988, the latest years for which figures are available.
To be sure, some American companies, many of them in highly competitive industries, have continued to increase their research budgets.
At I.B.M., for example, research spending increased by about 10 percent last year, to about $5.5 billion, and at the Hewlett-Packard Company, such spending was up almost 20 percent.
But I.B.M.'s head of research and development, Dr. John Armstrong, said that as a result of increasing competition the company has been changing the way it does research to support product development more closely.
 
'Traditional View'
''The traditional academic view is that first you do basic research, then applied research, then product development, then give it to manufacturing,'' he said. But he said the Japanese had been so effective at rapidly translating research into successful commercial products that I.B.M. had been forced to try to generate new products more quickly.
Hewlett-Packard executives said their focus in research had shifted because the increasing speed of change in the computer and electronic equipment industries meant more money had to go into product development just to keep up.

HEADLINE: PLOT ON BUSH'S JET POSSIBLE, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
United States intelligence has picked up indications that Colombian drug traffickers may be planning to attack President Bush when he visits the city of Cartagena next month for a four-nation meeting on narcotics, Administration officials said tonight.
The officials confirmed the substance of a report by CBS News, which said there were ''growing reports'' that the Colombian cocaine cartels had obtained shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles and were planning to use them in an attack on Air Force One.
Other Administration officials who were contacted tonight declined to confirm specifically whether the Soviet-made SAM-7 weapons were being smuggled into Colombia, as CBS reported. But they did not dispute the general accuracy of the broadcast. 
 
Available on Black Market
One official noted that such weapons were readily available on the black market.
Asked about the reports, Michael Skol, the senior State Department official in charge of relations with Colombia, said, ''I can't comment on that.''
Mr. Skol added: ''The President is going to Colombia. You can quote me on that.''
Mr. Bush is to visit Cartagena for several hours on Feb. 15 to discuss anti-narcotics efforts with the Presidents of Colombia and Bolivia and a representative of the Peruvian Government.
The Secret Service takes extensive precautions to protect the President as a matter of routine whenever he travels, and officials have said that these measures will be even more extraordinary for the Cartagena visit.
''The Service has assured us repeatedly that they are confident they can protect the President in Colombia,'' one official said tonight. ''They have checked out every report and gone over the arrangements repeatedly.''
CBS News said there had been ''a growing number of intelligence reports'' that SAM-7 missiles had been smuggled into Colombia ''for an attempt to shoot down Air Force One as it lands at Cartagena.''
 
Some Reports Dismissed
The network said some of the intelligence reports ''are dismissed by intelligence officers as attempts by informants to curry favor with law enforcement officials.''
CBS News quoted unidentified United States officials as saying they were confident they could thwart any effort to shoot down Air Force One, since the SAM-7 is a relatively unsophisticated weapon and Mr. Bush's plane is equipped with electronic devices intended to throw such missiles off course.
But it said the Secret Service was considering ''other ways of bringing the President into Colombia.'' It did not say what those methods were.
According to Administration officials, one early plan for the conference called for Mr. Bush to fly into a heavily guarded military airfield with military aircraft escorts and then to fly under equally heavy guard to an isolated Colombian naval station where the conference would take place.

HEADLINE: Cardinal Szoka Leaving Detroit for Vatican

 BODY:
Edmund Cardinal Szoka of Detroit announced yesterday that he would be resigning as the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Detroit to take up new duties in June, heading the Vatican's budget office.
At a news conference in Detroit, the Cardinal said he was acting at the request of Pope John Paul II, who is believed likely to name a successor for the Detroit archdiocese in the spring. It is the fifth largest archdiocese in the United States.
Cardinal Szoka ordered 30 parishes closed last year, but Detroit church officials deny that the action indicated that the archdiocese was in straits.
The Cardinal said the action was primarily due to shrinking congregations and low religious activity rather than insolvency.
He will be president of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See, which compiles and oversees the budgets of all Vatican offices and agencies and investigates abuses.
The Prefecture exercises no direct authority over the Vatican Bank, but Cardinal Szoka is a member of a council of cardinals who supervise the bank.

HEADLINE: Final Score on Panama

 BODY:
President Garcia of Peru refuses to meet with President Bush on drug issues . . . Colombia discourages the U.S. Navy from patrolling its coasts . . . Mexican and Venezuelan leaders stiff-arm Vice President Quayle. Has the Bush Administration relieved its Noriega headache at the cost of paralyzing itself elsewhere in Latin America? Not necessarily. But recovering Latin good will will require renewed attention to the style and substance of several sensitive issues. 
Before the Panama invasion, the Bush Administration worked hard to smooth U.S.-Latin American relations. One big reward was cooperation on drugs, symbolized by next month's drug summit meeting in Bogota. Latin leaders sensed that Mr. Bush was prepared to help them stand up to the political consequences of confronting traffickers.
Then came Panama. The invasion was justifiable under the circumstances, but no occasion for preening or pride. The resort to force represented a failure of U.S. policy on several levels.
For years, assorted U.S. agencies put misplaced trust in General Noriega. Their folly made it easier for the general to entrench himself, sell protection to drug traffickers and thwart later U.S. efforts to dislodge him. Those efforts, under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, all misfired. Reluctantly, a cautious President approved a drastic course he knew carried major diplomatic costs.
Still, Latin leaders seemed to recognize Panama as a special case, not a return to the Bad Neighbor Policy of the past. The U.S. had first gone to the O.A.S., with disappointing results. Panama marked a failure of Latin diplomacy, too. Had Mr. Bush defined his goals narrowly, kept U.S. troops in a low profile and stressed a quick return of authority to Panamanian hands, regional relations might have quickly recovered. Instead, U.S. commanders have shown stunning diplomatic insensitivity. Then, the Navy was ordered to patrol Colombia's coast without formal Colombian approval.
Latin leaders face acute problems. Most have little taste for Yanqui-bashing. They'd rather cooperate with Washington on debt, drugs and problems of democratic transition. Mr. Bush would do well to promote such cooperation, in non-military ways: Argentina and Brazil need economic and political reinforcement as they attempt economic adjustments as drastic as any in Eastern Europe. Chile's new Government needs diplomatic backing as it tries to bring institutions under civil control. Peru faces perils as it holds a presidential election amid guerrilla and drug violence, death squads and hyperinflation. Colombia needs help sustaining its non-drug exports, like coffee, if it is to continue resisting truce offers from the Medellin cartel.
Panama was neither a famous U.S. victory nor a regional diplomatic disaster. The President's final score depends on what he does now about enduring questions in Latin America.

No Shortage of Ideas

 BODY:
In 1988, American workers dropped 1,010,889 ideas into their suggestion boxes, according to the National Association of Suggestion Systems. Their bosses adopted more than 293,000 of those ideas, roughly 29 percent, and thereby saved $2.2 billion. 
Impressive numbers? Not compared with Japan. The Human Relations Association there says Japanese companies with worker-suggestion programs average more than 2,000 ideas per 100 workers. In America, it's only 13 per 100. What's more, 80 percent of Japanese suggestions are adopted.
Japanese and U.S. statistics aren't directly comparable because the systems differ. Japan's employers actively encourage involvement; employee discussion groups are more common. Trifling suggestions are welcomed - and get trifling awards. American business focuses on ideas for big improvements, with big awards. Differences notwithstanding, there's a message: The greater the workers' involvement, the sharper the competitive edge.

HEADLINE: Out of the Welfare Roll and Into the Soup Kitchen, Albany Style

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Cesar A. Perales, New York State's Commissioner of Social Services, recently issued a press release celebrating a drop in the welfare rolls to their lowest levels since 1968. His department attributes this drop to a stronger economy and successful programs to get welfare recipients back to work.
Mr. Perales neglects to mention that this plunge in the welfare rolls has been accompanied by an explosion in emergency food program use. In 1980, it is estimated, there were 50 food pantries and soup kitchens statewide; today there are more than 2,500. Food pantries serve 400,000 families each month; 1 million meals are served in soup kitchens each month. 
Contrary to Mr. Perales's assertion, the Department of Social Services has no statistical evidence to demonstrate that welfare numbers are down because people are entering employment as a result of any of its job-training programs. Where studies of employment and training programs are done, the findings indicate only a slight difference in entry to employment between people who participate in the program and control groups who don't.
Furthermore, the department acknowledges that only one-third of what it has saved in welfare grants through its comprehensive employment program is accounted for by employment. A full two-thirds results from sanctions placed on clients who failed to comply with complicated, confusing program requirements. What the state saves means a reduction in the income of public assistance families, forcing them to rely on food pantries and soup kitchens to feed their children. Seventy percent of all people on public assistance are children.
A second problem is that many people who get a job still live below the poverty level. A woman with two children would have to earn nearly $5 an hour to keep her family at the poverty level. Yet the Department of Social Services makes no effort in its job-training programs to insure that the jobs people are trained for pay decent wages, offer medical benefits and provide job security. They will not allow recipients to get a college degree.
The department has no information on the rate of pay clients are receiving when they leave the welfare rolls, and it does not track them after they leave the rolls to find out how long they are able to stay off. Nearly half of all jobs created between 1979 and 1985 paid poverty-level wages. If welfare recipients are going into these jobs, they will also need a food pantry or soup kitchen to feed their family. The minute a medical problem or some other crisis arises, they will return to the welfare rolls.
Mr. Perales should not boast about lowering the rolls yet. His constitutional duty as the Commissioner of Social Services is to insure the provision of aid, care and support to the needy. The purpose of the aid to families with dependent children program is to provide financial assistance and care for children and to help their caretakers attain self-support. When Mr. Perales can demonstrate that he is meeting these needs, instead of shifting the cost of feeding people onto the food pantries and soup kitchens, we will be among the first to congratulate him.

HEADLINE: American Wheat Habit Was Killing Nigeria

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Wheat Rift Splits Nigerians and U.S.'' (news article, Dec. 31) merits a bit of additional background information so that readers may better understand the dispute.
The countries of sub-Saharan Africa have been plagued with the slowest rates of economic growth of any area of the globe, and their economies are overburdened with international debt that they can never hope to repay in full. Their ability to purchase the vital capital inputs to keep their economies from slipping further backward is seriously restricted by their increasing difficulty in earning foreign exchange, and for years development economists have urged them not to squander it on unnecessary imported consumer goods. Politically, such reforms are difficult to implement, and when African leaders have occasionally undertaken to follow such advice, it has been at considerable risk. 
The Nigerian Government finally summoned up the courage to impose a ban on the importation of wheat, a commodity that does not thrive well in Nigeria, but has become a popular ingredient in the Nigerian diet because it has for many years been made available by the United States at attractive prices. As you point out, Nigeria had become the sixth largest market for American wheat imports, which were fast becoming a major absorber of Nigeria's scarce foreign exchange earnings.
The Nigerian population was becoming hooked on wheat, creating the specter of a permanent dependence on imports for its basic food staple by this largest of the African countries.
Not only were vitally necessary capital goods imports sacrificed, but Nigeria's efforts to build a measure of economic independence were also blatantly undermined by this increasing consumption of imported wheat. President Ibrahim Babangida's decision to demand that his people ''eat only what we can grow ourselves'' was a wise and courageous move, and we should offer our full moral support to him for making such a politically risky structural adjustment.
Instead, the Bush Administration is apparently threatening to retaliate against him in some manner. You suggest that the Administration is placing responsibility for its negative posture on Congress, arguing that Nigeria is discriminating against United States imports and is therefore in violation of American law. Although the facts are not all in, the Administration's case is not persuasive. The farm lobby will certainly be unhappy to lose these sales, but there is no basis for charging discrimination if the ban applies to all wheat imports, not just those from America.
Africa is suffering from a greater range of problems than any other area of the world, and its leadership is not always as farsighted as its friends would like it to be. Certainly we should applaud it when Africa makes the right decision, even if that imposes some inconvenience upon ourselves.

Insufficient Funds

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
The building that was once B. Altman stands on Fifth Avenue, solid as a rock, pathetic as an abandoned house. Two women mount the steps and peer inside the glass doors. ''I was on their bridal registry,'' said one sadly.
There are plenty of lessons to be learned when a business fails, lessons about retailing and financing and cash flow. But what shoppers think when they pass the lifeless hulk of what was once one of New York's grand department stores may be something different, something less cerebral, more emotional. 
The sluggishness of the real estate market may illustrate something about interest rates, and the transformation of Bloomingdale's from Trend Central to Chapter 11 is a story of crushing corporate debt. But to those of us who come closest to reorganization when we consolidate our debt on our Visa cards, these things speak to a vulnerability that has been with us for some time. This is a land of diminishing economic expectation. The ground is not solid here. In other parts of the country this has been manifest for years, and not just when the family farms have failed or the oil boom in Texas went bust. In most American small cities and large towns, there was a store like Altman's, the anchor to the downtown, the center of commerce on Main Street. If your father made enough money, you had lunch in the tea room and bought a winter coat with a velvet collar and matching hat there. If you were poor, you dreamed of doing those things.
What you didn't dream was that some day you would come through town and see that big square building boarded up. It often had more to do with the ascendancy of the malls and the suburbs than the national economy, and yet it seemed to the people who lived in those towns as though a part of a prosperous past was gone, the part that believed in passbook savings accounts.
There is, among economists, an equation that determines when a recession exists: two back-to-back quarters of negative growth in the gross national product. One group of economists even has a committee that will sometimes meet for the sole purpose of declaring a recession.
A new New York Times/CBS News Poll shows that 36 percent of the respondents said the economy was getting worse, 11 percentage points more than a little over a year ago. Oddly enough, there's a big difference in pessimism between men and women; 43 percent of the women said things had gone downhill.
There could be several reasons for that. There's the ''last hired, first fired'' dictum which makes women especially vulnerable to layoffs. The fact that, on average, women workers are still making 70 cents for every dollar a man makes means they also feel inflation more keenly.
But perhaps it is also that women experience the economy on what you might call a reality level. We buy bread. A recession committee meets nearly every week in my neighborhood supermarket, and this is how it works. Someone puts everything on the black rubber treadmill, and when it's all toted up the bill is $20 higher than it was a year ago. At that point, a recession is declared, at least in the mind of one person.
Unscientific, but never forget that science has to share shelf space in all our minds with humanities. Much of our approach to life is anecdotal. When a pretty house down the block wears a sale sign for eight months, and when we hear that it finally sold for $30,000 less than the asking price, we feel, not that our neighbor has a problem, or our neighborhood, but that the economy does.
When he was running for President, Ronald Reagan asked Americans whether they were better off than they were four years before. That's not the question I would ask today. Ask 30-year-olds whether they are better off than their parents were at that age. For that small slice known as the upper middle class, the ones with second homes and interesting portfolios, the answer is probably yes.
But for all those young men and women who thought that $25,000 a year would buy a house and now know that it will barely buy a car, the answer is clearly no. That is based, not on economic formula, but on the way we feel about our lives. The people who stop for a minute to look at the facade of B. Altman, the people who still experience a twinge when they drive down Main Street and see the department store where their first suit was purchased now a shell, do not necessarily know the numbers. They know the feeling.

HEADLINE: Man Held in Beating Death of Homeless Man After Subway Fight

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

 BODY:
A 39-year-old unemployed plumber, punched and spat at by a homeless man while standing on a subway platform Sunday night with his 3-year-old son, beat the vagrant so badly that he died a few hours later, the transit police said.
The police charged the man, Rodney Sumter of 2991 Frederick Douglass Boulevard in Washington Heights, with first-degree manslaughter.
The homeless man was described as a black male, about 6 feet tall, in his late 50's, by a transit police officer, Randall Berry. Officer Berry said the man had a reputation for harassing and spitting at passers-by. The man was a ''regular'' at the subway station at Columbus Circle and 59th Street, where the incident took place, Albert O'Leary, a transit police spokesman said. 
The confrontation occurred at 11:30 P.M. as Mr. Sumter and his son, Patah, returning from seeing ''Back to the Future II,'' waited on the platform for the northbound A train.
 
The Man Pursued Him
Witnesses told the police that the homeless man approached Mr. Sumter and spat at him. When Mr. Sumter tried to move down the platform the homeless man pursued him and punched him above the left eye, Mr. O'Leary said. Mr. Sumter then punched the man, knocked him to the platform, kicking him and slamming his head onto the platform.
It was not clear whether the homeless man had continued to fight while down on the platform.
A train supervisor spotted the fight and alerted the transit police. They arrested Mr. Sumter on the platform, where he was comforting his son, who was crying. The homeless man was taken to Roosevelt Hospital and died shortly after midnight, Mr. O'Leary said. The medical examiner's office had not reviewed the case yet.
The boy was picked up at 1 A.M. at a transit police command post at the subway station by his mother, Michelle Sumter.
 
Provocation Studied
Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney, said the charge of first-degree manslaughter was based on the slamming of the homeless man's head onto the platform. She said her office was still investigating what provoked Mr. Sumter's reaction.
''Mr. Sumter is alleged to have taken John Doe by the face area and slammed his head to the platform and kicked John Doe on the side of his head while he was down,'' Ms. Roche said. ''That in and of itself constitutes manslaughter.''
Mr. Sumter was to be arraigned last night. The transit police said he had no prior arrest record.
The case could pose difficult questions in the judicial process. Robert Pitler, who teaches criminal law at the Brooklyn Law School, said Mr. Sumter's defense would depend on how easily he could prove that he responded with physical force in order to protect himself.
Physical force can be used against a person, Professor Pitler said, if he needs to protect or defend himself.
''If he was afraid that he was going to be punched again, he had the right to defend himself,'' he said.
But justification defenses are very difficult to prove in cases in which the action happens very quickly.
 
Makeshift Cardboard Tents
''It is difficult to determine what is reasonable and what is not reasonable when everything happens very quickly,'' he explained.
The Columbus Circle train station is a haven for many homeless people who gather in makeshift cardboard tents on its heat grates or huddle in its cavernous cement underground hallways, foraging through the garbage or panhandling on the platforms.
The station has one of the largest populations of homeless people in Manhattan, said George McDonald, the executive director of the Doe Fund, which provides legal help to the homeless.
Some passengers feel threatened, others are sympathetic, annoyed or even lend them assistance. Fights among homeless people over food and money are not uncommon, said Mr. O'Leary. Neither are instances of homeless people being harassed, particularly by groups of teen-agers.
''I don't punch someone in the face unless they deserve it,'' said one 18-year-old subway rider in the station last night, Louis Rivas, of Staten Island. Mr. Rivas said he is regularly harassed by homeless people. ''If someone spits in my face,'' he said, ''I'll beat him up.''

HEADLINE: Troopers Bolstering Hartford Police

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 22

 BODY:
A state plan to help overworked local police departments combat street crime by sending in a little extra muscle from the state police has turned into a fight over jurisdiction, public perception and ruffled pride.
The pilot program, which began last week in a drug-plagued area near downtown Hartford called Frog Hollow, involves only five state troopers and a sergeant, who have been detached for 90 days for uniformed patrols.
But Hartford police union officials, who filed a lawsuit in Superior Court here last week to try to halt the patrols, said the small numbers mask a greater threat. The union officials argue in the lawsuit, which is supported by police unions in eight other towns and cities in Connecticut, that bringing in outside police service is illegal and is the first step in an effort to break the unions by subcontracting police protection. 
Some union officials also say sending for help is an insult to the department and sends a signal to residents that the local officers are not good enough.
 
'Undermines' Effectiveness
''The public perception is going to be that the Hartford police cannot do the job,'' said Stephen F. McEleney, a lawyer for the union. ''That undermines the Hartford police's effectiveness in the community.''
The debate over the plan has taken on political dimensions. For instance, the State Senate minority leader, Reginald J. Smith, a Republican who is running for governor, came out today in support of the police unions, urging that the plan be scrapped. He accused Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat running for re-election, of using the police for ''political grandstanding.''
''This program insults Connecticut's finest,'' he said.
Hartford's Police Chief, Ronald J. Loranger, dismissed the objections to the plan as ''ridiculous.''
''It's just like an extra vitamin B shot, that's all,'' he said. ''We need it. We're just stemming the tide of narcotics in this city.''
Chief Loranger denied that any attempt was being made to break the union and said any damage to department morale or public perception would be caused by the union leaders' remarks, not by the additional officers.
''If they keep saying it, some people are going to start believing it,'' he said.
 
Two Reasons
State and local law-enforcement officials cited two reasons for sending in the state troopers. One is the large increase in drug crimes over the last few years in the state's largest cities. The other is the difficulty that many local police departments are having in recruiting officers in a state that has an unemployment rate of only 3.4 percent.
In 1985, the New Haven police made 573 narcotics arrests, but by 1988, the most recent year for which state figures are available, the number of arrests had increased to 2,365. In Hartford, total arrests increased between 1985 and 1988 from 13,656, to 22,290. Drug arrests rose from 2,360, to 3,241. A spokesman for the Hartford Police Department, Capt. Joe Croughwell, said keeping up with rising crime is only half the battle. Although the department has an authorized strength of 500 officers, it is barely able to keep up with attrition and has only 448 officers now, he said.
 
'Hurting for Officers'
''If you look at the problems we have filling existing vacancies, I really think citizens should be proud of the work we do,'' he said. ''We're hurting for officers.''
But Hartford police union officials said that they believed some vacancies were deliberate and that the department had delayed hiring new recruits to save money. ''If the state has additional money, give it to the municipalities and let them fill these holes,'' said Dennis M. O'Brien, the union president.
The state is paying the $250,000 cost of the trial program, which also began in New Haven last week and will start in Bridgeport soon. After 90 days, the cities and the state police will evaluate the program and determine whether it should be continued or expanded.
Union officials question how much the troopers can achieve in cities they may not know well. Although the 984-member state police force does some muncipal police work in towns too small to have their own police departments, much of the troopers' work is essentially highway patrol duty. Except for occasional undercover narcotics investigations, thet have no jurisdictions in any of the larger cities.
In both New Haven and Hartford, police officials said, the troopers are teamed one on one with regular officers familiar with the neighborhoods.
 
Effort Doubled
A New Haven police spokesman, Lieut. James V. Sorrentino, said the troopers there have all been assigned to a uniformed detail that until last week had only enough officers to cover one neighborhood at a time. The six additional officers doubled the effort, he said, to two neighborhoods at a time.
In Hartford, Chief Loranger said the troopers have been assigned to regular police patrols, working with officers who know the drug gangs and crime patterns in Frog Hollow. He said just getting more uniformed officers on the street - even if the uniforms are a little different - will make a difference in the crime rate.
But Mr. O'Brien of the police union said he believed that the troopers would be ineffective because of their lack of familiarity with the city. ''They don't know our streets and they don't know our criminals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Says Strike By Lawyers Violated Law

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Rejecting free-speech arguments, the Supreme Court ruled today that a group of criminal defense lawyers here violated Federal antitrust law six years ago when the lawyers refused to accept more cases representing indigent defendants until the local government raised their pay.
The two-week strike by the Superior Court Trial Lawyers Association, a group of about 100 lawyers who represented most indigent criminal defendants in the District of Columbia's court system, received widespread publicity and accomplished its goal. The City Council voted to increase the lawyers' fees to $35 an hour, up from the $30 level that had been paid for nine years. 
The strike also attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which accused the organization and its officers of conspiring to fix prices and restrain trade.
Under the Sherman Antitrust Act, such a conspiracy is an automatic violation, regardless of motive or effect on the marketplace. The commission prohibited the lawyers' group from conducting another boycott.
The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the commission, saying the strike was a form of political expression protected by the First Amendment.
The appeals court said that while the Constitution did not give the lawyers immunity under the antitrust laws, the usual rules of automatic liability could not apply. Instead, the appeals court said, the trade commission first had to prove that the lawyers' group had significant market power before it could find them guilty of illegal price-fixing.
Voting 6 to 3 today, the Supreme Court overturned that decision. The Court said the First Amendment elements of the lawyers' action did not entitle them to any special consideration under the antitrust laws.
Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said that while ''reasonable lawyers may differ about the wisdom of this enforcement proceeding,'' nonetheless the ''social justifications'' for the lawyers' action ''do not make it any less unlawful.''
 
Creating a Gaping Hole
Justice Stevens said, ''Every concerted refusal to do business with a potential customer or supplier has an expressive component.'' He said a rule requiring special treatment for economic boycotts of that type ''would create a gaping hole in the fabric'' of the antitrust laws.
The majority opinion, Federal Trade Commission v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers, No. 88-1198, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, while joining portions of the majority opinion, dissented from the majority's conclusion that the First Amendment entitled the lawyers to no special treatment.
Justice Brennan said the majority decision was ''insensitive to the venerable tradition of expressive boycotts as an important means of political communication.''
 
A Central Role
Citing the American colonists' protests against the Stamp Act, as well as the civil rights boycott of the segregated buses in Montgomery, Ala., Justice Brennan said such actions ''have played a central role in our nation's political discourse.''
In his majority opinion, Justice Stevens noted that in 1982 the Court found that the First Amendment shielded black residents of Claiborne County, Miss., from liability for a boycott of white merchants.
He said the difference was that while the black citizens were seeking ''only the equal respect and equal treatment to which they were constituionally entitled,'' the lawyers were seeking economic advantage.
The decision was a substantial victory for the Federal Trade Commission. Lawyers' boycotts are very unusual, but the commission had been concerned that the appeals court's analysis might have for antitrust enforcement actions against doctors and other professionals.

HEADLINE: Dow Tumbles 77.45 to End at 2,600.45

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The stock market yesterday posted its biggest loss since Oct. 13 as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 77.45 points, or 2.89 percent, to 2,600.45.
The Dow has not been below 2,600 since Nov. 7, three weeks after it plunged 190.58 points, or 6.91 percent, on Oct. 13.
But yesterday's selloff was marked by low volume as many individual investors left the field to index futures program traders. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 148.4 million, down from 185.6 million on Friday. Only 267 Big Board issues rose yesterday, compared with 1,336 that declined. The Big Board composite index fell 4.36 points, to 183.20. 
Analysts attributed much of the selling to the flow of poor fourth-quarter corporate profits, as well to the older lament that the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates too high.
''The fact is simply that the market has finally gotten around to paying attention to fundamentals,'' said Hildegard M. Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''While we think the selling was overdone, the fundamentals that provoked today's selloff included poor corporate profits, a toppy Tokyo stock market and, indeed, the belief that interest rates will remain high for sime time.''
Much action centered on program trading, involving the Standard & Poor's index of 500 blue chips and the spot March S.&P. 500 index futures.
At one time toward the close, the March futures were down 11.95, close to the 12-point limit that would have mandated a 15-minute halt in trading the contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. But the March futures recovered to close down 10.80, at 331.50, avoiding the so-called circuit breaker mechanism.
Ms. Zagorski and other analysts were concerned that the spread between the March S.&P. 500 futures and the cash, or actual, index was abnormally close. The actual 500 index closed at 330.38, down 8.77 on the day.
Normally, futures should trade at a premium to the underlying instrument or commodity. How much of a premium depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the remaining life of the contract futures. The spot S.&P. 500 futures will expire on March 16, when all that month's index futures and options and individual stock options expire in what is termed the ''triple witching hour.''
If the program traders and other arbitragers feel the futures are inexpensive relative to the cash market, they will buy the futures and sell the actual shares. Should the spread widen significantly in favor of the futures, they will do the reverse.
William M. LeFevre, a market strategist at Advest Inc., said the index futures changed little in the 15 minutes these contracts are traded after the close of the Big Board. ''You can be sure the program traders will be watching Tuesday morning to see whether the spread between the futures and cash indexes widens or narrows further,'' he said.
 
Japanese Market Up
Although the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-share Nikkei average closed up a strong 420.47 points, or 1.14 percent, at 37,257.01, fears grew that the Japanese equities market was wobbly and that any sustained decline there would influence sentiment in the market here.
Most individual investors, however,will continue to be more concerned with deteriorating corporate earnings, Mr. Lefevre said. ''What they see is more quality companies, such as Quaker Oats and Monsanto, reporting lower fourth-quarter profits and the prospects of still weaker earnings this quarter,'' Mr. Lefevre said.
Quaker Oats fell 2 points, to 51, and Monsanto lost 3 5/8, at 107 5/8. Among other blue chips, Du Pont fell 1 5/8, to 39 7/8. Some analysts said a 3-for-1 stock split of Du Pont, which is one of the 30 blue chips in the Dow, may have caused a bit more volatility in that average.
Among the most actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris fell 1 1/4, to 38, partly in response to a mounting campaign against smoking; A.T.& T. 1 5/8, to 40 1/2; General Electric 2, to 62 7/8; I.B.M. 2, to 96 5/8; Union Carbide 1 5/8, to 20 7/8, and Citicorp 7/8, at 24 5/8.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index fell 5.20, to 360.88. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index plunged 8.94, to 431.94, its lowest level since last May 11, when it stood at 430.63.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Are Down Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of most Treasury notes and bonds continued to slide in lethargic trading yesterday, as dealers focused on coming auctions of securities.
While the impending supply of new issues helped to push down prices of long-term issues, another big drop in equity prices had a steadying influence on short-term interest rates.
''The market is trading a little bit heavy again,'' one government bond trader said. ''With the Refcorp and two-year auctions this week, there is no buying, and no bonds are leaving the Street.'' 
This afternoon the Resolution Funding Corporation is expected to sell $40 billion of 40-year bonds. That auction will be followed tomorrow by the sale of $10 billion worth of two-year Treasury notes. And early next month dealers will be asked to bid on what could be as much as $30 billion of notes and bonds at the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions.
 
No Japanese Influence
Unlike recent sessions, developments in the Japanese bond and equity markets had no influence on trading patterns once activity shifted to the United States.
''All of the ingredients for a good day were there,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The Japanese bond market was stable, their stock market was better and the dollar improved. But nobody is moving off the sidelines to take down bonds at this juncture.''
Market participants also seemed to attach little significance to a decision by the Federal Reserve Board not to conduct open-market operations at a time when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading below the 8 1/4 percent level that is widely perceived by analysts as the Fed's target for the rate.
Funds were trading at around 8 3/ 16 percent at the time the Fed normally conducts open-market operations. The closely watched rate remained at that level for the remainder of the session.
Analysts at MMS International, an economic information service company, noted in their daily market commentary that the ''lack of intervention is a surprise, but is not policy-related,'' adding, ''The softness in the funds rate should only be temporary.''
The slightly lower funds rate did little to aid prices of short-term Treasury issues, even though those securities managed to outperform longer-term notes and bonds.
By late in the day, the 7 5/8 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 99 3/32, up 1/32, to yield 8.13 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.66 percent, down from an average rate of 7.68 percent at last week's sale. Six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.58 percent, up slightly from the average 7.54 percent rate on bills sold a week ago.
Among longer-term securities, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2019 were offered at a price of 98 2/32 late yesterday, down 11/32, to yield 8.30 percent. And the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 14/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.25 percent.
 
Refcorp Yield at 8.50%
The Refcorp 40-year bonds to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.50 percent. Dealers said that about half of the $5 billion issue had been pre-sold.
As the slump in Treasury prices entered its fifth week, dealers were not about to predict the yield levels it would take to spark buying interest. But some said that securities look attractive now.
''We recommend closing your eyes and buying securities at this point,'' said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. Mr. Held added, however, that conditions might not improve until next month.
''You have to get beyond the fears of new supply in the refunding as well as the January producer price and consumer price numbers'' before market participants will feel more confident, he said. ''It's more a function of time than of price level.''
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very sluggish, traders said. Prices of most issues were unchanged to down 1/8 of a point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most issues slipped by 1/8 of a point in thin trading.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Selling Raises Dollar Despite a Plunge in Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday, despite a steep slide in stock prices on Wall Street that would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
Gold prices ended lower. In New York, gold for current delivery fell by $2.80 an ounce, to $407.20, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted an ounce of gold at $408.20, down by $1.80 from late on Friday. 
The dollar benefited from sales of West German marks. Currency dealers sold marks as they weighed the implications of fighting in Azerbaijan in the Soviet Union and the rumors of unrest in Eastern Europe, said John McCarthy, the chief dealer at the New York office of the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank.
But the dollar rally met resistance amid speculation about possible central bank intervention to curb the advance, he said.
Enthusiasm to buy dollars was also tempered in the afternoon as the stock market piled up losses.
''I'm quite surprised the dollar isn't lower, given that the stock market is down a ton,'' Mr. McCarthy said.
 
Average Falls 77.45
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 77.45 points, to 2,600.45. The decline was the Dow's largest one-day point loss since it fell by 190.58 points on Oct. 13.
But a belief that the Federal Reserve Board is unlikely to ease its monetary policy, which the traders said contributed to Wall Street's selloff, fortified the dollar.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 146.51 yen, up from 145.93 yen late on Friday. Against the West Germany currency, the dollar rose to 1.7242 marks, from 1.7105.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6385, from $1.6475 late on Friday. In later New York trading, a pound cost $1.6370, compared with $1.6470 late on Friday.
Of the major currencies, only the Canadian dollar strengthed yesterday against the American dollar.
Other late-dollar rates late yesterday, compared those of late Friday, included: 1.5350 Swiss francs, up from 1.5205; 5.859 French francs, up from 5.8130; 1.18015 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1836, and 1,283.00 Italian lire, up from 1,274.12.
Gold prices eased while silver finished mixed. The late bid for gold in London was $405.25 an ounce, down from $410.25 late Friday, while silver for January delivery rose to $5.268 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.

Attention-Getter
It was good news, bad news at last week's annual meeting of the National Retail Merchants Association here. The good news was that the event finally grabbed the attention the organizers have always insisted it deserved. The bad news was why: on Monday the Campeau Corporation announced that the off-again, on-again bankruptcy filing of its Federated and Allied unitswas definitely on. 
Reporters flocked to interview such industry leaders as Harold E. Sells, the chairman of the Woolworth Corporation, or John M. Belk, the chairman of Belk Stores. But the questions were about Campeau, not about fashion trends.
Throughout a week that in the past has been devoted to glad-handing and cheerleading, ominous words were heard from the speakers' platform. Rosalind Wells, the association's chief economist, pointed out that population and new household growth will slow during the 90's. The result: ''Yearly gains in consumer purchases of department store merchandise will be lower than in past decades.''
The word from William R. Howell, chairman of the J. C. Penney Company, who was elected chairman of the association Wednesday, was worse: ''Today it is accepted that the general merchandiser is a dinosaur,'' he said at the opening session.
 
Service Bandwagon
Most of the retailers were from independent smaller stores rather than the giant chains. In the corridors, lobbies and dining rooms of the New York Hilton and the Sheraton Centre, when they weren't trading titillating Campeau gossip they commiserated about the industry's shared obsession: customer service.
''Everyone is trying to get on the service bandwagon right now,'' said Carmen Monaco, the vice president of Miller's Outpost, a chain of 300 apparel stores based in Ontario, Calif.
''I don't think anybody can get by without price competition,'' remarked Jeff Dahl, co-owner of the Dahl House, a group of 23 women's specialty stores with headquarters in Northfield, Minn. ''But customers shop in stores because they want to shop there. And the stores that do well year in and year out give customer service.''
Once again, electronic point-of-sales equipment and systems were billed as the panacea.
''When we installed POS equipment, it was good for the customer,'' said Allan Dukelsky of the 40-store Strawberry women's apparel chain. ''If we see merchandise that's not selling, we can mark it down and make it more attractive. And the more merchandise we have that is selling enables us to sell everything at cheaper prices.''
Electronics dominated the exibition spaces in both hotels; about half of the 300 exhibitors, a record number for the trade show, set up displays in this category. A retailer browsing through the four floors of exhibits could test out software for inventory control or customer profiling, bar code scanners, security systems and an array of personal computers.
Gone were many of the packaging booths. The hanger and garment bag manufacturers were banished far from the high-tech exhibitors.
 
A Merging of Identities
In any event, this 79th convention was the last for the National Retail Merchants Association.
During the week, the association and the American Retail Federation, another trade group based in Washington, voted to merge. The directors decided not to support two separate organizations with overlapping functions and individual overhead and staff.
So next January the seminars, speeches and trade show may be familiar, but they will be under the auspices of the National Retail Federation, the combination's new name.

HEADLINE: Electronic Teacher: A Mississippi Experiment

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Mississippi, where one of every three adults is functionally illiterate, is embarking on an ambitious experiment in electronic education: put an I.B.M. computer program in every kindergarten and first grade, and try to have every child reading and writing by the end of the first grade.
The experiment, the first effort to use one computer program throughout a state, is backed by two millionaires who put up money on the condition that the state buy computers from the International Business Machines Corporation and use an I.B.M. program called Writing to Read.
While Mississippi is overjoyed with the initial results, some educators say the arrangement raises questions about the economic and political forces at work in efforts to improve the educational system, the proper role of technology in education and the power of business leaders to impose their solutions on schools.
 
A $7 Million Contribution
Part of the money is coming from Richard Riordan, a California philanthropist who had given the same I.B.M. equipment and software to school districts elsewhere and was sold on the results. When an I.B.M. executive suggested that he donate computer programs to an entire state, Mr. Riordan turned to Mississippi and found a partner to share the cost. He and his partner, Richard Dowling, a New York City businessman, contributed a total of $7 million for a five-year program. The state agreed to put up $6 million. 
The gift was seen as manna from heaven by Mississippi, which trails most other states in education spending per pupil, teacher salaries and per capita income. For I.B.M., the gift was a business and publicity windfall. And for educators and computer specialists, it offered an intriguing case study: Are computers the best way to tackle illiteracy? Is I.B.M.'s phonetics-based approach, which teaches reading by sounding out words, the right one? Is it better to use one I.B.M. program statewide or to offer a range of other computer education programs?
Many Mississippians, from Gov. Ray Mabus to teachers and students, rave about the program. So far, 72 computer centers out of a total of 523 have been installed.
 
'They Know More Words'
''They are definitely further along this year,'' said Dorothy Jenkins, a kindergarten teacher at Boyd Elementary School in Jackson. ''They know more words. We've not had children at this stage writing stories before. I believe we're going to see a lot of improvement in this state.''
Advocates of electronic education say computers are infinitely patient, and they can tailor programs to the needs of each student. But educators say computers are no substitute for good teachers or group learning in a classroom.
''The problem with computers in education is that people expect the same kind of wonders that they see in other areas, like medical research,'' said Dr. M. D. Roblyer, author of a book evaluating research on computer-based teaching. ''If they're expecting miracles in Mississippi, they're going to have to try harder.''
 
A Question of Choice
Others question whether a businessman's vision was being imposed on the state because he had the means to make a gift with strings attached.
''It's too bad the teachers in Mississippi weren't given a choice,'' said LeRoy Finkel, coordinator of instructional technology in the San Mateo County Office of Education in California. ''What's just been said to Mississippi is there's only one way to do it.''
Schools may refuse the computers if they wish, but none have so far.
Governor Mabus and Dr. Tom Saterfiel, the interim State Superintendent of Education, said that they did not consider the Writing to Read program the only way to teach and that it was only part of broader educational changes being planned in Mississippi.
''We need to do something dramatic, and this is dramatic,'' the Governor said. ''But it's not the only thing we need to do. If something doesn't click in Writing to Read, you've got to catch them with another teacher, or more time in school.''
 
A Vast Potential Market
Computer education represents a vast potential market. In the 1987-88 academic year, elementary and high schools spent a total of $210 million on educational software, said Natasha Thomsen, an analyst at LINK Resources. She estimated that by the end of 1988 schools had installed 2.5 million computers.
The I.B.M. program is based on the idea that children come to school knowing many more words than they can read or write, and many more than most textbooks teach them in the early grades. By teaching children 42 ''phonemes,'' or letter-sound combinations, and encouraging them to spell words any way they hear them, the program seeks to have children write down words they can say and read what they write. In one-hour daily sessions, children rotate through a series of computers and learning stations.
At the Boyd School in Jackson the other day, Daisy Carter, a kindergarten pupil, put on a headset and began to study her words and sounds for that day. She saw the letters ''VAS'' flash on the computer screen, along with a picture of a vase and its proper spelling. As she heard a voice on the computer say each sound, she repeated it, typed it on the keyboard and then typed the whole word.
Next she moved to a low table, pressed a tape recorder and reviewed the computer lesson in a different way: a taped voice spoke the sounds and letters, and she wrote them down with a pencil in her workbook.
When she finished writing, Daisy walked to another row of computers, where she could write stories on any topic she pleased. After about 15 minutes she shifted again, moving to a ''listening library'' where she heard a tape recording of a book. She ended the session by making words with alphabet tiles.
The children move through the program at their own pace, staying with one set of words until they master it. To encourage the pupils to write without fear of corrections, teachers are told not to correct their unconventional spelling.
 
A Story About Turtles
Sabre Razeyeh, a kindergarten student at Boyd, hunched over the computer, typing intently. ''Wuns epone tim ther woor thre tutith,'' she wrote, beginning her story about three turtles in fairy tale fashion.
Her classmate, Jeffrey Schelver, thanked a college student for writing a poem about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ''Tu store wus grat,'' he typed. ''Thk yuw for rotn tu store to doctr mortn luth kig.''
Mississippi teachers say computers offer children something teachers cannot always provide.
''It reaches all learning styles,'' said Vicki Moore, a first-grade teacher at the West Lauderdale Regional Attendance Center, a rural school in Collinsville, near the Alabama border. ''If somebody learns better by hearing or touching or seeing, they can.''
The results have convinced many teachers and administrators, who concede that they began the school year worried that the program would cut into valuable classroom time.
 
Praise From a Principal
''I felt it was another gimmick,'' said Marvin S. Richardson, principal of the elementary school in Collinsville. ''I have made a complete change. This program is the best supplementary project I've been involved with, but nothing takes the place of a good teacher.''
There are some problems. While children like Sabre and Jeffrey write on the computer, some of their classmates merely play with the keys or write the letters of the alphabet over and over. Some children had a hard time at first understanding the Northern accent of the recorded computer voice. One teacher in Collinsville said several of her students at first thought the voice was saying ''take'' instead of ''type.''
Governor Mabus says he considers Writing to Read just one approach among many. The Governor, a longtime backer of educational change, has called for a $500 million commitment for further improvements. A week ago, however, the State Senate voted down an important source of money for the improvements: a proposed state lottery.
Much of the reaction to I.B.M.'s program depends on how people see the role of the computer in education.
''The most efficient way to do things is computers,'' said Mr. Riordan, a lawyer, investment banker and restaurateur who established the Riordan Foundation in 1969 to fight illiteracy.
 
'You Go In and Make Changes'
''The main thing is, whatever was being done before wasn't working,'' he said. ''If you have a sick company you go in and make changes. If you don't make any changes, it will go under and go bankrupt.''
Many specialists, including Idit Harel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory, and Tom Snyder, a publisher of educational software, say children learn better when they make decisions on a computer and when they can work in groups.
For example, Ms. Harel has worked on a project that encourages children to learn about fractions by writing a computer program that introduces fractions to younger children. Mr. Snyder's software allows a teacher to divide the class into small groups, each at a computer terminal, and take a computer-simulated voyage around the world.
By contrast, the I.B.M. program presents a prescribed course, one that company officials say is necessary to make sure children learn certain concepts.
 
Faster Reading Progress Found
Several studies, including one conducted for I.B.M. by the Educational Testing Service, found that kindergarten and first-grade students who used the Writing to Read program progressed faster than the national norm on standardized reading tests.
Other educators remain unconvinced. They fault Writing to Read for its emphasis on phonics - learning to read by sounding out words - rather than learning phrases and words as a whole, as children do when they learn to speak.
''This forces students to work contrary to the way they learn language,'' said Daniel Hittleman, an associate professor at Queens College and former president of the New York State Reading Association. ''You will probably see dramatic short-term gains, but the question will be whether these are true gains, whether the results couldn't have been achieved more efficiently and effectively through some other means.''
Educators say the true test of the Mississippi experiment will come years from now: whether students do learn to read and write better, and whether the program endures or goes the way of other educational trends.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE ASKS AN IRATE CONGRESS FOR CHINA SUPPORT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration pressed returning members of Congress today to support the President's handling of relations with China, but the effort was greeted by a storm of opposition from both Democrats and Republicans.
The Administration's initiative was prompted by a pending vote in Congress over whether to override the President's Nov. 30 veto of a bill that would allow the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States to remain in the country after their visas expire.
Both houses of Congress overwhelmingly passed the legislation last year in response to Beijing's violent crackdown in June on democracy demonstrators, many of them students.
 
Loss of Congressional Confidence
While the matter at hand was Mr. Bush's veto, which he explained in part by saying that he could accomplish the bill's goals through administrative action, the real issue today was broader: Congress's apparent loss of confidence in President Bush's handling of relations with China and the Administration's attempt to win that confidence back before it loses control of the policy to legislators. 
''Republicans as well as Democrats are going to vote in the House to override the President's veto,'' Representative Mickey Edwards, Republican of Oklahoma, said at a ceremony with Chinese students outside the House today. ''The President has simply made a mistake, but the American Congress and the American people stand very strongly with those people in China who want to get those same rights of democracy and liberty that mean so much to us.''
The pending vote to override the veto has also taken on significance as an expression of Congressional sentiment after recent Administration gestures toward Beijing. These included a resumption of high-level contacts suspended after the crackdown and the lifting of some economic sanctions.
 
House Vote Imminent
A vote is expected on Wednesday in the House and Thursday in the Senate.
The White House Chief of Staff, John H. Sununu, and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met with Republican senators on Capitol Hill, while Mr. Bush telephoned others in an effort to secure the 34 votes needed to block the two-thirds majority required for an override in the Senate. Administration officials have all but conceded that the veto will be easily overridden in the House, where the original bill passed, 403 to 0, in November. The Senate adopted the bill without a recorded vote.
Senators and members of Congress from both parties seemed to return from their holiday vacation angry over the Administration's recent gestures toward Beijing. Some of the most controversial were revealed while they were on recess, including two trips to Beijing by the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, and the lifting of several economic sanctions without any significant human rights concessions by the Chinese authorities.
The Administration said such high-level contacts were essential with a country as important as China, and pointed to Beijing's lifting of martial law on Jan. 10 as a vindication of its overtures. Many members of Congress sharply disagreed, saying that the lifting of martial law was an empty gesture.
 
A Beijing Facsimile
This morning, a group of leading Democrats and Republicans made it their first order of business to join with the Chinese students in dedicating outside the House of Representatives a plaster model of the Goddess of Freedom, similar to the one erected in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. At the ceremony, the Senate Democratic leader, George Mitchell of Maine, denounced the Administration for engaging ''in embarrassing kowtowing to an aging Chinese Communist leadership.''
The ceremony was followed by a special hearing of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and refugee affairs, headed by Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. The hearing was entirely devoted to policy toward China.
''The secret White House missions to China,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''have dealt a serious blow to the confidence of Congress in the Administration's China policy, and to the confidence of the Chinese students that the Administration has their best interests at heart.''
Borrowing a remark frequently made by President Reagan in his dealings with the Soviet Union, Mr. Kennedy said: ''President Bush says, 'Trust me.' We say, 'Trust but verify.' ''
Technically, the debate between Congress and the Administration is focused on the President's veto of the Chinese Emergency Immigration Act, a bill passed with broad bipartisan support that would give Chinese students now studying in this country four more years to apply for new visas, or for permanent residence, while also waiving the requirement that they first return to China.
In an effort to provide the same safeguards without passing a law that would offend the Chinese authorities, the President accompanied his veto with an administrative directive to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that offers Chinese in the United States - students and non-students alike - much the same protection. The Administration argued that if the Congress overrides the President's veto, Beijing will choke off all student exchanges with the United States. Constitutional Infringement? The White House has also contended that such a law would be an infringement on the President's right to make foreign policy and only lead to a further isolation of China from the United States.
Supporters of the bill, which was initially put forward by Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, have argued that legislation is necessary because the President's administrative order could be withdrawn at any time, because it might be challenged in court as illegal, and, most important, because it sent too mild a signal to Beijing.
Testifying at Senator Kennedy's hearing, Winston Lord, who served as Ambassador to China during the Reagan Addministration, said: ''Fairly or unfairly, the vote on this issue will be interpreted abroad and at home not just as a decision on how best to protect Chinese students in America, but more fundamentally as a referendum on our posture toward the current Chinese regime.''
After a lunch with Republican Senators, Mr. Baker said it was too early to predict whether the Administration would be able to stop an overriding of the veto.
 
Baker's Argument
''We're making the point,'' Mr. Baker said, ''that the President has done as much, or more, administratively as you get through the legislation. We're pointing out that things are at a very sensitive stage over there and what could happen if you override the President's veto is get a reaction over there that would, in effect, close off student exchanges.''
Nevertheless, Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Senate minority whip, predicted that a veto override ''will pass like a dose of salts.''
''There won't be five of us who will vote'' for the President, he said.
Aides to the Senate minority leader, Robert Dole of Kansas, said he told Mr. Baker that he would tally the votes he can muster. If it appears that he is close to 34, Mr. Dole is expected to try to enlist everyone from past Presidents to China experts in an attempt to block an override. If the number is too small, Senator Dole is not expected to ''waste any time'' on the matter, aides said.

HEADLINE: Rome Journal;
Campuses Aflame Again: Just Tools of Industry?

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 23

 BODY:
From Palermo to Turin, and on more than a dozen campuses in between, Italian universities are being rocked by student protests that had all but disappeared in the passive, self-absorbed 1980's.
The principal issue is the quality of academic life, or, more commonly, the lack of it in a system that is universally denounced as obsolete, overcrowded, inefficient and at times dehumanizing.
Over the last few weeks thousands of students have demonstrated in at least 17 cities, forcing the wholesale cancellation of classes in many departments.
At La Sapienza, the main campus of the University of Rome, protesters have occupied eight buildings, denouncing the Government and demanding the ouster of the university rector. Reflecting the high-technology age in which these students were born, their symbol is not the bullhorn of earlier generations but rather the fax machine, which they use to follow developments elsewhere. 
 
Looking Back at '68
Perhaps inevitably, the Italian press has alluded frequently to 1968, that landmark year of ferment, when campuses exploded in Italy as elsewhere. But students resent the comparisons as glib attempts to trivialize their grievances as imitations of past activism.
Their immediate target is a proposed law, endorsed by the governing five-party coalition, which would give individual campuses more autonomy to set course requirements than they now have under a highly centralized system. They would also be able to sign research contracts and start other joint projects with private companies.
In theory, the changes would nudge Italy's 50 universities and 1.1 million students closer toward the United States model of privately run colleges. They amount to a Government acknowledgment that it has totally failed to correct decades-old inefficiencies.
''I don't believe that anyone can deny that the Italian university system needs reform,'' said Antonio Ruberti, the Government minister in charge of colleges and the architect of the new law.
 
What the Students Fear
On that score, no one disagrees. But students say they worry that big corporations may be given a free hand to reshape the country's schools to fit their own needs.
While the sciences and engineering are likely to get adequate financing, they argue, the liberal arts will fall by the wayside. Laboratory researchers, who joined the protests this week, fret that they will lose their independence and become tools of industry. Large companies, it is also argued, are more likely to invest in the well-developed Italian north, further widening the considerable gap with the relatively poor south. Not coincidentally, the campus protests first erupted in Palermo, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent, three times that in Turin.
''Students don't count for anything now,'' said Francesco Bucci, a 22-year-old physics major at La Sapienza. ''They'll count for even less, if that's possible, in the hands of industry.''
Although the University of Rome rector, Giorgio Tecce, calls such concerns overwrought, Italian skepticism about industry's good intentions runs high, not only among students.
 
Dissatisfaction Is Widespread
Objections to the Ruberti plan reflect widespread cynicism about the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a few industrialist titans like Giovanni Agnelli of Fiat, Carlo De Benedetti of Olivetti, Raul Gardini of the Ferruzzi-Montedison agrobusiness group, and Silvio Berlusconi, a television magnate. A recurring student theme dwells on perceived slights of their cause by the leading national newspapers, most of which are controlled by these men.
In their protest the students are supported by the dominant opposition force, the Communist Party, and judging from their slogans, most demonstrators seem to fall on the political left. But such characterizations are not especially meaningful, for dissatisfaction with Italian universities goes deep and cuts across political lines.
The basic issue is not the Ruberti plan so much as the system itself, which is little changed from 1968 or from 1977 - another milestone year of protest, when, unlike now, violence was epidemic. The litany of complaints is long, tending to focus on shabby equipment and overcrowding.
La Sapienza, Italy's largest campus, has 180,000 students, or 100,000 more than it should, Mr. Tecce said. If not for the fact that fewer than 30 percent show up for classes, the rector said, ''this place would look like a soccer stadium.'' Even so, an engineering major here says he must arrive an hour early for one of his courses to get a seat in the lecture hall. The University of Bologna's law department has only 40 teachers for 10,000 students.
 
Most Students Drop Out
At most colleges, libraries stay open only a few hours a day. Campus housing is meager, forcing most out-of-town students into apartments that are undersized and overpriced. A common lament is that professors are aloof.
One result is that most students give up, with two-thirds dropping out in the first two years. And as they do, Italians worry that the country will wind up academically ill equipped for Western Europe's economic integration in 1992.
''We will enter Europe,'' wrote Miriam Mafai, a commentator for the newspaper La Repubblica, ''with a backward scholastic system, like haughty ragamuffins, fatuously proud of the past but incapable of preparing for the future.''
That is why immediate change is critical, says Mr. Ruberti, who complains that protesting students, while well intentioned, overlook the need for quick action. The Government, he says, is prepared to modify his plan, but the basic framework will remain intact.
''No one is proposing alternatives to this law,'' he said. ''Sometimes, it seems as though there is no will among the students to reform.''

HEADLINE: Shamir and Sharon in Bitter Fight to Run Israel

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his chief Likud party rival, Ariel Sharon, are deep into a bitter political war two weeks before a party meeting at which the future leadership of the nation, and the future of the Government's moribund peace initiative, may well be decided.
The party meeting, similar to one last summer, is an open contest of political strength between Mr. Shamir and Mr. Sharon. And on Monday Mr. Shamir warned, ''It is very clear that if the Likud Central Committee won't support me, I cannot remain the leader of the Likud or the Prime Minister.''
It is not clear how the voting at the party meeting Feb. 7 will be framed. But whatever the actual question put before the delegates, the real decision will be whether the Likud party wants Mr. Shamir or Mr. Sharon as its leader. The vote is likely to be close. Mr. Sharon and his allies disparaged the Prime Minister's resignation threat today. Mr. Sharon told supporters in Beersheba, where he was campaigning, that Mr. Shamir should abandon his proposal for Palestinian elections ''that would in fact bring about a Palestinian state, bloodshed and war.'' 
 
An Open Challenge
Many Israelis, Palestinians and Americans have already come to the view that the election plan is not likely to be carried out in any case, because of intransigence on the part of both Mr. Shamir and of leading Arabs.
But although the proposal is moribund, Mr. Sharon wants to see it dead. While he is a rival of Mr. Shamir's for power, he says the frequent charge that he is attacking Mr. Shamir's plan only for his own political gain is ''lies and utter nonsense.''
Mr. Sharon openly challenged Mr. Shamir over the elections proposal at a party meeting last summer. Before that meeting, too, Mr. Shamir threatened to resign if the party did not support him. Then, as now, the threat was in part a tactical inducement for support: If Mr. Shamir resigns, the Government will fall and there would be a chance that the Labor Party would take over control of the Government.
In the last few weeks, the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, has been actively trying to work out agreements with several smaller political parties to form a narrow coalition should the Labor-Likud Government fall.
 
Attacked at Every Turn
At the meeting last summer, Mr. Shamir compromised at the last minute - just as the Central Committee meeting was set to begin - and accepted several binding constraints on the elections proposal pushed on him by Mr. Sharon and his two allies, Housing Minister David Levy and Economics-Planning Minister Yitzhak Modai.
Since then, the three who offered the proposal have attacked Mr. Shamir at every turn, accusing him of betraying the right-wing promise to exclude the Palestine Liberation Organization from any role in peace negotiations. The United States Government, meanwhile, has repeatedly indicated that it did not think Mr. Shamir was being flexible enough.
And in the end the unrelenting pressure from both sides prompted Mr. Shamir to call for a party meeting to meet his political rivals head on.
Getting ready for that meeting, he addressed a group of Likud party members last week and, apparently trying to flaunt his right-wing credentials, told them he believed Israel should hold onto the West Bank and Gaza because the land would be needed to settle some of the Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel.
Predictably, that brought a protest from the United States, even though Mr. Shamir contended that he had been misunderstood. And today President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, taking an unusual threatening tone, said Egypt would never accept it if Israel began settling Soviet immigrants on what he called ''Arab land.''
Mr. Sharon and Mr. Shamir are holding rallies around the country as the party meeting draws near. At his rally today, Mr. Sharon called Mr. Shamir's elections plan ''the greatest concession of Israel to the Arabs without anything any return.''

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East: U.S. Policy;
Congress Starts Review Of U.S. Military Posture

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Bush Administration and Congress began work today on what is likely to be a basic reshaping of American military strategy and spending in the wake of political and social upheavals in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Returning after a two-month recess during which the Rumanian Government was overthrown and new domestic turmoil erupted in the Soviet Union, the Senate Armed Services Committee opened hearings that its Democratic chairman said will question ''fundamental assumptions'' of Pentagon military and budget policies for the 1990's.
''We've seen the threat change on TV every night,'' said the chairman, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. ''We'll be looking at this changed threat as the foundation on which we build the budget which we will be asking the American people to pay for.'' 
Mr. Nunn, the leading Democratic expert on defense matters and a major force in setting the course of Pentagon spending, is expected to shape his party's response to the Bush Administration's proposed military budget for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
Defense Department officials already have said that they will propose cuts in military spending for fiscal 1991 of about 2 percent, after inflation is taken into account, because of the reduced threat of war with the Soviet Union.
 
Tallying the 'Peace Dividend'
Today, Mr. Nunn said those reductions could produce savings - a so-called ''peace dividend'' - of $8 billion to $15 billion in the next fiscal year. While substantial, the number is well below the estimated $60 billion that Congress must cut from the budget if it is to achieve spending targets set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law, he noted.
Mr. Nunn said it will not be clear how spending cuts might be achieved until the month of hearings begun today produce a new ''threat assessment'' of the military perils facing the United States.
The ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, Senator John Warner of Virginia said this afternoon, after the session, that he ''didn't hear any testimony today which would justify drastic revisions in the armed forces of the United States.''
While the Soviet Union's intentions appear to have changed, he said, ''we must wait a period of time in order to allow the arms control process to go forward, to allow the threat assessment to be predicated on solid facts of change rather than intentions.''
 
Changing Military Priorities
The public portion of today's hearings, which consisted of prepared statements from three senior intelligence officials, indicated that the Bush Administration may seek to shift some of the military's emphasis from conflict between the superpowers to other arenas, such as terrorism and other third world threats.
But they stressed that technological advances will make the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal more advanced and powerful than ever in the next decade, even after reductions in the number of missiles and warheads that are contemplated as a result of arms control agreements still to be reached.
The first witness, William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, told the panel that the Soviet Union's political and conventional force threat to the United States and Western Europe is likely to ebb in this decade as its leaders struggle with the nation's ''mounting turmoil and economic distress.''
Mr. Webster told the committee that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, ''and any successors will have an even more pressing need than in the past few years to reduce the burden of defense spending and to transfer resources to civilian production.''
 
Soviet Control in Bloc Fades
Two other Defense Department intelligence officials who appeared with Mr. Webster predicted that Moscow will continue to reduce its military presence gradually in the nations of Eastern Europe, and said some of those nations already are making military decisions independent of the Soviets.
The Warsaw Pact military alliance is likely to change radically, or even disappear, as a result of the past year's political upheavals, they said.
The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lieut. Gen. Harry E. Soyster, said the disintegration of Eastern Europe's Communist bloc means the Soviet Union no longer can expect the automatic support of its old satellites' military forces in a conflict with the NATO alliance.
''In light of these developments,'' he said, ''I believe the Soviets would consider large-scale theater operations against NATO with only their own forces as highly risky, if not impractical.''
Both General Soyster and Mr. Webster said the Soviet Union has also reduced its military commitments in the Far East, potentially reducing the requirement for an American military presence there.
But Mr. Webster warned, as he has often in the last year, about the rising potential for chemical, biological and nuclear warfare among developing nations such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and Pakistan.
Increasingly Sophisticated Missiles Roughly 15 third world nations are developing missiles capable of delivering chemical, biological or nuclear warheads, Mr. Webster said in a March 1989 speech. While most of those missiles have a range of less than 625 miles, he predicted today that by the end of the decade at least six nations will have missiles with ranges exceeding 3,100 miles.
Four of the nations developing missiles already have or are close to acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities, he said. ''By the end of the decade,'' he said, ''four more countries could be added to the nuclear list.''
Mr. Webster's remarks went beyond what has previously been publicly disclosed about the nuclear and missile capabilities of third world nations. After meeting today with Mr. Webster and other intelligence leaders behind closed doors, Mr. Nunn and other members of the Armed Services Committee said they found the new estimates disturbing.
Mr. Nunn said the spread of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons among developing countries is causing ''a great deal of concern'' that the Soviet Union also shares.
Senator Warner said the issue of third-world missiles ''is a factor that must be considered as we re-examine our military aid programs.''

HEADLINE: Colombia Envoy Angry About U.S. Trade Policy

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Recent Bush Administration trade decisions are squeezing Colombia's earnings and making its war against cocaine trafficking more difficult, the country's Ambassador, Victor Mosquera Chaux, said today.
Three weeks before President Bush is to meet the Colombian President, Virgilio Barco Vargas, and other Andean leaders at a summit conference on drugs in Cartagena, Colombia, Mr. Mosquera held a news conference here to criticize American actions affecting Colombia's top legal exports: cut flowers and coffee.
He said the Administration's policies could cut Colombia's foreign earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars a year at a time when his country has had to ''earmark a good portion of national resources for that heroic fight'' against drug trafficking, ''which Colombia is waging on behalf of the whole of mankind.''
Mr. Mosquera said a move to impose a Federal import surcharge on Colombian flowers, after a finding that Colombia was ''dumping'' them in the United States at below fair market value, could put a serious dent in the country's $200 million-a-year trade in cut flowers. He also said that a decision by the United States to pull out of negotiations on a new coffee agreement, causing prices to plummet, will cost Colombia $500 million a year. 
 
Flowers Are Widely Distributed
The freshly cut flowers, airfreighted daily from Bogota in air-conditioned Boeing 747's, are sold in 35,000 American florist shops and 10,000 supermarkets.
A preliminary decision by the Commerce Department on Jan. 5 could mean that the surcharge, imposed retroactively on importers, would rise by 50 percent to $8 million, weakening the competitiveness of Colombian flowers. The decision, which could be overturned when the department makes a final determination in April, is based on an earlier finding that Colombia's dumping was harming domestic growers.
The breakdown in the International Coffee Agreement, signed by 74 producing and consuming countries to regulate coffee prices by controlling the quantity of exports, resulted from demands by the United States. Washington wanted greater imports of higher-quality coffees and elimination of discounting that it said was hurting American companies.
Its decision not to continue to negotiate caused a sharp drop in international coffee prices.
 
Coffee Price Drops by a Third
The agreement, which has maintained order in the world market for the past 27 years, aimed at supporting a base price for coffee beans of $1.20 a pound. After suspension of the quotas, the world price toppled to 85 cents, and remains around these levels today, coffee experts said.
Academic experts see the apparent contradictions of trying to help Colombia fight a drug war on the one hand and then penalizing it with trade actions on the other as the result of the fiercely competing tugs of domestic American interests.
''Obviously it doesn't sound like a very coordinated policy,'' said James R. Tybout, an economics professor and Latin American expert at Georgetown University. ''Since we're so driven by domestic lobbies, it's not surprising that our policy actions are not in concert.''
Administration officials insisted that the United States is in fact offering important trade assistance to Colombia, or as United States Trade Representative Carla A. Hills put it, ''trying to be a constructive force in many areas.''
 
Colombian Sugar Quota Raised
In coffee, she noted, American negotiators, under instructions from President Bush, are currently working with other nations to repair the agreement.
''There's nothing the United States can do on the coffee agreement without the big producers like Brazil and Colombia getting closer together,'' she said, adding that one of the problems is that Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, is between governments.
Mrs. Hills noted that as part of a reallocation, the United States recently increased Colombia's sugar quota.
On Colombia's complaints in the cut-flowers trade case, Eric I. Garfinkel, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Import Administration, said the department is constrained by the anti-dumping law and judicial review provisions, which mandate that decisions be based on facts and supported by the record.
''If the department were to tilt its decisions because of foreign-policy considerations,'' he said, ''then the integrity of anti-dumping enforcement would be undermined.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
'Umbrella' on Abortion Delays G.O.P. Decision

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Republicans have grown adept at pursuing two-track strategies, with the White House sending one message and party leaders another.
Democrats complained throughout 1989 that the Republicans were playing a sophisticated game of good cop, bad cop, with President Bush extending the hand of bipartisanship to Congressional Democrats, seeking deals on the budget and Central America, while his lieutenants pursued an unrelenting partisan war.
Now another multi-track strategy has emerged, around the issue of abortion: The President reiterates his opposition to abortion rights, easing the fears of the party's fervently anti-abortion wing, while other Republican leaders emphasize the party's tolerance of differing views. Consider Monday, the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, when tens of thousands of protesters descended on the city. 
Mr. Bush, following precedent set in the Reagan years, delivered a message to the anti-abortion rally, expressing his commitment to their cause. But Marlin Fitzwater, his press secretary, told reporters that morning that Mr. Bush's position ''is a personal choice of conscience,'' adding, ''We all feel there is room within the party for varying points of view.''
At the same time, Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, paused to say a few words to a group of Republicans who support abortion rights, who were rallying on the steps of their party's headquarters. Mr. Atwater, reiterating remarks he delivered to the Republican National Committee last week, a speech that met with White House approval, emphasized his commitment to an ''umbrella party'' with tolerance for people on both sides of the abortion issue.
It was a day, in short, that sent more than one message to more than one audience.
Even the President's message to the marchers was carefully calibrated, softer than the one he gave a year ago, before the Supreme Court reshaped the politics of abortion by giving states more power to restrict it. Moreover, several times in recent months, he has signaled his support for the ''umbrella party'' philosophy.
Republican leaders, ever vigilant about protecting the President's right flank, and ever sensitive about a President who has changed his position on abortion before, play down the significance of all this. An Administration official, speaking on condition that he not be identified, argued that ''we're not trying to fog it up'' or blur the party's identity as being firmly anti-abortion. But many others see a gradual change, like the turning of a battleship.
At the least, the party leadership has managed to hearten some of its people who support a more flexible approach to abortion, while avoiding open warfare with the anti-abortion wing. The question is how long the dual-track strategy can work.
There will come a time when the party must address the issue head on, when it rewrites its 1992 platform. Right now, the platform commits the party to a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Senator Bob Packwood, the Oregon Republican who has long supported abortion rights, says he believes it is ''almost inevitable'' that this anti-abortion plank will be pulled. The other side is equally determined to save it. The party will have to choose.
In the short term, Congressional Democrats who support abortion rights are eager to challenge the Republicans' two-track strategy. ''I think it's doomed to failure,'' asserted Representative Les AuCoin of Oregon, who played a key role in the abortion battles last fall. Mr. AuCoin said he and his allies intend to ask, again and again, why abortion is a matter of individual conscience for Republican politicians, but not for American women.
''That's the question we're going to put to the country,'' said Mr. AuCoin. ''We're going to win that argument.'' Moreover, Mr. AuCoin and other abortion rights supporters argue that it will be hard for the Republicans to soften their image on this issue if the President continues to veto legislation like the bill last fall to provide Federal financing for abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest.
Indeed, many analysts assert that such actions carry a heavy political cost for the party, especially with the baby-boom voters who lean Republican on economics but are more liberal on social issues. The Republicans know they need to keep those voters under their umbrella.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Crisis Could Open Door to the G.O.P. in Massachusetts

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
The precipitous decline in Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's popularity and a budget crisis that has paralyzed state government have set the stage for a wide-open governor's race - so wide open that people are talking about the possibility that a Republican candidate could win for the first time in two decades.
''It could be a watershed year for Massachusetts, said Nick Mitropoulous, a former close aide to Mr. Dukakis who is now executive director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at Harvard University. ''Things are really up for grabs,'' ''There is a tremendous desire for change,'' said Thomas Kiley, a political consultant in Boston. ''It gives the Republicans a unique opportunity, one they haven't had in 20 years.'' But Mr. Kiley cautioned that it is far too early to make any predictions and that the Republicans in Massachusetts have ''kicked away their chances before by squabbling among themselves.'' 
 
Bitter Over Budget Mess
The outcome of the governor's race is particularly difficult to predict because in a state where the voters are overwhelmingly Democratic and tend to be more liberal than elsewhere in the nation, and people are angry over the budget mess, blaming Governor Dukakis and disparaging the Democratic leadership in the legislature. So heated is public feeling that a number of legislators have reported getting telephone calls threatening them with physical harm if they vote for tax increases to make up a $600 million deficit in the $12 billion state budget.
The leading Democratic candidates are Lieut. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti and John R. Silber, the president of Boston University. With Ms. Murphy laboring under her close ties to the unpopular Dukakis administration and Mr. Bellotti, at 66 years old, regarded by many as past his prime, Mr. Silber could emerge as a dark horse.
Their race for the Democratic primary in September could be further complicated if Mayor Raymond L. Flynn of Boston enters the race.
On the Republican side, the major contenders are William F. Weld, a patrician former United States Attorney in Boston, and Steven Pierce, the House minority leader. Mr. Weld has tried to depict himself as an outsider, and has adopted a modified position accepting abortion where Mr. Pierce is strongly against it.
Although former President Reagan carried the state in 1984, no Republican has won a statewide election in Massachusetts since 1972, and the last Republican to win the governor's office was Francis Sargent in 1970. Republicans make up only 14 percent of the state's registered voters. Mr. Dukakis, who is not running for re-election, has dominated Massachusetts in his three terms as Governor beginning in 1974.
 
Pledges of No New Taxes
All the candidates in both parties, in varying degrees, have pledged not to raise taxes, with Mr. Weld promising no new taxes for four years and declaring that he can balance the budget by cutting $1 billion out of the $12 billion total.
Regardless of who ultimately appeals to the voters in November, he will inherit a serious problem. In the latest indication of how severe the fiscal situation has become, the Democratic House speaker, George Keverian, withdrew a scaled-down tax package last Thursday that would have partly closed the revenue gap after failing to muster enough votes to pass it.
By law, the state's books need to be balanced by the end of the fiscal year on June 30. But some legislators are now suggesting that they may simply leave the problem until the next governor is elected.
''There is an absolute majority for no solution,'' said Nicholas Paleologos, a Democratic state representative from Woburn. ''There's an absolute majority for no taxes and an absolute majority for no cuts in the budget.''
''We are being eaten alive by indecisiveness,'' said James Howell, a consultant who was the former chief economist for The Bank of Boston. The state's basic problem, he said, is that while its revenue is growing 2 percent a year, its expenditures are shooting up 8 percent a year.
The situation could become even more confused this week, when Governor Dukakis is scheduled to make his budget plan public for the fiscal year 1991, which begins July 1. Although the Governor's office is keeping the details secret, officials have indicated the new budget will be based on the assumption that the legislature will not vote any tax increases and therefore there will have to be deep cuts in most state services.
 
'Draconian, Appalling'
L. Edward Lashman, the state's Secretary of Administration, described the spending plan as ''Draconian, appalling, disgraceful, hideous, frightening.''
Public outrage at politicians here grows from several sources. In part, it reflects disbelief that the state could have fallen on hard times so soon after the ''Massachusetts Miracle'' that Mr. Dukakis boasted of in his unsuccessful bid for the Presidency in 1988. In the middle and late 1980's, Massachusetts consistently had the lowest unemployment rate of any major industrial state, as low as 3 percent, and its high technology and financial services industries were booming.
But in 1988 and 1989 many businesses in the state suddenly faced falling profits, led by mini-computer makers like Wang Laboratories Inc. and the Digital Equipment Corporation and then by banks like the Bank of New England. On Friday, the Bank of New England said it would report a record loss of $1.05 billion for 1989 because of bad real estate loans in the Northeast.
It was this downturn in the economy that largely caused the drop in state revenue, economists say, a problem that hit other states in the region like New York and New Hampshire. But because, in the public's eye, the decline in state revenue showed up first, it was Governor Dukakis who was blamed, not business leaders.
Public anger at Mr. Dukakis was also fueled by the belief that he knew that the problems were coming but kept them hidden during his Presidential campaign, an idea some of his aides now privately concede is right.
 
Group Bashes the Incumbents
This anger has been given further voice by an unusual group that broadcasts for two hours every Tuesday afternoon on radio station WRKO-AM, bashing anyone in state government and deriding them as ''hacks.'' The three are Barbara Anderson, a housewife who has become head of a powerful anti-tax lobby, Howie Carr, a Boston Herald columnist, and Jerry Williams, a radio talk show host. On the show, Mr. Dukakis is referred to as ''Pee Wee,'' and the gospel is spread that Massachusetts has the highest taxes in the country.
In fact, according to the Census Bureau, Massachusetts now ranks near the bottom in terms of state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income, 42d out of the 50 states.

HEADLINE: How to Pay for Social Security

 BODY:
I thought I understood what Senator Moynihan had in mind with his proposal to cut the Social Security payroll tax. He wants to stop using a tax that bears hardest on the poor to reduce the Federal deficit. That sure sounds nice. But if we reduce the payroll tax, won't benefits be threatened for people who retire in the future? 
No. Regardless of what people say about creating a big fund to cover the baby boomers, Social Security surpluses do not pay future retirees. Future taxpayers do, tax cut or no tax cut.
Right now, payroll taxes are high enough to generate large surpluses. These surpluses are lent to the Treasury. When the expected bulge in retirements occurs around 2020, the Treasury will have to pay back the Social Security Administration. How? With money from taxpayers. Under the Moynihan plan, no surpluses would accumulate. Every year, the Treasury would have to turn over the necessary cash to the Social Security Administration. How? With money from taxpayers. Either way, future taxpayers pay the bill.
In other words, the Moynihan tax cut would be harmless?
Not really. Future taxpayers will pay, either way. But how much pain that causes them depends on how much the economy grows between now and then. Future taxpayers won't mind the tax burden if they feel well-off. The best way to guarantee that is for the nation to invest in education and capital equipment.
The big danger of the Moynihan tax-cut proposal is that it threatens such investment. Tax cuts drive up the deficit, siphoning private savings away from productive investment. The economy could shrivel, making future tax burdens unbearable.
O.K., tax cuts harm the economy. But isn't Senator Moynihan right about the unfairness? Isn't there some way to help the majority of Americans who now pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes?
Yes. The flat-rate payroll tax that everybody pays up to $51,300 in earnings is a vestige of a powerful myth. Many people still think Social Security is an insurance system and that people only get back what they paid in. But in reality, most beneficiaries collect much more.
If Congress acts on the basis of that reality, it could readily fashion a tax system that spreads burdens fairly. The top marginal rate is now 28 percent. By raising it just a fraction of a percentage point, Mr. Moynihan could have his Social Security tax cut without worsening the deficit. Another remedy would be to make the payroll tax progressive, too.
Then why didn't he propose something like that?
Probably because he wants to make Congress face up to the hard choices. The worst outcome of all would be for Congress to pass the payroll tax cut and also the President's pernicious, sweeping cut in the capital gains tax. That would mean an even bigger deficit and more pain for the next generation.
A better outcome would be for Congress to redistribute unfair tax burdens away from the poor without raising the deficit. But the best outcome of all would be to protect lower-income people now and also reduce the deficit. That would insure higher incomes when the Social Security bills come due. If that happens, Senator Moynihan's ''hand grenade'' will have done enormous good.

HEADLINE: Elitist Visions Won't Feed China's Masses

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Li Lu, in his vitriolic and grossly exaggerated Op-Ed article, ''In China, I'd Be Dead'' (Dec. 24), uses all the cliches to elicit sympathy from Congress and the American people for the pro-democracy movement in China. If the movement fails, as I think it will at this time, it is precisely because it caters to United States emotions rather than to Chinese needs. When Li Lu writes that ''Our hopes in Tiananmen Square were built on the principles that frame the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights,'' he is talking about concepts that are as foreign to the Chinese people and their traditions as Confucianism might be to us. 
But he is not thinking about the Chinese masses. If he had his way, Li Lu would create an elitist democracy that would serve the daydreams of some intellectuals, with little regard for the immediate needs of the overwhelming proportion of the Chinese people. If his concern was for the workers and peasants, he and the other wielders of bullhorns in Tiananmen Square would have continued to combat corruption, inflation and the many other ills now plaguing China -for which they would have had the support of the population - rather than switching to unrealistic rhetoric about democracy and human rights, which play much better on American television but have little meaning for most Chinese.
To anyone who has watched China struggle through the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution finally to achieve the economic growth and political liberalization of the last 10 years, the unnecessary setback caused by unthinking and arrogant students is painful. Mr. Lu's article exemplifies this arrogance, and it too will only delay the changes we all desire to see in China.

HEADLINE: Why There's No U.S. Market for Electric Cars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''G.M. Displays the Impact, an Advanced Electric Car'' (Business Day, Jan. 4) reminds me, I am sorry to say, of similar recent events.
In the late 1970's, the General Motors Corporation announced, with great fanfare, it would produce 100,000 electric cars by 1984. This turned out to be somewhat misleading. I was then editor of EV Focus, the leading international newsletter on electric cars and trucks. Most of the electric vehicle companies I wrote about have gone bankrupt because few consumers will buy battery-powered vehicles when petroleum is available at a relatively low price.
No manufacturer will build an electric road car until a market exists for a limited-range, expensive vehicle. The only way to make the electric car competitive with vehicles in use today is to find a vastly improved electric storage medium. This is unlikely.
Lead-acid batteries, which have been around more than 100 years, have been improved only marginally despite enormous expenditures of time and money all over the world. Lead batteries are heavy, filled with corrosive acid, require slow charging and have power densities ridiculously small compared with gasoline.
Short-range electric trucks and buses make much greater economic sense than passenger vehicles. They can compete for stop-and-go runs of less than 50 miles a day. But they will come into being in the United States only when political leaders create markets for them - as is being done in a few, better managed parts of the world.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Appoints Advisers on Drugs And Top Positions

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday named Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, a former United States Attorney General, to head a study group to recommend a strategy for fighting drug abuse.
Mr. Dinkins also named Arthur L. Liman, the lawyer who was special counsel to the Senate select committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, to head a seven-member Committee on Appointments to screen nominees to certain city boards and committees.
''The objective is to provide a foundation for the city's anti-drug stratgey over the next four years,'' Mr. Dinkins said of Mr. Katzenbach's appointment. He said the study group would recommend treatment and education ideas and report back to him by May 1. The city will provide office space, but a private consortium has raised $150,000 for staff members and consultants. 
Mr. Dinkins has been under mounting pressure to fill about a dozen critical posts in his administration. But none of the vacant commissioners' jobs at agencies like the housing, welfare, correction and sanitation departments, and the Health and Hospitals Corporation, would be affected by the screening committee announced yesterday. Mr. Dinkins has said he hopes to fill those jobs as soon as possible.
''We have such a lot of work yet to do, as has been observed by some,'' he said with a smile, referring to criticism about the pace of appointments and complaints by some Hispanic supporters that he has not named enough Hispanic people to important jobs.
Mr. Dinkins had also been under pressure to name the Committee on Appointments, so it could screen nominees to bodies like the City Planning Commission, the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Conflict of Interest Board, all of which require approval by the City Council.
Mayor Edward I. Koch issued an executive order establishing the committee, with five members, as a check against corruption in the wake of the munici-pal scandals several years ago. But all its members resigned effective Dec. 31, when Mr. Koch left office.
Mr. Dinkins issued a new executive order yesterday to continue the committee. Dinkins aides have said they had candidates for some of the boards but did not want to identify them because the appointments committee was not in place. Now the boards have vacancies, mixed with holdovers from the Koch administration - sometimes with tangible effects on decision-making.
On Monday, for example, the Planning Commission, which has two vacancies among its seven seats, failed to approve zoning changes sought by a private developer for a high-rise project proposed for the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the changes, but that fell short of the four votes needed for approval.
Mr. Dinkins had not taken a position on the development. But he said yesterday that if the appointments committe had been in place, it ''already could have been considering names'' for such vacancies.
Under Mr. Koch, the panel was headed by the lawyer Floyd Abrams. It is modeled on the mayoral screening panel that recommends appointees for judgeships.
For each vacancy, the committee recommends at least three candidates for the Mayor's consideration. He agrees to pick one of the three, or to ask for additional nominees.
 
Hispanic Objections Addressed
Besides Mr. Liman, a partner in the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, the committee includes Victor Alicea, the president of Boricua College and a commissioner of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
After the announcement at a news conference in the Blue Room of City Hall, a reporter asked Mr. Dinkins if Mr. Alicea would be his last Hispanic appointee. It was the harshest of several similar queries to the Mayor in recent days.
''I suppose others standing in my position would resent the question and suggest that you were being less than candid in the fashion in which you put it,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''So I'll just answer the question you asked. The answer is no.''
On Monday Mr. Dinkins noted that he had named a Puerto Rican woman, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, as Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, and Carlos M. Rivera, also Puerto Rican, as Fire Commissioner.
The city's highest-ranking elected Hispanic official, Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx, said yesterday that people had expressed concern to him over the number of Hispanic appointees. But he said that some of the criticism had come from people who did not even support Mr. Dinkins and that the Mayor had not yet made all his appointments.
''The proof of the pudding is going to be at the end of the process,'' he said. ''So I don't think it's terribly productive to comment on numbers now.''
 
Investigation Chief Approved
Meantime yesterday the City Council approved unanimously without debate Mr. Dinkins's nomination of Susan E. Shepard as the city's Commissioner of Investigation. One of her first duties will be to appoint a special outside counsel to continue inquiries begun last year into Mr. Dinkins's handling of some of his financial activities while he was Manhattan Borough President, including a transfer of stock in a broadcasting company.
Mr. Dinkins said the executive director of the drug study group would be Dr. Lucy Friedman, who will take a leave from her job as head of the Victim Services Agency, a private, city-financed group that counsels crime victims. Herbert J. Sturz, a former Deputy Mayor and founding director of the Vera Institute of Justice, will be an adviser.
Mr. Katzenbach, who lives in Princeton, N.J., and is now in private law practice, said he expected the group to recommend a ''wide variety of things'' for the Mayor's consideration.
The Mayor's announcement said one issue the group would review was how to move step by step toward a system of drug treatment on demand at more treatment centers. But he said he could not give a timetable for when such treatment would be available or just how the city could afford it.
In addition to Mr. Liman and Mr. Alicea, the other members of the Committee on Appointments are:
 
Dr. June Jackson Christmas, professor, Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Ronald T. Gault, director for public finance, First Boston Corporation.
Nathan Leventhal, president, Lincoln Center.
Dr. Kenneth Ong, assistant director of AIDS center, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

Shortage of Ph.D.'s Imminent, Report Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A study by university deans predicts an intense tug of war among government, industry and academia for people with doctorate degrees.
As a result, the Association of American Universities said in a study released Sunday, the nation's competitive stature can only weaken in comparison with other industrialized countries.
''This nation faces a serious shortage of Ph.D.'s,'' the report said. ''A sharply increased demand will outstrip Ph.D. production before the turn of the century. Industry, government and universities will be pitted against each other in a battle for critical human capital.'' 
The report, ''The Ph.D. Shortage: The Federal Role,'' was prepared by a nine-member group, primarily graduate-school deans, for the association, an organization of 56 major research universities.
The report predicted that the nation would suffer an annual shortage of 7,500 natural science and engineering doctorates just a few years into the next century. Shortages of doctorate degrees in the humanities and social sciences would occur even sooner, it said.
 
Academia Is Losing Out
Faculty shortages have already appeared in engineering, business and other high-demand fields, the report said.
In 1985, an estimated 43 percent of all people with doctorates employed in the United States were working outside of higher education. Seventy percent of the people who received engineering doctorates in 1987 had commitments in nonacademic sectors, with 53 percent in industry and 17 percent in government and other sectors. About 65 percent of those who received doctorates in the physical sciences in 1987 had employment commitments in nonacademic sectors, with 50 percent in industry and 15 percent in other sectors.
Across all fields, 50 percent of the 1987 doctorate recipients had employment outside academia, the report said.
The report follows a study in September 1989 by the Mellon Foundation that estimated there will be only eight applicants for every 10 faculty jobs in liberal arts by the year 2000.
And last Friday, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos called on colleges to increase by 25 percent the number of college graduates completing doctoral programs in the basic arts, mathematics, sciences, engineering and technological disciplines.
 
Masking of Shortages
''The current shortages have been somewhat masked by the heavy enrollment of foreign students in Ph.D. programs in science and engineering and by the desire of those students to spend at least some postdoctoral years in employment in this country,'' said Robert Rosenzweig, president of the American Association of Universities. ''We should be grateful for that fact, but as many observers have noted, it is a foolishly risky assumption for the future.''
The report recommended ''a significant expansion of Federal support'' for graduate education and a doubling of Federal fellowships and traineeships.
Mr. Rosenzweig said, ''The government has an essential role in assuring that the nation's intellectual life and economic vitality remain healthily fed by successive generations of talent trained to the highest levels of which our universities are capable.''

 BODY:
TO 46-year-old Ina Pinkney, this is the Decade of the Blobb.
Blobbs are an almost intoxicating blend of walnuts, peanuts, chocolate chips and sweetened and unsweetened chocolate, dense shapeless mounds, crisp on the outside, fudgy and chewy on the inside. At $1.25 each, they are the signature offering of Dessert Kitchen Limited, Mrs. Pinkney's bakery on Chicago's Near North Side. 
They have also made Mrs. Pinkney a hit among Chicago restaurateurs, who buy Blobbs by the hundred, and among individual chocolate addicts across the country, who send in orders by phone and mail.
''They are our way of thumbing our noses at gourmet cookies and gourmet brownies,'' Mrs. Pinkney said. ''Blobbs are the next-generation brownie, what you eat after you are tired of the gourmet brownie.''
Now in its 10th year, Dessert Kitchen is prospering. Blobbs have put Dessert Kitchen on the map, but they are a relatively recent addition to its line. The company turns out many other desserts - tarts, flourless chocolate cakes, cheesecakes and fruit breads. Although ''gourmet'' commercial bakeries are proliferating, Mrs. Pinkney thrives by focusing on freshness. She bakes to order and usually delivers only hours after a dessert emerges from the oven.
''We don't freeze desserts and we don't hold them,'' Mrs. Pinkney said. ''At most, something stays overnight before being delivered.''
Dessert Kitchen was born in 1979, Mrs. Pinkney said, after she and her husband, Bill, moved to Chicago from New York and could find no good bakeries. Working first out of her apartment, where she used a coat closet to store chocolate and a dining room for extra refrigerator space, Mrs. Pinkney began by baking surprise birthday cakes that unemployed actors and actresses in tuxedos delivered. When that business matured, Mrs. Pinkney expanded her product line and moved into her current location, a nondescript storefront in a largely residential district.
Dessert Kitchen remains a decidedly low-tech venture; there are two home ovens and conventional Pyrex measuring equipment. Everyone on the staff, which at peak seasons does not exceed a dozen, serves as baker, clerk and deliverer. Even Mrs. Pinkney delivers, using her van to shuttle warm Blobbs and cakes to customers each evening on her way home.
And at the end of the day, is she sick of chocolate? ''The answer is you never get tired of licking the bowl and tasting,'' Mrs. Pinkney said. ''When people ask when did I start the business, I say 43 pounds ago.''
Dessert Kitchen, 721 West Wrightwood Street, Chicago, Ill., 60614 (312-525-1116), is open Monday to Saturday, 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. It sells to order, or by mail or at the store. There is no minimum order.

HEADLINE: Capital Restaurants Born of Global Politics

BYLINE: By JOAN NATHAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Ten years ago Gabriel Aubouin, the private chef for the French Ambassador in Washington, decided to open a restaurant. ''A backer offered me $100,000,'' Mr. Aubouin, 43 years old, said. ''That was the opportunity I was waiting for.''
Today Mr. Aubouin and his partner, the former maitre d'hotel at the French Embassy, Raymond Campet, own La Brasserie, a popular French bistro on Capitol Hill. ''I wanted to stay here because the opportunity to open a restaurant was greater and more exciting than in France,'' Mr. Aubouin said. Mr. Aubouin's tale reflects a peculiar Washington tradition of embassy workers who leave their jobs to open restaurants. In the last few years, Alain Roussel, the chef at the French Embassy, opened La Ferme in Chevy Chase, Md., and Pierre Chauvet, chef at the Dutch Embassy, opened La Fourchette in Adams-Morgan, a Washington neighborhood with many ethnic restaurants. 
Sometimes new restaurants open out of political necessity rather than economic opportunity. After Governments changed in Iran and Ethiopia, for example, Iranian and Ethiopian restaurants opened around Washington, serving a ready market of political refugees who missed their families and their food. Restaurant watchers are now betting on when Panamanian and Eastern European restaurants will begin opening.
David Carliner, a Washington immigration lawyer, said people who seek asylum in the United States are permitted to work and to open their own businesses. Many are former embassy officials, and restaurants offer an excellent outlet for their diplomatic skills.
Eight Ethiopian restaurants opened in Washington in the 1980's. One of the oldest, the Red Sea, opened eight years ago in Adams-Morgan. ''We were students; one worked at the embassy,'' one of the three owners, Ghennet Gabre Medhin, said. ''We didn't want to go back to Ethiopia. The first year it was the three partners who did all the cooking. Now we are one step up. We have a cook.'' Most of the restaurants open outside the high-rent district of downtown Washington. Nguyen Van Thoi, who left Vietnam by boat in 1979, owns two Vietnamese restaurants in northern Virginia, including My An 2, a tiny restaurant in a shopping center in Falls Church that has several Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants. In Vietnam, Mr. Van Thoi was an administrator for the Agency for International Development. ''When I came here I studied aviation and then worked in a gas station,'' he said. ''If you are not a mechanic or technician, which I am not, a gas station is a terrible job. I worked hard and didn't make any money.''
Like Greek, Chinese and Jewish immigrants before him, Mr. Van Thoi employs members of his family. ''Your family can save you lots,'' he said. ''There is less waste and no stealing.''
''I know public relations and how to greet the people,'' he went on. ''I am one of the people most successful, but don't kid yourself, most of these restaurants fail.''
Not all the people fleeing political regimes arrive in the United States penniless. Across the street from the Red Sea is Meskerem, the fanciest of the Ethiopian restaurants, with brightly painted tiles decorated with Ethiopian motifs. ''My husband and I left Ethiopia and made some money in Saudi Arabia,'' Nafisa Said, 33, who runs the restaurant, said. ''When we came here we thought there was a market for Ethiopian food.''
When the Shah of Iran fell in 1979, Fatola Samiy was the educational counselor at the Iranian Embassy. He and his wife, Simin, had been collecting furniture to take back to their home in Teheran. With no possibility of returning to Iran, Mrs. Samiy went to work cooking. The antiques found a new home at the Caspian Tea Room, a restaurant the Samiys opened in a shopping center in the Spring Valley section of Washington, a residential area.
Like owners of many other ethnic restaurants, the Samiys learned that it was wise to have a menu with ethnic and American dishes. ''There are not many Iranians who live in this neighborhood,'' Mrs. Samiy said. ''We have to adjust our menu for our American and Iranian customers.''
If politics governs restaurant trends, what is next in the nation's capital? ''Washington will continue to be a magnet for emigres,'' said Joel Denker, author of ''Capitol Flavors,'' a portrait of Washington's ethnic restaurants. ''I see Somali cafes, Haitian Creole eateries, and even more Pakistani kebab shops.''

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
In 1989, for the third year in a row, Americans drank less wine than the year before. But as they have been doing regularly for more than a decade, they continued to drink more good wine: sales of premium wines, while they constitute only a tiny segment of the wine business, were up.
In a report published in Wines and Vines, a trade magazine, Jon Frederikson and Louis Gomberg, industry analysts here, estimated that the entire American wine market, including imports, was off about 8 percent last year. It was down to 511 million gallons, they said, or a little less than 3 gallons for each American age 21 and over. What's more, they predicted that the trend would continue and that the market would be down 5 percent more this year. 
The biggest drop was in wine coolers, a hybrid product made from wine, fruit juice and carbonated water that dominated the so-called pop wine category just a few years ago. Some 85 million gallons of wine coolers were produced last year, 21 percent less than the year before, the report said.
In dropping so precipitously, wine coolers are following the path of a variety of wine or wine-based novelties that gained wide acceptance and then dropped into insignificance. Among them were bottled sangria, cold duck and apple wine. Lambrusco, another enormous success a few years ago, has dropped back but still has substantial sales. White zinfandel is probably the favorite pop wine of the moment.
After wine coolers, the champagne category dropped the most: 9 percent. The category includes both imported and domestic sparkling wines. The report attributed much of the decline to the nationwide crackdown on drunken driving. ''Most sparkling wine is consumed away from home,'' Mr. Frederikson said in an interview last week, ''and people are very concerned about what and how much they drink when they're out.''
It was the fifth consecutive year of decline for the sparkling-wine category, which experienced dramatic increases in the late 1970's and early 1980's. In those years, dozens of California wineries began making sparkling wine, and big sparkling-wine producers in France and Spain built extensive wine-making centers in this country. Some of those wineries are just now coming into full production.
Table wine - the most popular category, at 330 million gallons - was off only 3 percent last year, mostly in lower-end jug wines.
What has happened to sparkling wine mirrors to some extent the experience of the entire wine industry.
After dramatic, often double-digit, expansion in the 1970's, the market began to cool off at the end of the decade and at the beginning of the 1980's. But there was enough momentum to sustain some growth until 1987, when for the first time, overall production was off, by 1 percent. In 1988, it fell 5 percent more.
If the Frederikson-Gomberg prediction of total 1990 production of 488 million gallons is accurate, production will have declined almost 100 million gallons in four years.
The report sees a further drop of 2 percent in table wine this year, a 6 percent decline in sparkling wine and a 15 percent falloff in wine coolers.
Two bright spots in the otherwise gloomy overview were a prediction of continued strength for premium wines and what the report called a ''bottoming out'' in sales of imported wines, which have been falling steadily for five years.
Premium wines are hardly high priced by most standards: they are defined by the industry as wines costing more than $3 for a 750-milliliter bottle. That seemingly covers the cheapest of wines, and yet represents only 5 percent of the American market.
The report predicted gains not only for French and Italian wines but for wines from Latin America and the newly active wine-producing Eastern bloc nations.
When the dollar began to slide in 1985 and imported wine prices began to climb, most pundits predicted a new golden age for American premium-wine producers. In some ways, the opposite has happened. The price increases posted by California wine makers recently have provided new incentives for foreign wine makers to fight for a share of this lucrative market. Spain, Italy, Chile and to some extent Australia have done just that.
In a separate report, Hambrecht & Quist Inc., a San Francisco investment company with a special interest in the wine industry, is cautiously optimistic about the wine market for the 1990's. John Fisher, the managing director, said there would be sustained growth, particularly in the super-premium and ultra-premium catgories, while jug wines and spirit sales would continue to fall.
Mr. Fisher defined premium wines as those costing $3 to $7 a bottle, super-premiums $7 to $13 and ultra-premiums $13 and up.
Hambrecht & Quist reported that important advances in grape growing and wine making in recent years have enabled big wineries - those producing 250,000 cases or more - to make and sell super-premium and ultra-premium wines that once were assumed to be the exclusive domain of the California boutique wineries.
The report cited as an example the barrel fermentation of chardonnay wine, in which the wine is actually fermented in small oak barrels rather than in huge stainless-steel tanks. Once limited to small wineries, barrel fermentation is now ''measured in the tens of thousands of barrels, not the hundreds,'' the report said.
''The boutique barrier to quality,'' it concluded, ''is forever broken.''
The economies of size and the marketing clout of the larger wineries will, as the Hambrecht & Quist report put it, intensify ''competitive pressures across all levels of the winery size spectrum.''
As the consumers who created the wine boom of the 1970's and early 1980's age, the report said, the ''emphasis on drinking lighter, better and more healthful beverages is felt throughout the market.''
''The premium-wine industry of the 90's will continue to benefit from the decline of spirits and jug wines driven by 'less but better' philosophy,'' it continued. ''Unfortunately, the same trends will drive some current wine drinkers to waters, seltzers and other nonalcoholic adult beverages.''
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Gloria 1986, Bordeaux, about $12.
 
Since Chateau Gloria was rocketed into prominence a decade or more ago by a magazine story about its owner, Henri Martin, the wine has consistently lived up to its high reputation. The wines of St.-Julien have always been the most accessible of the Medoc wines, which are usually considered the most austere of all Bordeaux wines. Chateau Gloria - which is ranked as a cru bourgeois, or bourgeois growth - may not display the depths of a Ducru-Beaucaillou or a Beychevelle, but it is invariably delicious and a good value. The 1986 vintage was particularly successful in St.-Julien, as this bottle will attest.

HEADLINE: Tim Curry Plunges Ahead Into the Past, Part IV

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
Sitting in the lobby of the Manhattan Theater Club, a smile on his face, is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, William Shakespeare, Tristan Tzara and William Hogarth. Or, to put it another way, sitting in the lobby of the Manhattan Theater Club, a smile on his face, is the English actor Tim Curry.
Playing historical figures has been something of a specialty for the 43-year-old Mr. Curry, and at one time or another he has portrayed all of the above. He was the original Mozart on Broadway in Peter Shaffer's ''Amadeus,'' and he got a 1981 Tony nomination for his work. He was Shakespeare on British television in the 1970's, in a series written by John Mortimer. He portrayed Tzara, the Dadaist and apostle of the irrational, in Tom Stoppard's ''Travesties'' on Broadway in 1975. And now he is playing Hogarth at the Manhattan Theater Club in ''The Art of Success,'' Nick Dear's bawdy and provocative tale of a day in the life of the 18th-century English artist.
 
Playing With the Facts
Mr. Curry says he does not approach his historical characters differently from the way he prepares for such roles as the dastardly Rooster Hannigan in the film version of ''Annie'' or the transsexual Transylvanian villain Frank 'n' Furter in the cult movie ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'' 
''It's much more a matter of playing the characters as they were written by the authors,'' Mr. Curry says, ''because of the liberties that have been taken with pretty much all of them. They've all been distorted in one way or another, because the authors have hardly stuck to the facts. When I was playing Mozart, I really read very little about him, because I thought what was really important was to play not only Peter Shaffer's Mozart but also the Mozart who's seen through the eyes of his enemy Salieri.
''I think that if you get too close to the character, if you do too much historical research, you may find yourself defending your view of a character against the author's view, and I think that's terribly dangerous.''
For Hogarth, Mr. Curry says, ''I just looked at the pictures.'' And in a sense, he says, there was little point in doing extensive historical research for ''The Art of Success,'' ''because it's really a very modern play.''
 
Purpose of 'Success'
In ''The Art of Success,'' Mr. Dear uses the politics and the sexuality of 18th-century London, as seen through Hogarth and his friend the playwright and novelist Henry Fielding, to reflect on the greed and success-at-any-price ethic he sees in 1980's England. Mr. Dear has condensed episodes from 10 years in Hogarth's life into a 24-hour period. They include his marriage to the daughter of the official royal painter and his encounters with a prostitute, a killer and Robert Walpole, the British Prime Minister. There are discussions of the relations between the sexes, the role and the purpose of the artist in society and the problems of governmental censorship as well as the censorship an artist may impose on himself in his attempt to get ahead.
''Hogarth has really been taken hostage to Nick Dear's view of Thatcher's England,'' Mr. Curry says. ''The sort of economic greed of the 80's, at the end of the Industrial Revolution, is very similar to the part of the 18th century shown in the play, which was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and indeed of the British Empire.''
 
The Role of the Artist
The play, Mr. Curry says, is really about ''the moral responsibility of the artist - is there one, really? - and indeed the political responsibility of the artist.'' It's about making political compromises to succeed in your career, about the dilemma of the artist's position in society: to what degree the artist can be both a social critic and dependent on the state for a living.
''They're the kind of questions any artist in the 20th century would be asking himself,'' he says. ''Why am I doing this? Am I doing this for any kind of really valid reason? I think artists are driven by the engine of their own talent, but it's a question of what use they put it to.''
The play, he says, ''is also a discussion about how the wheels of censorship grind into motion and why it's important that they be stopped.''
''Reading the play, you couldn't help but think of the Mapplethorpe photographs,'' Mr. Curry says, referring to the decision last year by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington to cancel an exhibition that included homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. The exhibition was partly paid for by the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Corcoran feared adverse Congressional reaction. ''Anything to strike a blow in Mapplethorpe's defense is well worth doing,'' Mr. Curry says. #200 Years of Censorship In ''The Art of Success,'' Walpole creates a theater licensing system, a form of censorship, to stop Fielding from criticizing him in his plays. The real Walpole also created such a system.
''I was in the first play in London to be done after the theater licensing act was repealed,'' Mr. Curry says. ''It was repealed the day before I started to work in 'Hair,' in 1968. So between the 1730's and 1968 there was more than 200 years of censorship in England.''
Mr. Curry was born, toward the end of those more than 200 years, in Cheshire, in the west central England. His interest in performing began early. ''I was a boy soprano,'' he says. ''I sang in church from the age of 6 or 7, which I guess started it really.'' He went to the University of Birmingham, which was one of the first universities in England to offer a drama degree, ''and at the time I wasn't really sure whether I wanted to be an actor or a singer; so I talked my way into 'Hair' and postponed the decision for another year or so.''
His indecision continued for many years. He would alternate stints of acting with making rock-and-roll records and touring with a band. After doing ''Travesties,'' ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' and the stage version, ''The Rocky Horror Show,'' in London and on Broadway, he quit acting and devoted himself to rock-and-roll. But then came ''Amadeus.''
 
The Return to Acting
''When I did 'Amadeus,' I hadn't done a play for five years,'' he says. ''And I was so happy doing it and felt so foolish that I hadn't done a play for such a long time that I wanted to go back and really kind of reach out for a classical career.''
So he went back to London and joined the National Theater for two seasons, where he performed in ''The Rivals'' by Sheridan, ''The Threepenny Opera'' - ''a dreadful, abortive production of a play I'd always wanted to do and then made a terrible pig's ear of'' - and the Tom Stoppard adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ''Dalliance.''
He made a couple of movies, including ''Legend,'' in which he played the Lord of Darkness, and ''Clue,'' in which he was the butler Wadsworth. He also played Bill Sikes in a television movie version of ''Oliver Twist.'' And he is in the coming ''Hunt for Red October.''
Recently, he spent a year touring the United States in the road company of ''Me and My Girl.'' There is a movie on the horizon for him after ''The Art of Success,'' he says, but it's not definite yet, so he isn't ready to talk about it.
One thing he will talk about is the fact that he has abandoned rock-and-roll. ''It really is a young man's game,'' he says.
These days, he says, he's ''pretty much concentrating on acting,'' and specifically on acting in movies. He has even sold his home in London and bought one in Los Angeles.
''I moved to L.A.,'' he says, ''because that's where they point cameras at you. And that's what I'd like them to do.''

HEADLINE: Japan Stakes Out Nearby Markets

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
From Taipei to Bangkok to Jakarta, Japan's largest securities firms are rushing to open new offices, beef up their staffs, set up new investment funds and start joint ventures in their own backyard - Asia.
The flurry of moves amounts to a reorientation of the global ambitions of the big Tokyo securities houses. It is partly an effort to cash in on the region's rapid economic growth, but the Asian push also reflects Japanese frustration with the meager profits and stiff competition encountered by their Wall Street operations. In Western Europe, they are worried that the planned economic unification of 1992 may block them from new opportunities in the European markets.
Japan's Big Four securities firms - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - are staking out Asia's young but booming capital markets as, in effect, their own bloc. To be sure, the Tokyo firms stress that the United States and Europe will continue to be integral to their strategies, because of their size and because Japanese customers are still pouring huge amounts of capital into Western economies. But Asia will get far more attention in the pursuit of more profitable business. 
''For Daiwa, the United States is a kind of laboratory for new financial products,'' explained Tetsuo Yoshino, general manager of Daiwa's international planning department. ''But when we look at the dynamic Asian economies, we are looking at the 21st century.''
For American and European securities houses, which often moved earlier than their Japanese rivals into established East Asian financial markets like Hong Kong and Singapore, the Japanese assault is viewed as a formidable challenge.
''They have more capital and more patience than any other firms in the world,'' said Michael Dobbs-Higginson, chairman of Asia-Pacific operations of Merrill Lynch & Company. ''Belatedly, they are bound to become the most important firms in their own backyard, leapfrogging non-Japanese firms.''
For years, the Japanese firms merely sold Japanese stocks to wealthy Asian investors through their offices in the region. But with the area's rapid expansion and a trend among many Southeast Asian governments to dabble less in industry and rely more on private capital to fuel development, the stock markets of these nations seem on the verge of a growth boom.
To exploit that opportunity, the Japanese firms have started to move into ''higher quality'' business, underwriting securities and forming mutual funds - providing vehicles that allow the Japanese to invest in these markets and help Asian companies to acquire other companies.
''Now is the time, because this is when the markets in Asia are really growing and opening up,'' said Akiyoshi Ito, director of Yamaichi Securities' international division.
This shift by Japan's biggest securities houses marks the start of a new international offensive after the sobering problems they ran into in the United States during the 1980's.
Despite the commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars in capital and hundreds of staff members to their Wall Street offices, the Japanese firms failed either to build a substantial market share or to show a meaningful profit.
Hitoshi Tonomura, executive managing director in charge of international operations at Nomura, the world's largest securities firm, said that Nomura's Asian operations outside Japan, although less than a third as big as its American operations, are more profitable. The three other big firms have confronted similar problems in the United States.
 
Rethinking Strategies
Their experience on Wall Street has forced the Japanese firms to rethink their strategies. An early sign of the new direction emerged last year when Yoshihisa Tabuchi, chief executive of Nomura, said in a much quoted interview that ''Nomura's strength is our influence throughout Asia, not just in Japan.''
Mr. Tabuchi added that Asia was where Nomura had a competitive advantage and that the firm intended, finally, to exploit that edge. As is often the case in Japan, when the leader started to move, the other firms quickly followed suit.
With Japan as its anchor and smaller states expanding even faster, East Asia is the world's fastest-growing region. For example, the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand - grew 7.4 percent last year, compared with a 3.4 percent rate for the industrialized nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 
More Opportunity for Growth
''In Europe and the United States, you have more mature markets; the growth will be limited,'' said Takahira Ogawa, manager of Nikko's Asia and Oceania division. ''The growth possibilities in Asia are much, much greater, and will be for some time.''
These are among the steps taken by the Japanese firms in Asia:
* Last week, the four big firms said they had agreed to acquire small stakes, from 5 to 10 percent, in Taiwan brokerage houses. Although volatile, Taiwan's stock exchange is one of the hottest in Asia, with the value of shares traded there surpassing that of London. Wealthy Taiwanese are also increasingly looking for opportunities to invest in Japan and other foreign markets.
* Nomura was joint lead manager last November, along with the brokerage unit of the Bankers Trust Company, of the first Euromarket offering of its kind, a $100 million convertible bond issue for Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing of Taiwan. Japanese executives said the offering, which provided a rare opportunity for outsiders to buy Taiwanese securities directly, will be followed this year by at least a dozen more.
* Several of the firms have formed joint ventures in Jakarta to help build Indonesia's nascent securities market. There are only about two dozen listed companies now, but the Government is encouraging more companies to go public, which would provide new underwriting business and broader investment opportunities for Japanese firms.
* Several of the firms have opened representative offices in Thailand, and have begun, or expect to begin soon, Thai mutual funds.
* The firms are all substantially enlarging operations in the regional centers of Hong Kong and Singapore. For instance, Yamaichi wants to double its 70-member Hong Kong staff and 60-person Singapore staff ''as soon as possible,'' Mr. Ito said.
 
The China Question
The Asian push by Japanese securities firms is not across-the-board and not without pitfalls.The region's largest country, China, is still many, many years away from having active financial markets, the executives said. Some of the firms have made substantial investments in China -Nomura, for instance, has developed a hotel in Shanghai and an office building in Beijing - but expect no return soon.
The ties to China have also constrained the Japanese firms in Taiwan. Japan's Finance Ministry permitted the firms to invest in Taiwanese securities firms only recently, out of fear of upsetting China, and even then the approved investments were limited. They were also made indirectly, through Hong Kong subsidiaries of the brokerage houses.
''Frankly speaking, we do hope to open our own office eventually'' in Taiwan, said Mr. Yoshino of Daiwa. ''This is the best we can do for now.'' In addition, most of the markets in the region can absorb relatively small amounts of capital. Japanese institutions are often looking to invest tens of millions of dollars, sums that would swamp many of Southeast Asia's markets if pumped in too quickly.
''By our standards, these markets cannot take much capital efficiently,'' conceded Mr. Ogawa of Nikko.
 
Some Resentment Lingers
Not least, after Japan's brutal conquest of most of Southeast Asia in World War II, the Japanese are still resented in some countries. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in South Korea, where hostility toward Japanese companies can run high.
For their part, Asia's smaller economies still fear being dominated by Japan's financial powerhouses. ''Don't misunderstand, we are not invading them,'' said Mr. Yoshino of Daiwa, trying to tiptoe around the sensitive issue. ''This is a form of cooperation. We have the expertise and capital to help them develop.''
That, in fact, may be the Japanese firms' strong suit. They can help Asian financial markets mature and expand, bringing expertise in addition to capital and new investors -while building huge market shares.
''The point is that these economies don't yet have a financial infrastructure that links them to the major markets,'' Mr. Tonomura of Nomura said. ''That is what we are providing.''

U.S. Bond Auction Goes Poorly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Federal Government's first auction of 40-year bonds since the mid-1950's went poorly yesterday, as investors demanded higher-than-expected interest rates on $5 billion worth of bonds issued by the Resolution Funding Corporation that will be used to finance the bailout of insolvent savings institutions.
The higher-than-expected interest rates will cost the Government more than $200 million over the life of the bonds.
Bids on the securities produced an average yield of 8.60 percent, about 10 basis points, or hundredths of a point, above where the bonds had been offered in when-issued trading earlier in the day.
And after the results were announced, the price of the bonds slipped further. By late in the day the securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.66 percent. 
 
Other Signs of Weakness
The interest rates were not the only sign of weakness.
Demand was tepid, with $8.16 billion worth of bids received. By comparison, the last Treasury auction of 30-year bonds, in November, brought $20.4 billion in bids for the $10 billion in bonds that were sold.
And the Resolution Funding Corporation's first sale of $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds in October generated $12.9 billion in bids.
Moreover, the bids on yesterday's issue covered an unusually wide range.
Nearly 60 percent of the bids were at a price to yield 8.65 percent, while the low bids came in at a price to yield 8.55 percent. In most Treasury auctions, the difference between high and low bids is generally 1 to 2 basis points.
''This is a lot worse than expected,'' a trader who deals in Government agency issues said. ''It's very ugly.''
 
Officials Satisfied
Still, officials at Refcorp, as Resolution Funding is known in the credit markets, said they were satisifed.
''We shaved 12 basis points off the bonds sold in October,'' said William S. Jasien, a spokesman for the agency, which was established by Congress to oversee the savings bailout. ''That was our objective. Unfortunately, it happened at a time when the market was not hospitable.''
The auction results also produced a sharp selloff in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds. Prices of most issues, which had risen earlier in the day, plunged after the results were announced late in the day.
Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on activity in the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets, said the high bids showed that ''a small percentage of dealers wanted to be darn sure they got these bonds,'' adding, ''As far as the rest of the investor community is concerned, they were not interested in bonds at these yield levels.''
 
Japanese Not Involved
The investors in the 40-year bonds apparently did not include the Japanese.
The Japanese ''prefer 30-year bonds,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Mr. McCarthy and others said the lack of Japanese participation at the auction raised questions about whether Japanese investors would be active buyers at the Treasury's quarterly refinancing auctions in February.
But Mr. Brachfeld commented, ''I don't think it says anything about how the refunding auctions will go.''
The 8 1/8 percent Refcorp bonds sold in October were trading at a price to yield 8.77 percent late yesterday. The auction of the 40-year bonds marked the first time the Government has sold securities with such a long maturity since 1955.
 
Reduce Financing Costs
''One of the purposes of Refcorp is to reduce financing costs, and they accomplished that,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''But you can safely say that the Treasury will not issue a 40-year bond to replace the 30-year bond.''
The price of the Treasury's outstanding 8 1/8 percent bond of 1919 pl,mmeted after the results of the auctiowewere annncnced.
In le e tradin t the clo 1/4,ly watched issue was offered at a price of 97 3/32, down nearly a full point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.39 percent.
Treasury note issues also took a beating, especially intermediate- to long-term issues.
By late in the day, the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 30/ 32, down half a point, to yield 8.33 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 97 7/8, down 3/8 of a point, to yield 8.25 percent.
Interest rates on the $10 billion worth of two-year notes to be sold at auction today also rose.
The notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.17 percent late yesterday, up from a late offered rate of 8.10 percent on Monday. Treasury bill rates inched higher. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.67 percent late yesterday, up 3 basis points. And six-month bills were offered at 7.59 percent, also up 3 basis points.
 
Kodak 'Step Down' Notes
In the corporate bond market, the Eastman Kodak Company priced $500 million worth of ''step down'' floating-rate notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The notes, which mature Jan. 20, 1993, carry their name because interest rates on the securities decline at specified times in the course of the loan.
The notes, which were priced at par, or $100, are noncallable for one year.
For the first year, rates on the notes will be the one-month commercial paper rate plus 30 basis points. In the second year the spread, or difference, over one-month commercial paper shrinks to 25 basis points. And in the third year the spread over one-month commercial paper falls to 20 basis points.
The commercial paper rate is set the third Wednesday of each month, with the first rate set on Jan. 29.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Investors in the tax-exempt municipal bond market snapped up an $837 million issue of general revenue bonds from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.
The negotiated issue consists of serial and term bonds. Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6 percent on bonds maturing in 1991 to 7.50 percent on bonds that mature in 2004.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated A by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Most Employers Coveting Frequent-Flier Bonus Miles

BYLINE: By PHILIP S. GUTIS

 BODY:
Corporations are increasingly wrestling with their employees to claim frequent-flier bonuses from airlines as travel costs soar and the economy slows.
Frequent-flier programs, which were introduced 11 years ago, typically offer free upgradings to first class and free flights to passengers who log a certain number of miles. At first, many companies took the position that having paid for the tickets, they deserved to get any bonuses earned by their employees on business trips. But the structure of the programs and an overwhelming resistance by employees to give up what they saw as a new benefit quickly led most companies to abandon their efforts. 
Now, under pressure from a sluggish economy and business travel costs that rose 94 percent in the 1980's, according to the Runzheimer International Business Travel Price Index, corporate travel managers are trying a variety of ways to reclaim frequent-flier bonuses.
Some, like the Boeing Corporation, use get-tough policies ranging from monitoring the return of bonus points accumulated by employees to restating longstanding corporate policy against using the bonuses for personal use.
But others, the Unisys Corporation notable among them, have decided a share-the-fortune approach is better. They offer their employees cash or other incentives to turn the bonuses in for company use.
''As air fares go up, companies tighten budgets and corporate travel managers come under pressure to cut costs, frequent-flier programs are something that is being looked at,'' said Margie L. Crace, the president of the National Business Travel Association, an organization of corporate travel managers.
Still, it is unlikely that most companies will make stringent efforts to take the bonuses from employees, according to travel managers and people who monitor the frequent-flier programs. Because awards are registered in personal accounts - designed by the airlines to increase ''brand loyalty'' among travelers and their families - it is difficult for companies to keep track.
Ms. Crace is travel manager at Chemed/DuBois, a specialty chemical company in Cincinnati. She said her company has been taking back frequent-flier bonuses since 1984.
 
Employees Fight Back
Even though the airlines expect only 30 percent of all frequent-flier awards to be redeemed, employees still strongly resist giving them up. ''At first, it's like Vietnam, Korea, World War III,'' Ms. Crace said. ''You are against Mom, Apple Pie and America when you try to take the awards.''
One international management consultant said frequent-flier miles should not be taken from employees. The benefits represent ''the scars of business travel,'' he said, because such travel was more of ''a hassle than pleasure.''
That may explain why more than 100 companies have got in touch with Unisys, in Blue Bell, Pa., for information about a strategy it devised for prying loose frequent-flier bonuses from its workers.
Under a program started in April 1989, Unisys, the computer manufacturer, gives employees who agree to use their bonus points for business travel half the cash value of the air fare saved.
Robert W. Anderson, the company's director of corporate travel, said many employees had accumulated so many bonus points that they would never be able to use them all for personal travel. The program, he said, benefits both company and employee.
 
'Money in the Hand'
''There is more to a trip than just the air fares,'' Mr. Anderson said, ''and if you don't have the money to take a big trip - or the vacation time - then our program offers money in the hand and it certainly helps the company.''
In the first nine months of the voluntary program, Mr. Anderson said, Unisys saved about $100,000 -which he concedes is minuscule when compared with the company's air fare costs last year of about $75 million. But he said he expected more of the 25,000 eligible employees to participate this year and projected saving 10 percent of Unisys's air fare costs.
Other companies are more strict about wanting it all. In Dallas, the Halliburton Company, the diversified energy and construction concern, told its more than 60,000 employees last year that they would no longer be able to keep frequent-flier awards accumulated on business trips. ''I'm not aware of any problems that we've had with the new policy,'' said Guy Marcus, Halliburton's vice president for investor relations. ''The employees recognize that it is the company that buys the tickets.''
 
Boeing's Savings
Boeing, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer, has never allowed employees to use awards for personal travel. It closely scrutizes ticket reimbursements to insure that bonuses are returned to the company. A spokesman, Bob Jorgensen, said that last year the company used the bonuses to save about $1 million on an annual travel budget of $100 million.
When new employees join Boeing, Mr. Jorgensen said, many grumble about losing frequent-flier benefits. To assauge them, the company said that any money saved on air fares is credited to an employees' department. ''That way the money comes back to your organization,'' he said, ''if not to you.''
Following the airlines' lead, many hotel chains and rental car agencies have started their own frequent-traveler bonus programs. But because air travel is usually the most costly part of corporate travel over all, companies are focusing on ways to cut that expense.
Ken Heldt, managing director of Frequent Flyer Services of Colorado Springs, said that on average a company could cut total air fare costs by 7 to 10 percent. His company analyzes corporate travel budgets to help managers determine how much they can save through reclaiming bonus awards and how to track the awards.
His clients, he said, have included large international operations like the Amoco Oil Corporation and the Union Carbide Corporation as well as the small but travel-dependent scouting team for the Chicago Cubs.
While these companies are interested in seeing how much they can save by reclaiming awards, Mr. Heldt said he often advised sharing.
''It still gives employees some incentive to make sure that the numbers are put in the computers,'' he said.

U.S. Memories: Who Is the Loser?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
U.S. MEMORIES, R.I.P.: The joint venture formed last year to rescue the American computer industry from the clutches of a Japanese chip cartel died of financial anemia last week. The giant companies it was intended to protect just could not bring themselves to sign checks amounting to a few days' worth of the industry's annual investment budget.
To Sanford L. Kane, U.S. Memories' president, the decision was a sad example of American managerial myopia, of the computer makers' inability to look beyond the current glut in mass-produced memory chips to the day when NEC, Toshiba, Hitachi and friends would once again be in the catbird seat. But to Gary Saxonhouse, a specialist on the Japanese economy at the University of Michigan, the decision seemed more a triumph of cool business logic over chauvinist passion. 
High-tech manufacturers, he said, are happy to play the us-versus-them game on the public's nickel. But with their own money at stake they are far more likely to look to the bottom line.
The American semiconductor industry leads the world in logic chips, the electronic brains of computers and other smart machines. But it has lost its once-dominant position in solid-state memory devices, where efficient manufacturing technology rather than design prowess is key.
While some American companies remain in the forefront of this technology, Japan now makes 70 percent of the standard one-megabit dynamic random access memory chips, known as D-RAM's, and 90 percent of the more advanced four-megabit chips.
To people who think America and Japan are fated to fight it out for king of the industrial hill, that represents a dangerous vulnerability. When the market for D-RAM's again tightens, prices will skyrocket and shortages will be felt most severely by American manufacturers.
And the long-term problems created by dependence on the Japanese may be worse than the temporary supply disruptions. Japanese computer makers, which are mostly divisions of the same companies that manufacture D-RAM's, will be favored with advance knowledge and guaranteed supplies of the next generation of memory chips. That will give them a critical leg up in the fast-paced competition for world markets.
U.S. Memories was meant to blunt the threat. Mr. Kane expected to hit the ground running next year, using technology licensed from I.B.M. to make four-megabit chips, and moving on to 16-megabit designs by mid-decade.
But major domestic consumers of D-RAM's, including Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, never signed on. And other heavyweights, like A.T.&T. and Compaq, would not put up enough cash or sign the long-term purchase contracts needed to finance plant construction. U.S. Memories threw in the towel. That may have surprised Federal officials, who have been persuaded in the past to subsidize research on D-RAM's. And it may have surprised the Japanese Government, which was bullied by Washington back in 1985 to reserve a niche in the world market for American-made memory chips. But it was no shock to Mr. Saxonhouse, who noted that American computer makers probably have less costly ways to assure adequate access to D-RAM's.
I.B.M. is already licensing its advanced chip-making technology to smaller domestic producers. Sun Microsystems is forging strong ties with Fujitsy, a D-RAM maker - a deal that leaves the companies mutually dependent for product technologies. Others are signing long-term contracts with Japanese, South Korean and American chip makers, paying a higher price to be protected against possible supply interruptions.
But most simply do not buy the idea that they are vulnerable to a Japanese power play, Mr. Saxonhouse said, and for good reason. Any serious attempt by the Japanese to withhold chip supplies at a critical moment of the product cycle would induce other companies in other countries to enter the business. And since each generation of chips requires new technology, there would be no insurmountable barriers to entry. ''The Japanese could gouge Sun or Motorola once,'' Mr. Saxonhouse concluded, ''but not twice.''
What if the computer makers are wrong? What if the Japanese somehow parlayed their lead in D-RAM's into a long-term edge in electronics?
Look at the extreme case, Mr. Saxonhouse suggested. Suppose that a lock on the D-RAM market permanently doubled the economic return on $100 billion worth of Japanese capital, and that the extra return came entirely at the expense of American consumers. The annual loss to Americans would be about $10 billion - nothing to sneeze at, surely, but still less than a fifth of 1 percent of national income.
The game is real enough: Strategic decisions by computer makers and their governments could make or break companies, careers and fortunes. But high stakes for corporations do not translate into high stakes for the economy. Mr. Saxonhouse's argument: For the want of a D-RAM the nation will not be lost.

Ford to Defer Merit Raises

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it would defer first-quarter merit pay increases for 55,000 salaried workers in the United States to cut costs in a soft and unpredictable auto market.
The move ''is a recognition that the future is somewhat uncertain because of weak auto industry sales and slowing economic growth, along with an increasingly competitive environment,'' a company spokeswoman, Joy Wolfe, said. 
Earlier this month, the industry leader, the General Motors Corporation, said it was planning broad cost cuts intended to save more than $1 billion.
Ford did not say how much it expected to save with the program but said it was part of an effort to cut costs and increase efficiency.
The No. 2 United States auto maker is seeking savings in other areas, like travel expenses, scheduled overtime for production and office workers, and discretionary spending not linked to product development, Ms. Wolfe said.
Ford said about 52,000 of its salaried work force were in the United States and 3,000 in Canada.

Municipal Bond Upgradings Were Favorable in 1989

 BODY:
Upgradings in the ratings of municipal bonds in 1989 were the most favorable in recent years, according to a report released this week by the public finance department of Moody's Investors Service Inc.
The 240 issues that were upgraded exceeded the 186 that were downgraded by about 30 percent, the financial rating agency said in the annual report. In all, about $38 billion in debt was affected by changes, Moody's noted. 
The report said most changes reflected national trends, like the relative strength of the economy last year and the generally healthy financial condition and favorable debt positions of the bond issuers.
A higher rating on an issuer's bonds makes borrowing costs less expensive, because the ratings reflect the degree of risk that buyers of bonds must assume. Bonds with lower ratings generally must carry higher interest rates in order to attract buyers.
Regions with the most favorable ratios of upgradings to downgradings last year included the Southeast, the Midwest and the Great Lakes area. New Jersey had the most favorable ratio of upgradings to downgradings, followed by New York, Ohio, North Carolina and California.
The region with the least favorable ratio was the Southeast, followed by the Rocky Mountain and Great Plains regions. The poor showing for the Southeast was primarily the result of oil- and real estate-related problems in Texas, which had the most rating reductions, with 26. However, Moody's said the figure was significantly lower than the 46 ratings that were lowered in 1988.
In terms of dollars, Massachusetts had the most debt affected by rating downgradings. On two occasions, a reduction in the state's general obligation debt rating affecting $8 billion of debt.
Rating changes on general obligation and other tax-supported bonds accounted for 75 percent of all revisions, Moody's said, with the ratio of upgradings to downgradings at 5 to 4.
Among municipal revenue bond issues, water, sewer, public power and higher education bonds had more than three times as many upgradings as downgradings, while hospital and housing issues suffered more downgradings than upgradings, the report showed.
Hospital downgradings reflected the continuing financial dificulties stemming from market competition and Medicare reimbursement, Moody's said.

HEADLINE: Haste Urged in Savings-Asset Sales

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
Congress today prodded Federal regulators charged with disposing of the assets of insolvent savings institutions to step up their pace and urged them to sell some single-family homes to low-income buyers.
The House Banking Committee also voted to supboena Michael R. Milken, the billionaire financier, as part of a new investigation into the role of high-yield ''junk bonds'' in the failures of savings and loan institutions, including Charles F. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
The committee, which conducted hearings last fall on the Lincoln failure, also voted to supboena two men involved in land deals with Lincoln, Ernest Garcia and Fernando Acosta. 
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the panel, said Mr. Milken's testimony could ''signal phase 2 of the investigation, which will concentrate on the extent to which trading in junk bonds and subordinated debt contributed to the collapse of Lincoln and other savings institutions.'' Mr. Milken, who pioneered the use of junk bonds in his years at Drexel Burnham Lambert, is now under indictment on securities fraud charges. $22 Billion Spent So Far The regulators who appeared before the House committee today, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, both members of the Government's savings oversight board, said they had so far spent $22 billion for the rescue, including $8.3 billion to pay off certificates of deposit that had come due, and had sold or merged 40 insolvent institutions with about $12 billion in deposits.
Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee criticized what they considered the slow pace of the asset sales by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The agency was created by the industry bailout in August to liquidate or find buyers for insolvent institutions, and to dispose of their assets.
At the beginning of January, the Bush Administration instructed the trust agency to sell as quickly as possible the real estate it had inherited. The savings agency has listed more than 30,000 commercial and residential properties as the first group it will put on the market.
Addressing the members of the trust agency's oversight board, Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, ''You had estimated last September that you could spend $20 billion by October'' in closing or taking over the insolvent savings and loans. ''It's now January, and you've only used $8 billion or $9 billion.''
 
The Problems in the Process
John E. Robson, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, responded to Mr. Schumer by citing ''the problem of creating new institutions'' like Resolution Trust and ''broadening the bidding process'' for properties.
Mr. Robson suggested that the $50 billion provided by the rescue plan might prove inadequate. It is not yet known whether the figure will prove correct ''because of many variables that continue to exist,'' he said. ''These include the pattern of interest rates, the performance of local real estate markets and the general condition of regional economies.''
Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked the Federal overseers: ''To what extent do you intend to utilize your authority to discount sales to low-income buyers?'' The Congressman cited a provision in the bailout law that authorized the trust agency to sell single-family homes to low-income families at below-market value, and to provide low-interest loans to expedite those sales.
Daniel P. Kearney, president of the trust corporation's oversight board, replied that the agency was ''exploring the possibility'' of such sales.
And Mr. Greenspan said that unless such sales were made to low-income families, the agency would violate the spirit of the law.
 
Greenspan Quizzed on Rates
Mr. Greenspan was also questioned about President Bush's comments last week on interest rates. On Friday the President told the National Association of Home Builders that ''low and stable interest rates'' were essential to a growing economy. The previous day, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the Administration hoped the inflation rate and a faltering housing industry would persuade the Fed to loosen credit.
Representative Chalmers P. Wylie of Ohio, the committee's ranking Republican, asked Mr. Greenspan if he was feeling White House pressure to reduce interest rates. Mr. Greenspan replied that he had not felt any pressure and that Mr. Bush had merely stated a fact that most people, including himself, agreed with.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, warned Mr. Greenspan, ''If you didn't see the smoke signals, watch out for the tom-toms.''
Mr. Kemp agreed with Mr. Greenspan concerning the President's statement. ''He wasn't putting any pressure on the chairman,'' Mr. Kemp said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Reports Of Subsiding Soviet Unrest

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar lost value against all major foreign currencies yesterday and finished near its lowest levels of the day in United States trading.
Reports that the unrest was subsiding in Soviet Azerbaijan halted the dollar's recent advance and renewed buying of West German marks. Investor confidence in the dollar was also shaky in the aftermath of Monday's sharp selloff on Wall Street.
Robert Morrissey, a currency trader at the Bank of Boston, said the recent political turmoil in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union had spurred dollar demand and caused dealers to lighten their holdings of marks.
 
'Market Is Fairly Bearish'
But sentiment turned against the dollar again yesterday and interest reappeared in marks. Sales of dollars pushed the dollar past technical support levels and caused additional sales amid trading maneuvers intended to prevent further losses.
''The market is fairly bearish on the dollar and we could see it trade lower,'' Mr. Morrissey said.
Testimony by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, before a Congressional committee had minimal effect on the foreign exchange markets, Mr. Morrissey said. Traders said Mr. Greenspan left only a vague impression that interest rates might move lower sometime in the future.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 145.94 yen, down from 146.51 late Monday. And sterling strengthened further, to $1.6535, from $1.6370 late Monday.
Selected late dollar rates, compared with Monday's late levels, included: 1.6960 West German marks, down from 1.7242; 1.5085 Swiss francs, down from 1.5350; 5.7655 French francs, down from 5.859; 1.1785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1801, and 1,262.25 Italian lire, down from 1,283.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Construction Without Loan Or Tenants

BYLINE: By Shawn G. Kennedy

 BODY:
AS a cadre of dignitaries looked on, ground was broken on Monday for a new 28-story office tower in Fort Lee, N.J.
Noticeably absent from the group, however, was a banker. In an unusual move, David Poskanzer, the project's developer, has started work on his new $150 million, 800,000-square-foot building without a construction loan in place. Also not in place are tenants for the new building, and that is the key to the problem.
Mr. Poskanzer said that Chase Manhattan Bank, which provided the financing for his first two office buildings in the Fort Lee Executive Park, where the new building will go up, decided last year not to serve as lender for the final phase of development there. 
''Right now, there is very little available money for speculative ventures,'' said Mr. Poskanzer, whose complex is at the intersection of Fletcher Avenue and Route 4. ''But what surprised us about Chase's decision not to go forward was that we have proven ourselves with this office park and with 28 other projects. Both of the other buildings here are full. Fort Lee is a strong market - perhaps the strongest in the state. We are doing well, and so are our competitors.''
Although he is confident that a lender will be found, Mr. Poskanzer has not taken Chase's decision lightly. He filed suit in New Jersey Superior Court on Dec. 29 charging the bank with breach of contract and failure to deal in good faith. Officials at Chase have said there is no merit to the suit.
Mr. Poskanzer said that in the past a bank would lend the full construction cost of a project and often accept the value of the land as the builder's equity. Once the project was built and tenants found, permanent financing would be supplied by a pension fund, insurance company or investment group.
Mr. Poskanzer's reaction to tightening purse strings at Chase may be unusual, but other developers are also finding that banks that were enthusiastic lenders in the past are shying away from new projects, particularly those for which no tenants have been signed up. Lenders say this skittishness is a reflection of an overbuilt market in the New York suburbs characterized by high vacancy rates and flat or declining rents, as well as the stricter lending policies that Congress has put on the savings and loan industry.
''There is no question that the current market is making financing more difficult,'' said Stephen Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry group that represents real estate professionals.
Today's tight money is in dramatic contrast to the atmosphere during most of the 1980's, when lenders often pursued developers. During much of the decade, as the region's economy grew briskly, new office centers sprouted throughout the region, tenants took space and rents rose. But the slowdown in the economy and high vacancy rates have made lenders see speculative development in a new light.
One bank, American Savings Bank, based in White Plains, which lent money for some new development projects in the 1980's, stopped financing new construction altogether a few years ago. ''There is not enough reward in the risk-reward equation,'' said H. L. Van Varick, the bank's executive vice president for real estate. ''It is rare to find a project where builders can find a sufficient number of tenants before putting a shovel in ground to put a project in a paying mode as soon as it is finished. But that is what banks are looking for these days.''
Mr. Van Varick said American Savings had not stopped financing real estate ventures but had returned to the business of refinancing completed projects. ''We look for well-located buildings with healthy income streams that do not have to achieve top-of-the-market rents,'' he said. ''In short, we are chasing the same deals as our competitors.''
Jack Shaffer, a chief executive with Sonneblick Goldman, one of the nation's largest mortgage brokerage firms, said: ''Banks are being much more discriminating when it comes to new construction. The office demand curve is flat or declining in all but a few locations. The money for new office projects has not dried up completely, but we find that lenders are requiring more up-front equity -as much as 30 or 40 cents on the dollar - and much less debt.''
Stephen L. Green, a Manhattan investor who recently secured a $20 million construction loan for redevelopment of a 450,000-square-foot office building at 333 East 38th Street, said he had noticed a sharp change in the attitude of lenders.
''Banks are administering the loans they make with a greater degree of care,'' Mr. Green said. ''You have to be able to show that you can increase profits 5 or 10 percent a year without counting on inflation to do it for you.''
Many in the industry, including some developers, see the conservative posture among lenders positively. William L. Klein, vice president of commercial development with H. Hovnanian Investment Properties Inc. in Red Bank, N.J., said: ''It is the responsibility of lenders to ask for equity or signed leases in areas where the supply is greater than the demand. In the long run, overbuilding and panic hurt everyone.''

HEADLINE: Pentagon Freezing Construction As Bush Reviews Arms Priorities

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Pentagon today imposed a three-month freeze on military construction, and President Bush said he would submit a new budget to Congress next week that would begin to ''restructure America's defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes'' in Europe.
At a news conference, Mr. Bush also denounced a proposal by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York to cut Social Security taxes. And the President announced that he would support a Congressional proposal to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency to a Cabinet department.
The construction freeze, ordered by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in a memorandum to senior Pentagon officials, halts all new military construction projects and modifications to existing contracts. It is intended to give the Pentagon time to revise its future construction plans but is unlikely to save much money now. 
 
Plans to Close More Bases
In addition to the temporary freeze, a Pentagon official said, Mr. Bush will present Congress on Monday with a ''hefty'' list of bases he wants to close, most likely including some Air Force and Army bases in Germany. The list goes beyond the 86 bases already being closed or scaled back under last year's Congressional order. It is not known how many more bases the Pentagon will ask Congress to shut down.
Directed by Mr. Bush to begin cutting Pentagon spending, Mr. Cheney on Jan. 13 ordered a moratorium on hiring in the Defense Department through Oct. 1 that is expected to eliminate 50,000 jobs out of a work force of 1.05 million civilians.
Mr. Bush also plans other management changes at the Pentagon, which he has not detailed. Officials have said those changes would save $2.3 billion in the Defense Department budget in the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Pentagon officials have said the military budget would total $295 billion, or a decrease of 2 percent from the current fiscal year after inflation is taken into account.
 
Hopes to Head Off Congress
The President's comments, and the Pentagon's actions so far, seem largely intended to head off Congressional efforts to dictate a new military strategy and tell the Pentagon how it should restructure American forces. Administration officials hope to avoid reductions in Pentagon spending beyond cuts already incorporated into their proposed fiscal 1991 budget.
Mr. Bush opened the selling campaign for that budget at his news conference today with his comments on military strategy and by calling the Social Security tax cut proposed by Mr. Moynihan, Democrat of New York, a ''sleight of hand'' that would end up producing an increase in other taxes.
Although he said an alternative proposal was ''worthy of consideration,'' Mr. Bush stopped short of endorsing a measure by Representative John Porter, Republican of Illinois.
Mr. Moynihan has proposed reducing the Social Security tax by $62 billion over the next two years to eliminate a surplus in the retirement fund. Mr. Porter today proposed continuing to deduct the Social Security tax from paychecks but refunding the money at the end of each year in the form of a payment to a retirement savings account in the taxpayer's name.
Both the Moynihan and the Porter proposals would end the practice of using the Social Security surplus to offset the Federal budget deficit.
Mr. Bush's comments today drew immediate fire from Mr. Moynihan on the Senate floor. ''I rise for a painful purpose,'' he said, ''to state my disappointment with the remarks made by the President this morning.'' Mr. Moynihan said using the Social Security surplus to offset the budget deficit is ''embezzlement.''
Mr. Bush also endorsed making the Environmental Protection Agency a Cabinet department, saying he was convinced ''that the environmental challenges that face America and the world are so important that they must be addressed from the highest level of our Government.''
 
Foreshadows Speech and Budget
Mr. Bush's news conference foreshadowed the State of the Union Message he will deliver next Wednesday to a joint session of Congress and the budget he will submit on Monday, and was part of a new approach his Administration is taking.
Rather than use the State of the Union Message as a detailed, summary of his major pieces of proposed legislation and of the new budget, Mr. Bush will focus on broader themes, officials said.
Before he speaks, three of the most complicated portions of his new budget will be presented by top Administration officials: William J. Bennett, the Federal narcotics chief, will unveil a new anti-drug abuse program on Thursday; Mr. Cheney will present the military budget on Monday, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will offer new initiatives on family savings on Tuesday.
The speech will also be shorter than average; the current draft, officials said, runs less than 30 minutes. The speech usually lasts 45 minutes to an hour.
 
Details of Freeze
In his memorandum to heads of the military departments today, Mr. Cheney froze all new military construction contracts and any options on existing contracts until April 30, 1990, unless they are required by law or international treaty or to comply with base closings ordered by Congress last year.
Mr. Cheney said the freeze would give the Pentagon time to review its spending plans ''in light of the coming changes in force structure and disposition of the U.S. armed forces.'' He also ordered top Pentagon officials to review all their building plans.
The current military budget includes $8 billion for thousands of construction projects around the world, ranging from major bases to childrens' day care centers. It is always one of the most politically ticklish parts of the military budget, since it involves the future of bases that are an important source of income in Congressional districts and the direction of United States foreign policy.
Mr. Bush said the 1991 Pentagon budget ''begins the transition to a restructured military, a new strategy that is more flexible, more geared to contingencies outside of Europe while continuing to meet our inescapable responsibility to NATO and to maintaining the global balance.''
Mr. Bush's comments drew quick criticism from Congressional Democrats.
''If there is a strategy in what we've seen of the 1991 defense budget, it's so sophisticated that we can't detect it,'' said Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities. ''Perhaps it's a new stealth strategy,'' she said.
Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin, who heads the House Armed Services Committee, said, ''President Bush is finally saying we need a new defense strategy for new times, but it still looks like the Administration is writing the budget first and drafting the strategy later.''

HEADLINE: U.S. FACES STRAINS FROM GLOBAL JUMP IN INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Interest rates in Japan and West Germany are suddenly surging, in the process dragging up American rates at what most economists say is just the wrong moment for the nation's fragile economy.
Rarely has the global economy forced itself so vividly on the United States. West Germany and Japan, currently the engines propelling the world's economic growth, are trying to curb inflation. But their chief tool, higher long-term interest rates, is spilling over into the weak American economy and that could be a hammer blow, further slowing growth.
''This is a terribly inconvenient time to have rates pulled up,'' said Lawrence Veit, an economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. 
 
Free Flow of Money
Experts say the huge Federal deficit has left the American economy hostage to a continual flow of investment funds from abroad.
In today's international economy, with so few legal or practical obstacles to the flow of money across national boundaries, borrowers in this country must match the higher interest rates being offered abroad. Otherwise, savers throughout the world will pursue higher returns by buying the bonds issued in Japan and West Germany.
Although the market's spontaneous forces, not the Federal Reserve, have pushed up long-term rates, the central bank is nevertheless on the spot. The Federal Reserve could stand pat, allowing the market flows to take their course. But the higher interest rates could well nudge the vulnerable American economy into recession.
Higher interest rates have spread throughout the money markets. In the United States, mortgage rates have rebounded in the last month, just when the housing industry is weak. Many corporations, already heavily in debt, are facing higher monthly payments, which would further cut into their profits. Car loans might be pushed up as the higher rates force a General Motors or a Beneficial Finance to pay more for the money they lend to consumers.
 
'It Makes People Nervous'
As in any market, expectations are often self-fulfilling. Lenders who expect interest rates to rise will demand a higher rate before committing funds.
''It makes people nervous,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, a research organization. ''There had been an expectation that interest rates would continue to slide down, and suddenly people have woken up to the idea that maybe they won't.''
A month ago, with the rate on 30-year Treasury bonds at 7.84 percent, no mainstream American economist was predicting its rise to 8.4 percent or forecasting that 30-year mortgage rates would be back to 10 percent after being closer to 9 percent in December. But the steps taken by West Germany and Japan made that chain of events inevitable, economists now say.
This is the first time in more than a decade that American economic growth is significantly less vigorous than in West Germany and Japan. With the robust growth, prices in Germany and Japan have climbed at rates deemed alarming in those inflation-resistant nations.
The West German inflation rate almost tripled last year, to 3 percent, and the prospect for 1990 is for more strong demand. Eastern Europeans are pouring into West Germany at the rate of 2,000 a day, adding to the national demand for goods.
 
Boom Times in West Germany
What is more, a capital spending boom in Europe has drawn heavily on German products, and the country's exports are up strongly. And now the metal workers union, seeking a greater share of the profits, is demanding what amounts to a 15 percent wage increase. The union represents more than 10 percent of the nation's organized labor.
In such a situation, the Bundesbank pushed up interest rates, the classic central bank strategy for curbing an expansion that threatens to increase inflation. The higher rates are intended to raise the cost of the loans that finance spending by consumers and businesses.
Similarly, the inflation rate in Japan more than doubled last year, to 2.5 percent, and workers are seeking a 6 percent wage increase in nationwide negotiations now under way. Rising land prices also were a problem, and, inexplicably, the yen weakened a bit against the dollar, perhaps because of the uncertain outcome of the national election next month. In this situation, the Bank of Japan on Dec. 25 raised its key discount rate by half a percentage point. The move helped to push up 10-year notes to more than 6.3 percent, from 5.5 percent.
Some American economists argue that the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan are overreacting. They contend that inflation is not all that big a problem and they predict that the two central banks will back down soon on interest rates, which are now unusually close to American rates. (Yields on 10-year government notes range from 8.3 percent in the United States to 6.3 percent in Japan.) ''Our current view is that Japan has a case of inflation jitters,'' said Nicholas Sargen, the chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers. ''We can't identify what has changed so much in Japan in recent weeks to trigger such a jump in rates.''
 
A Different Viewpoint
A few economists in this country hold that the rising rates abroad are fortuitous, coming at a time when inflation again threatens the American economy.
These economists argue that recent data - particularly an upturn in industrial production and in the Producer Price Index, an important inflation measure - indicate that the long slowdown in American economic growth ended late last year. As a result, they say, the annual inflation rate, which declined from about 5.5 percent in early 1989 to 4.5 percent by year-end, will be on the rise again by springtime. So, in their view, the higher long-term interest rates forced on the nation by the West Germans and the Japanese will help to arrest the inflation.
Some policy makers at the Federal Reserve show signs of concern that the economy might be rebounding. Two of the central bank's governors, Manuel Johnson and Wayne Angell, have said they see little likelihood of a recession ahead. And Robert L. Parry, president of the Frederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said yesterday that the West Germans and Japanese are only partly responsible for the rise in long-term American rates. ''It seems to me that a prime additional suspect putting pressure on rates is heightened inflationary concerns in the United States,'' he said.
 
Awaiting the G.N.P. Report
But it remains uncertain whether the economy is getting a second wind. Government data measuring developments in recent weeks are still too sparse to tell. The first major assessment will come on Friday, when the Commerce Department releases its initial estimate of what happened to the gross national product in the fourth quarter.
Most economists guess that the G.N.P., which measures the total value of the nation's goods and services, grew by less than 1 percent from September through December. Growth of 1 percent or more would feed the economic-rebound viewpoint while a growth rate of less than five-tenths of one percent would be viewed as evidence that the economy remains very weak.
Whatever the state of the economy, the mechanism through which rising interest rates abroad affect American rates is causing a problem of its own: the increased competition for funds. The United States Treasury in recent years has counted on Japanese buyers to purchase roughly one-third of the long-term securities that the Government issues periodically to finance its budget deficit.
The next major auction of these securities is scheduled for early February, and the question is whether American rates will be high enough to attract not only Japanese investors, but Americans as well. Their alternative is to purchase Japanese or European securities. Salomon, in fact, recommended to clients this week that they consider this possibility.
 
Looking Abroad to Invest
''For the first time in two years, we have told customers that the Japanese bond market may be attractive to U.S. investors,'' Mr. Sargen said. If they agree, then rates on the securities auctioned in early February will have to rise above their current levels to draw investors.
But more than just rates influence investors' decisions. Foreign investors might not purchase Treasuries, for example, if they believe that the dollar will decline in value after they make the purchases. Currently, the dollar is just beginning to fall against the yen and has been losing ground since last fall against the mark. On the other hand, the Japanese might invest here for political reasons, because their Government encourages them to do so.
Right now, neither Japanese nor American nor German investors are buying many bonds, as the selloffs in all three marketplaces in recent days indicate. Most investors are holding their funds in cash, waiting to see what will happen, Mr. Sargen said.

HEADLINE: Azerbaijani Strife Expected to Lift Oil Prices Throughout the World

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Western experts say the ethnic strife in Azerbaijan has begun to disrupt production of oil in the Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer by far and a large exporter. The resulting drop, which comes on top of a decline that began in mid-1987, is expected to contribute to tighter supplies and higher prices for oil around the world at a time when production is also falling in other regions.
Lower Soviet oil production is likely to mean a drop in exports, and that could be particularly troublesome for the nations of Eastern Europe as they wrest with political upheaval. These nations have relied heavily on subsidized oil from the Soviet Union.
But because every oil-thirsty economy drinks from the same barrel, virtually all nations could be affected, market analysts say. The Soviet Union produces about 12 million barrels of oil a day, and exports almost 4 million, including about 2 million to non-Communist nations. 
While Azerbaijan, a republic bordering Iran, produces only about 3 percent of the Soviet Union's oil, it is home to two-thirds of the country's oil services industry, the factories that make the valves, pipes and more specialized equipment needed to operate wells from the Baltic to the Pacific, experts say.
Production of that equipment has suffered as the conflict between Muslim Azerbaijani and Christian Armenian workers has increased, said Thane Gustafson, a professor of government at Georgetown University and an expert on the Soviet energy industry.
''Beginning with the first strikes and demonstrations in November 1988, the Azerbaijanis would put down their tools to go off to the public square,'' he said. ''The Armenians, already in fear, would either disappear or lie low. The Russians remaining would lay down tools, because they didn't want to be left holding the bag and be responsible for the target output.''
Of the fighting in Azerbaijan in recent days, Professor Gustafson added, ''All of that is multiplied by 10 in the wake of the most recent problems,'' when the Soviet Army was sent into Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, and when nationalist sentiments intensified.
James R. Schlesinger, a former Secretary of Energy, said the disruptions in Baku mean the Soviets ''will be short of oilfield equipment at a moment that they need more equipment if they want to sustain production.'' The disruption, he said, ''is likely to have a long, lingering effect.''
 
Poor Drilling Results
The insurrection in Azerbaijan comes on top of a recent history of trouble in the Soviet energy industry. Despite growing demands for investment in other fields and shortages of capital, the country has dedicated huge amounts to drilling in recent years, with smaller and smaller results.
American officials say they expect a decline in Soviet oil production of about 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, even without taking account of the recent violence.
Analysts say the oil industry suffers from the inefficiencies and technological backwardness that other Soviet industries face, only on a larger scale.
The Soviet oil export picture is also affected by trouble in the nation's coal mines, experts say. The Soviet Union has had to make up for coal production lost to strikes by burning more oil.
The Chernobyl nuclear-reactor accident in 1986, which led to shutdowns at other reactors for safety improvements, has had a similar effect. For years, the Soviet Union has tried to use its coal and nuclear power at home and export the oil to earn hard currency.
''We're reaching a confluence of factors that are probably going to send another price shock,'' said Nauman Barakat, first vice president of futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Others are predicting at least a bull market for oil.
''We are very concerned,'' Mr. Barakut said. ''This might be a blessing for the OPEC cartel,'' he said, by weakening a competitor.
The American benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, has been selling at $22 to $23 a barrel in recent days, up $5 from this time last year. Analysts attribute some of the recent strength to expectations of lower Soviet exports.
 
Output Falling Elsewhere
The decline in Soviet exports comes as production is falling in other non-OPEC fields, from the North Sea to Alaska, and among some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries outside the Middle East, like Nigeria and Indonesia.
Thomas McHale, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert and a frequent traveler to the Soviet Union, said a variety of technical and economic problems have been threatening the level of oil production. But he added: ''When you get these political dimensions, all bets are off. This has generated some underlying fear in the United States that has supported our current price spike.''
Strife in Azerbaijan could also disrupt the market for refined products. The republic takes in crude oil from Iran and returns it as finished products, said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst with Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in London.
The condition of the Soviet energy industry and its prospects have long been a subject for groping estimates and speculation among Western experts and, by some accounts, among planners in Moscow.
In 1977, the Central Intelligence Agency forecast that the Soviet Union's oil output would peak in 1980 and then decline sharply, turning the Soviet bloc into a net importer. Professor Gustafson, in a book published by the Princeton University Press last month, said the C.I.A. forecast might have alarmed even the Soviets, who began spending heavily on energy projects soon after. The book is called ''Crisis Amid Plenty: The Politics of Soviet Energy under Brezhnev and Gorbachev.''
 
Further Decline Expected
By everyone's count, Soviet oil production was down last year, falling by 100,000 to 250,000 barrels a day, and may fall by 300,000 barrels a day more this year, which would probably reduce exports to non-Communist nations to a level below the current two million barrels a day. Some experts think the level is already below that.
That oil enters a non-Communist market of about 55 million barrels a day in which virtually all the spare capacity is in a handful of OPEC countries, a situation that makes it easier for producers to agree to reduce their pumping and raise prices.
Part of the Soviets' production problem is the natural decline of their major oilfields in western Siberia. In addition, Western experts say, the Soviets lack the technology needed to extract the harder-to-get oil, and are reluctant to spend scarce hard currency abroad to obtain it.
''Exploration is about at the limit of their capacity,'' said one United States Government expert, who added that Moscow was talking to Western oil companies about using their expertise. But Western experts on the Soviet Union said newly ascendant environmentalists and ardent nationalists in the Soviet Union would oppose exploiting Soviet natural resources for foreign markets.
 
Some Fields Damaged
In addition to a lack of technical innovation, experts say, the Soviets have damaged some oilfields by trying to meet short-term production goals. That has reduced the amount of oil that can be easily recovered.
''They worked off five-year plans, and in many cases did short-term, expedient things that in the long term are detrimental,'' said Herbert M. Ryan, a spokesman for Dresser Industries, a Dallas-based oil services company that sells about $100 million a year in equipment and services to the Soviets and is hoping to sell more. ''Well, the long term is now,'' he said. The condition of the Soviet industry has profound implications for the newly independent states of Eastern Europe. Mr. Varzi, the London analyst, who is a former Iranian diplomat, said that last year, exports to Eastern bloc allies totaled 1.5 million to 1.6 million barrels a day, but ''at the moment, they are running not much more than one million barrels a day.'' As a result, he said, those countries will buy from OPEC at a rate of 1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day this year, more than double the level of three years ago, assuming no increase in demand. That raises OPEC's power in the worldwide market.
 
Hard Currency Needed
What is more, the Soviet exports to Eastern Europe have been at subsidized prices, but Moscow has said it wants to raise prices.
That would help the Soviet Union maintain foreign currency earnings even if the quantity exported were to decline. Nearly half of Soviet foreign exchange comes from energy exports including natural gas, by some estimates, and the need for hard currency is increasing. The country's external debt has risen in the last five years to about $25 billion from $5 billion.
To earn that hard currency, the Soviet economy has paid a very heavy price, experts said. Mr. Gustafson calculated that of the increase in industrial investment from 1985 to 1990, 70 percent went to energy.
He and others think the high level of investment cannot be sustained.
''The oil sector has taken up an incredible amount of capital over the last 20 or 30 years,'' Mr. Varzi said. ''Some of that capital has got to be reallocated to other sectors if the needs of Soviet consumers are going to be at least partially satisfied.''
''With over-allocation, production was beginning to level out,'' he said. ''Now, with under-allocation, what's going to happen?''
If the Soviet Union makes the ruble a convertible, or ''hard,'' currency, it will find it cheaper to buy its oil from the Persian Gulf than to spend huge numbers of rubles to drill in inhospitable places inside the country, economists say.
But other experts say that such a goal is far off, and that no matter what happens to total production, the Soviets will struggle to keep exports high because of the driving need for foreign exchange.
''It's too essential for them,'' said Robert Mabro, director of the Institute for Energy Studies at Oxford University. ''They will do whatever is possible, and divert resources from other industries.''
''There has been a traditional pessimism about Soviet oil production, starting with the C.I.A. report, but they have always managed to struggle on,'' he said. The events in Azerbaijan, he added, ''could produce a hiccup for six months or a year, but I wouldn't rush to conclusions about the longer run.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Softens Its Stance on Return Of the Boat People in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By SHEILA RULE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The United States has softened its opposition to the forced repatriation of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong by indicating at an international meeting here that some boat people could be sent back after a one-year moratorium. But the American insistence on the moratorium effectively prevented any consensus from being achieved at the meeting.
The closed two-day meeting was of a United Nations committee formed to seek a new policy for the 44,000 boat people who have streamed into Hong Kong in the last year and a half.
As the meeting ended today, Robin McLaren, an assistant under secretary in Britain's Foreign Office and head of its delegation here, said that of the 30 countries represented on the committee, only the United States and Vietnam had failed to agree to a proposal that mandatory repatriation start on July 1. 
 
'Fully Tested' Repatriation
Mr. McLaren said the United States insisted that the deportations not begin until Jan. 1, 1991, in order to put in place guarantees on screening methods and the safety of the Vietnamese once they returned, and that Vietnam proposed Oct. 1 of this year.
The United States Embassy said the United States delegation would not comment and referred all inquiries to Washington.
The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, told reporters today in Washington that the ''United States' position on involuntary repatriation has not changed'' and that it remained opposed to the practice ''in principle and in practice.''
Miss Tutwiler said the State Department believed that alternatives to forced repatriation could be ''fully tested'' during the moratorium and ''found to be the most effective means for addressing this problem.''
 
Britain Eager for Agreement
When asked what would happen to people who refused to go voluntarily after the moratorium ended, Miss Tutwiler said, ''We'll cross that bridge when we get there.''
The committee has been deadlocked since its establishment in June, largely because of United States opposition to forced returns. Britain, the colonial authority in Hong Kong, insists that it has no choice but to carry them out eventually.
Mr. McLaren said that it was not Britain's view that there was any need for a moratorium on deportations and that he did not know whether it would forcibly repatriate boat people before some consensus was reached on the issue.
Britain is eager to get an agreement on the repatriations before seasonal winds change in March and boat people sail northeast across the South China Sea. After international protests greeted Britain's repatriation of 51 Vietnamese boat people in December, Britain announced that it would suspend the repatriation temporarily. #12-Month Moratorium Proposed Sergio Vieira de Mello, head of the Asian section of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said High Commissioner Thorvald Stoltenberg had been asked by the committee to consult with ''governments that still have reservations'' about the proposed date on which forced repatriations could resume. He said the United Nations hoped that Britain would refrain from further deportations until the effort to reach a consensus was given a chance to succeed.
Delegates said it appeared for a while that a consensus might be reached after the United States, which had previously steadfastly opposed any mandatory repatriation, softened its position to accept forced returns under certain conditions.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Funseth, who led the United States delegation, reaffirmed the United States' opposition in principle to forced repatriation. But he proposed the 12-month moratorium on any forced repatriations, after which mandatory repatriation would be allowed on the condition that no one be forced to return to Vietnam as long as there were volunteers waiting to return and that there be full international monitoring of the process leading to any mandatory return. A copy of the proposal was obtained by The New York Times.
While welcoming the change in position as the starting point for more discussions, British officials said the moratorium was too long and should be reduced.
 
Vaguely Worded Proposition
At an international conference on Indochinese refugees in June, it was unanimously agreed that the Vietnamese should be screened and that those determined to be economic migrants and not legitimate political refugees should be persuaded to return ''voluntarily.'' But it left in suspension the crucial question of what to do with the Vietnamese who are likely to be denied refugee status but refuse to return to Vietnam. Participants could only agree to a vaguely worded proposition that ''alternative'' solutions should be found if voluntary repatriation did not work ''after a reasonable period of time.''
Britain hopes to eventually empty the crowded Hong Kong detention centers that now house the 44,000 boat people who have arrived since June 1988, when the colony began treating all arriving Vietnamese as illegal immigrants.

Prague Arms Trade to End, Foreign Minister Says

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The Czechoslovak Foreign Minister has promised that the country will end its lucrative worldwide arms exports immediately.
In a wide-ranging interview at his home on Tuesday night, the Foreign Minister, Jiri Dienstbier, a 52-year-old former journalist and former dissident, also said negotiations to get Soviet troops withdrawn from Czechoslovakia were being complicated by Moscow's preoccupation with violence in Azerbaijan, and he expressed the hope that the United States would respond with a comparable gesture if they did withdraw.
He also speculated that German reunification might come before either East or West could revise what he called their already obsolete strategic conceptions of the world.
The Foreign Minister, who just two months ago was stoking coal at the menial job to which he had been assigned as a punishment, has been keeping an arduous schedule. On Tuesday, his duties did not end until well after midnight, when he traveled to the airport to greet Gianni de Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister. 
Earlier in the week, Mr. Dienstbier (his full name is pronounced YIHR-zhee DEENST-beer) had met Polish officials, and the Israeli Finance Minister, Shimon Peres. With Mr. Peres, Mr. Dienstbier discussed a resumption of the diplomatic relations with Israel that Czechoslovakia broke 22 years ago.
 
'Arms 'Just Won't Be Sold'
Such a schedule, his wife, Vera, insisted, was impossible, but Mr. Dienstbier appeared to be thriving under it.
''Foreign policy until now was either very pragmatic, or else very ideological,'' Mr. Dienstbier said, echoing the pledge of a new approach given by the new President, Vaclav Havel, his close friend. ''It seemed that some things could not be done because they had never been done before, but they can be done if people want to do them.
''For instance,'' he declared, ''Czechoslovakia will simply end its trade in arms without taking into account what the pragmatists will say, that it will be a blow to the state coffers, that those people will get arms from somebody else anyway if we don't supply them.
''That hasn't been officially announced,'' he said, ''but it simply will be done and weapons just won't be sold anymore. We can stop that actually even without knowing how big the trade was.''
Mr. Dienstbier's assertion apparently reflected discussion with other ministers in the new Government, which has replaced the Communist regime swept away last month in the tide of change across Eastern Europe.
 
Major Weapons Exporter
Czechoslovakia has one of the world's biggest arms industries, ranking seventh in total weapons exports from 1984 through 1988, says the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an organization funded by the Swedish Government.
The United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency has reported that Czechoslovakia's arms exports totalled $975 million in 1987. That is down from a peak of $1.5 billion in 1985.
Those figures do not include arms smuggled out of the country, often with the Government's tacit consent, for which no figures are available.
Mr. Dienstbier said he did not know precise figures for Czechoslovakia's arms exports. ''There are very many things we don't know about exactly, because for 40 years they were very cleverly camouflaged under various entries,'' he said. But it would not take much cleverness to stop selling submachine guns to hunt antelopes, he said.
Omnipol, an export agency rumored to be behind many arms deals, happens to be just down Nekazanka Street from the Dienstbiers' fourth-floor walkup apartment.
Britain and other countries have asserted that terrorist groups have obtained Czechoslovak-made high explosives like Semtex. The British authorities have concluded that Semtex was used in the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Scotland in December 1988, an attack that killed 270 people.
Mr. Dienstbier said determining how such explosives could have fallen into terrorists hands was difficult.
''Officially there was never anything ever sold to terrorist organizations,'' he said. ''I think this kind of trade is done throughout the whole world in such a sophisticated manner. It's not only Czechoslovakia; it's everywhere. You can't really prove the real origins.''
The Czechoslovak Government has demanded the withdrawal of all 70,000 to 75,000 Soviet troops stationed here by the end of this year. But Mr. Dienstbier said the negotiations that began Jan. 15 may have been complicated indirectly by civil disturbances in Soviet Azerbaijan.
''In the Soviet leadership hardly anybody has any time today to deal with anything but burning problems, in a situation when there are thousands of dead and wounded in Azerbaijan,'' he said, using a figure much higher than the one officially reported in Moscow.
 
Suggests U.S. Gesture
Asked if Czechoslovakia would formally encourage the United States to pull out troops from Western Europe if Soviet forces left the country, he answered: ''I think that when one side does something, it is possible for the other side also to do something.''
Asked how important the political survival of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union was for the process, Mr. Dienstbier replied: ''I do not think the fate of Gorbachev himself is all that important. The Soviet Union has no alternative, unless it is something even more radical.
''On the other hand,'' he continued, ''there is the danger that the Soviet Union could become a focal point of great world tension unless it manages in a peaceful manner to solve an endless series of mutually interconnected problems, of the economy, society, nationalities, religion, and even of civilization itself.''
 
Thoughts on Germany
Speaking of the relevance of military alliances as change transforms Eastern Europe, he said, ''In this new situation we still talk about whether the NATO alliance should continue to the year 2010, while at the same time the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as the other half of a bipolar security system. The NATO alliance still exists in its old form. Institutions lag behind historical developments, not only institutions, but thinking, too.''
He was asked what he, as a citizen of a country victimized by German aggression, thought of the prospect of German reunification now.
''What could easily happen is that tomorrow demonstrators in Berlin and Leipzig could decide to abolish the frontiers altogether, and suddenly there will be a country that's half in the Warsaw Pact and half in NATO, and nobody will be able to prevent it,'' he said. ''Not if a nation of 80 million simply decides to do it.
''I don't think we have to be afraid of the reunification of Germany,'' he said. ''But at the same time we shall have to proceed very quickly in all of Europe so as to knock down as quickly as possible all the artificial barriers created here over 40 years. We should probably have the courage to return to the year 1945 to the principles of the Atlantic Charter and the anti-Hitler coalition, to connect ourselves with the idea of postwar cooperation in building a free and democratic Europe, as if these 40 intervening years didn't exist.''
 
The Helsinki Process
He suggested the process begun in Helsinki in 1975 by the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as the best framework.
Mr. Dienstbier, who was a radio correspondent in Washington in 1968 before he was recalled and banned from journalism by the Soviet-installed regime, said, with the evident concurrence of his wife, that he would not move to the Foreign Minister's official apartment on the third floor of Cernin Palace on Prague's Medieval castle hill.
It was from that apartment that Jan Masaryk, Czechoslovakia's previous non-Communist Foreign Minister, either jumped or was pushed to his death from his third-floor bathroom overlooking the palace's inner court.
Masaryk's rooms will be opened March 10, he said, as a museum, a memorial to a man whose death he thought could never be conclusively explained. All that is known is that Masaryk went to his death a month after agreeing to remain in the Government after the Soviet-backed Communist takeover of Klement Gottwald.
 
Likened to Kennedy Death
''It's like the problems with the assassination of President Kennedy,'' Mr. Dienstbier said. ''I don't think it's of any use to speculate about it, because it is clear that if there was something behind it, the participants and the documents have been destroyed, the participants together with the documents.
''Anyway,'' he said, ''if he jumped from the window it is an even more damning judgment of what had happened in February than if he was pushed. If he was killed, it would testify to the stupidity and cruelty of those who decided the murder. If he did it himself it was his own protest against the regime. All the files that could have been found were discovered when the historians went through the files in 1968.
''Of course,'' he acknowledged, ''they're still discovering things from the Egyptian period.''
But he said he plans to put his office where Masaryk's leather-topped table stands now, a few rooms away from the bathroom that figured in his death.

HEADLINE: Haiti About-Face: General 'Looking Like Dictator'

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 24

 BODY:
After 16 months of tentative hope for democracy, Haiti appears to be slipping back into dictatorship.
Haitian political leaders and foreign diplomats say they now believe that legitimate elections, scheduled for this year, are unlikely and that Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, the military ruler, is trying to consolidate his personal power. ''He's looking like a dictator,'' one diplomat said.
In a burst of fury that began last weekend, General Avril has banished a presidential candidate and several advocates of free elections, driven independent radio news broadcasters off the air and, with dozens of beatings and arrests, intimidated most of his critics. 
Haiti's political elite was shaken, but until today there had been few other signs of tension or discontent in the teeming capital. This afternoon, however, many street vendors and shopkeepers closed their businesses in panic as soldiers circulated saying ''things are going to get hot.''
 
A Call for Firearms
This evening, Gen. Fritz Romulus, the Interior Minister, issued a call for all firearms being held without permits. Anyone not complying within 48 hours, he said, will be subject to arrest.
General Avril, who had taken some steps toward holding elections, abruptly imposed a state of siege on Saturday night, startling Washington and the six million residents of the most impoverished, disease-ridden country in the Western Hemisphere.
A colonel in the Presidential Guard had been slain in the street the night before and there had been some bitter exchanges between General Avril and civilian political leaders. But the country seemed otherwise quiet.
Encouraged by the general's initial steps toward elections and wanting to encourage him, the United States, France and the World Bank had begun discussions aimed at restoring some of the economic aid that was suspended after Haiti's first attempt at democratic elections in more than three decades ended in a massacre in November 1987.
 
Two Theories
The sudden turn of events seemed to confirm the suspicions of many Haitians that General Avril never intended to hand over power to a civilian.
Just what motivated him is not clear, but two theories are gaining adherents. One is that Haiti's democratic leaders had demonstrated their weakness by failing to gain public support for a general strike recently and he believed he could move against them without raising a general protest. So far that has proved true. He wanted to get rid of key political leaders, the theory goes, before the election process started in late April with voting for municipal councils.
The second theory, less fully formed, is that General Avril was responding to demands for more financial benefits from members of the Presidential Guard, which is his main base of power and which put down an attempt to overthrow him last April.
Enlisted men in the Presidential Guard brought General Avril to power on Sept. 17, 1988, after turning against President Henri Namphy. Until Friday night, Joseph Hebreux, a young former medic who had been promoted to sergeant major, had worked at General Avril's side and lived with his wife in a suite in the Presidential Palace. Sergeant Major Hebreux represented the interests of the enlisted men and, at least symbolically, indicated that they had a share in power of the presidency.
 
Economy Doing Badly
On Friday, Sergeant Major Hebreux quietly went from being the highest ranking enlisted man to adjutant, the lowest ranking commissioned officer, and was reassigned to an obscure post at army headquarters.
Haiti's economy has been shriveling. Economists say that it has been poorly managed under General Avril and that money from some state enterprises has been diverted to the military.
One Haitian with contacts in the military said General Avril led the Presidential Guard to believe that a trip to Taiwan this month would yield millions in aid that would benefit them. But diplomats say he apparently returned empty-handed.
While General Avril was in Taiwan, three civic leaders sent a message to the Government in Taipei saying no agreements with the general would be considered binding on the Haitian people. Diplomats say General Avril knew he was unlikely to receive financial aid from the Nationalist Chinese. But in an airport speech back in Haiti, he attributed the financial failure of his mission to the civic leaders. One of them, Dr. Louis Roy, was exiled on Sunday. Another, Antoine Izmery, was arrested on Tuesday morning.
The United States, France and Canada condemned the crackdown and Francois Benoit, Haiti's Ambassador to Washington, resigned, declaring he no longer believed that General Avril would preside over fair elections.
 
Behavior Called Indefensible
Echoing blunt criticism from Washington, Alvin P. Adams, the American Ambassador in Haiti, described General Avril's behavior as ''indefensible and outrageous.'' He indicated, however, that the United States was holding out hope that General Avril would reverse himself. ''We hope ways can be found to restore the status quo ante, meaning to restore and to enhance confidence in the electoral process,'' Mr. Adams said in an interview with several foreign reporters.
General Avril has made no public statements on the crisis, but Interior Minister Romulus suggested on television on Tuesday night that the Government would go ahead with local and legislative elections in the next few months and that after a national assembly had been formed some of the exiled political leaders might be permitted to return to take part in presidential elections in the fall.
Distrust of General Avril was widespread when he was installed as President in an enlisted men's coup on Sept. 17, 1988. He had spent almost his entire army career as an adviser and confidant to Francois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, as they terrorized and plundered Haiti. The Duvalier Government was overthrown in February 1986.
General Avril, who became a millionaire, negotiated weapons and equipment purchases from abroad and had close ties to the electricity company and the national flour mills, two of the Government's most lucrative businesses. But he began to win some support by promising he would lead Haiti to ''irreversible democracy.''
Last fall, however, violence, some of it directed at political activists, began to increase. Some diplomats and Haitians following politics here say they now believe the violence was part of an overall plan to prevent or limit elections this year.

HEADLINE: Wider Search Is Seen In Mail-Bombing Case

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENTERPRISE, Ala., Jan. 24

 BODY:
A Federal investigation into mail bombings that killed a judge and a civil rights lawyer appeared today to be widening, with one law-enforcement official saying new agents had been assigned to this small town that has become the center of the case.
Publicly, officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington declined to comment on reports that Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, who operates a salvage and army surplus store here, had failed a lie-detector test. Privately, other Government officials do not dispute accounts that he failed such a test in some important areas. But these officials also emphasized that Mr. O'Ferrell, a 56-year-old lifelong resident of Enterprise, had not been singled out as the chief suspect. 
On Monday, Mr. O'Ferrell became the object of the first search warrants issued in the case when investigators poring through court files found a letter he had typed. It related to a lawsuit he had filed that ultimately involved one of the bombing victims, Federal Judge Robert S. Vance, who sat on the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta.
Judge Vance was killed by a bomb that had been mailed to his Birmingham, Ala., home in December.
 
Fresh Reinforcements Arrive
Federal investigators here remained silent on their investigation, but Tom Moore, a spokesman for the F.B.I.'s Birmingham office, said that while some investigators had left, fresh reinforcements had come in and were likely to remain through the week.
Mr. O'Ferrell started today much as he always has, except that he was being watched by hordes of reporters and television cameramen. He strode across the cluttered yard into a red shed for buckets and food for four yapping puppies, four dogs, two horses and a pony.
''I hope today or tomorrow will wind it up,'' he said of the searches on his property and that of his relatives and the hours of questioning, lie-detector tests and taking of blood samples. ''They ain't found nothing, and you can't keep looking when you ain't found nothing.''
 
N.A.A.C.P. Was Target
In addition to the bomb that killed Judge Vance, an explosive device killed a Savannah, Ga., civil rights lawyer in December. Two other bombs were removed safely from the Atlanta offices of the 11th Circuit Court and from the offices of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Jacksonville, Fla.
A number of people are said to be under surveillance. Mr. O'Ferrell reportedly came to attention because he had sued his former employer, the Gulf Life Insurance Company of Jacksonville, in a case that was ultimately rejected by Judge Vance's court.
The Associated Press quoted Mr. O'Ferrell as saying, ''I have not been told I am a suspect and have not been told I failed a lie-detector test.''
 
Some Residents Are Skeptical
Many residents said they find Mr. O'Ferrell an unlikely focus in the case. He is a religious man, said Carole Green, who works at the Sessions Company peanut warehouse near Mr. O'Ferrell's own store.
Later today, Mr. O'Ferrell lost patience with the journalists surrounding his home. He threatened to call the police if onlookers did not say off his property, and he posted ''No Trespassing'' signs.
Impatience could be felt throughout this southeastern Alabama town of 20,000 residents. Many residents seemed torn between curiosity about the investigation's progress and anger at the unwelcome attention.
Lynn Sullivant, the secretary to Police Chief Tim Byrd, scowled at the ever-ringing telephone and said, as others did, that she was ''just trying to get back to normal.''
 
Tidbits of Local History
''Of course, they feel that it reflects badly on the town,'' said Wallace Goodman, publisher of the local newspaper, The Enterprise Ledger.
But Mayor Jacqueline Thompson said that the town was accustomed to taking ''disaster and turning it into a positive.'' Enterprise, she said, is the only town in the country that has a monument to a pest, the dreaded boll weevil that devastated the city's major crop and cotton-ginning industry at the turn of the century.
The event forced farmers to diversify their crops with peanuts and corn, saving the soil and, in the long run, the economy. Thus a tribute: an Italian-made fountain, featuring a robed woman holding aloft a large carapaced boll weevil was erected in the main intersection.
Enterprise is the main population center of Coffee County, an area that is jokingly called U.C.L.A. for the ''upper corner of lower Alabama.''

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Panama Invasion Costly In a Far Wider Theater

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The domestic political verdict is in:
President Bush's standing with the American electorate has benefited enormously from the invasion of Panama on Dec. 20. Opinion surveys demonstrate conclusively that, as usual, voters in this country have responded favorably to a decisive military stroke by a President.
But more than a month after Mr. Bush sent airborne forces into the little Central American state, other questions remain open: Will democracy take root in Panama, where it has so often withered in the past? Will the Bush Administration be able to convict Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in a Florida court? Will his arrest have any lasting impact on international drug traffic?
And it is clear already that the operation has cost the United States a pretty penny abroad - more, perhaps, than Washington anticipated. 
In Western Europe, where the President is widely faulted for passivity in his approach to what Europeans consider the overriding issue of the day - the historic changes in the Soviet Union and its former satellite states in eastern Europe - the invasion of Panama did not strike most foreign-policy experts as evidence of a new boldness by Mr. Bush.
Instead, it seemed, as one diplomat here put it, like ''one more step in the decline of the American empire, with the United States, like the British, reduced to bashing little guys.''
The reaction in Latin America has been, if anything, worse.
While Latin leaders recognized that the ''accepted'' remedies for the Noriegas of the hemisphere had failed, with both the Organization of American States and initiatives by groups of Latin nations failing miserably, they were displeased by the clumsiness of American commanders, especially the invasion of Nicaraguan diplomatic property, and what many of them saw as mindless American self-congratulation.
A senior Latin American representative here asked the other day: ''Can't the United States deal quietly and quickly with sticky problems? Must it beat its own chest so hard?'' In other words, what had played so well at home, ample promotion of a quick victory with few American casualties over a universally disliked foe, raised others' hackles.
An early casualty of the Panama invasion was the Administration's vaunted plan to station United States warships off the Colombian coast to intercept drug runners. Colombia didn't like the idea at all. In the pre-Panama climate, it might have swallowed its objections; in the post-Panama atmosphere, the United States had to do the swallowing.
Recognizing what harm had been done, Mr. Bush announced on Jan. 5 that Vice President Dan Quayle, who had worked the phones during the hours after the invasion in an effort to assuage Latin feelings, would visit several countries in the region for some ''very, very important diplomacy.'' In fact, Mr. Quayle will begin on Friday a trip to three countries that are safely in the American camp -Jamaica, Honduras and Panama itself.
Not one is a major factor in hemispheric affairs, and not one needs any convincing about the utility of what happened in December, so the journey has lost its meaning.
Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela made it clear, after weeks of talks, that a visit from Mr. Quayle wouldn't be welcome. The White House could hardly send the Vice President anyway. A few people there remember the abuse that earlier Presidential emissaries, like Richard M. Nixon and Nelson A. Rockefeller, suffered in Latin America when they had the temerity to visit at times of hostility toward Washington.
Administration cheerleaders, ignoring Mr. Bush's earlier comments about the mission's importance, about how urgent it was for Mr. Quayle to ''personally deliver'' the President's message of good will, now say the timing of the trip and its itinerary don't matter much. More candid officials within the Government are speaking of ''serious miscalculations'' - not only in estimating the depth of Latin displeasure but also in planning to deal with it.
''As we learned,'' an American diplomat with long experience in Latin America said today, ''there wasn't any quick, clean, cost-free way to get rid of Noriega. There isn't any quick, clean, cost-free way to assuage the Latins' feelings, either. We'll have to win their confidence back the hard way: help them economically, stay out of their politics and wait.''

HEADLINE: Bush to Seek $1.2 Billion For a Bigger Drug War

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
As part of an additional $1.2 billion he proposes to add to the nation's budget for the war on drugs, President Bush plans a 50 percent increase in money for the military to intensify efforts to halt international drug smuggling.
But Mr. Bush's increase for next year is not as much as the Democrats are seeking.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will offer today a long Democratic counter proposal calling for an increase of more than $5 billion in current spending in many new areas. In the introduction, the Delaware Democrat emphasized that his plan was not a ''wholesale rejection of the President's approach'' but would take the debate one step farther. 
Bush Administration officials said yesterday that the President's plan, which is the second phase of a new national drug policy announced last September, makes some major changes and adds more details, including specific dollar figures for the fiscal year 1991, starting Oct. 1. The current budget is $8.8 billion.
 
Dispute Over the Effect
Democratic leaders and experts in the drug field have contended that the national strategy to combat drug abuse has had little effect thus far. Administration officials say it is still too soon to see a major change but one of them, speaking on condition that he not be identified, said: ''The first strategy was the broad plan. This is how we're going to win the drug war.''
The new proposals, to be announced by the President today at a luncheon in Washington with newspaper editors and publishers, underwent at least four drafts and have been closely guarded at the White House because of President Bush's penchant for secrecy. But in interviews, Administration officials involved in writing the document disclosed several key elements:
* As part of the Pentagon's efforts to play an increased role in fighting drugs, that agency's anti-drug budget would increase to $1.2 billion from slightly more than $800 million in the current fiscal year. The military would use nearly a third of the money for the American program to help the cocaine source countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, which received $261.2 million this year.
* A multi-agency drug intelligence center would be established to coordinate all intelligence information involving domestic and international drug trafficking.
* The New York, Miami, Los Angeles and Houston metropolitan areas and the Southwestern border will be designated for a special infusion of money because of their particularly serious drug problems. Federal officials said probably far less than $100 million would be divided roughly equally by the areas next year.
* The drug treatment efforts in Federal, state and local prisons would be intensified. More money would be available for Federal prisons for treatment programs, and agencies would be encouraged in some cases to shift funds from treatment programs outside the prison population to programs for prisoners. State and local governments would be encouraged to put more of their Federal block grant money into drug treatment programs at their jails and prisons.
* The Customs Service would again be allowed to open its own drug investigations and have more authority to make arrests under drug laws, as it did before the Drug Enforcement Administration was created in 1973.
* Pilot programs, including one site in New York City and another in New York State, would be selected for large drug-treatment ''campuses'' in which addicts could get in-patient and outpatient services and job training.
William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, had requested a budget increase of about 30 percent over the current fiscal year, Administration officals said.
 
Revival of Former Plan
The multi-agency center in the plan had been proposed in the strategy announced by Mr. Bush in September, but was shelved in part because Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had complained that he had not been named chairman. In a compromise that represents a small victory for Mr. Thornburgh in his tug-of-war with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Thornburgh was named chairman but the center will be run daily by an executive director, who will be selected by all the agencies involved.
The 1988 drug law requires an updated strategy by Feb. 1 of each year. In addition to the blueprint that will be made public today, the White House next week is planning to release another document that lays out in even greater detail the Administration proposal for drug spending in fiscal 1991.
Senator Biden's plan, prepared by the Democratic staff of the Judiciary Committee and International Narcotics Control Caucus, puts a greater emphasis on helping hard core drug users rather than occasional users, and on using economics tools rather than the military to curb cocaine production in the Andean nations.

HEADLINE: Study of Teen-Agers Hints Gain for Those Having Abortions

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A federally financed study of unmarried, sexually active teen-age girls has found that those who obtained abortions did better economically and educationally and had fewer subsequent pregnancies than those who chose to bear children. Those who had abortions even fared better than those who were not pregnant at the start of the research project.
The findings of the four-year study, conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, suggests for the first time that the experience of choosing an abortion may have beneficial results for some adolescent girls. A total of 334 girls from Baltimore, 17 years old and younger, participated in the study, the first to compare teen-agers who obtain abortions with those who were never pregnant in the way they fare later, experts said. 
Dr. Laurie Schwab Zabin, the principal author, said the study did not conclude that young women were helped by having an abortion. ''I don't think it's fair to say that the abortion experience did all these glorious things for them,'' said Dr. Zabin, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins. ''I hardly think we should tout it as something that everyone should go out and do.''
There were a number of factors that complicated the task of interpreting the data. For example, those who chose to end the pregnancy had better educated parents and higher educational ambitions than those in the two other groups, so their superior achievement may not be attributable to abortion.
But Dr. Zabin said the group that had abortions came out ahead of the other two even when researchers statistically allowed for these variables.
 
Differences Held to Be Striking
And she said the differences between those who ended their pregnancies and those who did not or were not pregnant were so striking that the possiblity of benefits could not be dismissed.
''Clearly the abortion experience is not setting these kids back,'' she said. ''If anything, it's probably giving them some sense of control over their lives so that they can move on and do the things that are important.''
The study, financed by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, one of the National Institutes of Health, reported on black teen-agers who came in for pregnancy tests at two family planning clinics in Baltimore in 1985 and 1986. The young women were interviewed before they knew the results of their tests so researchers could establish baseline data on educational achievements and expectations, economic levels, psychological traits and other variables.
Once results were known, the young women were divided into three groups: 141 who chose to have an abortion, 93 who bore the child, and 100 who turned out not to be pregnant. The groups were then followed for two years.
The researchers found that 90 percent of the young women who had abortions had graduated from high school or were still in school. By contrast, 68 percent of those who bore children and 79 percent of those whose pregnancy test were negative completed high school or had not dropped out.
Also, those teen-agers who had abortions were more likely to find jobs, and thus were less likely to be in a household that is receiving food stamps or Medicaid payments than their counterparts in the other two groups, the study said.
The study will be published the November/December issue of Family Planning Perspectives magazine, published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute.
 
Psychological Impact
It found that 4.5 percent of those choosing abortion experienced an adverse psychological change two years after the event, as against 5.5 percent of those who bore children and 10 percent of young women with negative pregnancy tests. This indicates that while the decision to have an abortion provided few psychological benefits, it did not, as anti-abortion groups often claim, cause any emotional damage.
The research team also found those who had abortions were more likely to use contraception later than the teen-agers in the other groups, and that they were less likely to become pregnant later. The study found that 37 percent of those who had abortions became pregnant within 18 months. By comparison, 47 percent of the girls who had babies were pregnant within 18 months of the birth of their baby, and 58 percent of those who were not pregnant became pregnant within 18 months of their examinations.
Officials of anti-abortion organizations denounced the study, contending that its methodology was flawed.
Olivia Gans, president of the American Victims of Abortion, faulted the study for only following women for two years. Ms. Gans asserted that ''postabortion stress syndrome'' often does not show up until five years after the abortion.
The study weakens the argument often made by anti-abortion forces that abortions produces severe psychological trauma in women, an assertion that is generally made on the basis of anecdotal evidence.
 
Koop Letter About Review
In 1987, at a meeting with a group of anti-abortion advocates, President Ronald Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to prepare a comprehensive report on the health effects of abortion. Last January Dr. Koop declined to release the review. Instead, he wrote Mr. Reagan that studies on the psychological effects of the procedure had serious flaws and ''could not provide conclusive data about the health effects of abortion on women.''
In most of the studies the women were reached after they had abortions. Thus there is scant data on the subjects' personality traits, or psychological stresses before they became pregnant. Also, few studies in this area use a control group. If it does, there are often economic or social differences between the groups that distort the findings. To accurately measure psychological effects, Dr. Koop said, would require a five-year study that begins looking at some women before they conceive. Such a study would cost approximately $100 million.
The Johns Hopkins study tries to get around these flaws by interviewing their subjects before they knew the results of their pregnancy tests, and by studying a relatively uniform groups -inner-city black teen-agers. ''That's the strength of this study,'' said Brian Wilcox, director of Public Interest Legislation for the American Psychological Association. ''It's the first to have such a nice clean research design.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The Bishop And the Chairman

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Governor Cuomo of New York is in ''serious risk of going to hell'' for his support of abortion rights - so says a Roman Catholic bishop who is serving a 10-day jail sentence for trying to block the entrance to an abortion clinic in Albany.
Bishop Austin Vaughan of Newburgh, N.Y., did not speak for the Roman Catholic Church or its hierarchy, but his ecclesiastical threat to Mr. Cuomo inevitably raises the specter of religious intervention in the politics of Catholic voters. And his remark, as well as the act that landed him in jail, suggest the extremes to which some anti-abortion activists are willing to go in order to impose their beliefs on the rest of us.
Mr. Cuomo, to his credit, defended both the bishop's right to speak out and women's ''constitutional right to abortion.'' 
Bishop Vaughan's strong views and willingness to act on them also suggests why Lee Atwater, the Republican national chairman, is having trouble trying to convince his party of one of the oldest, most necessary tenets of traditional two-party politics - that each of the two parties is and must be an ''umbrella'' under which people of varying opinions and ideology can shelter.
That's not a tradition congenial to rigid anti-abortion forces. But were it not so, in a nation of such vastly differing economic interests, ethnicity and social attitudes, the American political spectrum would be divided into dozens, perhaps hundreds, of small limited-interest or regional parties, many of them bitterly or even violently opposed to and unwilling to cooperate with others. Whatever else may be said for or against the two-party system, it usually has spared the nation that kind of dangerously fractionated politics.
Mr. Atwater would not have to be much of a student of history to understand that; nor need he reach far into the past for an apt metaphor. Only 20-odd years ago, President Lyndon Johnson was insisting that his party was a ''big tent'' covering all sorts of voters and ideas.
The Republican chairman, however, has not undertaken to teach his party an elementary lesson of American politics for purely educational reasons. Instead, he knows and wants Republicans to realize that in last year's three major elections, Democratic candidates who took a pro-choice position on abortion defeated rivals who were perceived as anti-choice.
Mr. Atwater's President, moreover, vetoed three bills last year ostensibly on anti-abortion grounds, and now maintains in the bully pulpit a pronounced personal stance against abortion and using Federal funds for that purpose. Besides, the Republican platform commits the party to a constitutional amendment that would end a woman's right to choose abortion.
For many years, Republicans were able with little political cost to oppose that right and reap anti-abortion support, because pro-choice voters believed such an amendment was unlikely to pass and that the party could do little to interfere with an established constitutional right. Last year, however, the Supreme Court made it possible for state legislatures to restrict abortion rights; the once-empty Republican anti-abortion threat became suddenly all too real to women and families everywhere.
Consequently, Mr. Atwater is trying to tell his party that to be monolithically anti-abortion has become risky politics. Instead of shunning anyone favoring choice, Republicans should welcome under their umbrella all shades of opinion, in the traditional manner of American political parties.
Even Mr. Bush, though apparently fearing to change once again his own polymorphous view, allowed his press secretary to say that ''there is room within the party for varying points of view.'' A story in Newsweek that the women in the Bush family, including the First Lady, are pro-choice makes the same political point: There's such room even in the White House, folks.
It would be a neat trick if Mr. Atwater and Mr. Bush could persuade the nation that their party is not necessarily anti-abortion - even if Mr. Bush is, and even if the party platform is too - while retaining the anti-abortion votes that have been a major element in Republican political success.
The elections next fall will provide a test. But what will happen when Republicans gather under their big tent in 1992 to write a new platform? Will they scratch the anti-abortion plank, turning their backs on a staple of their political support? Or will they stand defiantly on their position as the party of opposition to women's right of choice? That's a conundrum to challenge even the occult powers of Republican spin doctors.

HEADLINE: The Talk of the South Fork;
Baymen Find No Warmth This Winter

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SPRINGS, L.I., Jan. 24

 BODY:
The bushel of steamers that Tom Lester harvested last week is still in his cellar, and it is starting to stink. ''I can't sell them,'' said Mr. Lester, a burly 48-year-old baymen whose day's work normally fetches between $75 and $100. ''No one wants them at any price.''
The market for clams and other shellfish has collapsed here on the South Fork since last week, when the State Department of Environmental Conservation banned shellfishing in 56,000 acres in Suffolk County. Pollution isn't the problem. A shortage of state inspectors to certify the waters is. 
Winter on the South Fork - the towns of Southampton and East Hampton -brings a welcome calm to year-round residents who live in a love-hate relationship with the summer tourists and second-homeowners, whose dollars drive this region's economy. Now is also the time when local concerns, like the plight of the baymen, attract more attention.
At a court hearing today in Hauppauge, state officials promised to speed the testing in 500 acres of particularly rich clamming beds in East Hampton and Southampton. If the waters prove clean, the baymen might be able to resume harvesting there by Feb. 5.
But for the baymen, a dwindling breed who rely on $350 a week or so from clamming to tide them over until spring, this winter will be one of the leanest in recent memory. ''The damage has already been done,'' Mr. Lester said. ''People's confidence has been ruined.''
In recent years, man-made regulations and natural catastrophes have robbed the baymen of two other catches: striped bass and bay scallops. Now, with clams and oysters unjustly suspect, the baymen say, a way of life may soon be gone.
''We've been getting beaten down, peg by peg,'' said Billy Havens, 37, who has worked on the waters here since he was 7 years old. ''We can't hang on much longer.''
 
Crossed Swordfish
Grilled, broiled or blackened, a moist, meaty swordfish steak has increasingly become the fish of choice for many American diners.
That appetite has set off a boom in swordfishing - 750 licensed longline boats in East Coast waters now, compared with about 35 boats 10 years ago -and a resulting 60 percent drop in the number of mature swordfish in the same period, Federal officials say.
Alarmed by evidence of overfishing, the National Marine Fisheries Service is expected to impose emergency swordfishing restrictions in the western Atlantic within the next few weeks. The limitations - which could set a minimum size, ban night fishing and close waters with large numbers of undersized fish -would stay in effect until a permanent fishing-reduction plan is adopted later this year.
For the five dozen fishing vessels in the South Fork's oceangoing fleet, the plan is tantamount to a moratorium on their livelihood. ''I'll be out of business,'' said Bill Modica, 28, who is captain of the 58-foot Midnight Sun out of Montauk and who relies on swordfishing for 70 percent of his catch.
Any kind of fishing restrictions sends shock waves through the boat dealers, marine suppliers, bar owners and restaurateurs of Montauk, a seaside village of 3,100 people.
''Sure, there's a need for conservation, but they're talking about wiping us off the face of the map,'' said Richard Gosman, one of the largest dock operators and fish wholesalers in Montauk.
Fishermen here complain that the restrictions would cover only boats from the United States. Vessels from Spain, Canada and Japan, the other large swordfishing nations, would be free to continue their free-fishing ways and increase exports to this country.
''The fishermen have legitimate complaints,'' said David Crestin, deputy director of the Office of Fishery Conservation and Management at the Marine Fisheries Service. ''But if the United States wants to take a leadership role in conservation, we can't sit back.''
 
New Look at Ruling
Since Colonial days, New York State has recognized the Shinnecock Indians as a tribe. Now the 350 Shinnecocks who live on an 800-acre reservation in Southampton are debating whether to seek tribal status with the Federal Government.
On the surface, the issue is not cultural identity but gaining another source of money and, perhaps, assistance: The designation would make the tribe eligible for education, health and governmental administration programs under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Shinnecocks are already eligible for other Federal aid, like nutrition programs for the elderly.
But perhaps more important, many Shinnecocks are questioning whether their traditional form of tribal government - three male trustees elected by the men of the tribe - is fit to deal with the same complex problems that all communities face today: land preservation, family violence, drug and alcohol abuse.
''The tribal government is not up to that challenge,'' said Roberta Hunter, 38, a member of a newly formed women's group on the reservation. The group is pressing the trustees for a full public discussion of the Federal recognition issue, the right for women to vote in tribal affairs and a more active role in regaining ancient Shinnecock lands.
''There's plenty of potential here,'' said David Bunn Martine, a 29-year-old painter who has advocated a more progressive government. ''But too many people are satisfied with the status quo.''
 
The News and Then Some
Just how many articles about zoning boards and chambers of commerce can anyone really read? That's the question that people in Sag Harbor are asking these days as a battle of weekly newspapers in this old whaling village shows no signs of waning.
It started a little over a year ago when Gardner Cowles 3d, the scion of the Midwestern newspaper family, bought the 129-year-old Sag Harbor Express. The publisher of a venerable weekly in nearby East Hampton, Helen S. Rattray, jumped into the fray by starting a competing weekly, the Sag Harbor Herald. All this for a village of 2,800 people.
Add to that two other larger weeklies, the East Hampton Star and the Southampton Press, and there is a local-news glut. ''If you want to keep up, you feel overwhelmed sometimes,'' said Lorraine Dusky, an author and member of the village zoning board. She said she reads all four weeklies regularly.
Business owners complain that they cannot afford to advertise in both village papers, but most residents like the competition. ''It either makes the news twice as interesting or twice as boring,'' said Ted Conklin, owner of the American Hotel. ''There's just not that much to report.''

HEADLINE: A New Yankee Stadium Is Proposed in the Bronx

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
The Bronx Borough President proposed yesterday that the city and state build a new stadium for the New York Yankees at Ferry Point Park, a 414-acre site at the north end of the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge.
''We need to build the Yankees a state-of-the-art, first-class baseball stadium in the Bronx,'' said the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. ''I think Ferry Point Park is an outstanding location because of its proximity to the bridge and major traffic arteries.''
Mr. Ferrer's proposal focuses attention on concerns that the Yankees, whose lease on the city-owned ''House that Ruth Built'' expires in 12 years, might follow other professional sports teams to New Jersey. An agreement in principle that would have kept the team in Yankee Stadium until the year 2032 was signed more than two years ago, but was never made final. 
On Tuesday night, during a broadcast of the WCBS radio program ''Ask the Mayor,'' Mayor David N. Dinkins said he hoped to meet soon with the Yankees owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3d. Mr. Dinkins said he intended ''to make it plain to him that we will do all that we are able to accommodate his concerns because we need our Yankees.''
 
'30 Years Is a Long Lease'
Mr. Steinbrenner said last night that he had spoken to Mr. Dinkins and that they would meet tomorrow. Asked about the impasse over the agreement signed in October 1987, Mr. Steinbrenner said the Yankees and former Mayor Edward I. Koch had encountered two obstacles.
Mr. Steinbrenner said the former baseball commissioner, Peter Ueberroth, ''told us that he would not approve any extraordinarily long leases, and certainly 30 years is a long lease.''
Also, Mr. Steinbrenner said, ''We have been promised many, many things from the city and, for some reason, they just didn't get done.''
Under the agreement that would have extended the Yankees' lease until 2032, the city and state were to finance jointly about $90 million in improvements in and around Yankee Stadium. These included construction of a Metro-North railroad station and a 3,200-space parking garage as well as new skyboxes and a restaurant at the stadium. Mr. Steinbrenner said he had proposed to Mr. Koch that the Yankees pay for the improvements inside the stadium, but that without a final agreement on the lease Mr. Koch had refused.
 
'A Passive Park'
Asked about Mr. Ferrer's proposal to build a 75,000-seat, domed stadium at a cost of about $200 million, Mr. Steinbrenner said, ''That's the first I've heard about it.'' The general counsel for the Yankees, David Sussman, said, ''Any proposal that the city would make is something that the Yankees would have to evaluate very seriously.''
Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, Albert Scardino, said the Mayor ''has to look at the proposal.''
''Part of the park is landfill, and without some engineering effort it could not support a permanent structure of any size,'' Mr. Scardino said. ''But it's possible.''
Under the agreement that was never made final, the New York State Urban Development Corporation would have helped pay for the improvements to Yankee Stadium. The corporation's chairman, Vincent Tese, declined to comment on Mr. Ferrer's proposal, adding, ''This is the first I've heard of it.''
 
Stadium Called a Boon
Mr. Ferrer called Ferry Point Park a ''passive park, which means that it's not anywhere being utilized to its full potential.'' A baseball stadium, he said, ''would not be intrusive to the community and would be a tremendous boon to the Bronx, the city and to the Yankees.''
The park is near two highways, the Hutchinson River Parkway and Interstate 95, but the closest subway station - Westchester Square on the IRT's No. 6 Pelham Bay Park line - is about a mile away. Asked about that problem, Mr. Ferrer's spokesman, Clint Roswell, said, ''There could be some sort of shuttle hookup by bus or, in the future, you might be able to extend the subway a little down the line.''
The city's departing Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, said Ferry Point Park is largely undeveloped and lightly used. It has a ball field, a field for flying model planes and sitting areas, he said.
Marc Matsil, the Parks Department's director of natural resources, said ''a small percentage'' of the park is wetlands. ''It does have a coastline with native grasses,'' he said.
Mr. Stern said, ''We have no objection to the plan, provided our park acreage is replaced acre for acre, because we don't like a net loss.''
Asked what would happen to the old Yankee Stadium, Mr. Ferrer said: ''You turn it into a municipal stadium for intercollegiate and high school athletics, as well as for concerts. It still has tremendous economic, recreational and sports potential for the city.''

HEADLINE: President's News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Issues

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday in Washington, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Good morning, good morning. Well, as you know, I'll soon present my budget to the Congress, and as I prepare to do so, it strikes me that our nation faces challenges on many fronts. So, let's give each the attention it deserves.
Tomorrow I'm going to announce the second phase of our strategy to fight drugs in the schools, in the streets of America. The future of this country depends on whether we can give our children a chance to grow up drug-free. And, secondly, I will soon present our plan to restructure America's defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are taking place abroad. And I'm proposing a defense budget that begins the transition to a restructured military - a new strategy that is more flexible, more geared to contingencies outside of Europe while continuing to meet our inescapable responsibility to NATO and to maintaining the global balance. 
And finally, Secretary Brady and Director Darman and Chairman Boskin will put the details of our budget before the American people. And as that occurs, other members of the Administration, the Cabinet, key agencies will provide an in-depth outline of their efforts to address the many challenges of caring for the afflicted and uplifting the poor, cleaning the environment, educating our kids, as well as other important issues.
All of this is preparatory to the State of the Union one week from today, in which I will speak to the broader issues that we face as a nation. Cabinet Status for E.P.A. There are two items that I want to mention here today and then take some questions.
First, I've decided that the environmental challenges that face America and the world are so important that they must be addressed from the highest level of our government. And at the beginning of this century, President Roosevelt - Theodore Roosevelt - helped pave the way for the establishment of a national park system. Twenty years ago, President Nixon established the E.P.A. -Environmental Protection Agency - and - by executive order - that is now one of the largest and most important regulatory agencies in the Government, and today I'd like to announce another step forward in this important tradition of support for conservation and environmental protection.
Many countries have environmental ministers and now in - with Cabinet status - and I'm convinced that that Cabinet status will help influence the world's environmental policy.
So, with so many difficult decisions ahead, I'll need Bill Reilly's counsel. I'll need him sitting at my side in the Cabinet and I'm pleased to endorse the elevation of the E.P.A. to Cabinet status by creating a Department of the Environment.
Senators Glenn and Bill Roth, chairmen and ranking members of the government -Senate Government Affairs Committee -have introduced legislation that would create this department. Congressmen Conyers and Horton are working on similar legislation. And I look forward to working with them and other interested members of the House and Senate to enact legislation that would bring E.P.A. to the Cabinet table where it now belongs.
 
Commitment to Chinese Students
And now I'd like to address one other issue that I know is foremost on your minds. Every American should know. I want to take this opportunity to state this as strongly as I can, that I will not break faith with the Chinese students here.
I made that very clear from the very beginning and right after Tiananmen I moved to protect the Chinese students in this country. Not one was sent back. They were safe then and they are safe now and they will be safe in the future.
And when Congress passed the Pelosi bill last fall, I was faced with a choice. If I signed the bill, the students would still be safe but China would retaliate and cut off future student exchanges. You see, I think the exchanges have brought forward the reforms that have taken place in China, if you look back over your shoulder for a starting point and compare it to the Cultural Revolution day.
Some of the reforms have taken place as steps - have been taken forward - and, regrettably, Tiananmen was a step, gigantic step, back. I want to keep contact. I do not want isolation.
If I vetoed the bill, I could take action to provide the students with even greater protection while keeping the door open for more Chinese scholars to study here. And the price of the Pelosi bill is lost opportunity for the Chinese scholars of tomorrow. And people should understand that very, very clearly.
The bill is totally unnecessary. The long-term policy consequences are potentially great and Congress, in my view, will have only itself to blame. I can understand their emotion, but we've got to look at policy and we've got to be fair in what has already been accomplished by the executive order. It's a strong message. I want it to be seen exactly that way.
And now I'd be delighted to take any questions. Terry and then Helen.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Gorbachev Chances of Survival
Q. Mr. President, how serious a crisis is the nationalist rebellion in Azerbaijan for President Gorbachev, and what are the chances that he'll survive this test and the challenge in the Baltics?
A. Well, I think the answer to your question unfolds every day. We don't really know, and it is serious. Gorbachev has always indicated a desire to restrain - for peaceful change inside the Soviet Union, and I refer to what he said on the Baltics. He's faced with an ethnic problem, and an internal problem of enormous dimensions. But I don't know, Terry, I can't make predictions about that. But I know that I hope that he not only survives but stays strong, because I think it is in our interest that perestroika succeed and go forward.
Q. Could I just follow up and ask you: Do you think that he's gone too far in the crackdown in Baku?
A. Anytime you have a use of force and a loss of life, we are concerned. But I don't believe I can judge that question right now.
 
Drug War and Banning Guns
Q. Mr. President, you're very concerned with drugs, and drugs are intimately connected now to guns. What is it, what do you tell your grandchildren in why you would ban semiautomatic foreign-made guns and not domestically produced? There were two students who were killed in the last 10 days, high schools students, here. Aren't you deeply concerned? I mean, what is the lethal - legal justification?
A. I am concerned, and I just don't happen to believe that banning of weapons will take them out of the hands of the criminals. And we've seen state law after state law violated by the bad guys getting the weapons. And I believe that, so I don't want to go for more Federal gun control. I'm not going to do it. We've taken some steps that I think are helpful.
Q. But we are sending weapons, though, to Colombia and so forth that are made in this country. How do you stop that?
A. To Colombia?
Q. And to other places where they're getting in.
A. If they're going to the Colombian Government, I wouldn't stop it, and if they're going to the bad guys, we would undergo every possible - follow every possible avenue to stop it. Yes?
 
Outlook on Chinese Relations
Q. Mr. President, back on China for a moment, it appears your veto will be overridden in the House today. That would require Senate action for the job to be complete. I know you met with Senate leaders this morning. Are you confident that just these remarks you've made out here today, and whatever else you may have said, will be enough? Or do you really feel that the Chinese leadership with whom you have dealt for so long kind of let you down here, and didn't give you a strong enough hand?
A. Well, what I did to try to - in talking to the Senate leaders this morning, the Republicans - is to cite certain things, steps that China has taken. They've accepted the Peace Corps volunteers, you see; I think that's good. People say, ''Well, in the face of Tiananmen, that's not good.'' I think it is good because I think cultural contacts, educational contacts will benefit in the long run democracy and reform in China. They've accredited a V.O.A. correspondent; as you know, they were kicked out. They've muted the hostile propaganda against Americans and stopped harassing the U.S. Embassy. That's good; that's important to me as President, who feels a certain responsibility for the people there. They've given some assurances on missile sales; I want to see them follow up, but I think that's positive. They're reopened the Fulbright exchanges. I think that's good and I think that's positive.
And I think if we let Congress have its head and do what is emotionally popular, these things would be changed. They've lifted martial law. I don't know a single member of Congress that if I'd have said to them, ''Look, we think by sending General Scowcroft and Larry Eagleburger over there, we can get martial law lifted. Do you think it's worth it?'' I think most would have said, ''Sure, that would be a good step.'' It happens and we see a lot of criticism of it. They've released 573 people that were detained after last June's events.
You can argue about any one of these points, but I ask the Senate and the House - I'm a little late for that one - the Senate to take a look at these things and put it in the totality of a policy. And, you see, I think there's some real reasons - Asian reasons, if you will: Cambodia and Japan - that we should retain relations with China. That doesn't mean we endorse the lack of human rights.
I tell you, one of the criticisms that gets to me a little, and I vowed - I didn't tell you my New Year's resolution was not to let it get to me - but it's the idea that I don't care about human rights. That is absolutely ridiculous. I want to see China move forward. And some think isolation, don't think so. I think we're handling it pretty well, Brit.
Q. Just to follow up, Mr. President, did you in any way convey to the Chinese leaders the idea that these steps taken so far would be enough to head off this action taken by Congress?
A. We didn't give a timetable, but we've encouraged in every way we can these and more. But I'm just asking that people look at them. I have not seen them - maybe it's my fault - one account on whatever media of these steps put together as a package. Haven't seen one. So I'd like to suggest to the Congress that are debating this to take a hard look at this and see whether it's progress, whether it adds up to anything, or, as some of our critics would say, it's pure, you know, boilerplate. Yes, Lesley?
 
Signal on Trust From Congress
Q. Mr. President, in voting, in the House particularly, you seem to be conceding that that's gone for you. Do you think that there's a problem of trust here with you? Are they saying they don't trust you to go forward on the student thing? After all, you told them you weren't going to have high-level exchanges, and while you were telling them that you were sending a high-level delegation.
A. There weren't any exchange in that. What the exchange was, Lesley, was when the Secretary of Commerce was going to go to China and be an exchange visit arranged by their Commerce Minister. That was canceled.
Q. But they obviously thought it included high-level contacts. The question is, Do you think you have a problem with them not trusting you because of that?
A. No, I don't think it's a question of trust. I think the students have done a very good job presenting their case to the Congress. I think there's some politics involved, crass politics. When you hear name-calling, when you hear people saying ''kowtow''; that is not the kindest word to say, We have an honest policy difference with this President. And so there's some politics involved in this as well, but I think there's some genuine feeling that these students have a very good case. And what I want to do is make the case that the way to continue reforms and have reform go forward is not through isolation and unilateral Congressional action, but through the kinds of contacts that I foresee, and through encouraging the kinds of steps that have already been taken.
 
View of Repression in China
Q. You talk about the lifting of martial law. What about the situation as it exists without the gesture? Are you at all disturbed that the repression goes on?
A. Yes, I'm very much concerned about the status quo, and I was terribly concerned at the time of the Cultural Revolution when we made the original contact with China. And it was a good thing we did because you began, through contacts with the West, to see China pull out of this Middle Kingdom syndrome and move forward. And I think I know enough about it that in China you get a couple of steps forward and then somebody steps back.
And I look at Deng Xiaoping's own history; I think he was out three times and in four. And some will argue, well, he's part of the problem - he's now retired - but the reforms, particularly on the economic side, that brought a new level of prosperity to the Chinese people, really were started by him. So I'm not giving up; I mean I'm not accepting the status quo at all.
And China knows my position in this. But it's - I do think there's some indignation about students, there is some feeling that -I'm talking about the Congress now - there's a lot here of empathy with the students, right here, but I think there's also a dose of political rhetoric up there that certainly has diminished the other side.
And I will readily concede maybe I could have done better, and sooner, in presenting the facts of this case. The Attorney General's doing a good job telling, you know, the differences between the Pelosi bill and what we've already accomplished. But I don't know where we'll come out. But I'm going to keep on working the policy. Yes, over here.
 
Effort to Prevent Recession
Q. Mr. President, given the weakness of the dollar, the turmoil in the financial markets and the recent poor economic indicators, what are you going to do to calm the economy - calm the markets and keep the economy from sliding into recession?
A. Well, one thing I'm not going to do is comment on levels of the market, except to say that there's been a substantial increase over the last year - and some are reading the recent couple of days as corrections, although I gather it recovered a little bit yesterday. And the market has always been an indicator and it's been one that's been read quite positively, but I don't want to get into market levels.
What I do want to do is establish sound policies, and I'm convinced that if we can get the cooperation of Congress that we need on reducing the deficit, that that will go a long way not to market prices but in terms of the fundamentals on the economy. It's slowed down a little, there's a lot of prediction that it'll be slow for a while and then have a rather robust step-up come summer. But I don't know, all I know is that we've got to not bash anybody but get out there and try to enact policies that will help keep this longest recovery in modern history going.
Q. You said that you felt that there is room for further reduction of interest rates. Given the need to attract foreign investments from overseas, their rates are high. How do you square that with your call for lower interest rates?
A. You mean to attract --
Q. Attract more investments to cover the U.S. deficit and yet so we're competing against foreign investments that are --
A. I think that people see the U.S. still, regardless of what's temporary out there, as the safest haven for investment anywhere in the world. And I want to conduct the fiscal policy of this Government so they will continue to see it that way. Yes, John.
 
Chinese Dissident's Status
Q. Going back to the vote on the Chinese student visas - you and your people have been trying to get that vote delayed. Is that because you had some indications from the Chinese they may soon release Fang Lizhi? And if this vote goes against you, will it hurt his chances?
A. No, it is not. But I don't think it'll help his chances. But I would love to see that step taken by the Chinese. But it isn't - there's not a - I think we're reconciled to the fact that the vote will go forward tomorrow in the Senate.
 
Attitude Toward China Card
Q. Have you tried to change your China policy? One thing you never do is talk about the China card. You seem to hate that expression even though when Kissinger and Nixon were doing it, it was considered a master stroke of foreign policy playing the Chinese off against the Soviets. If Gorbachev does fall from power and is succeeded by men whose role model is Joe Stalin, must you then have to play the China card too?
A. I don't think you play a card. I think that's gratuitously offensive to the Soviets and to the Chinese. But one of the reasons I want to stay engaged is that there are geopolitical reasons to have good relations or improved relations even under these unsatisfactory conditions.
And it's going to be hard to do because of the - of the human rights setback. But I want to have some contact. I want to retain contact because as you look around the world - take a look at Cambodia, take a look at Japan; take a look at a lot of countries in the Pacific - China is a key player. And I'd like to think that our representation will have them move forward on the human rights side so we can have a more normalized relationship. Charles.
 
Contacts With Gorbachev
Q. Mr. President, regarding the Soviet Union, have you in the course of these events going on in Baku or any of your senior people - I see General Scowcroft is here - been in touch with Mr. Gorbachev or his people to discuss how severe it is and --
A. Well, we had contact with him. I don't remember when my last contact was with Mr. Gorbachev, but it didn't relate specifically to the Baku.
Q. Could I then follow, sir - ask you to reconcile if you can the position that you've taken that you want Mr. Gorbachev to survive and succeed and on the other hand you have areas of the Soviet Union such as the Baltics that you do not recognize as being part of the Soviet Union and where you say you favor an independent pursuit of their own destiny. Does he succeed if they secede?
A. Well, he - that again - at this juncture the U.S. position is well known and you stated it correctly, that we have not recognized the status of the Baltics. However, what I say that we want to do is to encourage Mr. Gorbachev's stand that peaceful change is the order of the day.
And he is sorting out some very difficult internal problems in these three Baltic countries, and I don't think it helps facilitate things for us to fine-tune all that. They know our position. I talked to him about this, incidentally, at Malta, and the thing I think is that in looking at the Soviet scene there, that he is still adhering as best he can to the concept of peaceful change in the Baltics and that's got to dominate.
 
Reconfirming Poland's Borders
Q. Mr. President, President Jaruzelski of Poland recently suggested that the four big powers reconfirm - or reaffirm - the frontiers of Poland irrespective of whatever happens to West Germany. Would the United States join such a reconfirmation of the frontiers?
A. Well, we have recognized under Helsinki existing borders and I've no problem reiterating that. But whether that requires some kind of a international action on it, I just have no judgment on that. Yes.
 
Summit Meeting in Prague
Q. Mr. President, Havel of Czechoslovakia offered yesterday a summit in Prague with Mr. Gorbachev. Do you think it's a good idea?
A. Listen, I respect him so much and I don't just give him the back of my hand, but we've got a summit set and we have a - we have a very critical agenda that I want to see met -goals that I want to see met. And so I think at this time, that suggestion is not going to work out the way he suggests. But I was rather moved by the suggestion and by the conditions that make the suggestion possible. Who would have dreamed it a year ago, that the conditions inside Czechslovakia would give them less than a, you know - would give them the freedom to make this kind of suggestion. I was rather moved by it, but I don't believe it's going to work for this summit. Ann.
 
Alternative on Social Security
Q. Mr. President, you've opposed the Moynihan Social Security bill strongly. Would you endorse or work for or support a Republican alternative proposed by Congressman Porter that would take the Social Security increases for this to next year and allow people to keep those tax increases and put them in a separate account?
A. The Porter proposal has some interesting ingredients to it. I'm not prepared to endorse it. We have, don't have provision for that in our budget proposals. It's worthy, though, of consideration and some study, but I'm not prepared to endorse that. No, I'm not.
Q. Is that not the first step to privatizing Social Security?
A. Well, I don't think that he would say that it is, that that's the inevitable goal. But it has certain aspects there.
But people are concerned about Social Security, so when you have innovative thinking of that nature, I don't want to just gun it down. I'm not going to support it.
Q. Mr. President, over the last few years there's been large increases in the Social Security tax and even though it's a regressive tax, people supported it or swallowed it because they were told that that was necessary to make the system solvent for the next generation. But now everyone is finding out that in fact that money isn't there any longer and it's been used for debt reduction. Given the fact that people are now realizing that this is happening, do you think it's fair to ask them to continue to pay this increased tax for even one month longer?
The commission that reformed Social Security was well aware of what you just talked about. They considered it. I think the commission included Mr. Moynihan - I may be mistaken, but I think it did - and they considered this point, and we will have some innovative suggestions as we go along here as to how to compensate for this understandable concern on the part of some. But I would for now, for this year - we will not alter the recommendations of that bipartisan commission.
Q. Mr President --
Q. Could I just briefly - do you feel that this increase was sold to people under false premises?
A. No, 'cause I think these were intelligent people wrestling with a very, very difficult problem, and I can't accuse them of selling the commission conclusions as under false cover. Owen and then Ann.
 
Social Security Surplus
Q. Well, as you know the budget deficit has been coming down over the past few years solely because Social Security surplus has been rising and in fact your own budget projections show $200-billion-a-year deficits in the indefinite future when you remove the Social Security surplus. Given the fact that you have such a large deficit in every other program, when will you and the Congress stop bickering and counting gimmicks and deal with this problem that the American public has said for a decade --
A. Thank you for the endorsement of our approach, Owen. We would urge that we stop bickering and go forward with the proposal that we come out with that I think will begin to address itself to Maureen's question that is very sound. And nobody's trying to conceal the fact that the Social Security trust fund is operating at a surplus. There wasn't any concealment by the Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, and others that entered into this bipartisan agreement. Ann.
Q. Well, wait a minute. Your own budget proposal that you will unveil on Monday which shows a $64 billion deficit - in fact if you remove Social Security will be close to $450
A. But you're making the argument - the old argument of taking the Social Security trust fund off-budget, and at this juncture we're not prepared to do that. But wait till you see the detail, and I hope you'll see, the American people will see, something here that begins to address itself to these fundamentals that I think are properly being asked about. Ann and then Rita.
 
Bush Family Views on Abortion
Q. Mr. President, could you confirm this week's published reports that there are divisions within your own immediate family on the issue of abortion, and in particular could you confirm the widely held view that your own wife supports abortion?
A. No, I couldn't confirm that and I can't -and the meeting that I read about in one of the most respected publications was pure, unadulterated malarky, is the word I like to use. It just wasn't there. Rita.
Q. Follow up. As I understand your position you now say that the question of abortion is one of personal choice, one on which Republicans can have diverse views and still be good Republicans.
A. I've always said that, Ann. I campaigned for people that disagree with me on abortion.
Q. But my question is you say it's an issue of personal choice and the question of conscience, and yet you support a constitutional amendment which would remove that choice for all Americans. How do you reconcile those --
A. I reconcile that I was elected to try to fulfill the platform and the programs that I believe in and so that's my personal choice, but that doesn't mean that I have lack of respect for others and that I'm going to go out and not campaign for people that disagree with me on this issue, on foreign policy or whatever it is. And so that's how I explain it. Yeah, Rita.
 
Civilian Death Toll in Panama
Mr. President, last time you took questions here you were claiming success for the capture of Noriega, and also that you had protected American lives in Panama. What do you have to say to the Panamanians about more than 200 civilians - civilian Panamanians that were killed as a result of this invasion? And also, in your aid package to Panama, which hasn't been announced, do you plan to offer any compensation to the families of these people?
A. I'm not sure of the details on the aid package, because we haven't - I haven't signed off on it yet. But what I say to them is, Look, you lost some Panamanian lives; innocent life was lost. And yet 92 percent of the people in Panama strongly supported the action of the United States. Isn't that significant? And I mourn the loss of innocent civilians in Panama, or anywhere else, and certainly mourn the loss of the life of Americans. But you have to feel concerned about that, but you have to look at the broad picture, and then you have to - and I'm very pleased with the strong support from the Panamanian people. And then you've got to do what's right; you have to try to help repair the wounds, repair the damages.
We've got to go to the - I know most of you are very anxious to be at the arrival ceremony out there, and I have to be there. Yes?
 
Fairness of the Tax System
Q. Mr. President, another question that's been raised about the Moynihan proposal is the fairness of the tax system. Over the past decade, even as income tax has come down for high-paid people, Social Security taxes have gone up, mostly for lower- and middle-income people. Do you think that's fair?
A. Well, it's - look, if we were all starting over, I think we'd fine-tune the entire tax system. We're not starting over, and I think that system has been, in and out over the years, basically a pretty fair system. And while I'm here, don't think I've lost because of some arguments - political arguments - on the Hill that capital gains reduction is only for the rich. I support it, but the reason I do is that in my view it - it increases jobs for people.
So you have to look at what individual -somebody has an idea that it's some individual deduction that encourages, say, drilling when we are in an increasingly negative oil supply situation. And some would say, ''Hey, that favors those that go out and drill.'' And I say, ''Wait a minute, that's true and that may not be fair to some taxpayer here, but the national interest is best served by the encouragement and development of domestic resources.''
We're all fat, dumb and happy about our energy situation today, and I'm not. So there's all kinds of provisions that some will argue are fair or unfair.
Q. But, Sir, some of your favorite economists and think-tanks say that the Social Security tax acts as a great disincentive to work and to employing people.
A. Well, I think that's a legitimate complaint about some of it, and that's one of the reasons I favor holding the line on taxes. And one of the reasons I oppose Moynihan is I think it's a disguise for increased taxes around the corner. And I don't want to see the benefits of Social Security cut. It is odd that a Republican President, often accused by political opponents in an election year, is the one that is protecting the sanctity of the Social Security benefits. And I would say to those out around the country, ''Take a hard look now, don't let that rabbit be pulled out of the hat by one hand and 25 other rabbits dumped on you in another.'' This is a very complicated situation and this is, you know, a sleight-of-hand operation here.
And the very day Moynihan proposed it, or the next day, what do we get? We get the call from another prominent, respected Democratic Senator saying raise the sales tax on everybody. Before we go making a lot of changes, let's know exactly where everybody's coming from in this. And I think Mr. Moynihan of a few years back ought to go out and discuss it with Mr. Moynihan of today, because he was a part, I believe, of a Social Security compromise that didn't correct some of the injustice.
Q. Mr. President --
 
A. Hey, listen, I got to be out there looking very strict here at 10 o'clock.

HEADLINE: WAR OF NUMBERS ON BUDGET REOPENS

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Washington's annual war of numbers commenced officially today, with the Congressional Budget Office telling lawmakers they will have to find $74 billion in spending cuts or new tax revenue to reduce the 1991 deficit to the level required by law.
In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the non-partisan budget office, also said $38 billion more would be needed to reach the deficit target if Congress approved Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes.
Mr. Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has said the taxes should be reduced to force a halt to the practice of using surpluses in the Social Security retirement fund to offset part of the Federal budget deficit. 
 
Sasser Criticizes Estimates
Despite the difference between the Congressional estimate of the deficit and the one expected in the budget request President Bush will send to Congress on Monday, under the terms of the balanced-budget law the Administration figure is the one that has to be used to determine the amount of spending cuts or new taxes needed to reach the deficit target.
''It has become obvious to all concerned that the Office of Management and Budget consistently underestimates the deficits by resorting to the most optimistic economic assumptions it can credibly - and now sometimes even incredibly - employ,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
Mr. Reischauer told the committee that over the last 10 years the average amount by which the deficit exceeded the amount stipulated in the budget was $40.2 billion a year. He said the use of overly optimistic economic forecasts accounted for 43 percent of the miscalculation.
The budget panel will play a crucial role in deciding how savings from the Pentagon budget should be allocated between reducing the deficit or increasing money for domestic programs.
In a preliminary study of where the military savings might come from, the budget committee's staff has calculated that $93 billion over the next four years could be made available by deferring production on the Sea Wolf submarine and the C-17 transport plane, scaling back the antimissile defense system, and cancelling programs for the B-2 bomber, the mobile basing system for the MX missile, the V-22 vertical lift plane, the Army Air Defense Antitank system and the advanced tactical fighter.
According to the staff study, these deferrals and cancellations would save from $13 billion to $18 billion in the 1991 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds U.S. Expects Peace Dividend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Three out of four Americans say the warming of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can open the way for cuts in military spending, and by a wide margin they want this ''peace dividend'' spent to fight problems here at home rather than to cut taxes or close the budget deficit.
That is a central finding of the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll and is consistent with an important shift in public sentiment registered in a number of recent surveys: the rebellion against government and taxes, which dominated the politics of the 1980's, is abating and the desire for government intervention at home is on the rise.
A majority wants the Federal Government to spend more to fight drugs and to protect the enviornment. Four out of 10 Americans said they would be willing to pay $100 a year more in Federal taxes if the money would go for those purposes.
 
The Mood of Americans
The poll of 1,557 adults was conducted from Jan. 13 to 15 to gauge the mood of Americans as Congress prepares to receive President Bush's budget and his State of the Union Message next week. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
The central dynamic of the new Congressional session, which opened Tuesday, will be reconciling the pressure for increased domestic spending with the continuing deficit problem and the widely expressed view in the Bush Administration that the United States should not abruptly reduce its military strength.
But pressure to cut military spending is on the rise. When Mr. Bush took office a year ago, 24 percent of the public favored a decrease in military spending. In the current survey, 36 percent said they favored such a decrease. The number who would keep military spending the same has declined over the same period, from 58 percent to 48 percent, while the 13 percent who would increase spending is essentially unchanged from a year ago.
In January 1981, when Ronald Reagan began his Presidencvy on the promise of a major military buildup, only 7 percent of the public thought military spending should be decreased, while 61 percent favored an increase.
 
Military 'Restructuring' Planned
Mr. Bush announced today that his budget proposal would include the first stages of the Administration's plan for ''restructuring'' the military in light of the economic and political changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
The latest survey asked how Americans would like to spend the savings if there is a large cut in military spending in the next few years, whether they wanted ''to reduce the Federal budget deficit, to cut taxes or to spend more to fight problems such as drugs and homelessness.'' Only 10 percent said they would cut taxes; 21 percent favored cutting the deficit and 62 percent said they would spend the money to fight domestic problems.
''There is less tax fear and more of an accumulated public agenda,'' said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee. But he and other political analysts cautioned that there is a deep mistrust of government in the nation and a strong belief that general tax increases would be wasted.
 
Some Skeptical Comments
Indeed, when some people in the Times/CBS News Poll were asked if they would pay more taxes to fight drugs or clean up the environment, they said they would but then volunteered skeptical comments about what would really happen to the money.
''I'd pay and then hope to God the money would go to that,'' said Cynthia Olsen, the 38-year-old wife of an Army staff sergeant in Keizer, Ore., in a follow-up interview after the poll was completed.
Although she described herself as a Democrat, she said that if a politician guaranteed that the increased taxes would be spent for the purposes she supported, which include improving education, fighting drugs and cleaning the environment, ''he'd have my vote every time, whether he's a Republican or a Democrat.''
In recent years many Americans have rationalized seemingly contradictory desires to cut taxes while preserving or even increasing spending on favored programs by saying that the money should be found by curbing waste, fraud and abuse. Other surveys have shown that many Americans believe a lot of the Federal budget is wasted. But now a new alternative to raising taxes is taking shape in the public mind: the peace dividend.
 
Split Over the Cold War
Americans are still wary of the new world order. Slightly more than half of those surveyed in the Times/CBS News Poll say the cold war is not over. But even among this group, 31 percent favor a decrease in military spending.
If relations between the United States and the Soviet Union continue to improve, most Americans expect there will be a peace dividend. Asked how much the nation could save on military spending in that eventuality, 36 percent said a lot of money and 38 percent said it would save some money.
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, seemed to be well aware of this public expectation when he arrived at a television talk show Sunday with figures to quantify the peace dividend. He said that in the budget Mr. Bush is to submit next Monday the peace dividend would amount to $10 billion, and as much as $40 billion within four years.
''What the political system will actually do with that, or how much it will actually be as it works its way through the political system, you just can't predict at this point,'' Mr. Darman added. It is widely expected that Congress, which very nearly enacted deep cuts in military spending last year, will cut more deeply into the Pentagon budget than Mr. Bush will propose Monday.
The President and other members of his Adminstration have cautioned against cutting too much too soon from the military. Many conservatives in Washington, and even many moderates and some liberals, are coming to see the American military presence in Europe as an important stabilizing force in the Continent's unpredictable political situation. Indeed, current arms reduction talks are seen by many of these people as a way to fend off the pressure for military cutbacks and preserve higher levels of arms and troops than the public mood and political process would produce on its own.
But if there are cuts in spending by the Defense Department, there is broad agreement on where the money should go. Domestic spending to fight problems like drugs and homelessnes is favored over other alternatives among virtually every demographic and political category. Sixty-nine percent of Democrats want to spend the money on domestic problems, but so do 56 percent of Republicans. And among the other Republicans, the clear choice is cutting the deficit (26 percent), while cutting taxes was the third choice (8 percent).
There are other variations, too. Seven out of 10 younger Americans, the 18-to-29-year-olds that both parties view as important to their future, favor spending any peace dividend on domestic problems, while only half of those who are 65 and over do.
The 101st session, which Congress resumed this week, has been one of the most difficult in memory. The House was staggered by a corruption scandal last year and seven Senators face ethics inquiry this year.
 
Corruption Scandals in Congress
The deep veins of cynicism about Washington were tapped in a question about whether members of Congress were financially corrupt. Forty percent said they thought some members of Congress were corrupt, 22 percent said half the members were and 18 percent said most of them are.
Despite corruption scandals in both the House and the Senate, the public attitude toward Congress is not at a record low. Forty-two percent of the public approves of the job Congress is doing, while 47 percent said they disapproved. When the same question was asked in October 1982, 33 percent approved and 50 percent disapproved.
Americans continue to have a better opinion of the representative from their own Congressional district than of Congress itself. Sixty-four percent said they approve of the job their own representatives are doing, while 21 percent disapproved.
Those who said they disapproved of Congress but approved of the work their own representative was doing were asked why they felt their lawmaker was doing a better job than Congress as a whole.
The answers illustrated the crucial importance of service to individuals in the home district and attention to local questions. The two reasons cited most often by nearly half of those who rated their representative better than Congress as a whole were that the lawmaker takes care of people in his or her district and communicates with people.

HEADLINE: New Plan By Owners Rejected

 BODY:
The baseball players' union yesterday rejected a proposal by the owners under which the players could accept the owners' revenue-sharing plan, with its pay-for-performance salary scale, but still qualify for elements of the current system, such as salary arbitration.
''Management loves to have a two-tiered wage structure,'' said Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union. ''All that does is breed problems and resentment.''
The proposal was announced by the owners' chief negotiator, Charles O'Connor. After a five-hour negotiating session in Tampa, Fla., O'Connor, general counsel of the Player Relations Committee, said the owners would be willing to include a grandfather clause in a new collective-bargaining agreement.
Under such a clause, he said by phone from Tampa, players who are in their first six years in the major leagues could opt to be covered by the existing economic rules. Those rules provide for salary arbitration for players after their third, fourth and fifth years in the majors.
Under the plan, the owners would commit 48 percent of gate and broadcasting revenue to player salaries and benefits. Salaries of players in their first six years would be determined by service time in the majors and status within a statistically devised scale. The players would not have the benefits now available: salary arbitration, guaranteed contracts and multiyear contracts.
The two sides plan to meet again today in Tampa, then recess until next Wednesday in New York.

HEADLINE: For Keeping Up With the Joneses, A Dual-Career Pair

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 21

 BODY:
By their houses, ye shall know them.
Houses built of the social trends of 1990, not just of bricks and mortar, were on display in all their neo-traditional glory at the 46th annual convention and exposition of the National Association of Home Builders, which ended here Monday.
From a ''house for the 'Thirtysomething' generation'' to the Busy Woman's Dream House, the shifts that have taken place within the American family are finding physical expression in the mass-production housing that is the stock in trade of the estimated 65,000 building professionals who descended upon the Georgia World Congress Center - and an exposition floor the size of nearly 17 football fields - for this yearly event.
In a year when housing starts were the lowest since the recession of the early 1980's, the economics of home building were very much on builders' minds. One seminar was titled ''If You Stay in This Business Long Enough, You'll Go Broke.'' 
''They're scrambling,'' said Barry A. Berkus, a Santa Barbara architect who designed two modular houses for the show. ''The builders are faced with a double-edged sword. They're worried about the savings and loans, their traditional source of financing, while at the same time they're looking at a lot of environmental regulations that are slowing down the building process.''
But where design ideas were concerned, there was no lack of trying. It was all here: working at home, teleconferencing, a yearning for the outdoors, a longing for tradition. Outside, classical windows, gables and other details harkened back to America's past. Inside, rather than formal spaces, there was a growing preference for family rooms and the rambling farmhouse-style kitchens that adjoin them.
Twin sinks in enlarged master bathrooms, the drip-free symbols of dual-career couples, are now standard-issue in nearly every new housing development. As Mr. Berkus put it, ''If the only time working couples see each other is between 7 and 7:30 in the morning and while cooking dinner, the bathroom and the kitchen had better become a living room.''
The much-touted media room of the 1980's seemed to yield to the living room, kitchen and family room; increasingly sophisticated technology makes it likely that images will be projected on screens that can drop down in any room.
When they were not chatting about ''power facades'' and ''big-impact looks'' or attending talks on ''Surging Slabs'' and ''90 Marketing Ideas for the 90's in 90 Minutes'' (''See how hot design ideas can make your product sizzle!'') builders engaged in an unusual form of tourism by taking bus tours to Atlanta subdivisions. They also flocked to showcase houses, most constructed for the conference on the outskirts of the city, that were meant to demonstrate the latest residential design trends.
The most talked-about of these was the 2,300-square-foot New American Home '90, sponsored by Builder magazine, Home magazine and the National Council of the Housing Industry, the manufacturers' arm of the builders' association. Designed by Claude Miquelle, a Wakefield, Mass., architect, the house, priced just under $200,000 in the Atlanta market, was meant to reflect the needs of ''Thirtysomething'' couples raising young children. According to a National Association of Home Builders profile of new home buyers, released at the conference, the median age of the new single-family home buyer has risen from 32.8 years in 1976 to 36.8 years in 1989.
An unfinished upstairs ''bonus'' space with a separate entry is intended to be used as either a home office, a ''granny flat'' or as an accessory apartment for a visiting (or returning) child. According to the architect, such flexible interior spaces have become vital. ''Today's couples may have four kids, or no kids, depending on the weekend,'' he said.
In contrast to the open plans of the 1970's, the vaulting interior spaces are informally divided by varied floor and ceiling heights, half-walls with columns, and French doors with transoms. The front entry leads directly into the family room, which is on a lower level, with an informal dining room on one side of the entry and a parlor on the other. In a break with the ''Father Knows Best'' tradition, the main staircase is in the kitchen, which is now, Mr. Berkus said, the room ''the family watches Ted Koppel in.''
''Rather than sitting around the living room in an artificially formal posture,'' said John Bloodgood, a Des Moines architect, ''we're recognizing who we are. The kitchen and the family room are becoming the reality of the house, instead of being tucked away. As the family spends less time together, they want to communicate more.''
Improbable road signs that read ''Dream House: Straight Ahead'' led to the Busy Woman's Dream House, sponsored by Family Circle magazine. The house, built and designed in accordance with a reader survey, tries yet again to answer the question, ''What do women want?'' Among its features is an entertainment center built into the kitchen island and a children's wing with a shuttered laundry chute.
Despite their professional strides, women are still the ''coffee cup fairies'' who shoulder the burden of housework, said Marilyn Turnipseed, the Georgia builder who built the house.
Designed by Jane Siris and Peter Coombs of Siris-Coombs Architects in New York, the house has an attractive pine deck and veranda that extends the interior floor plane to the outside, another trend. It combines a ranch house plan with ''a form of American architecture people like,'' Ms. Siris said.
There were two adjoining factory-built modular ''nest'' (new expanding shelter technology) houses by Mr. Berkus, one of 1,560 square feet and the other of 1,105. They addressed both the aging population and marketing to couples with children, a new concern. Three-foot-wide doorways are incorporated to accommodate wheelchairs. Privacy for children is achieved in small rooms, one with pull-down beds and another with a divider like a sliding windowshade.
The factory-built houses played to the most popular jargon at the convention: ''affordability'' and ''the family market.'' They attracted long lines as builders queued up, occasionally distracted by Vanna White look-alikes in leather minis singing about faucet warranties. The houses' vinyl shingles, pitched roofs and round clerestory windows - a mystifying architectural pastiche Mr. Berkus called ''national regionalism'' - were an attempt, he said, to blend ''old forms with new technology.''
Among the thousand or so exhibitors at the show certain trends were evident. In a nod to the influence of architects, Frank Lloyd Wright in particular, several companies were showing architect-inspired collections. At the General Electric booth there was a Prairie Kitchen. It had Stickley-esque hardware and leaded-glass cabinet doors. It also had a home canning center, a nod to canning as a ''family togetherness activity,'' said Bob Mundt, a designer of G. E. appliances.
Wright also lived on at Marvin Windows in a new insulated corner window with a 90-degree bend, and at Pella Windows and Doors in an Architect Series of insulating windows in Prairie, Palladian and Mission styles.
Spotted in the crowd the Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman confessed that after a while, his eyes ''began to glaze over like heat-seeking missiles.'' But he applauded the resurgence of Wright. ''It's reassuring to see that America is still interested in itself,'' he said.
The growing interest in home technology seemed to reach its apex in the bathroom. Kohler introduced Pillow Talk, a whirlpool bath with a squishy padded rim. A computer controls water temperature, lights under the rim of the tub, room lights and the radio; the bath costs $7,000, without faucets. For those who have everything, there was also a matching chaise longue for the bathroom in water-resistant synthetic leather.
In perhaps the ultimate manifestation of the ''smart'' house, there was the Smart Seat, a microprocessor-controlled bidet attachment for the toilet, as yet only available (for $1,000 to $1,500) in Japan. Shown at American Standard, it attracted the kind of attention that might normally greet a moon man. This ''total hygiene system'' had a ''seat-activation switch'' to control the temperature of the water, dryer and seat. America, take note: it also has a memory.
Other new unveilings included a halogen cooktop at Dacor, a handsome barrier-free shower for elderly people at Kohler, a pull-down ironing board with a built-in light at Nutone), and a spa by Jacuzzi that had a built-in deck. The salesman offered the dubious suggestion that the deck might be used for ''wine and cheese.''
The Slicer-Dicer Award for the most bizarre gadget might go the Cybiag, or Can You Believe It's A Garage Door? This garage door - disguised with a curtained window - is manufactured by a division of Ashland Engineering Inc. of Park Ridge, Ill. On Sunday, about a hundred builders attended a seminar, one of nearly 200 during the convention, called ''Marketing to Kids: The Heart of the New Family.'' Discussing the ''hippie-yuppie dichotomy,'' said Mr. Bloodgood, the architect, along with Todd Zimmerman, a housing research and strategic planner from Clinton, N.J., and Randall Lewis, an Upland, Calif., builder, discussed the ''hot buttons'' essential to catering to baby boom families.
In the future, Mr. Bloodgood predicted, there will be an additional activity room in the house ''for finger painting and growing hydroponic vegetables.'' But for now, Mr. Zimmerman suggested, builders should pay attention to children's housing preferences, including ''the Swiss Family Robinson syndrome,'' the fact that most children would rather live in a tree than a house.
Mr. Zimmerman told the crowd not to overlook ''the guilt factor'' in marketing to ''Thirtysomething'' couples with children.
''Kids are the road to higher profits,'' said Mr. Lewis. He urged the builders to be more involved in their local communities by building playgrounds, sponsoring summer pizza parties and the like. ''You'll not only be the good guy,'' he said. ''It's good for referrals.''

HEADLINE: Rewriting Auction Records

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
IN 1989, defying reports of a softening economy, many antiques and collectibles enthusiasts paid record prices for the rarest works, some with choice pedigrees, in the booming auction market.
Two spectacular prices fetched last year - $12.1 million for an American 18th-century desk-bookcase and $88,000 for a 1920's German teddy bear - were paid by buyers who, some dealers and collectors said, were affected by auction fever. They were determined to acquire these objects at any price. In both cases the bidders encountered stiff competition, and the sums they paid for their prizes far exceeded the auction houses' expectations. 
The Steiff teddy bear caused a sensation when it was auctioned at Sotheby's in London in September, bringing four times the $19,630 that a Steiff bear had brought in May at Christie's South Kensington in London.
The desk-bookcase, the tallest surviving example of what was a status symbol for merchants in Colonial America, was expected to bring $3 million to $5 million, a price commensurate with its pedigree and proportions. When the bidding ended at the June sale at Christie's in New York, the bonnet-topped secretary, made in the 1760's for Nicholas Brown of Providence, R.I., probably by John Goddard of Newport, had surpassed the previous auction record for furniture: $2.97 million paid at Sotheby's in London in 1988 for a Louis XVI console that once belonged to Marie Antoinette.
''Not all masterpieces hang on the wall,'' said Harold Sack of Israel Sack Inc., the New York dealer, after he bought the Newport secretary for a collector he would not name. His client was identified by trade sources as the Texas financier Robert M. Bass.
Auction fever characterized the bidding for other works, too. Some, like the secretary, had enviable pedigrees; others, like the bear, were bought out of sheer collecting enthusiasm. These were among the year's records:
* A Tang horse was sold last December at Sotheby's in London for $5.95 million, a record for Chinese art, to Keiichi Shimojo, a Japanese dealer who bid for a man whom he would identify only as 70-year-old Tokyo real-estate investor.
* A diamond-encrusted ''Pine Cone'' Easter egg by Peter Carl Faberge was sold last May for $3.1 million, a record for any 19th-century work of the decorative arts, at Christie's in Geneva to Joan Kroc, the owner of the San Diego Padres.
* A lotus-shaped lamp made about 1900 by Daum and Louis Majorelle of Nancy, France, brought $1.76 million at Sotheby's in New York in December, a record for Art Nouveau. The buyer was a Japanese bidder who was not identified.
* The $522,500 paid for a Navajo First Phase chief's blanket by David Walentas, a New York real-estate developer, rewrote the record for American Indian art. The price, four times the previous level, was reached at a November sale at Sotheby's in New York.
* In May at the same house, Anthony De Lorenzo, a New York dealer, paid $374,000 for a black lacquer screen by Eileen Gray, a record for a work by the designer.
In collectibles, sometimes emotion plays a major part in the decision to buy. The look on the Steiff teddy bear's face proved irresistible to Paul and Rosemary Volpp. Mr. Volpp, a semiretired West Coast manufacturer of parts for construction equipment, said this week that he gave two instructions to Jack Wilson, a British friend who bid for him and his wife: ''I said, 'I want complete anonymity'; I said, 'Buy the bear.' ''
The Volpps collect teddy bears, and he wanted to give this one to his wife as a 42d wedding anniversary present. ''We admit to owning a little over 5,000 teddy bears, but nobody has the will to count them,'' he said.
Although the presale estimate was $1,120 to $1,440, the Volpps thought the bear would sell for about $23,000. But the bidding was fierce. ''The problem was, there were two people with the same idea,'' Mr. Volpp said.
Rarity commanded high prices in several sales. A complex boxwood clock by Thomas Tompion, a Charles II design made in the late 17th century, brought $1.4 million at Christie's in London in July, when it was sold to Asprey of London. The price was a record for any clock.
An Art Deco wastebasket by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann was bought by Francois de Menil, a New York architect, for $33,000, a record for a wastebasket, at Sotheby's in New York in May. A much-sought black and white celluloid of Donald Duck in the Disney cartoon ''Orphan's Benefit'' was sold in May for $286,000 to a Canadian collector. And in a November sale at Christie's East in New York, a 1950's Thunder Robot brought $9,020, a record for a toy robot.
''The market goes forward in leaps and then fills in the gaps,'' said James J. Lally, a New York dealer in Chinese art. ''The Tang horse had that tugging effect, that tractor effect.''
Navajo blankets are gaining in popularity, and when a rare one appears, collectors compete relentlessly for it. Mr. Walentas, who owns about a dozen Navajo weavings, said he never intended to spend $522,500 for his, which had been estimated to bring $100,000 to $150,000.
''I got carried away,'' he said. ''I really did not intend to spend that kind of money. I bid by telephone. I just wanted to own it. It is something that only comes along very occasionally. It is not the kind of record you want to set.'' Will these prices ever be repeated? The Faberge market is soon to be tested. In April, the ''Bonbonniere'' Easter egg is to be auctioned at Christie's in New York, with a presale estimate of more than $1 million. Like the ''Pine Cone'' egg, the ''Bonbonniere'' was made not for a Romanov but for Alexander Ferdinandovich Kelch, a gold-mining industrialist from St. Petersburg.
''The big publicity surrounding the price paid for the 'Pine Cone' inspired the client to contact us and to sell it,'' said Marie Stock, one of Christie's specialists in Russian art.
Dean Failey, who heads Christie's sales of American furniture and decorative arts, said the extraordinary price paid for the Newport secretary was no fluke, as was demonstrated last weekend in Christie's sale of American furniture.
''Everyone - collectors, dealers and auctioneers - was looking at this sale as a barometer of what the coming year holds in store in the American furniture market,'' Mr. Failey said. A Philadelphia 18th-century pier table was sold for $4.62 million - the second-highest price for a piece of furniture - to Mr. Sack. And a Philadelphia 18th-century tea table was bought for $1.2 million by Leigh Keno, another New York dealer.
High prices work ''like a magnet,'' Mr. Sack said. ''They give people support to invest in buying American furniture. As far as sellers are concerned, a lot of great pieces are attracted to the market. Money is honey. The secretary was a benchmark. That $12 million secretary makes everything else seem reasonable in price.''

The Economy
Interest rates in Japan and West Germany are surging and in the process dragging up American rates at just the wrong moment for the nation's fragile economy, many economists say.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 10.82, A Comeback After Plunge

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 62 points in the first half-hour of trading yesterday, then climbed back during the balance of the day to close at 2,604.50, down 10.82.
Analysts said changes in technical factors and fears of rising interest rates had caused the plunge. They said the rally reflected, at least in part, a strong reception in the credit markets to the Treasury's auction of two-year notes.
At the close, declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered rising ones, 1,207 to 384. That indicated that most of the recovery was led by a few important stocks, as was the earlier decline. Volume on the Big Board soared to 207.8 million shares, from 179.3 million on Tuesday. 
The analysts said the large opening drop and the later climb was driven by computerized trading, which took advantage of an odd spread between the Standard & Poor index of 500 stocks and the nearest futures contract on the index, for March. The S.&P. index fell 1.35 yesterday, to 330.26, a premium to the March futures contract.
Normally, the futures contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell a certain amount of a financial instrument at a specified time and price, sell for more than the S.&P. 500 index.
That abnormality prompted program traders and arbitragers to sell the underlying shares in favor of buying the unusually ''cheap'' futures.
The early decline was also reinforced by falling bond prices and rising yields, which have contributed heavily in recent weeks to the large losses in the stock market.
Other negative influences included the sharp overnight drop of 599.04 points, or 1.60 percent, in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei average of 225 issues. The fall left the average below the 37,000 mark.
Stock prices were also hurt by the surge in interest rates that followed the poor reception accorded the Treasury's auction of $5 billion in 40-year bonds on Tuesday.
 
Strong Recovery
The recovery yesterday gathered full force in the late afternoon, when the computer-program traders who had sold the blue-chip issues from the opening were instructed by their programs to buy most of them back, as those stock prices fell to more attractive levels.
''One positive technical factor undoubtedly put into the computers was the fact that most trades under 10,000 shares during the first hour were buys, not sells,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, who heads an investment consulting firm bearing his name in New York. ''Many small traders apparently expected the early decline because of the index spreads and saw it as an opportunity to buy.''
The analysts also said the opportunity to make money on the other side of the technical-trading coin combined late in the day with the unexpectedly strong demand for $10 billion worth of two-year notes at a Treasury auction yesterday.
Bond traders said the response to the note auction would take some upward pressure off short-term interest rates, which in turn would help make for a more promising climate when the stock market opens this morning.
 
Above 2,600 Level
Another positive technical factor yesterday, Mr. Birinyi said, is that the Dow closed above 2,600. Many of the analysts conceded that a close below 2,600 would have been very troublesome, to say the least.
After yesterday's close, Donald M. Selkin, the index futures and options specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said: ''The situation is back to normal and, if anything, the 500 index futures are now dearer than the cash market. Added to this positive situation was the surprisingly good reception given the Treasury's two-year notes, which slowed the rise in Treasury yields.''
In New York, the S.&P. 500 index closed at 330.26, but the March futures contract on the index, which trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for 15 minutes after the Big Board closes, finished with a gain of 2.85, at 333.10. Thus, the futures settled with a premium of 2.84 points over the cash, or actual, index.
 
Normal Premium of 2.05
Mr. Selkin said he calculated that the normal premium on the March 500 futures contract at yesterday's close should have been 2.05 points. The premium is calculated by using a formula that included the number of days to the expiration of the nearest 500 index futures, which is March 16, the interest investors would get if they put their money into 90-day Treasury bills instead of into the basket of 500 stocks and related factors.
Typical of how such computer trading can influence the price of even the bluest of the blue chips was the performance of Merck, the pharmaceutical company based in Rahway, N.J. Its shares closed up 3/4, at 72 5/8, after falling as low as 69 3/4 during the opening selloff.
But among the most-active Big Board issues, changes were fractional, except for Tucson Electric, which dropped 3 1/4, to 13 5/8, on a volume of 2.1 million shares. The Arizona utility not only omitted its quarterly dividend but was downgraded to a ''sell'' by Prudential-Bache, which says Tucson may not resume paying dividends for several years.
Citicorp was the most-active issue, off 3/4, at 24, on 6.3 million shares. Further talk had arisen about the bank holding company acquiring some of the assets of the troubled Bank of New England, which rose 1/2, to 3 3/4.
 
UAL Rises to $161.50
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, was again the subject of rumors about an offer by employees to buy the company for $190 a share. The stock closed up 6, at 161 1/2. New York Stock Exchange officials, concerned by stock's volatility, asked UAL if it had any solid developments to report. Officials of the company, based in Elk Grove Township, Ill., said their policy was not to comment on the behavior of its stock or on rumors.
On the American Stock Exchange, Texas Air was the most-active issue, dropping 1 3/8, to 7 3/8, on 6.7 million shares. Officials of the Houston-based company said they could not explain the decline or the unusually high volume. At the First Boston Corporation, the traders said they crossed a block of a million Texas Air shares at 6 1/2. The traders at other brokerages said 900,000 shares of the carrier were crossed at 6 1/4.
The Amex's market-value index dropped 5.06, at 354.67, while in the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index lost 4.76 at 425.66

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Joins Siemens In Developing Chips

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
In a move to strengthen its ability to compete with Japanese semiconductor manufacturers, the International Business Machines Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to work with the West German electronics giant Siemens A.G. to develop advanced computer memory chips for the mid-1990's.
I.B.M. was also encouraged yesterday in its effort to develop ties to the computer industry in Europe when officials at Project Jessi, a European semiconductor consortium, said they would welcome the American company's participation in selected projects with the group. Project Jessi includes Siemens, Philips N.V. and Thomson CSF.
The two announcements are evidence of a growing trans-Atlantic technology cooperation, largely motivated by the fear of Japanese domination of the world's supply of semiconductors, industry executives and analysts said. Several other American companies have development agreements with Japanese manufacturers, but none have such an extensive tie to a European company. 
 
Atlantic Chip Alliance
I.B.M. executives have indicated for some months that the American computer maker has been seeking closer ties with European companies to form an Atlantic alliance. Such an alliance may insure that the United States and Europe will remain independent suppliers of advanced semiconductor chips.
''This is part of a strategy to improve the balance in a global sense,'' said Paul Bergevin, an I.B.M. spokesman. ''The effort is not directed against any particular set of suppliers. But the Japanese are also systems makers who we compete against. We are trying to strengthen the other two legs of the triangle.''
The I.B.M.-Siemens collaboration also reflects the rapidly rising cost of developing new generations of dynamic random access memory, or D-RAM, chips. The highest capacity commercial chip now holds four million bits of information.
I.B.M. and Siemens will jointly develop a chip capable of storing 64 million bits of information - or the equivalent of 10 good-sized novels -on a single fingernail-sized sliver of silicon. Chips with this capacity are expected to be commercial manufactured as early as 1995.
Currently, chips that can store 16 million bits of information are in the advanced stages of development. The 64-million-bit chip is the next step in the evolution of semiconductors.
''Even for companies the size of I.B.M. and Siemens, the costs of trying to go it alone in developing new generations of memory chips are very significant,'' said Michael Borrus, co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics. ''If you can cut those costs in various in ways, it is a tremendous advantage.''
 
Failure of U.S. Memories
I.B.M. officials said yesterday that the agreement with Siemens was not related to the recent failure of U.S. Memories. That attempt to build an American semiconductor manufacturer of advanced memory chips fell apart on Jan. 15 because not enough American computer makers were willing to invest in it.
Analysts and industry executives said the negotiations between I.B.M. and Siemens have been going on for about a year. Although the idea behind U.S. Memories and the announcement of the I.B.M.-Siemens agreement are not directly related, they are both part of the same plan, the executives said.
''I.B.M. views the Europeans as being well ahead of most Americans in their understanding of the threat posed by the Japanese and their understanding the importance of responding in a strategically cohesive manner,'' said Charles H. Ferguson, a computer industry researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
As part of the agreement to develop new memory chip technology, the two companies will immediately begin to cooperate at I.B.M.'s new advanced semiconductor technology center in East Fishkill, N.Y., and at the Munich semiconductor laboratories of Siemens. No dollar value was assigned to the agreement.
 
X-Ray Lithography
I.B.M. executives said the work would concentrate on chip design and semiconductor-processing technology. But they said it would not include the development of X-Ray lithography technologies.
I.B.M. says it is working on using X-Rays instead of light to manufacture advanced chips because it believes that in the mid- to late 1990's semiconductors will become so dense that lightwaves will fail to resolve the ultra-thin circuit line widths of advanced chips.
The company has signed an agreement with Motorola Inc. to participate in the development of X-Ray lithography technologies.
Officials at Project Jessi, which stands for Joint European Submicron Silicon, also said yesterday that the organization considers Jessi-Sematech cooperation as an important factor in establishing a strong industry for both European and United States semiconductor manufacturers.
Sematech is a consortium financed by American computer and semiconductor companies and the United States Government to develop advanced chip-making equipment.

British Ford Strike Averted

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Workers at the Ford Motor Company Ltd. voted by nearly 3 to 2 to accept a 10.2 percent pay increase, averting a nationwide strike, union leaders said today.
Final returns showed that 59 percent of those voting went against their union leaders' recommendations and accepted the improved offer. 
They will get a 10.2 percent raise in the first year and a minimum of 8 percent, or a choice of 2.5 percent above inflation, in the second year.
The vote took place on Tuesday and today. Most of the 32,000 workers at the American company's 22 British plants earn an average of $374 a week.
Union leaders rejected the offer last week and sought agreement from the workers to start striking with the last shift on Friday.
The Ford pay negotiations are considered a standard for Britain's manufacturing industry. The Ford deal is likely to mean more double-digit pay demands. The engineering union, the country's largest, immediately said it considered 10.2 percent a benchmark for raises throughout industry.
A Ford spokesman in Britain said the vote ''has saved us the prospect of a potentially damaging strike here and at Ford's continental plants.''

HEADLINE: Earnings Drop At Du Pont

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 24

 BODY:
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company said today that its fourth-quarter earnings dropped 3.4 percent, prompting some analysts to lower expectations of the company's 1990 results.
Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., had earnings of $483 million, or 71 cents a share, in the 1989 quarter, compared with $500 million, or 70 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier, when more shares were outstanding. 
For the year, Du Pont posted a 13.2 percent increase in earnings, to $2.48 billion, or $3.53 a share, on revenues of $35.9 billion. In 1988, Du Pont earned $2.19 billion, or $3.04 a share, on revenues of $32.7 billion.
The company said its quarterly profits were depressed by softening in economic sectors important to the company, including automobiles, housing and electronics.
 
James Wilbur, an analyst for
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said he lowered his 1990 earnings estimate to $3.85 a share, from $3.88, primarily because of anticipated weakness in the auto industry, an important market for Du Pont's polymers, which are used in plastics.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Change Seen

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 24

 BODY:
A. W. Clausen, who led the BankAmerica Corporation back from the brink of financial ruin, is expected to retire this year as the bank's chief executive, banking industry officials said today.
The changing of the guard might take place at or after the company's annual shareholders meeting in May, they said. 
Richard Rosenberg, 59 years old, the vice chairman for retail operations, is expected to be named the new chief executive, executives said. A bank spokesman would not comment on any changes.
 
Mr. Clausen, 66, who ran
BankAmerica in the 1970's and left to head the World Bank in 1981, returned as chairman and chief executive in 1986, a time when BankAmerica was suffering from huge losses and was the target of a takeover attempt by the First Interstate Bancorp. Mr. Clausen fought off the takeover, revamped the bank's management team and engineered a recovery with steadily increasing earnings.
Two other major California banks, the Security Pacific Corporation and First Interstate, recently announced the retirements of their chief executives.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Were Flat in Mid-January

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 24

 BODY:
Sales of the eight companies that build cars in the United States were flat in mid-January, compared with a year ago.
The Big Three auto makers sold fewer cars in the 10-day period, compared with a year earlier, while Honda, Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi posted increases.
The sales figures for the 10 days ended Jan. 20 translate into a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.8 million cars, slightly better than some analysts had been expecting.

''If the industry can keep selling at this pace, inventories could get back to normal in a matter of weeks,'' said Scott Merlis, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. He said the steady pace of sales in January have resulted in ''very meaningful inventory reduction.''
Light-truck sales rose 9.3 percent during the 10 days, led by the Chrysler Corporation, which continued to draw customers with its first rebates on mini-vans.
Analysts said rebates and a steady economy kept vehicle sales from falling below last year's level, which was a fairly strong sales period.
The eight manufacturers sold 156,333 automobiles in mid-January, up slightly from 156,284 in the period last year.
Steady sales would be good news for the auto makers, which have ordered widespread plant shutdowns and cut about 200,000 vehicles from their first-quarter production schedules in an effort to reduce inventories.
 
Ford to Idle Plants
The Ford Motor Company announced today that it planned to idle two car plants, in Edison, N.J., and Kansas City, Mo., and a truck plant in Louisville, Ky., for a week in early February. The shutdowns will result in temporary layoffs of 5,600 hourly workers.
Production slowdowns have spread to include some factories partly or wholly owned by Japanese manufacturers. Diamond-Star Motors, the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's joint venture with Chrysler, plans to cut the output of cars it manufactures for Chrysler at its plant in Normal, Ill. And Mazda Motor Manufacturing Inc. in Flat Rock, Mich., will trim its production of the Ford Probe later this month.
''If we kept the line speed at normal levels, we'd have more cars than we could sell,'' a Mazda spokesman said.
But the Honda Motor Company, which began producing cars at its new factory in East Liberty, Ohio, last month, said it had no plans to curb production. Slight Gain at G.M. The General Motors Corporation sold 110,736 vehicles, up 1.1 percent from the comparable period last year. Light trucks led the way with a 5.9 percent gain, to 41,036 units. But sales of G.M. cars fell 1.5 percent, to 69,700 units.
Ford's sales fell 6.1 percent, to 82,899, with cars down 10.4 percent, to 47,122, and light trucks up two-tenths of 1 percent, to 35,777.
Chrysler posted a 14.1 percent increase in sales, to 52,340 vehicles. Chrysler's car sales fell 8.8 percent, to 20,196, but its light-truck sales surged by 35.6 percent, spurred by the rebates on its mini-vans.
The Toyota Motor Corporation and Mistubishi both posted sizable sales increases for the 10-day period, reflecting new United States production added since last year. Toyota sold 7,405 cars in mid-January, compared with 1,571 a year earlier. Mitsubishi sold 1,918 cars during the 10 days, compared with 311 in the 1989 period.
Honda's sales increased 14.9 percent, to 7,241 cars, while Mazda posted an increase of 55.4 percent, to 1,049 cars.
The Nissan Motor Company was the only Japanese auto maker to post lower sales on its American-made vehicles, with car sales falling 12.5 percent, to 1,702, and light-truck sales plunging by 42.1 percent, to 1,805.

HEADLINE: Fed Expects Slow Growth This Year

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 24

 BODY:
The nation's economy is expected to grow slowly in 1990, with improvements in some regions later in the year, the Federal Reserve Board said today.
''Economic activity is expanding slowly in most of the nation, with conditions somewhat stronger in the West than in the East,'' the central bank said in a summary of its so-called beige book.
The report did not mention any inflationary problems - the reason the Fed slowed the economy early last year by driving up interest rates to dampen demand and cool off pressure on prices. 
The Fed switched course last June and has permitted short-term rates to drop gradually in an effort to keep the slowing economy from falling into a recession. But the central bank has not acted since mid-December and last week the White House broke its usual no-comment stance on Fed activities and said that ''lower interest rates are justified.''
 
'Soft Landing' Seen
Nevertheless, the latest report appeared to indicate that most participants in the Fed's survey, completed Jan. 18, thought the central bank had achieved its ''soft landing'' - continued sluggish growth but no recession.
''The outlook is for slow growth in all regions in 1990,'' the report said. ''Some respondents expect improvement late in the year.''
The survey is conducted eight times a year in preparation for meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary policy-setting arm. The next meeting will be held on Feb. 6-7.
The beige book summed up trends in various sectors of the economy in recent weeks.
''Retail sales in the holiday season ranged from 'disappointing' in Boston to modest in Philadelphia and Atlanta and relatively strong in Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco,'' the report said. ''However, widespread discounting generally reduced store profits. Retailers expect flat sales or modest increases through the first six months of 1990. Results in the first weeks of January were said to be encouraging.''
 
Manufacturing Sluggish
The manufacturing sector also performed weakly, according to the report. ''Manufacturing activity is generally sluggish with production declines in some industries (autos, in particular) offsetting gains in others (such as commercial aircraft and oilfield equipment),'' the report said. ''Several districts reported that the steel and computer industries, among others, may be bottoming out. Most manufacturers expected slow growth in 1990, with a weak first half followed by gradual improvement.''
Weather also had an impact on various sectors of the economy, the report said, pointing out that cold weather hurt construction activity in some regions and that cold or dry weather hurt citrus, vegetable and winter wheat crops. It also said that the real estate industry held steady or improved modestly.

Yields' Slide Is Slowed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of tax-exempt and taxable money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the week ended yesterday, but the decline was not as steep as a week ago.
Analysts at Donoghue's said they still expected lower interest because of a weak United States economy. But they added that the trend toward lower interest rates had been interrupted as higher interest rates abroad affect the American economy. 
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market mutual fund was down 5 basis points in the week, to 8 percent, while the 30-day yield fell a similar amount, to 8.14 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
Taxables Up $2.5 Billion
Assets of taxable funds rose $2.5 billion, to $373 billion. Donoghue's analysts said most of the increase came from consumer funds, where assets increased $1.9 billion, to $292.8 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios increased three days, to 41. The increase may be a reflection of managers having to go further in maturities to get higher yields. Shorter maturities have not shown many increases.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, the best performer was the Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I.. It had a return of 8.90 percent, or about 90 basis points better than the average yield this week.
 
Tax-Exempts Are Flat
Tax-exempt assets increased $9.3 million, essentially staying flat at $75.9 billion, as the average seven-day compounded yield decreased 7 basis points, to 5.33 percent. Taxable equivalents were 7.40 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket and 7.95 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
Just as it has been for the last few weeks and again for the week ended yesterday, the top-performing tax-free fund was the Evergreen Tax-Free Money Market Fund, distributed by the Evergreen Asset Management Company in Purchase, N.Y. Donoghue's said the fund posted a return of 6 percent, about 67 points better than the average.
By contrast, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index showed bank money market accounts and six-month certificates of deposit unchanged, at 6.32 percent and 7.87 percent, respectively.

'Junk' Forecast: Wide Premiums

BYLINE: By Richard D. Hylton

 BODY:
A RECENT study by a bond research organization concluded that ''junk bond'' interest rates would have to remain 5.3 percentage points above Treasury yields to reward investors fairly for the high risk of default.
''While a 2.6 percent premium was adequate for the traditional junk bond buyer, bond funds and individuals who participate in the market will not be adequately compensated at these levels,'' the study by the Bond Investors Association said.
The study, done by Richard Lehmann, president of the nonprofit research organization, offers some startling figures. But perhaps even more startling are the conclusions about the future of the junk bond market one would reach if the study's logic is extended a few years into the future. The association, which is based in Miami Lakes, Fla., is supported by members and publishes a newsletter. 
Among the findings is that in the last decade 651 junk bond issues defaulted on more than $30.5 billion. The group calculated that the junk bond market comprises 3,500 issues with a value of more than $300 billion of debt, a figure up to $100 billion higher than some previous assessments.
The study, which grouped defaults by the year of issue, demonstrated that for every year about 38 percent of the junk bond issues would eventually go into default. Based on that record of default, Mr. Lehmann predicted $40 billion in defaults in the next three years, with $15 billion of that this year.
''The high incidence of default should keep junk bond yields at current levels,'' Mr. Lehmann said. ''This means that the new issue volume in 1990 will continue its sharp decline since fewer businesses can justify paying such rates.''
An even more important point that the study tries to make is that the rates are high because this is not a good time to be in the junk bond market. Mr. Lehmann regards the present rates as a sign of what is to come, not a buying opportunity.
''The 5.3 percent premium that we came up with is interesting not only because that's where the market is now, but what it says is the differential doesn't represent a buying opportunity but indicates where the market is going to be in the future,'' he said. ''It's not going back to 2.6 percent premium that was adequate for the junk bond buyer.''
There is substantial evidence to support the contention that these kinds of differentials between Treasuries and junk are here to stay.
First, as junk bonds grow more risky, the likelihood that these high yields will be maintained and that defaults will rise is strong. According to Moody's Investors Service, in December of 1981 $22.6 billion of bonds was graded as junk, or below investment grade. That accounted for 6.5 percent of all corporate bonds rated by Moody's. At that time, approximately 42 percent were assigned a Ba rating, that is, where the least risky junk bonds are.
Today the amount of junk rated by Moody's has a face value of $226.2 billion, which accounts for 25.4 percent of all corporate bonds rated by Moody's. The least risky Ba-rated category accounts for only 25 percent of rated junk bonds. On the other hand, the B-rated and even lower-rated categories grew.
''Between 1970 and 1988, the one-year default rate on average for a Ba-rated junk was 1.6 percent,'' said John Lonski, a senior economist with Moody's. ''For B-rated, junk it was 6.7 percent. If we continue to observe the downward shift toward B-rated, then the default rates, of course, will rise.''
Mr. Lonski emphasized that the buzzword now among many junk bond buyers is ''conservative.'' And with good reason. ''You have to keep in mind that the junk bond market has been skewed toward increased risk on average,'' he said. ''If I were putting together a junk bond portfolio now, I would skew my portfolio toward the upper echelon of the junk bond universe.''
If the picture of steady defaults in a junk bond universe that is more speculative and 10 times larger than it was in December 1981 does not paint a grim picture, the specter of a recession on top it all certainly finishes the job.
''If we have a mild recession, we may find that banks and other sources will not be able to lend short-term money to make up for cash shortfalls of junk bond issuers,'' Mr. Lonski said, ''and a number of the more precarious issuers may not be able to procure short-term capital at favorable rates.''
This, of course, sharply increases the likelihood of a deluge of defaults. ''We've never had such a large and risky junk market come under the weight of a recession,'' Mr. Lonski said.
But history is not necessarily the best indicator of where the fast-moving junk market will go. Given the variables, the rate of default in the near term may prove significantly higher than the pattern developed in the last decade.
''If you extrapolate three years forward, you're looking at $40 billion in defaults,'' Mr. Lehmann estimated. ''We're looking for about $25 billion in new issues in 1990 and a 50 percent default rate in 1990 as a function of new issue volume.''

U.S. Notes and Bonds Fall Again

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Even as prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower again yesterday, some market participants and analysts said they saw the early signs of a strong technical rally.
Talk of a price rebound began to circulate after Tuesday's big selloff was followed by a further slide in prices during overnight trading in Tokyo. The bulk of those declines were made up once trading shifted to the United States.
''This is the first day we have felt constructive on the market in the past three weeks,'' said Roger A. Froelich, president of Technical Dimensions, a firm in Mount Kisco, N.Y., that provides research for institutional investors. ''We have had three weeks of declines, and expect a technically driven rally that will take yields on the 30-year bond back to around 8.25 percent.'' 
In late trading, the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was offered at a price of 96 30/32, down 5/32, to yield 8.40 percent. Earlier the bond had been offered at a price to yield 8.45 percent.
 
'Prices Will Correct'
One government bond trader, who asked not to be identified, said: ''The news that is coming on Friday is expected to be constructive for the market. We won't have any more supply for two weeks and we have come down a long ways in price. You can never be sure, but I would anticipate that prices will correct somewhat from here.''
Tomorrow the Government is scheduled to release reports on durable goods orders for December, as well as a preliminary estimate of how much the economy expanded in the fourth quarter. Most analysts anticipate that both reports will provide further evidence of generally weak conditions in the economy.
The sense of slow growth or no growth was underlined in the Federal Reserve's ''beige book,'' released yesterday. Compiled every six weeks or so by the Fed's regional banks, the report said that ''economic activity is expanding slowly in most regions of the country, with conditions somewhat stronger in the West than the East.''
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets, but analysts said the Fed's comments on inflation were reassuring. The report noted that with the exception of fuel prices, both producer prices and retail prices were steady to falling, ''with discounting occurring in some industries.''
Edward J. Sawicz, president of the Discount Corporation of New York, said the ''beige book fit fairly well with what we know about the economy; and the inflation news was better than I had anticipated.''
A big drop in stock prices helped to keep short-term interest rates firm for much of the session yesterday. But the modest gains were erased as the stock market rallied from its lows.
 
Note Auction Is Strong
In marked contrast to Tuesday, when the Government struggled to sell $5 billion of 40-year bonds for the Resolution Trust Corporation, dealers said that demand was strong for $10 billion of two-year Treasury notes auctioned yesterday.
Bids on the notes produced an average yield of 8.21 percent, 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, above the average yield on securities sold on Dec. 19, the last time two-year notes were auctioned.
The sharp rise in yields attracted healthy bids from individual investors. More than $1.3 billion in non-competitive bids were placed on the securities, the highest total since the July 26 two-year note auction.
In the secondary market for Treasury issues, in late trading yesterday the 7 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 96 25/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.35 percent. And the 7 3/4 percent five-year notes were offered at 97 27/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.26 percent.
Treasury bill rates eased slightly. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.65 percent late in the day, down three basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills dipped by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 7.56 percent.
 
Bell South Offering
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by a public offering of $275 million of notes by BellSouth ESOP Trust. Proceeds from the sale will be used to finance the purchase of BellSouth stock in its employee stock ownership plan. A total of $825 million in securities will ultimately be sold to finance the plan.
The 9 1/8 percent notes, which mature in July 2003, were priced at par, or $100, 73 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 7 7/8 percent ten-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The notes, guaranteed by the BellSouth Corporation, are rated AA-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AAA by Standard & Poor's. Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues were unchanged on the day.
Prices of most actively traded municipal bonds dipped by a quarter to a half a point, traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: SENATE, BY 4 VOTES, FAILS TO OVERRIDE BUSH'S CHINA VETO;
Getting Mad, Getting Even

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
In heading off what looked three days ago like a sure defeat on the China issue, President Bush proved today that a popular leader, if sufficiently aroused, can still change votes on Capitol Hill, even in this day of lax party discipline and constantly shifting coalitions.
Mr. Bush managed to keep his record intact; not one of his vetoes has been overridden by the heavily Democratic Congress. He won a fine victory for the executive branch in its decades-long struggle to keep the legislative branch from asserting control over foreign policy. And he had his way on a subject he is convinced he knows better than anyone else in Washington. 
 
Reasons for the Victory
But he did not win by much, and he needed a lot of help, however high he is flying in the opinion polls.
It helped that he needed to persuade only senators of his own party, and not all of them, to block a bill permitting Chinese students to remain in this country after their visas had expired. It helped that the Democrats made the bill a partisan question in their seeming eagerness to pin a defeat on the President within a few days of the start of the new legislative session.
It helped that not many voters were worked up over the issue. Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said he doubted that any of his colleagues had been approached by more than two or three constituents about the bill during the long holiday recess.
It helped that the President promised, through an executive order, to do essentially what the Democratic bill would have done - a step that allowed Republican lawmakers who worry deeply about civil liberties questions, like Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsyl vania, to support the White House.
 
A Passionate Argument
Most of all, it helped that George Bush, a mild man who usually finds it hard to communicate passion, got good and mad this time and showed it.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, who made a testy, offhand remark Tuesday about only five Republican Senators' backing the President, said he had never seen the President ''as focused, as forceful and as effective'' as he was at a morning meeting with Republican senators.
''He was just offended as hell that the Democrats would accuse him of kowtowing to the Chinese leaders or of jeopardizing the Chinese students,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''He let people see his annoyance, he told people that he understood the guys in power in Beijing - rattled off their names, phonetically perfect, guys I've never even heard of - and that convinced people.''
Mr. Bush was badly beaten in the House of Representatives on Wednesday. But like most Presidents, he found it easier to influence the relatively small number of senators. He knows them better, knows how best to twist their arms and to reward them, knows what issues appeal to them and why.
In addition, the longer the issue hung fire, the more it looked like an attempt by the Democrats not only to help the students, not only to register dissatisfaction with the President's relatively mild attitude toward the massacre last June in Tiananmen Square, but also to hand him a defeat early in his second year.
Senator Specter said that, to him, ''the whole thing started to have the smell of the Congress trying to land a political punch on the President's nose, and that made a lot of us rally around our man.''
 
'Politics,' Not 'Policy'
Seeking to frame the debate that way before the vote, Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, said, ''It's not China policy, it's American politics.''
As things turned out, the roll-call was about as close to a party-line matter as one sees these days, with all the Democrats present voting against Mr. Bush and all but 8 of the 45 Republicans voting with him.
In foreign-policy terms, most experts on Asian issues say they think the vote will have only a marginal effect. China faces problems of corruption, of economic stagnation and of institutional inadequacy so severe that this week's debate must seem minor. And Mr. Bush's executive order, plus his pledge today that ''no student, as long as I'm President, will be sent back,'' would seem to protect those who fear reprisals.
The Democrats had argued along with dissident Republicans that Mr. Bush was sending the leaders in Beijing ''a signal that they can get away with what they have done and retain their power,'' as Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican from Washington, argued this afternoon.
Some of those who voted against Mr. Bush say they think that the Chinese leadership will now be less likely to reform than it might otherwise have been.
 
A Matter of 'Face'
But Professor John K. Fairbank of Harvard University, the dean of American China scholars, said the whole issue had more to do with Chinese ''face'' - with preserving prestige -than anything else. ''They fight the face war on every front,'' he said, and that explains their vocal opposition to the bill that President Bush vetoed.
''It isn't the students as such that bother them,'' Professor Fairbank added. ''If Congress votes against them, that makes a law, something formal, something official, something permanent. But if George Bush does the same thing with an executive order, well, he's just doing what he has to, playing American politics, and they know he's their friend anyway, because he sent his people to see them when the rest of the world wouldn't talk to them. At least that's what I have to figure.'' Presumably, Mr. Bush, who spent a year and a half as United States representative in Beijing and counts himself a China expert as a result, has made some similar calculations.

U.S. Envoy in Hungary Quits To Handle Investment in East

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Jan. 25

 BODY:
R. Mark Palmer, the United States Ambassador here, is resigning from the State Department to manage a new consortium of North American financiers that today announced the purchase of half interest in a Hungarian bank, the first in what was projected as a series of ambitious investments in Eastern Europe.
The chairman of the group, the Central European Development Corporation, is Ronald S. Lauder, a former American Ambassador to Austria and a free-spending, unsuccessful candidate in last year's New York City mayoral race. Mr. Lauder said this week that tourism, communication and commercial real estate would be the main targets of investment, initially in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
 
Venerable Institution
The announcement of the $10 million bank deal, celebrated with an official ceremony at the Ministry of Finance, will turn 50 percent of the General Banking and Trust Company, one of prewar Hungary's most venerable institutions, over to a group of high-profile businessmen, several of Hungarian descent.
The deputy chairman is Andrew Sarlos, a Toronto-based real estate developer. Other major investors include Melvin Simon, the American shopping mall magnate, and Albert Reichmann, owner of Olympia & York Real Estate Company in Canada. Mr. Lauder, whose family owns the Estee Lauder Cosmetics Company, holds 50 percent of the shares. 
The sale of General Banking and Trust Company shares, while not the first Western purchase of a Communist-held bank, is yet another high-water mark in the continually rising attraction of American businessmen to Hungary.
Foreign investment in Hungary is still limited by the nonconvertibility of the forint, the national currency. Most of the foreign business starting up now is either barter trade dependent on exports of raw materials or in trade of manufacturers' goods made inside the country.
 
Hard-Currency Projects Favored
For investors like the Central European Development Corporation, the initial attraction is to projects like tourism and commercial office space for foreign businesses where payment will be in hard currency and can be legally taken out of the country.
Mr. Palmer, a career Foreign Service officer who has headed the United States Embassy here since December 1986, said today that he did not want to comment on the business venture until he resigned from the State Department in July. He will leave Hungary after the general elections next March, it was announced today.
Lawyers for the State Department apparently reviewed the propriety of an Ambassador's doing business in a region where he has served, and ruled that Mr. Palmer may not conduct business with United States embassies or the State Department for one year after he leaves Government.
Mr. Palmer, who will be the chief executive officer of the group, has told friends that he would like to spend six months of the year in Washington and the rest in Prague, where the projected European Community bank for Eastern Europe is expected to be situated.
Mr. Palmer, 48 years old, who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Soviet and Eastern European Affairs from 1982 to 86, has been an energetic representative here, championing the cause and virtues of Americans to Hungarians and vice versa.
The Ambassador's gung-ho approach toward Hungary's economic potential was the chief attraction Wednesday night at the inaugural supper of the American Chamber of Commerce here, just formed by representatives of 57 American companies now doing business in Hungary.
''If you stand in a lobby of the Forum Hotel, you are lucky not to get knocked down,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''The gold rush is on in Hungary. Budapest is a boom town.''
He said the opportunities lay not just in the glitzy downtown, which makes Budapest look like a Western city, but in its dingier regions on the outskirts, where the city reveals its age and 40 years of Communist rule. ''There are numerous people here who are poor, which is a disgrace,'' he said. ''The city is in disastrous shape, which means the possibilities are unlimited.''
American business here, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, pales next to its European competitors. The chamber's president, Michael J. Shade, a banking consultant, said that for every American company doing business in Hungary - he counted about 100 late last year - there were 10 from either West Germany or Austria.
Although the fall of Communism in surrounding countries has given Hungary competition in the rush for Western investment, it has also given investors reassurance that the economic and political changes begun here several years ago have taken on a life of their own.
Hungary's economic lure, however, is tarnished by its $20 billion debt, a figure that officially and suddenly grew by $2 billion late last year. But the Hungarian Government has since made enough cuts in food, housing and other subsidies to satisfy conditions set by the International Monetary Fund.
Hungary faces other major problems as it makes the transition to capitalism. It is known for having one of Europe's worst telephone systems, and only the first hint of a computerized financial infrastructure. But what it has is more than its neighbors, and for the moment, that still puts Hungary at the advantage.
 
Lobbies for Deal-Making
The best evidence of this are the lobbies of Budapest's big hotels, now bursting with businessmen making deals. Fax machines at the popular Forum Hotel are backed up for hours, while Hungarian clients patiently wait their turn to take a seat at the lounge tables.
''It is the new crossroads of Europe,'' said Alexander Tomlinson, a senior adviser to the Washington-based Center for Privatization who has been advising the Hungarian Government on its transition from a state-controlled economy.
Although the Americans do not dominate the foreign investment scene, many of their projects have captured the limelight - General Electric's $150 million investment in the Tungsram lightbulb factory, General Motors' negotiations to start a joint automobile factory. Rupert Murdoch, an Australian-born entrepreneur who has many interests in the United States, announced last week that he had spent $4 million to buy 50 percent of two Hungarian tabloids.
Businessmen here say American investment was spurred last summer by President Bush's visit here and the subsequent decision of Congress to let the Overseas Private Investment Corporation provide guarantees for a return on profits on new American investment here.
 
Business Slow and Arduous
Mr. Lauder - who last year spent $13 million on his campaign for Mayor of New York, where he failed to win the Republican nomination then ran and lost as a Conservative - said that since college he has been drawn to Eastern Europe, where his family is originally from. But he said his experience had shown him that business here is still a slow, arduous process.
''One mistake people make is they think it is Western Europe or the United States,'' he said. ''Americans come in here, see the potential, try to do something in two weeks and are disappointed. It takes years.''
Estee Lauder last year opened a luxury shop on Vaci Street in downtown Budapest. ''People ask why there are not more Western shops,'' Mr. Lauder said. ''It took us two years.''
In his speech last night, Mr. Palmer also cautioned against overenthusiasm and warned that in the next year Hungary, which is now embracing foreign capital, might go through a counterreaction.

HEADLINE: $1 Billion Package Of Aid to Panama Announced by U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
President Bush announced a $1 billion package of grants, loans and other types of assistance today to help Panama rebuild its economy after the American invasion and years of corrupt government by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The proposal was worked out by White House, Treasury and State Department officials, who acknowledged that some of Panama's problems resulted from economic sanctions imposed by the United States in an effort to undermine General Noriega.
Most of the package is subject to approval by Congress, where it is likely to have broad support.
The new President of Panama, Guillermo Endara, who took office as a result of the American invasion last month, said today that while the $1 billion aid package ''does not match the total that we would wish,'' it was still an extremely generous amount that Panama intended to put to use promptly. He said it was about half of the amount requested by his Government. 
Mr. Bush said the new aid programs would give Panama instant relief, ''or as close as instant relief as we can hope for.''
The package includes grants and loans to promote economic development; new incentives for American investment in and trade with Panama; an emergency public works program; new housing to replace that damaged in the American invasion; funds to repair Panamanian businesses damaged in recent looting; funds to help Panama reduce its foreign debt, and a decree restoring the quota for American imports of Panamanian sugar.
Mr. Bush said that Vice President Dan Quayle, who is scheduled to visit Panama this weekend, would review details of the plan with Mr. Endara.
Members of Congress welcomed the proposal. But they said it would not be easy to find all the money at a time when there was a large Federal budget deficit as well as new demands for American aid from the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
Administration officials said they did not know where the money would come from or how much might be taken from foreign aid earmarked for other countries or other purposes.
The Bush proposal includes several million dollars to build housing for former residents of El Chorillo, an impoverished neighborhood of frame houses that was heavily damaged last month in three days of fighting around General Noriega's military headquarters.
Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, said there were about 2,500 homeless families in El Chorillo and other parts of Panama City.
 
Economic Woes Listed
Mr. Endara said this month that ''Panama is in economic ruins.'' Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, described the problems when he testified today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Panama's gross domestic product, which measures the output of goods and services, declined about 16 percent in the last two years, Mr. Aronson said. ''Unemployment, which had been at 12 percent before the crisis, now stands at 25 percent or higher,'' he reported. ''Total external public debt is projected at $4 billion, and the ratio of external debt to gross domestic product is one of the highest in the world.''
''The Noriega regime made no debt service payments for over two years,'' Mr. Aronson added. ''The Endara Government has inherited arrearages of $940 million to international financial institutions and commercial banks. The short period of civil disturbance and looting which followed the collapse of the Noriega regime caused additional damage and has particularly hurt private business.''
The Deputy Treasury Secretary, John E. Robson, said the United States was willing to put up $100 million to $150 million to help Panama reduce its debts to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Administration officials said they would also encourage Japan and Western European countries to help Panama pay off such debts.
The Bush Administration is apparently undecided about where to find the money for Panama. Administration officials originally told Congressional aides that $500 million would be taken from Defense Department accounts, but they seemed to be reconsidering that idea today.
 
'Repair the Wounds'
The Administration also told Congressional aides that it would ask permission to reallocate $40 million previously appropriated for economic aid to Somalia and the Sudan. The United States was unlikely to spend that money because of human rights abuses in Somalia and the Sudan and because of their failure to repay certain loans made in the past.
Mr. Bush said the American aid would help ''repair the wounds, repair the damage'' done in the American invasion.
Under his plan, the Export-Import Bank of the United States would provide up to $400 million to finance sales of American products in Panama. In addition, the Treasury would try to negotiate an agreement with Panama allowing American businesses to take tax deductions for conventions held in Panama. The Defense Department would resume buying Panamanian goods and services for American troops there.
Several Senators expressed doubts today about whether Panama was making a sharp enough break with its past. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he feared that Panamanian banks would not take the steps needed to curtail the laundering of money derived from illicit narcotics traffic.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said that many of the military men who served under General Noriega were still in Panama's security forces. Mr. Dodd said he feared that ''some of the very culprits who created the problems we've seen in recent months will be back in a few years, under a different name and in different uniforms, engaging in the same practices and activities.''
Senator Claiborne Pell, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States had an obligation to help Panama create a stable democracy because Washington ''nurtured the rise to power of Manuel Noriega.''

HEADLINE: Bush to Propose Savings Plan Providing Tax-Free Interest

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 25

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has added the final details to a new savings plan and other programs that it hopes will address what many economists have identified as the nation's No. 1 economic problem, the lagging United States savings and investment rate.
The centerpiece is a new account that the White House hopes will increase the amount that many Americans save each year by granting them tax-free interest on money left on deposit for at least seven years.
The White House hopes the account will induce millions of middle-income Americans, particularly members of young families, to save more. President Bush had promised to push for such an account during his election campaign, and he will officially propose it when he sends his 1991 budget request to Congress on Monday, Deposits Not Deductible Deposits in these accounts would not be tax-deductible. Thus the proposal would not be immediately costly to the Treasury by enabling people to reduce their tax bills. But over the years some people, perhaps many, could deposit large amounts of money in these tax-free accounts that they might have saved in taxable accounts, costing the Treasury money. 
The White House hopes the beneficial effects of the higher savings rate would more than offset that loss in revenue.
Mr. Bush also plans to propose that Congress expand the scope of individual retirement accounts, so savings in these accounts could be used by people for the purchase of their first home, Administration officials said.
President Bush's proposals are subject to approval by Congress. Because the savings proposal gives much of the middle class a small but significant tax break, it is politically difficult for either Republicans or Democrats to oppose.
But if it is politically sound, some economists said, the proposal is economically questionable. Many people would take advantage of it to switch money from a savings account where the interest is taxable, they said, to another, and some economists characterized it as a political ploy by the Bush Administration to broaden the number of taxpayers benefiting from a break.
President Bush has also been pushing for a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, another of his campaign promises. A lower gains tax, which is assessed when assets like stocks or real estate are sold, would principally benefit richer families.
A consensus seems to have emerged in Congress that some form of capital gains reduction will be enacted this year.
 
'Shifting Ballast'
One critic of the new savings proposal, Charles L. Schultze, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and chairman of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, said: ''It's a little bit like shifting ballast around in the Titanic. I do not think it is going to change savings. All we are doing is dumping the revenue loss off onto people in the future.''
Several legislators have proposed their own plans to stimulate savings, primarily by enlarging the use of the I.R.A. These plans were discussed last year, often as alternatives to Mr. Bush's proposal for a lower gains tax.
Lobbyists for financial institutions say some form of I.R.A. legislation will also pass before Congress adjourns in the fall. They note that in an election year such plans are generally popular with middle-class voters.
The Family Savings Account, as the President's proposal will be known, would permit families with adjusted gross incomes of less than $120,000 to deposit up to $5,000 a year in an account, with the interest earned tax-exempt provided the money is kept on deposit for seven years. Individuals with incomes of less than $60,000 could put as much as $2,500 into such an account each year.
 
Simple and Widely Available
Administration officials said the plan was both simple - a necessary dimension to make it appeal to a large number of people - and available to a broad range of middle- and upper-income taxpayers. This is thought to be the primary segment of the population that could significantly increase the national savings rate; such groups have in recent years shown a propensity to spend heavily, rather than save.
Family savings rates, now running at just over 5 percent a year, are roughly a third what they are in Japan, which has the highest rate of a major industrialized nation. In West Germany, Canada, France and Belgium, the savings rate in recent years has been about twice as high as in the United States.
The personal savings rate in the United States hit a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987. In the early 1970's, it was above 9 percent.
 
Growing Consensus
There is a growing consensus that domestic savings and investment must be increased and that the nation's growing reliance on foreign capital for investment is an unacceptable substitute.
Economists have been stepping up warnings that low rates of savings and investment inevitably produce a weaker economy and a lower standard of living. Unless the United States stimulates its savings, many of them say, over the long run the nation could turn into a second-rate economic power.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has called the nation's low savings rate ''the most important long-term issue that has to be addressed by policy makers.''
A low savings rate makes it harder for businesses to make new investments in plant and equipment; with a smaller pool of savings capital, their competition for financing drives up interest rates. As a result, businesses either try to find capital from abroad or reduce their spending, which eventually lowers their productivity and earnings potential. And their workers ultimately suffer when companies shut outmoded plants or reduce wages, lowering the standard of living.
Though the basic outline of the Bush savings account has been known for several weeks, the final details have only recently been worked out, Administration officials said today.
Under the plan, the accounts will be offered by any institution that can now offer an I.R.A. This would include banks, savings and loans, credit unions, brokerage firms and mutual funds.
Administration officials said the new family account was intended primarily to give younger families a tax-preferred account that had a shorter term than an I.R.A. The I.R.A. is mainly oriented to retirement, with a 10 percent penalty on withdrawals before the age of 59 1/2.
''We see this as a way to provide the kinds of funds you need for education or catastrophic health problems without changing the I.R.A. too much,'' one official said.
 
Broad Support Seen
The White House is certain to get broad support from the financial industry. ''We're in favor of savings,'' said Robert Dugger, chief economist at the American Bankers Association. ''There are a lot of ways of doing it. But we are never going to get a serious discussion going until we have real proposals, and this is one.''
But other economists were not as supportive.
Mr. Schultze of Brookings and other economists have said that one key to stimulating savings is to cut the budget deficits, since heavy Government spending absorbs large amounts of private savings and leaves little for private industry investment.
 
No Penalty
Under the change that the President will propose in I.R.A.'s, if a first-time home buyer uses I.R.A. funds as a down payment on a home, the 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal would not be applied, an official said.
This is likely to find some sympathy in Congress, though some legislators may propose variations. For example, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has proposed expanding the use of I.R.A.'s to include first-time home buyers and people needing money for educational expenses.
Lobbyists and economists said they doubted that Mr. Bentsen would support the Family Savings Account without insisting on his version of the I.R.A.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's News Conference on China and Other Matters

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Washington yesterday, as recorded through the facilities of CNN.
 
OPENING STATEMENT
No Chinese student who is in this country is going to be sent back against his or her will, and we will continue to urge the People's Republic of China to recognize the human rights of its citizens, to participate in the affairs of the world community.
And I do want to express my personal thanks to the leadership of the Republican Party in the Senate -Senator Dole, Senator Simpson -who led this effort with courage and determination. And a special thanks to all those members who voted for the values of justice and human freedom that I believe were at stake in this question.
Secondly, this morning I called President Endara of Panama to assure him of our continuing support of his efforts to establish democracy in Panama. A part of this effort involves the establishment of a healthy economy, and I am deeply impressed with his commitment to reform Panama's economy. 
And based on this commitment and the report I received from Larry Eagleburger and John Robson, with us here, I informed President Endara that we'd arrived at an economic assistance package to help assist Panama in its economic recovery.
Our plan, valued at about a billion dollars, includes $500 million in humanitarian assistance for housing, emergency public works, business assistance; loans, guarantees and export opportunities; and then a $500 million, in addition, assistance package for balance of payments support, public investment and economic restructuring. The Vice President will review the details of this plan with President Endara on his visit to Panama.
And we're going to work closely with the Congress on this package to insure its prompt implementation. The economic challenges that Panama faces are great, but we will work with the people to build a prosperous democratic nation. I've just met again with Secretaries Robson and Eagleburger and they believe, given the history in Panama, the business side, that this economic assistance can indeed result in the short-run in a very - in a vastly improved economic situation. Helen?
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Lifting of Martial Law
Q. Mr. President, isn't it about time that you told the American people what were the results of two secret missions to China? Whether you got any kind of promise from the regime for loosening up and becoming a more tolerant society? And will this victory now lead you to try to lift the sanctions against China?
A. Well, I think I addressed myself to that yesterday, but let me repeat. I was very pleased at the lifting of martial law, I was very pleased at the release of 573 people from jail in a kind of an amnesty. I've said that these weren't all the steps that need to be taken.
I'm very pleased that they've stopped harassing the United States Mission there, our embassy in Beijing. I'm very pleased that they've lightened up on the areas where I think we can really move things forward, and that is the Peace Corps and the Fulbright exchanges.
So this was all part of the debate on the Hill, and I must say that I think that - the fact that they had made those moves carried some weight with some of the senators.
Q. Is that the promise that you were given? They say now that martial law is--
A. No promises. I'm looking for action, not words.
 
Chinese Students in U.S.
Q. Mr. President, of 535 members of Congress, 52 supported you on this veto. Do you view that as any kind of - do you view that as a mandate for your policies?
A. Yeah. Because you've got to give disproportionate weight to how the Executive Branch feels. We're an equal branch. So you add to that the support on the Hill - we come out more than equal.
Q. Does your commitment that no Chinese student will be sent back against his or her will - does that run absolutely, or is that something that will run until such time as you feel that China has changed its ways in some way that meets your approval?
A. Against his or her will is the controlling statement. You, Charles.
 
Aid to Panama
Q. Mr. President, on the aid to Panama - some assessments say $1 billion is only a fraction of what it will need to restore the effects down there. What is your assessment and what are people saying?
A. Well, I'm basing my judgment on what President Endara said, and on the recommendations of the economic mission that went there. And President Endara seemed very pleased with this.
I said to him, if there is additional categories where we can - in which we can be helpful - please let me know. But I think he was very pleased, and I think both Larry and John feel that it is a very good step. Whether it is the last step or not I don't know. We've got to see how that private sector responds, and how the economic recovery goes forward. But I wouldn't say that this is the end of the road in terms of what we can do to help them.
Q. Is there an assessment of what the total cost will be?
A. Well, I think they feel that this is - let's go here, see what happens, and then take another look. Some may come up with higher figures, but this is what we think is a good and full program to give them the help they need right now. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, have you been personally briefed on the exact number of people left homeless as a result of the U.S. invasion of Panama, and when, specifically, sir, can they expect to get new homes to replace those that were destroyed?
A. I think these programs will give instant, or as close as instant relief as we can hope for here. . . . I don't have the exact number there. But I would like to help as best I can with the reconstruction. . . .
 
Action on Drugs
Q. Given the fact that in your inaugural address you talked about the promise to stop the scourge of drugs, and given the fact that today you told newspaper publishers that drugs were at the top of your agenda, is this going to be the primary test of your Administration - in its first four years, at least, is the primary domestic test - assuming the economy doesn't fall apart - is it the big one?
A. I think it's the big one, and I think it's a test, not for the Administration, but for every community in the country, every state, every local government - for the people. And somebody asked me, if you had to set goals, changes in the education system or - and, but where could you most readily hope to see results, I would say in the antinarcotics fight. I think it's really that kind of priority.
 
Trips to China
Q. Going back to China - you gave us an accounting of why General Scowcroft went in December, but I wonder if I could ask you to go back to July. Could you give us an accounting of that trip - what happened? What did you learn? Why did you send him then?
A. To see - to make clear to the Chinese leadership that the relationship is important but that it could not go forward until certain changes were - had taken place. And that, in sum, is what it was about.
Q. Was it your initiative or theirs?
A. Mine. My initiative.
 
Vote on China
Q. Why was it so important to win this vote?
A. Well I said yesterday - I mean, for several reasons - One reason: I think there was a political ingredient in it. And nobody likes - nobody likes to get patted on that, on that.
And also I think from a foreign policy standpoint, I think it's better to do it this way. I think there's a trust factor that hopefully will result in changes that are satisfactory to the American people and to me, a trust factor in the Administration. And I -I hope that I can use that, having won this now, to further the kinds of things that I think will help move China forward.
I will pledge right here to work with the Congress. I love the way their debate ended with both Senator Mitchell and Dole saluting each other for the way in which the matter was discussed. And I think that's a good signal for the political fights that - that may lie ahead.
Q. Mr. President, I understand the Secretary - Transportation Secretary Skinner was among those making calls on this vote.
A. I hope so.
Q. Suggest - well that's just a little pork barrel of persuasion as well. But was there something more than just
A. Highways in China? What are you talking about?
Q. Well, was it just the pure merits of the case that won the day or was it, you know, win one for the--
A. I think there was some politics in it. I think there was politics in it.
Q. Did you make specific promises to anyone on - help on any other issue.
A. No.
Q. On the trust factor, I wonder if I can apply that to the American people, sir. What can you say to convince the people that the missions to China weren't secret simply to avoid the overwhelming public opposition to them?
A. I say I think what I'm doing is correct. And I say I think I was elected to do, in foreign policy, what I think was correct. And you have the checks and balances of the Congress. They had a shot to say that it wasn't correct in this instance. And so I - I say that I feel encouraged that the process worked out this way. And I point back to the original relationship with China, and I don't believe you'd ever had if there hadn't been some secret diplomacy.
 
Policy on China
Q. You indicated in the beginning of your statement that you feel you do have a mandate now on this China policy. A lot of people have criticized it as a secret policy. You also indicated that perhaps you might do more to keep Congress informed. Why not keep them informed of these secret missions, and what do you plan to do in terms of keeping them informed?
A. Well, I think we do. We've bent over backwards to keep people informed in the Congress. And I think once in a while there is something that is, that is done quietly and then when it is proper, while we'll, we'll give a thorough and full briefing. And I think in this one, when this matter was disclosed by us, we immediately briefed Congress on what it was we had intended to do, why we did it. And so, I don't think there's any real lack of consulation. In fact, I pride myself on the fact that we have had outstanding consultation. And I've had these leaders down here over and over again, bipartisan. And I'm going to continue to do that.
Q. Mr. President, it was six months before Congress found out about it.
A. That's right.
Q. Why not inform the people--
A. Because we were working on some initiatives and in my judgment it was better that it be quiet. And I've cited some examples in history, particulary the China trip opening to China that I think was, was best served by the way it was done.
Q. Mr. President, a lot of the emotion over your China policies had to do with the famous Scowcroft toast on videotape. It angered a lot of people to see toasting people responsible for the Tiananmen Square massacre. Would you say that at least that part of it was a mistake. That it--
A. No, because when you go to China, that's, that is, I don't know of anybody that's been there that doesn't engage in that activity. And if you read the full context of what was said, I think it was a very unfair shot. But I agree with you. Some people used that as something that was outrageous. But they ought to go over to China and just understand how it works.
 
Election in Panama
Q. The election last May is the one that never really resulted in a full count, because of General Noriega, yet that's the same election on which the Endara Government is basing its legitimacy. Is it time, sir, for another election in Panama?
A. Well, I think that, fortunately, the Endara Government has been endorsed by the Electoral Commission - they kind of were a little diverted from their normal course of business by Mr. Noriega a while back, but I think that's a matter for the Panamanians to decide. I think it would be a little bit outrageous for us to come charging in and tell them when they ought to have an election.
 
Army of El Salvador
Q. Several key Democratic Senators say they no longer - they don't believe President Cristiani has control of the military any longer. What is your response to that? They are also drafting legislation which would kill future military aid. Do you think you will be as successful in defeating that topic as you were today?
A. I hope so, because Cristiani is trying hard. And I think there is some evidence that he doesn't control all his military. The very fact that he is trying to bring some to justice who at least have been accused of wrongdoing demonstrates that. But the man was elected - certifiably free elections. He is trying very hard. He has taken some extraordinarily courageous and tough steps, and he has my full support.
 
Support in Congress
Q. Mr. President, the surprise victory to start the year, will this transfer to other issues and is this what someone once called Big Mo -momentum - starting off?
A. Listen, I learned a lesson, not to talk about that. And I learned it the hard way, took it right on the chin. And I'm coming in here in a spirit of cooperation and - excuse me if the adrenalin flowed on one or two of the questions because, you know, things didn't look too bright a little while back.
But, no, there's no point in - this is too serious a business, especially as it relates to this China policy. And so I'm not in a mode of talking about momentum or something of that nature. I do think, because of the way it worked out, it's going to be helpful in reaching accommodation in the Senate and in the House on certain of our objections.
And by that mean, I offer out that hand of cooperation, but it is a two-way street; I simply cannot accept legislation that is - that is opposed to principles I believe in. So I don't know where it'll fall out, but there is - and I promise you, I don't come in here with some sense of gloating or anything of that nature of all. It was too tough a vote for a lot of my friends, on both sides of the aisle. . . .
 
Flexibility in Aid
Q. Mr. President, in announcing $1 billion for Panama, that's an awful lot of money, so what countries are going to get less money as a result of our generosity with Panama?
A. Well there will be offsets. And we will, at the appropriate time, which is fairly soon, tell the Congress where we think those offsets should come from. But let me reiterate my philosophical approval for the Bob Dole position, which is to give the President more flexibility on this concept of earmarking. . . .
 
Racism in the U.S.
Q. Mr. President, do you agree with the N.A.A.C.P. and other organizations that there is a rising tide of racism in this country?
A. I had a long talk with some of the executives of the N.A.A.C.P. the other day and they expressed to me their concerns. And I share their concerns. But whether it - I like to think that there isn't a rising tide. I think that there are some very ugly incidents. And if I can use this platform, the White House, to speak out against that bigotry and against that ugliness, perhaps it will help. I don't, but I will tell you that several of those leaders felt that there was a growing pattern of racism and as you, your question said, a rising tide. I don't know that I agree with it, but I do agree there is some very ugly incidents lately and we all ought to do what we can to make clear that is not the American way.
