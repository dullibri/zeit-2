HEADLINE: New Cars Arrive, Courting Few Buyers

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The prolonged slump in vehicle sales has barely slowed car companies from blitzing the market with new models.
But with industry sales expected to fall below last year's depressed levels, automakers will be challenged to attract attention from consumers who are staying away from showrooms in increasing numbers.
General Motors, whose United States sales fell 22 percent last year, made the most news Sunday, by introducing a sedan and two crossover vehicles at the opening on Sunday of the Detroit auto show. The company also said it would add two more models to its Chevrolet lineup -- a minicar and a seven-passenger crossover -- in 2011. 
G.M. executives said the models had been in development long before the overall market slid 18 percent last year, and the company hit such dire straits that it needed to seek financial help from the federal government.
''These cars are paid for, their development is behind them, and the manufacturing investment is done,'' said Robert Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman for product development.
He said he hoped the new Buick Lacrosse sedan and the two crossovers, the Chevrolet Equinox and Cadillac SRX, would sell without incentives and lift G.M.'s sagging revenues.
''Some people say a bad market and a poor economic environment is an unfortunate time to launch new product,'' Mr. Lutz said. ''I think it's an extremely good time to launch new product because that's when you need the added revenue.''
Automakers and analysts believe that industry sales in 2009 will drop significantly below the 13.2 million vehicles sold last year, possibly to as low as 10.5 million units.
Under those conditions, new models will be hard-pressed to draw anywhere near the level of interest they typically receive when they first hit the market.
Developing a new model usually takes three to four years, meaning G.M.'s offerings started being developed when American consumers were buying about 16 million vehicles a year.
''The problem is you can't turn product development on and turn it off depending on the market conditions,'' said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
In G.M.'s case, the company will probably cut back on new models as it downsizes to meet conditions attached to its $13.4 billion loan package from the government.
''The nature of auto companies is to overproduce, but that is definitely going to change with the new financial reality,'' Mr. Cole said. ''I don't think we will see these bad habits come back.''
The Ford Motor Company showed off two new models Sunday, the Taurus sedan and Fusion hybrid, as well as a 540-horsepower version of the Mustang.
But with the market shrinking, Ford is playing down expectations somewhat for the Taurus.
The Taurus was the best-selling American car in the early 1990s, but it gradually lost its appeal and became an also-ran in the full-size sedan segment behind the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
The new version, Ford executives said, will find a smaller niche in the market.
''We're not expecting to ever do the 400,000 units we did at its peak,'' said Mark Fields, president of Ford's Americas division.
Other models that were introduced in Detroit included hybrids from Honda and Toyota's Lexus division, as well as concept cars from German automakers.
The automaker with the least to show was Chrysler, which was coming off a year when its sales had declined 30 percent.
Chrysler recently received a $4 billion loan from the government in order to stay solvent until March. The company's chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, said Sunday that Chrysler was counting on more federal aid to complete its reorganization process.
While it showed a few prospective electric vehicles on Sunday, Chrysler had no new models ready for the market.
But Mr. Nardelli said new car introductions would resume in 2010, and pledged that Chrysler would still be in business by then.
One of Chrysler's vice chairmen, James Press, said the automaker did not think the lack of new models would hurt its sales in 2009. ''We feel we haven't extracted the potential of our current product line,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Abortion Choices of Poor Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''For Privacy's Sake, Risking Do-It-Yourself Abortion'' (news article, Jan. 5): 
 Throughout history, women have tried many ways to end an unwanted pregnancy. Your article underscores the fact that after 36 years of legal abortion, some women still struggle to obtain reproductive health care because they don't understand or trust the American medical system.
 In my Washington Heights clinic in northern Manhattan, I see at least one patient every week who has tried to end a pregnancy on her own. When lack of information, poverty or stigma overwhelm pregnant women, some take matters into their own hands. 
 We can do better to educate women about their legal options. While they can use misoprostol to end a pregnancy, there are safer and more effective methods.
 As we approach the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, physicians need to remember that reproductive health care remains a challenge, even in New York City. We must work within our communities to ensure that women know how to navigate the health care system.
 Anne Davis New York, Jan. 5, 2009
 The writer is medical director of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health.
 To the Editor:
 In your article, abortion is called ''safe, legal and inexpensive.'' 
 While this common procedure is safe and is mostly legal, despite aggressive regulation, it is not inexpensive. An abortion at 10 weeks' gestation costs $523 on average, often out of pocket. 
 To term this ''inexpensive,'' especially in the current economy, is ludicrous. 
 Many women struggle to raise the money for an abortion as their pregnancy progresses. Sixty-seven percent of poor women having an abortion report that they would have preferred to have an earlier procedure. 
 Regarding abortion's ''widespread availability,'' that is perhaps true for some in New York, but not for all women. 
 Self-induced abortion does raise questions about women's experience, but glossing over the challenges of gaining access to abortion services does nothing to answer these questions. It neither reflects the reality of abortion delivery nor the reality of women's lives.

 The writers are executive directors of, respectively, the Abortion Access Project and the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.
 To the Editor: 
 Your article points out that for some women abortion care has not changed in more than 100 years. 
 Using the code ''I need to bring down my period,'' women in Washington Heights ask the pharmacist for an abortion drug. 
 In the 1800s, newspapers and the religious press in the United States carried ads for medicines that would cure ''blocked'' menstruation. Such ads stated that the product should not be used by married ladies. This was a code that the product could cause an abortion, thus telling women who wanted to end a pregnancy to buy the product. 
 On the other hand, this is the 21st century. Some teenagers are going to the Internet for instructions on a do-it-yourself abortion. I went online to see what information was out there and was horrified by what I found. 
 On one site the reader is instructed to insert implements vaginally and then head for the emergency room once the hemorrhaging starts. But as a pediatric nurse practitioner in Washington Heights, I know there are clinics that provide safe, confidential care for teenagers.
 Confidential care is the law of the state. One would hope that pharmacists would tell women about these facilities. New York women do not have to live with 19th-century care. Poor women in other states may not have a choice.

 To the Editor:
 Your article is an excellent reminder of the struggles facing poor women who seek basic reproductive health care in this country. Because of a law called the Hyde Amendment, which was first enacted in 1976 and renewed each year since, women on Medicaid are not covered for the cost of an abortion. 
 Unlike other basic health needs for men and women, this procedure, which nearly one-third of all women in the United States will have by the end of their reproductive years, is specifically carved out of coverage. For poor women in Washington Heights, paying $30 for a risky and illegal drug is much more realistic than paying several hundred dollars (or much more) for a legal abortion out of their own pockets.
 If President-elect Barack Obama is serious about improving the health of poor women, one of his first agenda items should be the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. In the meantime, poor women will, at best, turn to private assistance through local abortion funds, or, at worst, turn to risky medicine that is the modern equivalent of the back-alley abortion.

 The writer is an associate professor at the Drexel UniversityEarle Mack School of Law and a board member of the Women's Medical Fund in Philadelphia.
 To the Editor:
 The article about Dominican women in New York who use medication to give themselves abortions highlights the need for better information.
 In some states, legal residents and/or undocumented immigrants may be eligible for medical programs that would pay for abortion or contraception. Where women have no access to publicly funded medical care, they may still find assistance from a local abortion fund or from the National Network of Abortion Funds, which helps women who cannot afford an abortion to obtain safe pregnancy termination services.
 Access to information about these resources may not be enough to combat the fear of deportation and social censure, but it is a start.

HEADLINE: For U.S.O.C., Sponsorships Become a Challenge

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

 BODY:
Heading into an economically troubled year without several of its biggest and longest-standing sponsors, the United States Olympic Committee is refusing to panic.
 The U.S.O.C., one of the few national Olympic committees that does not receive any direct government money, is still financially stable and will be so in the foreseeable future, Jim Scherr, its chief executive, said in a telephone interview on Friday.
 ''We have one of the strongest, if not the strongest, brands in the world, and we believe that we will still have the ability to achieve our domestic and international sponsorship goals,'' Scherr said, adding that committees with government financing, like Britain's and China's, are probably having an easier time navigating in hard times. 
 Britain, which runs a national lottery to help support athletes, subsidizes some key sports ''four times more'' than the United States does, Scherr said. He added that athletes in countries like France, Spain, Japan, Italy and Germany also receive more money than those in the United States because of government financing. 
 But Scherr said the U.S.O.C. was undeterred.
 ''Certainly, it may take a bit longer to negotiate contracts and it may take a little more effort, but we feel that we are extremely viable,'' he said.
 Scherr added that television revenue from the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2012 Summer Games -- which will be about $255 million for the U.S.O.C. -- and a cash reserve of about $100 million will help the organization make it through this downturn. The U.S.O.C. is also in talks to renew sponsorship contracts with AT&T and Bank of America, each of which was worth about $4 million to $5 million annually.
 Still, like most every other sports entity, the U.S.O.C. has been grappling to keep its sponsors, which account for 45 percent of its $150 million average annual budget. Another 15 percent comes from private donors, who are also likely to give less during a recession.
 Although the U.S.O.C. has signed 17 sponsors -- all through at least 2012, including the personal-computer manufacturer Acer, new to the Olympic movement -- it has lost some valuable support.
 Last week, Home Depot announced that it would not renew its 16-year sponsorship of the U.S.O.C., a contract worth about $4 million to $5 million a year.
 General Motors, an Olympic sponsor since 1984, left at the end of last year, concluding a contract worth about $7.5 million annually to the U.S.O.C. 
 An Olympic sponsor since 1896, Kodak pulled out. Its share price has dropped about 65 percent in the past year. John Hancock, a sponsor since 1994, also did not renew.
 So far, Kellogg's, a sponsor since 1976, and Johnson & Johnson have neither announced an end to their relationship with the Olympic movement nor renewed their contracts. Anheuser-Busch returned but reduced its financial commitment.
 Despite those changes, some sports marketing experts say the U.S.O.C. has nothing to worry about, though the outlook for all sports sponsorships may be bleak.
 Peter Graham, an Olympics expert and a professor of sport and entertainment management at the University of South Carolina, said that the U.S.O.C. was resilient enough to handle the loss of companies like Home Depot. Other companies, he said, would eventually fill those vacancies, even in categories like home improvement and automotive, sectors that are currently struggling.
 ''I think companies are interested in those sponsorships because of the global aspect of the Olympics,'' he said. ''When the Olympics are on, you're going to get worldwide exposure that only the World Cup series in soccer and maybe the Super Bowl gets. No other sporting event comes close.''
 ''The U.S.O.C. may not get the kind of money they want from each sponsor,'' he added, ''but I believe they will get it if they add more sponsors or categories of sponsorship.''
 Rob Prazmark, a marketing consultant who works with the U.S.O.C., said the Olympic brand in the United States was strong enough to handle the crisis and had weathered bad times before.
 After a bribery scandal involving the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games, Prazmark and others secured a long list of corporate sponsorships, despite the negative publicity.
 ''Yes, we're having a bit of tough times these days, but smart companies know this investment is not just for '09,'' he said. ''I think companies are planning for a better economy in '10, '11 and '12, when these sponsorships will still be in place.
 ''This also might be a perfect chance for companies to jump into sponsorships, when other companies might be too financially weak to do so.''
 Despite the sponsor negotiations and the recession, Scherr said he was confident that the U.S.O.C. would be able to finance its athletes without a hiccup. ''They will be the last group to be affected,'' he said.
 When Home Depot ended its sponsorship last week, though, some athletes felt the loss. The company had been the exclusive sponsor of the Olympic Job Opportunities Program, which provided athletes with full-time pay and health benefits for part-time work, as well as flexible hours. 
 Since 1992, more than 600 United States and Canadian athletes have worked in the program. Now, 86 athletes, including the American speedskater Jessica Smith, are involved.
 To stem the loss of the program, which ends March 2, the U.S.O.C. will provide additional stipends to the Home Depot athletes who are training for the 2010 Games. It will also pay their health insurance.
 For 2012 Games athletes, the U.S.O.C. plans to give a one-time extra stipend of $5,000. 
 Officials from the organization said several companies had already showed interest in the jobs program, and that the U.S.O.C. would likely sign several companies to be involved.
 Smith, who spends about $30,000 to $50,000 annually on training and expenses, said she wondered if the U.S.O.C.'s immediate help would be enough. With the Olympic trials for speedskating less than a year away, she is concerned that she will not find a job with hours as flexible as the ones she has working at a Home Depot near U.S. Speedskating's training center in Kearns, Utah.
 ''When I first heard, I was nervous and scared and a lot of emotions went through me,'' said Smith, whose father, Richard, delivers car parts outside of Dearborn, Mich., and whose mother, Reina, cuts hair. ''I really don't want this situation to put a damper on things and start taking a toll on my training.''
 She said that ''it would definitely be helpful'' to receive government money for her training but that the financial struggle of many American athletes was what made achieving their Olympic dream that much sweeter.
 ''If we had everything given to us, it wouldn't be the American way,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Electric Auto Fleet Moves a Few Steps Closer

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
 AUTO engineers have been talking for years about the coming ''electrification of the automobile.'' But as the development of hybrids and pure-electric vehicles has accelerated rapidly across the industry, it's increasingly difficult to separate the subject of batteries from the cars and trucks they'll soon be powering.
 A look at the machinery to be revealed at the 2009 North American International Auto Show seems to be strong evidence that the dawn of that new era has finally arrived. It is being driven in large part by tighter regulations of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel-efficiency regulations worldwide -- not to mention federal bridge-loan expectations for the Detroit Three. 
 Still, automotive executives lament that the current combination of low average fuel prices and plummeting consumer confidence is not exactly spurring the market for the more costly hybrids and battery-electric vehicles. 
 Here are some of the models that are expected to be revealed at the Detroit auto show:
 Honda and Toyota will be unveiling what are perhaps the most anticipated production green cars of the new year, the 2010 Insight and 2010 Prius, respectively. 
 The Insight re-establishes the nameplate that started the hybrid-car market in the United States in 1999. A five-door hatchback, it will feature an interactive technology called Eco Assist to help drivers optimize their cars' fuel efficiency. Honda claims the new Insight will be the most affordable hybrid car in the world, with a base price under $20,000, when it goes on sale in April.
 Toyota comes to Motown intent on asserting its ecocar leadership. It will unveil the third-generation version of its iconic Prius, with an improved nickel-metal hydride battery and electric motors that are expected to deliver greater overall performance and longer driving range. It will also introduce the first Lexus available only as a hybrid, the Lexus HS 250h. 
 Toyota also will show a battery-electric city car concept, the FT-EV. This subcompact shares its platform with the cute iQ commuter car that was a hit of the auto-show circuit last year. The FT-EV points to the electric urban runabout that is expected to be in showrooms by 2012. 
 General Motors will unveil a Cadillac concept version of the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric sedan. The luxury vehicle demonstrates how G.M. is configuring its E-REV powertrain, featuring a 16 kilowatt-hour lithium battery and small gasoline engine-generator, for use in a broad array of car and truck types beginning in late 2010.
 Ford's electrification strategy will be presented to the crowd of journalists here for the press preview days, including an electric commercial van based on Transit Connect for 2010. Ford will also show a Focus-based electric sedan that is a prototype for a future production model.
 Showgoers will get their first up-close look at the 2010 Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan hybrid sedans. Late last month the E.P.A. certified the Fusion hybrid at 41 m.p.g. in city driving, bettering Toyota's Camry Hybrid by eight m.p.g. Ford will showcase the cars' all-new hybrid powertrain that enables the cars to travel up to 47 miles and hour on electric power alone. BYD, China's largest manufacturer of cellphone batteries (the initials stand for Build Your Dreams) has been steadily developing electric automobiles under its BYD Auto group. The company, 10 percent of which is owned by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway group, which plans to enter the American market within the next two years, will be easy to find at the Detroit show, having secured display space on the main floor after Nissan pulled out of the show.
 The centerpiece of BYD Auto's display will be the F3DM, the plug-in electric compact sedan introduced to great fanfare in China last month. Two hybrids, the midsize F6DM (introduced in Detroit last year) and the F3RDM, will also be shown. Chrysler will produce its first electric model in 2010, with three additional E.V.'s following by 2013. For the Detroit show, the new Jeep Patriot EV heads a quartet of concept hybrid and electric vehicles developed by the company's ENVI electric-vehicle engineering group.
 The Patriot features a range-extending drivetrain, similar in function to that of the Chevrolet Volt.
 Upgraded and more sophisticated versions of three previously-shown Chrysler vehicles to appear at the show include a new version of the Dodge Circuit EV electric sports car; an extended-range Jeep Wrangler Unlimited EV; and the Chrysler Town & Country EV, which is capable of achieving 40 miles of all-electric range with its lithium battery pack.
 Chrysler's former partner Mercedes-Benz will show its latest battery-electric vehicle study, the BlueZero E-Cell. It's part of a trio of environmentally-focused concepts the automaker is developing, including the hybrid BlueZero E-Cell Plus and the BlueZero F-Cell, powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The automaker plans to introduce its first production E.V. in 2010.
 Smart, the Mercedes-owned maker of city car, will be exhibiting a prototype electric version of its diminutive Fortwo runabout, expected to enter production later this year.
 Silicon Valley's electric-car sensation, Tesla Motors, will have its first show-floor display at Detroit this year. Having established itself as a production automaker (with more than 150 examples of its $100,000 Roadster sold to date), the fledgling maker doesn't have anything new to unveil. 
 Production of Fisker Automotive's Karma luxury-hybrid GT sports car is expected to begin later this year at the Valmet Automotive plant in Finland (which assembles Porsche's Cayman and Boxster models on contract). The Karma made its debut in Detroit last year. Its Q-Drive powertrain is a series-type hybrid like the G.M. Volt, with a lithium-ion battery pack that can be charged with home current to provide nearly 50 miles of electric-only driving.

HEADLINE: Still No Work, and Soon No Benefit Check

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and MATHEW R. WARREN; Jon Hurdle contributed reporting from Philadelphia.

 BODY:
Just as the recession is throwing people out of work at an alarming rate, the unemployment insurance system in New York and many other states will start cutting off benefits this week for thousands of people who have been unable to find jobs since early last year.
 About 50,000 New Yorkers who had been collecting unemployment checks for 11 months -- the longest stretch that benefits have been available since the last recession eight years ago -- will stop receiving weekly payments this week, according to the State Labor Department. 
 In normal circumstances, people laid off from full-time jobs can collect benefits for up to 26 weeks, after which they fall off the rolls. But some of the people who will lose benefits this week have been on unemployment for 46 weeks because Congress approved extensions of jobless benefits twice last year. 
 This will be the first time since the early 1990s that workers are exhausting benefits that have been extended twice because of an economic downturn. The inability of those people to find work after so many months provides a stark reminder of the weakness of the job market, officials and experts say. 
 For many of those facing the loss of that lifeline, the next step may be welfare, experts say.
 Julio Ponce, a 55-year-old chef, has been using his weekly $352 unemployment check to pay the rent on his apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn since he lost his job at a center for the elderly more than a year ago. But he said he did not know how he would cover the $800 monthly rent after his unemployment benefits lapsed this week.
 ''No one is helping me,'' said Mr. Ponce, who was faxing his resume to hotels and restaurants from an employment office in Downtown Brooklyn on Thursday. ''I've applied for public assistance, but I don't think I'm going to get it.''
 Extended benefits are also about to expire over the next week or two in Massachusetts, Texas, Virginia, Pennsylvania and at least 20 other states, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates for lower-wage workers. No official estimates exist for how many people would lose their benefits in those states, but experts said it was likely to exceed 200,000. 
 In Philadelphia, Tony Green, 38, said he was due to collect the last of his checks by Jan. 25. His twice-extended benefits have amounted to $470 a month after taxes, forcing him to give up a rented house in the Fox Chase section of the city and move with his two teenage children to a place in North Philadelphia that he described as ''drug-infested and dirty.''
 Mr. Green said he had sold his car and borrowed more than $10,000, mostly on ''maxed-out'' credit cards. He has been taking construction jobs to supplement his benefits, but said he feared the extra income would dry up as the economy contracted.
 ''People are really tapped out,'' he said.
 Unemployment insurance, a federal system that is administered by the states, was intended as a stopgap, half-year source of relief, not a long-term source of income. But last year, as the economy slumped and the unemployment rate rose, Congress approved two extensions of jobless benefits, one for 13 weeks and the second for up to 20 additional weeks. The national unemployment rate rose again in December to 7.2 percent, a 16-year high, the government reported Friday.
 However, New York and about two dozen other states have not yet qualified for the full 20 weeks of the second extension, because their jobless rates have been lower than other states. The latest extension was limited to seven weeks in states where the unemployment rate had not averaged at least 6 percent for three consecutive months. New Jersey and Connecticut have already qualified for the full extension.
 New York's unemployment rate has been rising in recent months, surpassing 6 percent in November. But the rate will have to jump again this month for workers in the state to qualify for the full 13-week extension. 
 The formula for triggering the availability of more emergency benefits has left New York's commissioner of labor, M. Patricia Smith, in the odd position of rooting for a higher jobless rate. 
 ''We've seen over the last year a large jump in the number of people who do exhaust benefits because, as the economic climate gets worse and worse, it becomes harder to become re-employed,'' Ms. Smith said Thursday.
 The program providing the additional 33 weeks of benefits is scheduled to expire March 31, meaning no extended benefits would be available after that date. But Congress is considering legislation supported by President-elect Barack Obama that would continue the program until the end of the year.
 Each month, about 18,000 state residents use the last of their regular benefits, and most of them immediately seek to start collecting extended benefits, according to the Labor Department. About 116,000 New Yorkers are collecting extended benefits now, including those who will receive their final checks this week. 
 Unemployed workers in New York not only receive fewer weeks of extended benefits than jobless residents of neighboring states, they also receive smaller checks. The maximum weekly benefit in New York is $405, a limit that has not changed in more than eight years because state lawmakers have been unwilling to raise the payroll tax that finances unemployment benefits. In New Jersey, the top rate for unemployment benefits is $584; Connecticut's is $576.
 Paulette Walker, 45, said she had depleted almost all of her savings since she lost a job as an employee-benefits representative for Cigna Healthcare, where she had worked for 17 years. She has been renting a room from her ex-husband's family in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, but fears she will not be able to afford even those humble lodgings if her $331 weekly benefits run out in three weeks, as scheduled. 
 ''I worked all my life and there's nothing wrong with me,'' Ms. Walker, a Jamaican immigrant, said, as she broke down crying. ''I'm living with my ex-in-laws because I don't have any family here. When my benefits finish, I don't know how I'm going to pay for that room.''
 Emanuel During, 55, whose extended benefits expired last week, said he had resorted to substituting a bottle of soda for a meal at dinnertime. Mr. During, who lives alone in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and does not qualify for food stamps, said he had been searching for work since he was dismissed a year ago by the school-bus company he drove for.
 ''I feel hopeless. I've been applying for all different types of jobs,'' said Mr. During, who said he applied for more than 20 jobs in the last few months and was considering training to drive a tractor-trailer. ''What I was doing, there's nothing. It's dead, it's dead.''
 Running out of unemployment benefits ''can become a real breaking point for families,'' said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. ''You'll see a big increase in poverty among these families. Some people will have to go on welfare. It's very destabilizing. In less than a year, they've gone from working class to poor.''
 The first step for many people whose benefits lapse is to take ''survival jobs,'' low-paying positions that do not make use of their skills, Mr. Stettner said. Several New Yorkers who were at or near the end of their unemployment benefits said that they might have to resort to menial jobs rather than continue pursuing the sort of work they were trained for.
 Eric Mio, 40, who has been working sporadically as a driver for a moving company, said his benefits would run out in a few weeks. He is receiving assistance from the state to study to become an electrician, but he said he might have to settle for a lower-paying job in the meantime.
 ''I've been lucky, things come through,'' said Mr. Mio, who lives alone in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx. ''It's just enough. I'm keeping a roof over my head and food in my belly. But I don't go out anymore.''
 If he can no longer collect unemployment, he said, ''I guess I'll go to the supermarket and bag groceries.''

HEADLINE: As Indian Outsourcing Changed, Satyam Hesitated

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and JEREMY KAHN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
The founder of Satyam Computer Services, B. Ramalinga Raju, made a risky proposition to win his first big client, the tractor maker John Deere: If you don't like our service, you don't pay. 
 With that pitch, which is now the stuff of legend in India, he persuaded John Deere in 1991 to allow his computer programmers to work near the client's headquarters in Moline, Ill., in a house Mr. Raju called ''Little India.'' Working only overnight shifts, with no face-to-face contact with Deere executives, the programmers got the job done -- supporting Mr. Raju's theory that they could do their work from India. That trial helped give birth to the country's outsourcing industry. 
 Mr. Raju's iconoclastic moves became something of a trademark during Satyam's rise. Satyam was one of the first outsourcing companies to move jobs outside of Indian urban centers, and one of the first Indian companies to qualify to trade on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Now, Satyam's demise has been as shocking for supporters in its hometown, Hyderabad, as it has been for investors and the 53,000 employees. The same single-mindedness that drove Mr. Raju to take a chance with his first big client may have laid the groundwork for the fraud at the center of this crisis. 
 Mr. Raju admitted last week to falsifying about $1 billion in cash on Satyam's books and vastly inflating the company's profit margins. Mr. Raju and his brother, B. Rama Raju, as well as the company's chief financial officer, Srinivas Vadlamani, were in jail Sunday night. All three are being investigated on suspicion of cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust and falsifying documents. 
 The Indian government ousted Satyam's board members and began replacing them with its own choices. Satyam's previous board did contain outsiders -- including Krishna G. Palepu, a professor at the Harvard Business School who teaches classes on corporate governance. 
 But the board, and auditors, evidently did not pick up on the fraud at the company. Instead, Mr. Palepu and three other board members quietly quit a week before Mr. Raju's admission.
 Over the years, the company faced competition from outsourcers growing even faster. Satyam was like ''the younger brother trying to keep up with the older brothers on the playground,'' said John C. McCarthy, an analyst with Forrester Research. 
 While the biggest firms -- Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro -- revamped their business practices to become more global, Satyam ''still felt like a family-run company due to its 'command and control' style,'' said Frances Karamouzis, research vice president with Gartner in New York, which advises information technology companies. ''What Mr. Raju said was what trickled down'' to the rest of the company, she said. 
 The Indian offshoring industry went through a painful transition in 2004 and 2005, as Western giants like I.B.M. and Accenture started to cut into their business.
 But Satyam was slow to transform, in part perhaps because of Mr. Raju's management style. ''He was very old school,'' Ms. Karamouzis said. The company's management, she said, was ''very parochial and didn't embrace change or implement anything differently.''
 Customers had complaints. ''We are tired of being required to call up the top guy in India to get things resolved,'' one Satyam client told Gartner in 2005. 
 Perhaps to make up for market share it might be losing, Satyam started to underbid its competitors, putting pressure on its own profit margins. If the other big outsourcers were charging $27 or $28 an hour, Satyam would charge $21 or $22, Ms. Karamouzis said. 
 Now, the struggles of Satyam are being acutely felt in the state of Andra Pradesh and its capital, Hyderabad, as Mr. Raju became an informal ambassador helping to lure other technology companies there. Microsoft decided to open a new product development center there in 1999. Many of Mr. Raju's other business interests, including the construction companies managed by his sons, benefited from state contracts. 
 Those construction companies helped to set Satyam on its downward spiral. Late on Dec. 16, Satyam said it was planning to acquire two companies, Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra, for $1.6 billion. The two companies are run by Mr. Raju's sons, and he and his brother Rama Raju had stakes in them. 
 But when Mr. Raju and his top executives met with shareholders that evening, they were faced with a full-scale revolt. The stock plummeted, leading to the margin calls that led him to admit the fraud, he said in his confession.

HEADLINE: New York Fed Considering Its Next Chief

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The board members of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York weighed who will become its next president over the weekend, interviewing candidates and meeting to discuss them, people briefed on the conversations said. 
Ever since Timothy F. Geithner, the current president of the New York Fed, was selected to become Treasury secretary last month, the board has been considering more than a dozen possibilities. With Mr. Geithner's confirmation hearing scheduled for Thursday, the board is hoping to appoint a new president as soon as he is formally certified.
Among the short list of contenders with government experience are David H. McCormick, the Treasury Department's under secretary for international affairs; Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor; William C. Dudley, the head of the New York Fed's markets desk; and Terrence J. Checki, head of the New York Fed's emerging markets and international affairs group.
The board is also considering a handful of Wall Street power players, including H. Rodgin Cohen, the chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell, and Paul Calello, the head of investment banking at Credit Suisse who worked for the Federal Reserve in the Monetary and Economic Policy Group in the mid-1980s.
It was unclear who was considered the front-runner. A spokesman for the Fed declined to comment.
Some of the candidates were first reported on The Wall Street Journal's Web site.
One concern among the board members is the role that the various candidates played in the bailouts during the financial crisis, people briefed on the deliberations said. Virtually everyone on the list was involved in the marathon bailout weekends, either in a government role or working for one of the various banks seeking help.
For example, Mr. Calello's firm represented Barclays in its failed deal with Lehman Brothers, and Mr. Cohen represented Lehman Brothers and later the American International Group.

HEADLINE: Fiction Reading Increases For Adults

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
After years of bemoaning the decline of a literary culture in the United States, the National Endowment for the Arts says in a report that it now believes a quarter-century of precipitous decline in fiction reading has reversed.
 The report, ''Reading on the Rise: A New Chapter in American Literacy,'' being released Monday, is based on data from ''The Survey of Public Participation in the Arts'' conducted by the United States Census Bureau in 2008. Among its chief findings is that for the first time since 1982, when the bureau began collecting such data, the proportion of adults 18 and older who said they had read at least one novel, short story, poem or play in the previous 12 months has risen. 
 The news comes as the publishing industry struggles with declining sales amid a generally difficult economy. 
 The proportion of adults reading some kind of so-called literary work -- just over half -- is still not as high as it was in 1982 or 1992, and the proportion of adults reading poetry and drama continued to decline. Nevertheless the proportion of overall literary reading increased among virtually all age groups, ethnic and demographic categories since 2002. It increased most dramatically among 18-to-24-year-olds, who had previously shown the most significant declines. 
 ''There has been a measurable cultural change in society's commitment to literary reading,'' said Dana Gioia, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. ''In a cultural moment when we are hearing nothing but bad news, we have reassuring evidence that the dumbing down of our culture is not inevitable.''
 Under Mr. Gioia's leadership the endowment spearheaded ''The Big Read,'' a program in partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services and Arts Midwest to encourage communities to champion the reading of particular books, like ''The Great Gatsby'' by F. Scott Fitzgerald and ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'' by Zora Neale Hurston. The report is being released just over a week before Mr. Gioia steps down after six years as the endowment's chairman.
 Four years ago the endowment released the report ''Reading at Risk,'' which showed that fewer than half of Americans over 18 read novels, short stories, plays or poetry. That survey, based on data gathered in 2002, provoked a debate among academics, publishers and others about why reading was declining. Some argued that it wasn't, criticizing the study for too narrowly defining reading by focusing on the literary side, and for not explicitly including reading that occurred online.
 In each survey since 1982 the data did not differentiate between those who read several books a month and those who read only one poem. Nor did the surveys distinguish between those who read the complete works of Proust or Dickens and those who read one Nora Roberts novel or a single piece of fan fiction on the Internet.
 Mr. Gioia said that Internet reading was included in the 2008 data, although the phrasing of the central question had not changed since 1982. But he said he did not think that more reading online was the primary reason for the increase in literary reading rates overall. 
 Instead he attributed the increase in literary reading to community-based programs like the ''Big Read,'' Oprah Winfrey's book club, the huge popularity of book series like ''Harry Potter'' and Stephenie Meyer's ''Twilight,'' as well as the individual efforts of teachers, librarians, parents and civic leaders to create ''a buzz around literature that's getting people to read more in whatever medium.''
 This apparent reversal came a little more than a year after the endowment released an overwhelmingly pessimistic report in 2007 that linked a decline in reading-test scores to a fall in reading for fun among adolescents. That report also collected data showing that the proportion of adults who read regularly for pleasure had declined. At the time Mr. Gioia called the data ''simple, consistent and alarming.''
 Elizabeth Birr Moje, an education professor at the University of Michigan who specializes in literacy, language and culture, said it was impossible to do more than speculate why literary reading rates had increased in the most recent survey. The rise could just as easily be attributed to changes in health care or a need for escape in difficult economic times, she said. 
 What's more, Ms. Moje added, it was an isolated piece of information. ''It's just a blip,'' she said. ''If you look at trend data, you will always see increases and decreases in people's literate practices.'' 
 Among ethnic groups the latest report found that the proportion of literary reading increased most for what the study classifies as Hispanic Americans, rising to 31.9 percent in 2008 for adults 18 and over, from 26.5 percent in 2002. The highest percentage of literary reading was among whites, at 55.7 percent, up from 51.4 percent in 2002. The rate of literary reading among men 18 and older increased to 41.9 percent in 2008, from 37.6 percent in 2002. The proportion also increased among women, to 58 percent in 2008, from 55.1 percent in 2002.
 At the same time the survey found that the proportion of adults who said they had read any kind of a book, fiction or nonfiction, that was not required for work or school actually declined slightly since 2002, to 54.3 percent from 56.6 percent.
 Mr. Gioia said that the decline in book reading might be attributable to a falloff in the reading of nonfiction, although he offered no explicit evidence of that.
 Patricia Schroeder, president of the Association of American Publishers, suggested that some people might not count the reading they do online or even on electronic readers like the Kindle as ''book'' reading. 
 Jim Rettig, president of the American Library Association and university librarian at the University of Richmond, said that the 2008 data would not reflect a recent uptick in circulation at libraries. As the economy has soured, Mr. Rettig said, ''people are discovering that you don't have to spend anything to read a book if you have a library card.''

HEADLINE: So Plugged In, Yet So Disconnected: Field Notes From Wired America

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
At the end of ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.,'' his talk-show-ready treatise on the gnawing sense of dislocation in contemporary American society, Dalton Conley, New York University's acting dean for the social sciences, buttonholes his readers to ask: ''Does what I argued in these pages strike you as spot on? Could I have been spying on your life or the lives of folks you know and interact with daily? Or, at the very least, does what I write seem plausible as you scan the wider social horizon around you? In short, do I make sense?''
 These are dangerous questions. Yes, Mr. Conley makes superficial sense, in that he tells readers what they already know. Yes, he makes tactical sense in his aspiration to rival Malcolm Gladwell's ''Blink'' and ''Tipping Point'' and Chris Anderson's ''Long Tail'' in the creation of high-concept buzzwords. And yes, the photo on his book's cover tells an all too credible story. It depicts one salad, two parents, two children, three laptops and an audio player with earplugs, arranged in ways that keep any of the humans from having anything to do with one another. ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.'' offers a lifelike portrait of techno-distraction. 
 But making field notes and making sense are two very different accomplishments. And Mr. Conley shows himself to be a much more acute observer than analyst. In a book that he describes as social criticism rather than social science, he underscores that privileged, present-day Americans (this study's narrow yet book-buying constituency) can only be ''convinced that they're in the right place, doing the right thing, at the right time, when they're on their way to the next destination.'' He postulates reasons for this phenomenon. But he cannot offer a coherent overview.
 ''This very book intends to serve as the first-edition guidebook to this new world we have created,'' he trumpets about the putative Elsewhere that some of us inhabit. That's a tall order, especially since Mr. Conley spends part of his time out on a limb, sawing. 
 Some of the claims made in ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.'' have become badly dated, whether by recent circumstances (''it is not true that firings or layoffs have increased''; ''when we look at the economy as a whole, we find that volatility has greatly decreased over the last 25 years'') or by dated research (Google's stock is said to have peaked at ''over $500,'' though it hit the $750 range). When Mr. Conley speaks of economic anxiety, he refers to awkward differences in status rather than a more timely fear of being out on the street.
 But this book's greater problem is the thin, iffy nature of its extended arguments. To back up the familiar claim that we have allowed merchandising to invade our private lives, he invokes (in no particular order) the selling of formerly free snacks on airplanes, slogans on T-shirts (with a thumbnail history of the T-shirt thrown in for filler) and the perils created by the bottling and marketing of water. A section on the changing nature of theft in a time when many goods are no longer worth stealing but social security numbers are extremely valuable, he describes an episode in which ''fake'' Yahoo operatives appeared to be scamming him. That these operatives turned out not to be fraudsters and were trying to reach him about legitimate business does not keep this story out of Mr. Conley's book. 
 He is on more solid ground when his anecdotes are nothing but colorful. Though people rarely carry much cash in a world full of ATM machines, diminishing the likelihood of muggings, he writes, ''That said, it would seem easier to pick people's pockets these days, or just conk them on the head with a club like so many baby seals as they cruise down the street, clicking away on their BlackBerrys totally unaware of their surroundings.'' That there is nothing newsworthy about excessive BlackBerry use -- or workaholic parents, children burdened with too many after-school activities, hedge fund managers who work from home in their pajamas and so on -- does not lessen that passage's colloquial appeal.
 But Mr. Conley has no big new point to make. He awkwardly coins new locutions (''weisure'' to conflate work and leisure, ''convestment'' to do the same with consumption and investment). He struggles with jargon while trying to interject the term ''intravidual'' into our collective conversation. Beware an ''of course'' when a point is anything but self-evident: ''The irony, of course, is that the intravidual is just as much an 'intervidual' (inter meaning 'between'), since it is the networked nature of our new, Elsewhere economy and the penetration of others into us that shatters the individual.''
 Mr. Conley dutifully travels out to Mountain View, Calif., to note the Orwellian nature of life at Googleplex, Google's corporate headquarters. A pox on Mountain View: it is now the destination of choice for writers seeking to pad books with sci-fi visuals and newish-sounding but already conventional wisdom.
 Otherwise the source material for ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.'' (beyond Mr. Conley's own colorful experiences, like the time he watched a British otter movie thanks to the recommendation of Netflix) is either weak (YouTube videos) or unhelpful. In citing ''The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work,'' the 1997 book by Arlie Russell Hochschild, Mr. Conley is simply emphasizing that some of his insights are old news. 
 Yet he buries in a lengthy footnote one of the most intriguing points that he might have explored: the connection between the social disembodiment described in ''Elsewhere, U.S.A.'' and rising rates of autism, a condition that defies the conventions of social networking. Mr. Conley might really have taken himself elsewhere had he pursued the question of how autism and our isolating, newly normal adult behavior are related.

HEADLINE: Named to Head S.E.C., and Named in Lawsuits

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Mary L. Schapiro, who appears this week at a confirmation hearing on her selection to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been accused in two lawsuits of making misleading statements to quickly complete a merger of regulatory organizations after which she received a 57 percent raise in her pay. 
 The merger involved the regulatory units of the New York Stock Exchange and the NASD two years ago. Ms. Schapiro was then head of the NASD, and she spent months traveling the country to persuade its 5,100 members to support it. The merger created a new self-regulatory organization, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, where Ms. Schapiro is the chief executive. The Securities and Exchange Commission relies on Finra to police Wall Street.
 Among the misstatements that she is accused of making is that the Internal Revenue Service had prohibited the NASD from paying each member more than $35,000 as part of the merger deal. Although an NASD proxy statement issued while the deal was pending said that the I.R.S. would not permit the organization to give more compensation to members, the I.R.S. did not actually issue a ruling on the matter until March 2007, long after the deal closed and three months after the members voted to approve it. 
 Lawyers representing Ms. Schapiro, Finra and other senior executives have fought vigorously to keep the I.R.S. ruling -- and court references to details of that ruling -- under seal. Last January, a federal judge in New York denied a request by The New York Times to unseal the ruling and other documents in the case.
 Ms. Schapiro's lawyer has denied the lawsuits' allegations and, in a recent interview said that the second suit, filed shortly after her selection, is an opportunistic effort to pressure the defendants to settle. The first, dismissed by a federal district judge in New York, is on appeal.
 At the S.E.C., Ms. Schapiro would be leading a government regulator that has been battered by setbacks, including its failure to uncover the apparent long-running fraud at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. A recent report by the S.E.C.'s inspector general said the agency had failed to adequately police the markets and regulate Wall Street's largest investment banks. Congressional critics have said the S.E.C.'s shortcomings contributed to the financial crisis.
 The strongest proponents of the merger that created Finra were the more than 200 firms that were members of both the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange. The merger significantly lowered their regulatory expenses, but many of the smaller members were concerned about what benefits they might receive from it.
 In an effort to get enough votes from the smaller firms, NASD offered each member $35,000, for a total of about $178 million, and a smaller commitment to reduce future assessments. 
 Executives said that amount was derived from a calculation of efficiencies from merging the organizations. NASD listed its total outstanding equity in an annual report of more than $1.6 billion. NASD officials, including Ms. Schapiro, said then that the organization could not make a greater payment because the I.R.S. had opposed it because the NASD is nonprofit. 
 The lawsuits challenge that assertion, saying that evidence that remains sealed undermines the NASD's description of the I.R.S. ruling. Also sealed is an independent fairness opinion on the merger by the investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin Financial Advisors.
 ''Our cases raise questions about the transparency, truthfulness and candor of the NASD and its leadership in a major financial transaction with its own members,'' said Jonathan W. Cuneo, the lead lawyer in both cases for the member firms. ''It's certainly ironic that the case involves the NASD, which is charged with policing those values in others.''
 Defense lawyers said in court papers and an interview that no material misrepresentations were made. They assert that the top executives of the organization, as regulators, are entitled to absolute immunity from lawsuits. They say that the members of the NASD were not entitled to greater compensation because they do not have the same rights as shareholders of a corporation. 
 ''These lawsuits are meritless, and the second suit is just a dressed-up version of the first one that was rejected by a federal judge,'' said F. Joseph Warin, a lawyer representing Finra and Ms. Schapiro. ''The lawyers are the same, and the arguments are virtually identical. The second suit was filed days after Ms. Schapiro was nominated to become chairman of the S.E.C. It looks to me like a desperate effort to leverage Mary's nomination to squeeze money out of Finra before her confirmation vote -- a last-second Hail Mary pass.''
 Mr. Cuneo said that the second lawsuit was in the works long before the announcement of Ms. Schapiro's appointment and that its filing had nothing to do with her selection.
 Herb Perone, a spokesman at Finra, said that following the customary practice of presidential appointees, Ms. Schapiro would not comment about the case while her confirmation proceedings were pending. The Senate banking committee is to consider her appointment on Thursday. 
 Lawyers involved in the proceeding say they have not been asked about the lawsuits by either the Obama transition team or the Senate banking committee.
 An official at the Obama transition said that the lawsuit had been examined during the vetting process and that Ms. Schapiro would not have been selected if it were seen as a problem. 
 Kate Szostak, a spokeswoman for the Senate banking committee, said it would study Ms. Schapiro's record as a regulator, including Finra's supervision of the Madoff firm and her role in the merger of the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange. Ms. Schapiro has extensive regulatory experience. She served for six years as a commissioner at the S.E.C. before becoming chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1994. She arrived at the NASD in 1996 to lead its regulatory arm. 
 Both suits were filed as class actions on behalf of most members of Finra. The first was filed by Standard Investment Chartered. Federal District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of New York dismissed that suit a year later without addressing the underlying allegations. The dismissal has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York. 
 A second lawsuit by Benchmark Financial Services, was filed three weeks ago in federal district court in New York. Benchmark was founded by Edward A. H. Siedle, a former lawyer at the S.E.C. who investigates pension fraud and other financial abuses. Mr. Siedle has been a plaintiff against other companies over the years and sued the NASD in 2002 after it blocked him from publishing a book about disciplinary proceedings against member firms.
 ''This case is about a corporate transaction effectuated by deception,'' the complaint in the latest case said. ''The officer defendants stood to gain substantially by the transaction, in terms of enormously higher compensation and benefits, vastly elevated prestige and powers resulting from the virtual monopoly regulatory authority created by the transaction, and the higher degree of control over the board of the consolidated entity.''
 After the merger, Ms. Schapiro's total compensation rose to more than $3.1 million, from almost $2 million. The pay package, while not outsize by Wall Street standards, is large for a nonprofit organization. Mr. Perone, the Finra spokesman, said the raise was the result of Ms. Schapiro's promotion to a higher job. He said her predecessor had received about $6 million in compensation. Other top executives at the new entity received pay increases of around 20 percent after the merger.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 4, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 12 about two lawsuits filed against Mary L. Schapiro, then the nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, described incorrectly the background of Edward A. H. Siedle, whose company filed one of the complaints. Mr. Siedle has done legal and investigative work for plaintiffs that have sued companies, but he has not been a plaintiff against other companies over the years. This correction was submitted on Jan. 12, but went astray at The Times.

HEADLINE: Do Online Universities Have Virtual Cheerleaders?

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Editor's Note: Look for In Advertising next week on Tues., Jan. 20, rather than Mon., Jan. 19, in honor of the Dr. King holiday.
 Remember when General Motors introduced Saturn by proclaiming it was ''A different kind of company. A different kind of car''? Almost 20 years later, an online educator is presenting itself to potential students as ''a different kind of university.''
 The school is Kaplan University, part of the Kaplan Higher Education division of Kaplan Inc., which is owned by the Washington Post Company. A campaign for Kaplan University, which began last week, carries the theme ''A different school of thought'' and suggests that learning online is a way to develop talent that could otherwise go to waste. 
 The campaign is the first national, multimedia effort for Kaplan University. There are commercials, running on television and online; print advertisements; and materials on a section of the Kaplan Web site that include a blog called Rethinking Higher Education.
 The campaign is the first work from the new agency for Kaplan University, the flagship New York office of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, part of WPP. Ogilvy is known for advertising for blue-chip brands like American Express, Cisco, Dove, I.B.M. and Mattel. By hiring the agency, Kaplan University signaled its ambitious intention to join the ranks of such familiar marketers.
 The campaign arrives as the popularity of distance learning for adults, through online universities and colleges, continues to grow. In addition to Kaplan University, others in the field include DeVry University, the University of Phoenix and Walden University. By one estimate, almost 4 million students were enrolled in online education in 2008.
 ''We began offering online degree programs in 2001 with 34 students,'' says Linda Mignone, vice president for brand and strategic marketing at Kaplan Higher Education, which is based in Davenport, Iowa.
 ''Now, there are 48,000,'' she adds, who can choose from more than 100 academic programs that even include a law degree through Concord Law School.
 The miserable economy may stimulate demand for distance learning because ''we're in a period of change,'' Ms. Mignone says, and ''many folks are re-evaluating their professional skills and career options.''
 That makes now a good time to ''raise awareness'' of Kaplan University, she adds, among the target market of adults in their 20s through 50s.
 Ms. Mignone declines to discuss the budget for the campaign other than to describe it as a multimillion-dollar effort. 
 The commercials include a 60-second spot that begins with a classroom full of students listening to a professor address them. ''I stand before you today to apologize,'' he says, adding that the educational system has failed them because it is ''steeped in tradition, in old ideas.''
 As the professor continues to speak, the viewer starts to see students watching and listening to him not in class but on laptops, iPods and other portable devices in living rooms, on subway platforms and other locations.
 ''It's time, time, time, for a different kind of university,'' the professor concludes. ''It's your time.''
 In another 60-second commercial, classroom chairs -- the types with desk-like tops attached -- are depicted on a beach, on a street, under a tree, in an elevator. ''Where it is written that the old way is the right way?'' the spot asks, ''that classes only take place in a classroom?''
 ''What if there was a different kind of university,'' the commercial continues, ''that fit in your life?'' The spot concludes: ''Where is it written that you can't change your life? That's the thing. It isn't written anywhere.''
 There are 15-second commercials offering variations on the messages of the longer spots. ''Who says a full-time mom doesn't have time to be a full-time student?'' one short commercial asks. Another asks two questions in a row: ''Thinking about going back to college? What if college came to you?''
 In the print ads, appearing in newspapers, there is more of a focus on the idea of online learning as a method to cultivate unexploited talent and help meet the country's need for more better-educated citizens.
 ''Every year in the United States, billions of dollars' worth of talent goes to waste,'' the headlines declare. ''What does that mean for you?''
 The ads proceed to answer that question by describing how the educational system ''doesn't work for everyone'' because it ''fails to recognize and develop the talents of people like ''stay-at-home moms. Late bloomers. Full-time workers.''
 ''It's time to rewrite the rules of education,'' the ads go on to say, with ''new technology. And new ideas. So that everyone with talent -- regardless of age, geography or circumstance -- can nurture it.''
 That approach offers Kaplan University ''a chance to frame an issue,'' says Chris Wall, vice chairman for creative at Ogilvy New York, and define itself as ''a different kind of learning environment.''
 The effort to raise the profile of Kaplan University comes at the right moment, Mr. Wall says, because ''when the economy goes down, people go back to school.''
 ''It's prime time for the brand to reach out to people,'' he adds.
 The campaign's upbeat attitude also works as an antidote to the gloom caused by the economy, Mr. Wall says, as it conveys ''the hopefulness of education, the hopefulness of self-improvement'' as well as the promise of technology to solve problems.
 Ms. Mignone echoes that assessment, describing those adults who ''want to benefit from higher education'' as ''optimistic'' people who want to ''do more'' with their lives.

HEADLINE: In His Emphasis on Economy, Obama Is Looking to History

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JIM RUTENBERG; Adam Nagourney reported from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It is still a week before he takes office, yet President-elect Barack Obama is everywhere: on the Sunday talk shows, on radio and YouTube, on Capitol Hill, drawing on the techniques he employed during the campaign and lessons from predecessors as he seeks to shape public attitudes about the economic downturn.
 His aides said Mr. Obama had studied the way Franklin D. Roosevelt approached the first 100 days of his presidency, and in particular had seized on the notion of Roosevelt having a ''conversation with the American public'' to try to prepare it for a difficult time. He has, aides said, even looked at the words Roosevelt used and the tone he struck.
 Mr. Obama has sought to strike a balance: emphasizing the depth of the problem, to create a sense of political urgency for Congress to act quickly, while not being so pessimistic that he could further destabilize the jittery financial markets or deplete the sense of energy and hope accompanying his election. 
 Yet even as the president-elect looks to the past -- he said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he had been reading Lincoln in preparation for his inaugural address -- he and his team are mobilizing to use the most up- to-date techniques to communicate with the public and rally support. 
 His aides said they would begin sending to supporters and posting on YouTube videotapes of economic experts in the administration -- like Lawrence H. Summers, who will be director of the National Economic Council -- talking in detail about Mr. Obama's economic proposals. That is following on a technique they used the first time to explain a complicated economic report this weekend. (His advisers said they had found in the campaign that using experts, even those not widely known, rather than employing familiar political faces in these types of videos was far more effective in engaging grass-roots supporters.)
 At the same time, the incoming administration is preparing to release more reports that will set out in specific numbers the goals for the huge spending Mr. Obama is proposing. The details include things like how many classrooms will be modernized, one aide said.
 Mr. Obama's aides said they were keenly aware of how President Bush, in their view, had failed to effectively explain the bailout plans he sanctioned last year or how they would benefit ordinary people, and as a result saw public opinion turn quickly against them. Mr. Obama's effort to avoid repeating that mistake was on display Sunday morning when he made the case for his economic stimulus plan -- saying it was essential to arrest and reverse a rapidly deteriorating economic situation -- for 30 minutes with George Stephanopoulos on ''This Week'' on ABC.
 ''It's going to take some time to fix it,'' Mr. Obama said, adding: ''But what we tried to do was put forward a plan that says, let's act boldly, let's act swiftly. Let's not only provide a jump-start to the economy and immediately create or save 3 million jobs, but let's also put a down payment on some of the structural problems that we have in our economy.''
 Mr. Obama's aides said that for the next three weeks, he would pack his schedule with interviews, speeches, news conferences and limited travel to try to rally public support behind the effort. The overall political goal, aides said, was to ensure that Mr. Obama's economic recovery program was approved quickly by a substantial bipartisan vote in Congress, while at the same time playing down public hopes about how quickly it might work.
 Mr. Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said: ''We're going to continue to make the choice clear. One course is do nothing and continue to shed millions of jobs and the other course is to begin to invest in creating 3.5 million jobs and American competitiveness. And to do it as quickly as possible.''
 Obama aides said he had used the transition to study how Roosevelt had tried to inform and reassure an anxious public. They said he had read a book on that period, ''The Defining Moment,'' by Jonathan Alter.
 Until his inauguration, Mr. Obama has the advantage of being able to promote solutions without having political responsibility for the increasingly acute economic situation. But though he can no doubt count on some patience from Americans, if history is any guide, he will fairly quickly be held accountable for whether his remedies result in tangible improvements. And in the meantime, he will face the need to manage expectations without stepping into negativity. 
 ''A great deal is going to hang on his Inaugural Address and what his first statement is about how he's going to deal with the economic crisis,'' said William E. Leuchtenburg, an emeritus professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who has written several books on Roosevelt. ''Can he be reassuring both in his rhetoric and by announcing a series of programs that plausibly seem as though, if they don't solve the crisis, they will at least improve things markedly in a reasonable period of time?
 ''If he's able both to instill confidence in the American people in the national government and in himself in his Inaugural Address,'' Professor Leuchtenburg said, ''and if he is able to get under way -- announce a series of initiatives that appear to be both bold and with the promise of being effective -- those are the two things that would be most like Franklin Roosevelt.'' 
 Mr. Obama's aides said the effort to rally support for his plan was not patterned on a political campaign, akin to what Mr. Bush did early in his second term in his unsuccessful effort to persuade Congress to pass his proposed overhaul of Social Security. Mr. Obama is not planning extensive travel, like visiting the districts of wavering Republican members of Congress, and he has no plans to set up a central war room to direct the campaign.
 There is little doubt on either side of the aisle that Mr. Obama can get Congress to pass a stimulus bill. The question is whether he can create one that can draw enough Republican votes to give the parties shared ownership of a plan, providing a basis for cooperation on other big issues, like health care and global warming -- and reducing the partisan recriminations should the plan fail to live up to its promise.
 But Mr. Obama's team will still be able to call on Washington's partisan political machinery if necessary.
 Brad Woodhouse, who was a senior Democratic Party strategist in the campaign, has assembled a group of 25 organizations -- including unions like the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and grass-roots groups like MoveOn.org and Acorn -- to build public and Congressional support for Mr. Obama's economic package.
 Mr. Woodhouse said the group was in the process of raising money for television advertisements that would pressure local lawmakers to support the plan. He said he had consulted with several of Mr. Obama's senior strategists. 
 ''We're doing this with the notion,'' Mr. Woodhouse said, ''that if we can help in any way, even at the margins, to make this any easier on Obama, it will preserve some of his political capital.''

HEADLINE: Obama Lobbies for Release of Second Half of Bailout

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even as they continued to hash out the details of a nearly $800 billion economic recovery plan, aides to President-elect Barack Obama on Sunday began lobbying a reluctant Congress to release the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund. 
 Senate Democrats said that they expected a formal request for the $350 billion to be made by President Bush this week. Both the outgoing and incoming presidents are then expected to take the unusual step of pressing jointly for approval, though lawmakers in both parties are furious over the Bush administration's handling of the bailout and some have pledged to block the money. 
 Securing the remaining $350 billion now would put the money in place for use by the new administration shortly after Mr. Obama is inaugurated, and it would spare him a potentially messy political fight that could interfere with his agenda. 
 The request is certain to generate angry debate on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers are reeling from last week's projection of a $1.2 trillion budget deficit and will also soon be asked to vote on Mr. Obama's $800 billion recovery package. 
 The first $350 billion in bailout money has been fully allocated and the Treasury says there is no urgent need for more, though officials have warned that further steps are likely to be needed to stabilize the financial system. 
 It remains unclear if there is a need to rush to release the money, or if the Obama transition team is just seeking to avoid what could become a major headache. The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said on the CBS program ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday that he would oppose disbursing the money because there was no justification for doing so now. 
 ''I think until there is a demonstrated need in our economy and a plan to address that need, I think it would be irresponsible of Congress to release the additional money,'' Mr. Boehner said. 
 Mr. Bush's request is expected to be preceded by a forceful effort by Mr. Obama's team to persuade lawmakers that the new administration will make better use of the bailout money, including new home foreclosure prevention efforts and restrictions on banks that get aid. 
 Lawrence H. Summers, who will be Mr. Obama's top economic adviser at the White House, began to make that case on Sunday in a meeting with Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill. Though the meeting focused primarily on tax provisions of the economic recovery plan, Mr. Summers also argued that the new administration should have the bailout money on hand. 
 ''They need it,'' Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said after the meeting. ''Larry Summers made a very strong argument for why it's important and critical to the overall recovery, and that's an argument most of us understand.'' 
 But Mr. Kerry said lawmakers were awaiting assurances from Mr. Obama and his aides on how the money would be used. ''How about a legitimate accountability structure for what's going to happen going forward?'' he said. ''And also there is a lot of interest up here in finding out what happened to the 350 that has already been spent.'' 
 The White House has indicated that Mr. Bush will formally request the money if Mr. Obama asks him to do so.
 ''There have been discussions between the administration and the transition team on how to proceed should the president-elect determine that he would like President Bush to notify Congress on his behalf of the intent to use the remaining $350 billion so that it will be available early in the new administration,'' the White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said on Friday. ''No final decisions have been made.'' 
 Officials said Mr. Bush was also willing to help try to persuade Congress to approve the money. 
 Even with the muscle of both the president and the president-elect, however, there is no guarantee Congress will release the money. Under the bailout law, the House and Senate can vote to block the funds, though Mr. Bush presumably would veto their disapproval. 
 Many lawmakers who say they may be willing to release the money are still demanding tough new conditions on its use, and Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill last week that would impose them. An aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would vote to approve Mr. Frank's bill this week. 
 Mr. Frank's bill would require the new administration to develop a plan by March 15 to use at least $40 billion of the $350 billion to prevent home foreclosures. 
 The bill also seeks to require greater transparency and accountability, including quarterly reports from financial institutions that receive help to document how the bailout money is being used. It would also impose tougher limits on executive pay. 
 Some Congressional leaders said there did not seem to be enough time to approve new legislation if the bailout money is to be in place by the time Mr. Obama takes office. Others said Congress bore some responsibility for rushing the bailout legislation in the fall and not including sufficient safeguards. 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said there had been discussion of a formal letter to be written by Mr. Obama or his aides to Congress describing their plan for the additional $350 billion and promising safeguards. But he acknowledged that without new legislation there would be nothing to guarantee that those plans would be followed. 
 Lawmakers are angry about many aspects of the bailout, which they intended for the government purchase of troubled assets, particularly mortgage-backed securities, but instead has been used to recapitalize banks and even prop up failing Detroit automakers.
 An oversight board recently issued a scathing report saying the Treasury had failed to track the money adequately. 
 Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, has been working to restructure the bailout program. Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said lawmakers would need assurances of the new administration's plans. 
 ''It has got to be in writing,'' Mr. Conrad said. 
 Mr. Dodd said, ''The Obama administration wants to rebrand this process; they realize it has been terribly mismanaged.'' He added, ''But they also make the strong point that they need these resources to do that.'' 
 Senate Democrats met with Mr. Summers, primarily about the larger economic recovery package, after a rare Sunday session, in which they voted to take up consideration of a package of public lands bills. 
 It was the first weekend of the new Congress, and Senate Democratic leaders insisted on a Sunday vote to signal that with their expanded majority they had less patience for efforts by Republicans to block their agenda. 
 Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, had sought to stall the public lands package because he said it included billions of dollars in wasteful spending. In the end, the Senate voted 66 to 12 to take up the bill. 
 The meeting with Mr. Summers was the second between Senate Democrats and the Obama team about the details of the recovery package. At a meeting on Thursday, several senators criticized some of the tax provisions in the plan and said they wanted a greater focus on job creation. 
 After the meeting, several senators praised Mr. Summers and said their concerns were being addressed.

HEADLINE: Coming at You, Again

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The imminent full-bore return to 3-D filmmaking, upon which the movie industry is placing many of its hopes, is in danger of becoming Hollywood's latest flub.
 Some of the mightiest forces in film -- Jeffrey Katzenberg, James Cameron, John Lasseter -- think the multiplex masses will soon demand that all movies be shown in newly available digital 3-D. Mr. Katzenberg, in particular, has pushed the format, trotting the globe to herald the technology as a transformative moment for cinema akin to the introduction of sound.
 His bandwagon has plenty of passengers, at least in Hollywood. The Walt Disney Company alone has 15 three-dimensional movies in its pipeline. Twentieth Century Fox is betting an estimated $200 million on ''Avatar,'' a 3-D space adventure directed by Mr. Cameron and set for December release, his first nondocumentary film since 1997's ''Titanic,'' still the biggest moneymaker in movie history, without counting inflation. All told, the movie factory has over 30 3-D pictures on the way. 
 But analysts are starting to warn that all of that product could find itself sitting on a loading dock with no place to go. Studios, thrilled by 3-D's dual promises of higher profits and artistic advancement, have aggressively embraced the technology without waiting for movie theaters to get on board. And without those expensive upgrades to projection equipment at the multiplex, mass market 3-D releases are not tenable.
 ''It's starting to look like there will be a lot of disappointed producers unable to realize the upside of these 3-D investments,'' said Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of ''Entertainment Industry Economics.'' Filming in 3-D adds about $15 million to production costs, he said, but can send profit soaring because of premium ticket pricing.
 Only about 1,300 of North America's 40,000 or so movie screens support digital 3-D. (Imax adds 250.) Overseas, where films now generate up to 70 percent of their theatrical revenue, only a few hundred theaters can support the technology. It costs about $100,000 for each full upgrade.
 Studios require about 3,000 screens in North America for most new releases. Popcorn movies like ''Avatar'' or ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' a 3-D entry from DreamWorks Animation, typically open on more than 4,000 screens. 
 ''The crunch has everybody scrambling,'' said Chuck Viane, president for domestic distribution for Walt Disney Studios. ''We had expected many more screens to be available by now, no doubt about it.''
 Upgrades have lagged primarily because of industry infighting over who will shoulder the cost. Studios expected theaters to take the lead because digital equipment would allow them to raise prices -- tickets to the new crop of 3-D movies run as high as $25 each -- and lure consumers away from their big-screen living room TVs. Exhibitors, hurt by soaring real estate costs, wanted studios to pay for similar reasons.
 Movie chains and four of the six major studios agreed in September on a plan to convert upward of 15,000 theaters using $1 billion in debt financing arranged through JPMorgan Chase. But the squabbling took too long: The financing plan came together just as the credit markets froze.
 Studios and exhibitors say the upgrade plan is not in jeopardy. 
 ''This is a long-term commitment and a long-term strategy,'' Mr. Katzenberg, the chief of DreamWorks, said recently. 
 Meanwhile, the Digital Cinema Implementation Partners, a consortium of exhibitors and studios, is pursuing alternative financing to allow the plan to proceed in steps. ''Rather than just being patient, we are aggressively exploring all options,'' said Rich Manzione, the group's vice president for strategic planning.
 Other participants seem less optimistic. Will the credit markets thaw in the first quarter, as Mr. Katzenberg predicts? ''Your guess is as good as mine,'' said Mike Campbell, the chief executive of the Regal Entertainment Group, which owns the nation's largest movie theater chain. 
 Meanwhile, the shortage of 3-D theaters is upsetting profit projections at various studios, with three-dimensional movies probably leaving millions of dollars on the table. When DreamWorks Animation releases ''Monsters vs. Aliens'' on March 27, it will have to settle for half the number of 3-D screens it wanted. While acknowledging the shortage, Mr. Katzenberg recently told analysts there were enough theaters available to ''recover our upfront investment and make a profit.''
 To get an idea of how much money is at stake, DreamWorks Animation recently estimated that one of its hit titles, released entirely in 3-D, would earn an additional $80 million in profit.
 The shortage is sending mixed messages to moviegoers, many of whom are already skeptical of the claims about 3-D. Because of a shortage of outlets last summer, Warner Brothers had to scramble to change the marketing for ''Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D'' -- dropping ''3D'' from the title -- and offer a two-dimensional release in tandem. Lionsgate will have just 900 3-D theaters available for ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' on Jan. 16, forcing the studio to show a standard version on about 1,600 screens.
 The delay is also threatening to undercut one of the primary benefits for theaters -- the ability to deliver an experience that consumers cannot replicate at home. But the home entertainment market is rapidly catching up, with companies developing 3-D options for the home.
 RealD, a California company that is the lead provider of 3-D technology for theaters, last week demonstrated a similar product for televisions at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 
 Michael Lewis, the chief executive of RealD, said in an interview that he expected Americans to own 10 million 3-D-capable television sets within five years. 
 People who remember 3-D from the 1950s roll their eyes at Hollywood's renewed fascination with the medium. They associate 3-D with cheesy films (''Creature From the Black Lagoon''), stiff cardboard glasses and jerky, stomach-turning camera movements. 
 This time, movie executives insist that everything has changed. Digital projectors deliver the images with perfect precision -- eliminating headaches and nausea -- while plastic glasses have replaced the cardboard.
 Most important, say filmmakers, new equipment allows movies to be built in 3-D from the ground up, providing a more immersive and realistic viewing experience and not one based just on visual gimmicks.

HEADLINE: Ideas for Obama

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week President-elect Barack Obama was asked to respond to critics who say that his stimulus plan won't do enough to help the economy. Mr. Obama answered that he wants to hear ideas about ''how to spend money efficiently and effectively to jump-start the economy.''
 O.K., I'll bite -- although as I'll explain shortly, the ''jump-start'' metaphor is part of the problem. 
 First, Mr. Obama should scrap his proposal for $150 billion in business tax cuts, which would do little to help the economy. Ideally he'd scrap the proposed $150 billion payroll tax cut as well, though I'm aware that it was a campaign promise.
 Money not squandered on ineffective tax cuts could be used to provide further relief to Americans in distress -- enhanced unemployment benefits, expanded Medicaid and more. And why not get an early start on the insurance subsidies -- probably running at $100 billion or more per year -- that will be essential if we're going to achieve universal health care?
 Mainly, though, Mr. Obama needs to make his plan bigger. To see why, consider a new report from his own economic team.
 On Saturday, Christina Romer, the future head of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who will be the vice president's chief economist, released estimates of what the Obama economic plan would accomplish. Their report is reasonable and intellectually honest, which is a welcome change from the fuzzy math of the last eight years. 
 But the report also makes it clear that the plan falls well short of what the economy needs. 
 According to Ms. Romer and Mr. Bernstein, the Obama plan would have its maximum impact in the fourth quarter of 2010. Without the plan, they project, the unemployment rate in that quarter would be a disastrous 8.8 percent. Yet even with the plan, unemployment would be 7 percent -- roughly as high as it is now.
 After 2010, the report says, the effects of the economic plan would rapidly fade away. The job of promoting full recovery would, however, remain undone: the unemployment rate would still be a painful 6.3 percent in the last quarter of 2011.
 Now, economic forecasting is an inexact science, to say the least, and things could turn out better than the report predicts. But they could also turn out worse. The report itself acknowledges that ''some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action.'' And I'm with Lawrence Summers, another member of the Obama economic team, who recently declared, ''In this crisis, doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much.'' Unfortunately, that principle isn't reflected in the current plan.
 So how can Mr. Obama do more? By including a lot more public investment in his plan -- which will be possible if he takes a longer view.
 The Romer-Bernstein report acknowledges that ''a dollar of infrastructure spending is more effective in creating jobs than a dollar of tax cuts.'' It argues, however, that ''there is a limit on how much government investment can be carried out efficiently in a short time frame.'' But why does the time frame have to be short?
 As far as I can tell, Mr. Obama's planners have focused on investment projects that will deliver their main jobs boost over the next two years. But since unemployment is likely to remain high well beyond that two-year window, the plan should also include longer-term investment projects. 
 And bear in mind that even a project that delivers its main punch in, say, 2011 can provide significant economic support in earlier years. If Mr. Obama drops the ''jump-start'' metaphor, if he accepts the reality that we need a multi-year program rather than a short burst of activity, he can create a lot more jobs through government investment, even in the near term.
 Still, shouldn't Mr. Obama wait for proof that a bigger, longer-term plan is needed? No. Right now the investment portion of the Obama plan is limited by a shortage of ''shovel ready'' projects, projects ready to go on short notice. A lot more investment can be under way by late 2010 or 2011 if Mr. Obama gives the go-ahead now -- but if he waits too long before deciding, that window of opportunity will be gone. 
 One more thing: even with the Obama plan, the Romer-Bernstein report predicts an average unemployment rate of 7.3 percent over the next three years. That's a scary number, big enough to pose a real risk that the U.S. economy will get stuck in a Japan-type deflationary trap. 
 So my advice to the Obama team is to scrap the business tax cuts, and, more important, to deal with the threat of doing too little by doing more. And the way to do more is to stop talking about jump-starts and look more broadly at the possibilities for government investment.

HEADLINE: How Many Miles Per Gallon?

 BODY:
The Bush administration has decided that it will not issue final fuel-economy standards before it leaves office. It is not entirely clear why. The regulators may have run out of time, or the White House may have chosen not to inflict any last-minute pain on the automakers. 
The standards would surely have been weaker than what the automakers are capable of achieving. The Obama administration now has a free hand to set its own standards that will save consumers money at the pump, reduce oil dependency and greenhouse gases, and help make the American car companies more competitive.
The 2007 energy bill required new cars and trucks to meet a fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, a 40 percent increase over today's average of 25 m.p.g. Congress intended this as a floor, not a ceiling, and ordered the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to write specific regulations.
Last May, as part of these regulations, the agency set an interim fleetwide standard of 31.6 m.p.g by 2015. This was initially praised for pushing carmakers more than halfway to the 2020 goal. The automakers have since suggested they can meet these goals without difficulty, while reputable studies have said they can do even better -- at least as high as 35 m.p.g. by 2015, and 40 m.p.g. by 2020, with no changes in current technology.
During Congressional hearings last year on the automakers' troubles, General Motors and Ford provided production plans to show that they would make more fuel-efficient cars. The Obama administration should make such vehicles a condition of any future help. No matter what Detroit does, the new administration must set much tougher fuel-economy standards.

HEADLINE: Yes He Can, and He'll Tell You About It

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Spend time with President-elect Barack Obama, and you won't question the confidence he will carry into the Oval Office eight days from now. He doesn't.
 At 47, Mr. Obama is inheriting an economy that has shed one million jobs just in the two months since his election. He has held public office barely longer than his eldest daughter, 10-year-old Malia, has been alive. 
 Yet he brims with self-assurance about himself, his program and his ability to rally a fearful American public. For evidence that his internal buoyancy resonates with the American public, consider that 82 percent of people polled by CNN last month credited Mr. Obama with the ability to inspire confidence. 
 The desk behind Mr. Obama at transition headquarters holds bound volumes of the words of one president: John F. Kennedy. He doesn't shrink from comparison with Kennedy, another charismatic 40-something president with an attractive young family and a Harvard pedigree.
 ''You've got to watch those Harvard guys, they'll get you every time,'' Mr. Obama said with a chuckle during a recent interview. He vowed to avoid the stumbles of Kennedy's ''Best and the Brightest'' by seeking a broad range of advice. 
 And he shrugged off concerns about overconfidence by invoking his skills: ''What I do have confidence about is that I'm a good listener, I'm good at synthesizing advice from a range of different perspectives, and that we will make the best possible decisions from the perspective of what's good for ordinary Americans.''
 Embracing Roosevelt
 The leadership challenge he faces most often draw comparisons with Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. He embraces that, too.
 ''If you look at F.D.R.'s first speech, the line that's remembered is 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,' '' Mr. Obama said. ''But actually the bulk of the speech centered around the need to act and act now. 
 ''This is a bit of advice that I received from one of the former presidents,'' he continued. ''He said, 'Part of the reason, Barack, that you're doing well right now is because you don't talk down to the American people, you play it straight and just explain what it is that's taking place.' 
 ''So my job, both in the inauguration speech and in the months to come, is simply to explain as honestly and truthfully as possible what the circumstances are, what the best ideas are that are out there in terms of meeting those challenges, and if I do that, I feel confident that we'll come together to solve these problems.''
 Keeping Mom Happy
 Mr. Obama's jauntiness extends beyond policy or communication acumen. The first African-American to be elected president projects an identification with middle-class parents everywhere, white and black. Call it an Ozzie and Harriet sensibility for a diverse, 21st-century America.
 ''I believe in the general theory that if Mom is happy, everybody's happy,'' Mr. Obama said, describing family advice he received from his predecessors at the White House last week. ''Everybody concurred on that one. 
 ''President Carter and Clinton both had some unique insights because they had younger children when they were in the White House. And, obviously, Malia and Sasha are 10 and 7, and we just want to make sure that we are creating normalcy as much as possible in what obviously is an extraordinary situation.''
 The fit, basketball-playing politician uses enthusiasm for sports to connect with men and women alike. He evinced no embarrassment over the paparazzi shots of him shirtless on the family's recent Hawaiian vacation, even as he observed that, ''My wife was tickled with me blushing.'' 
 After his bowling misadventure during the primaries last year, he has lately practiced with his daughters on their new Nintendo Wii. Speaking on the eve of the college football championship game between Florida and Oklahoma, he grew especially animated in affirming his preference for a playoff system. 
 ''If you look at knowledgeable sports fans, they agree with me,'' the president-elect said with a smile. ''But, you know, I've got to pick and choose my battles. I probably am going to be spending more time focusing on creating three million more jobs.''
 He didn't look worried when he said it.

HEADLINE: Republicans' Latest Talking Point: The New Deal Failed

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

 BODY:
On Christmas Eve, the conservative pundit Monica Crowley argued on Fox News that instead of rescuing America from the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt's spending on public works made it worse. She insisted that this bizarre claim was confirmed by ''all kinds of studies and academic work.''
 The show's host backed her up. ''Yes,'' said Gregg Jarrett, ''I think historians pretty much agree on that.'' In the same vein, a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece said F.D.R. helped turn ''a panic into the worst depression of modern times.'' Now, as Congress begins to debate President-elect Barack Obama's ambitious economic stimulus plan, this anti-New Deal talking point is popping up all over. 
 Conservatives have railed against the New Deal from the start. In 1934, H. L. Mencken was already decrying it as ''a saturnalia of expropriation and waste.'' When F.D.R. ran for re-election in 1936, a headline in William Randolph Hearst's newspapers insisted that ''Moscow Backs Roosevelt.''
 But Americans were not fooled. They knew F.D.R. was on their side in a way that Herbert Hoover and his fellow free-marketers hadn't been. They could see first-hand the good that Roosevelt's jobs programs were doing for the Depression's victims and the slow but unmistakable improvements in the economy.
 In the 1934 midterm elections, the voters delivered their first verdict on the New Deal, expanding the Democrats' margins in Congress. In 1936, F.D.R. won in a bigger landslide than he had four years earlier. By 1940, the Republican nominee, Wendell Willkie, was supporting much of Roosevelt's social welfare and regulatory regime.
 Anti-New Deal rhetoric has never disappeared from American political life. When Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, he attacked President Dwight Eisenhower for having presided over a ''dime store New Deal.'' But in recent years, the attacks have heated up.
 At the start of the Bush administration, conservatives talked openly about rolling back the New Deal. They were trying to unravel the regulatory state, including protections for workers, consumers and investors. They were also promoting a favorite cause of Wall Street's: privatizing Social Security, the crown jewel of the New Deal.
 These days the public is in no mood, given the high costs of deregulation in the mortgage industry and the Bernard Madoff scandal, for more talk about dismantling regulations and federal oversight. But today, the new focus is Mr. Obama's stimulus package. If F.D.R.'s New Deal spending made things worse, it follows that the Obama administration should not make the same mistake.
 The anti-New Deal line is wrong as a matter of economics. F.D.R.'s spending programs did help the economy and created millions of new jobs. The problem, we now know, is not that F.D.R. spent too much priming the pump, but rather that he spent too little. It was his decision to cut back on spending on New Deal programs that brought about a nasty recession in 1937-38.
 The second problem is that the criticism overlooks the relief Roosevelt's programs brought to millions. When F.D.R. took office, unemployment was 25 percent, and families were losing their homes, living in shantytowns, even fighting one another for food at garbage dumps. 
 The difference that the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration and other New Deal public works programs made in people's lives is incalculable. 
 F.D.R.'s labor secretary, Frances Perkins, described in her memoir what a relief job meant to an ''almost deaf, elderly lawyer'' she knew whose practice had failed. He had gotten a job as a caretaker at a small seaside park. ''He made little extra plantings,'' she recalled, ''arranged charming paths and walks, acted as guide to visitors, supervised children's play.'' When she saw him, she said, ''he would always ask me to take a message to the President -- a message of gratitude for a job which paid him fifteen dollars a week and kept him from starving to death.''
 Congressional Republicans say Mr. Obama's stimulus will cost too much, and that over time the economy will cure itself. When critics raised the same objections to F.D.R.'s programs, his relief administrator, Harry Hopkins, had a ready answer: ''People don't eat in the long run. They eat every day.''

HEADLINE: A Big Night for 'Slumdog Millionaire' and Kate Winslet

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and MICHAEL CIEPLY. 
David Carr contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
''Slumdog Millionaire,''Kate Winslet, HBO and its ''John Adams'' mini-series and NBC's comedy juggernaut, ''30 Rock,'' were the big winners Sunday night at the 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards here.
 ''Slumdog Millionaire'' won best dramatic picture, an honor that informally makes the film the little-movie-that-could of this year's award season. Danny Boyle won the award for directing the uplifting tale, presented partly in Hindi, which also picked up awards for best screenplay and score. Best comedy was Woody Allen's ''Vicky Cristina Barcelona.''
 Ms. Winslet won not only best actress in a drama for ''Revolutionary Road,'' a film directed by her husband, Sam Mendes, but also best supporting actress for ''The Reader,'' only the third time in Globes history that a person has won two acting awards in the same year. 
 ''Is this really happening?'' an emotional Ms. Winslet said in accepting her second award, pledging true love for her co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio. 
 Mickey Rourke, making a stunning comeback after seeing his acting career all but disappear, was named best actor in a drama for ''The Wrestler,'' about an over-the-hill athlete. ''Several years ago, I was almost out of this business,'' he said. Bruce Springsteen won for best original song for his theme song to ''The Wrestler.''
 Hollywood put aside a dismal economy and the threat of an actors' strike to focus on the awards, an important stop on the road the Oscars but one that is as much about putting on a show and putting away some Champagne as it is about building awards consensus. The stars who drive the industry certainly seemed ready to celebrate. The room laughed easily, applauded lustily and then trotted off to a menu of parties at the Beverly Hilton.
 While the Globes did their best to keep grimmer realities at bay, there was a flash of reality in the victory of ''Waltzing With Bashir'' for best foreign film. In an oblique reference to the current Israeli invasion in Gaza, its director, Ari Folman, dedicated the award to the eight babies born to crew members during the production and said he hoped that when the children grew up, they would see the film as ''an ancient video game that has nothing to do with their life whatsoever.''
 In the early awards, Sally Hawkins was named best actress in a comedy or musical film for her role as a relentlessly upbeat schoolteacher in Mike Leigh's ''Happy-Go-Lucky.'' In perhaps the evening's biggest surprise, Colin Farrell took the best actor in a comedy award for playing a hit man with a soft heart in ''In Bruges.''
 The association had nominated a wide range of movies, with no one film dominating as in years past. The leading entries were ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' and ''Frost/Nixon,'' both nominated for five awards, including best dramatic picture. ''Doubt'' also received five nominations but did not get a best-picture nod. 
 None of those three films took home an award. Notably, the awards went to small films and not more expensive movies like ''Mamma Mia!''
 Ms. Winslet had suggested on the red carpet on the way in that she believed she had very little chance of winning supporting actress, but less than half an hour later she was standing onstage reading a lengthy acceptance speech that singled out her fellow nominees, her agents, her family and even the hair stylists who worked on the film. ''I'm sorry I was so mental,'' she said. Later she gave another long list of thank-yous for the best-actress award.
 Heath Ledger, who died last January at 28, was named best supporting actor in a film for his role as the Joker in ''The Dark Knight,'' the year's biggest success at the box office. The film's director, Christopher Nolan, accepted the award on Ledger's behalf as the audience rose in a standing ovation.
 ''Wall-E'' from Disney's Pixar Animation unit was named the year's best animated film.
 HBO was the big winner on the television side, as expected. ''John Adams'' was on fire, picking up best mini-series, best actress (Laura Linney), best actor (Paul Giamatti) and best supporting actor (Tom Wilkinson). Gabriel Byrne won for best actor in a television drama series for playing a therapist on HBO's ''In Treatment,'' and Anna Paquin won in the same category for her role in ''True Blood,'' the network's vampire saga. 
 NBC's ''30 Rock'' was named best comedy, and its star and creator, Tina Fey, was named best actress in a comedy, while her co-star, Alec Baldwin, won for best actor. ''Mad Men'' was best drama, with its creator thanking ''his friends'' at AMC. The cable network announced last week that the series would return for a third season this summer -- with or without its creator and executive producer, Matthew Weiner, who is locked in a contract dispute with the cable network.
 ''If you ever start to feel too good about yourself, they have this thing called the Internet,'' Ms. Fey said in accepting her award. ''You can find a lot of people who don't like you.'' Then she added, ''I'd like to address some of them now,'' rattled off a series of Web screen names of people who had written unkind things about her this year and gave each of them a salty response. 
 A rambunctious Tracy Morgan, a member of the ''30 Rock'' cast, accepted the award on behalf of the show by cracking that he made a deal with Ms. Fey: ''If Barack Obama won, I would speak for the show from now on.'' He added that he was pleased with the victory because ''a black man can't get no love'' from the Emmy Awards.
 The Golden Globes -- given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 freelance writers -- are not taken seriously as artistic milestones and have a history of voting idiosyncrasies. Still, the best-picture Oscar has mirrored the association's choice for best drama or best comedy-musical in 14 of the last 21 years. And a Globe nomination is viewed as vital to maintaining momentum in the Oscar marathon.
 So with Oscar nominations due to be announced next week all eyes were on the International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton, where a coterie of Hollywood luminaries gathered at a sea of circular tables to eat, drink and see who walks away with a trophy.
 Dozens of entertainment figures -- among them Martin Scorsese, Sigourney Weaver and Johnny Depp -- presented awards during the ceremony. The Golden Globes were televised in more than 160 countries this year, and more than 20 million people in the United States were expected to watch the telecast even though it faced heavy competition from the season premiere of ''24'' on Fox.
 Steven Spielberg received the annual Cecil B. DeMille Award for ''outstanding contribution to the entertainment field.''
 Films that had much to gain from the Globes included ''The Reader,'' from the Weinstein Company, and ''Revolutionary Road,'' from Paramount Vantage and DreamWorks, both nominees for best dramatic picture, and ''Milk,'' from Focus Features, with a star, Sean Penn, nominated for best dramatic actor. 
 Because the awards recognize movies and television shows, the Golden Globe ceremony is one of the most star-studded events of the year, and because it is a dinner party with wine and Champagne, it is often more relaxed than the Oscars. But given the nation's sour economy, Hollywood had been unsure of how to handle the self-congratulation-a-thon.
 In the end, the Globes decided to pour on the glitter whether it fit the cultural mood or not, driven in part by last year's dreadful experience, in which the gala was replaced by a drab news conference because of a writers' strike. NBC lost viewers and millions of dollars.
 The production featured more elaborate sets than in past years, a redesigned statuette (more detailing) and a more extravagant dinner (''aromatic Asian spice marinated sea bass with sherry yuzu pepper sauce''). Dick Clark Productions, which produced the telecast for NBC, said that more than 200 celebrities were expected to attend and that the red carpet -- more of a zoo than normal, certain Hollywood watchers observed -- was stocked with at least 500 microphones and cameras to capture celebrity fashions and beam chit-chat to the masses.
 The press association had tried to curate a show that featured a younger set of stars, something that it had hoped would attract younger viewers. To that end, Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens, the stars of Disney's ''High School Musical'' franchise, were presenters along with the Jonas Brothers. Many nominees were notable for their youth this time around, with Miley Cyrus receiving a nomination for best song and James Franco nominated for his acting in the comedy ''Pineapple Express.''
 The walk-up to the Globes over the weekend included the usual assortment of parties and frolic, with Paramount hosting a party at the Chateau Marmont on Saturday night for ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'' and Miramax and Walt Disney Studios inviting the throngs to the rooftop at the Beverly Wilshire in honor of films that include ''Doubt'' and ''Wall-E.''
 As Sunday dawned -- sunny and warm, with temperatures in the Beverly Hills 90210 zone pointed toward the upper 70s -- it became clear the audience still had a large appetite for a legend like Clint Eastwood, even if those who vote for the Globes largely bypassed him this year. The morning box office reports put his ''Gran Torino'' on top with about $29 million in ticket sales, as it spread from a handful of theaters to more than 2,800 locations around the country.
 Inside the awards banquet, Ms. Linney and Meryl Streep were all hugs, and Mr. Spielberg schmoozed like a new kid in town. ''It's a reunion for these people,'' said one waiter who has worked the event before.
 Ms. Winslet made a beeline for the hotel's door to get off the throbbing red carpet. ''This event is wonderful, but there is so much pressure, so much madness out here, you don't know where to look,'' she said. 
 Her co-star in ''Revolutionary Road,'' Mr. DiCaprio, stopped to talk about the country's economic woes.
 ''There are a lot of problems out there in the world, many of them serious, many of them that I care deeply about, but who am I, or any other actor, to get in the way of tradition?'' he said. ''I think it's O.K. to take a night off and have some fun.''
 Not everyone was joining in the frolic. When Kristin Scott Thomas, the English actress, was asked who or what she was wearing, she said, ''My skin.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Golden Globe awards misstated, in some editions, the title of the movie that was named best foreign language film. It is ''Waltz With Bashir,'' not ''Waltzing With Bashir.''
An article on Monday about the Golden Globes awards ceremony, at which ''Mad Men'' was honored as best television drama, misidentified, in some editions, the party involved in a contract dispute with the show's creator and executive producer, Matthew Weiner.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Clamors to Be a Part of Obama's Big Day

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
Kate Walsh, the star of ''Private Practice'' by way of ''Grey's Anatomy,'' first met Barack Obama at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles and spent the past year traveling across the country for him. She caucused for him in Nevada, talked him up in her home state, Arizona, campaigned twice for him in Pennsylvania and promoted him on drive-time radio shows. Then she tried to get tickets to the inauguration. 
 ''I talked to the woman today, and she's like, 'We're going to let you know in four to six weeks,' '' Ms. Walsh joked to Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night talk show in mid-November. ''I'm like, 'Isn't that pretty much the inauguration?' I think I'll be on the outside of the inauguration door window with my nose pressed up against the glass.'' 
 She would not be the only one.
 Hollywood's clamor to be included in Mr. Obama's big day may prove good for the event -- part of it is, after all, a television program to be shown on HBO. But it is trickier for Mr. Obama, who maintained an arm's-length distance from celebrities throughout the campaign, notwithstanding Republicans' taunts that he was the political equivalent of Paris Hilton.
 Now, he finds himself about to welcome to the nation's capital ballrooms full of A-listers who, along with a million other Americans, want to witness the swearing-in and celebration of the first black president.
 ''After winning a Super Bowl, people always say, 'I'm going to Disneyland,' '' said Steven J. Ross, a history professor at the University of Southern California who is working on a book about how Hollywood helped shape American politics. ''Well, after winning an election, celebrities always like to say, 'I'm going to the inauguration.' '' 
 But bragging rights among the Hollywood set can cause complications for the Obama team, which is trying to make this inauguration as ''open and accessible'' as possible and is painfully aware of its image in tough economic times.
 ''He has to be careful that word doesn't get out that ordinary people were somehow cut out in order to the let celebrities in,'' Mr. Ross said. ''If the public perceives this as too glamorous or people buying their way into the inauguration, that will get him ill will.'' 
 (In fact, people who donate $50,000 to the inauguration receive four tickets to official inaugural events, and Jamie Foxx, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Steven Spielberg and Sharon Stone, among others, have signed up. There is also a smaller package for $10,000).
 But during the campaign, Mr. Obama strategically managed his interactions with celebrities, recognizing that hobnobbing with them seems to invite backlash -- especially for Democrats, who are more susceptible to being painted as Hollywood liberals. Mr. Obama crisply distanced himself from the actress Scarlett Johansson last summer after she gushed about exchanging e-mail messages with him. 
 After Senator John McCain's campaign mocked Mr. Obama as a celebrity in an advertisement leading up to the Democratic convention, an adviser to Mr. Obama, Anita Dunn, said: ''We were definitely conscious of how some things looked. There was definitely a higher degree of sensitivity coming out of big events.'' 
 Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant with many celebrity clients, said the Obama campaign had acted carefully.
 ''I think they got a little freaked out when McCain did his Paris Hilton ad,'' he said. ''And I think part of it may have been a reaction to perceived overfriendliness of Clinton with the Hollywood crowd, and polls showing that people don't like celebrities.'' 
 ''There is a fine line between over-identification with celebrity and running away from natural allies,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama has relied less on Hollywood for money, crowds and excitement than past candidates have, largely because he could generate those on his own.
 ''It was really coals to Newcastle, to bring celebrities to Obama,'' said Ron Brownstein, the political director of Atlantic Media and author of ''Power and the Glitter,'' a book about the Washington-Hollywood nexus.
 At the same time, Mr. Obama also understood how to harness his inner celebrity when the need arose, posing for the cover of glossy magazines (Annie Leibovitz shot him twice for Men's Vogue) and doling out access to his family at important moments in the campaign.
 Yet, said Larry Hackett, the managing editor of People magazine, Mr. Obama ''was not happy about it at all'' when his magazine ran a picture of a bare-chested Mr. Obama on the beach. At the same time, Mr. Hackett said, his political prospects are ''inextricably linked to who he is and who his family is.''
 The inauguration itself will be a balancing act. ''The entertainment at inaugural programs will include people that you've heard of and people that you haven't, and that's because we're striving to put together a program that represents the diversity of our country,'' said Josh Earnest, a spokesman for the Presidential Inaugural Committee. ''There will be artists that represent a range of interests, and there will be artists who are not famous.'' 
 But with the inauguration eight days away, the committee has been slow to announce its entertainment choices, leaving many artists facing a rare bout of insecurity. The musician Will.i.am, who was the driving force behind the ''Yes We Can'' video during the campaign, said a few weeks ago that he was waiting to hear back from the committee. 
 ''I don't want to get my feelings hurt and crushed,'' he said, adding, ''I want to go there as a citizen, and if I have to be in a van, I'm going to be in a van and I'm going to be happy.''
 As for Ms. Walsh? She said she would be there, but she got her tickets like most everyone else -- through one of her state's senators, Dianne Feinstein.

HEADLINE: Christie's Cuts Costs as Art Market Slows

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
When works by the British artist Damien Hirst sold for a record $127 million on the same day in September that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection, it seemed the art market might escape the economic crisis. 
 But a string of disappointing auctions over the last four months showed that the art market had no such immunity, prompting Christie's International, the large auction house, to start a cost-reduction effort on Monday that will include job cuts. 
 ''We have begun to implement a companywide reorganization, which includes significant staff reductions, not renewing many consultants' contracts and the continuation of other cost-reduction initiatives, that will ensure we remain competitive and profitable in 2009,'' Christie's said in a statement on Monday, without saying how many positions might be cut or giving any further details.
 In the last months, auction prices dropped together with financial markets, ending a decade-long boom in the art market that was buoyed by record bonuses paid to financial executives. 
 Lehman plans to sell about $8 million in artwork to help pay its creditors, but if a recent auction by the bank's former chief executive and his wife is anything to go by, it might be a challenge to attract buyers as many still wait for bigger bargains. Richard S. Fuld Jr. and his wife, Kathy, sold 16 drawings for $13.5 million through Christie's in November in New York, below the $15 million low estimate.
 Christie's reorganization is the first at the London-based auction house since 2001, when the end of the dot.com boom eroded investors' appetite for art auctions. 
 Its rival, Sotheby's, said in December that it planned to reduce costs by $7 million in 2009 by cutting jobs and salaries, citing an ''uncertain and challenging macroeconomic environment.''
 Initial predictions by some art investors last year that oil-rich Arab countries, Russia, India and China would continue to spend on art, even as the United States and much of Western Europe stumbled into a recession, proved too optimistic.
 A two-day sale of paintings and jewels in Dubai by Christie's in October yielded only about half of what the auction house expected. A sharp drop in the price of oil since its peak in July made the region, identified by Christie's as a growth market, less open to investing in art. 
 At an auction in New York in November, almost a third of the pieces remained unsold, including a self-portrait by Francis Bacon. 
 Christie's, which is preparing a sale of artworks from the collection of the late Yves Saint Laurent and his partner, Pierre Berge, in Paris, is owned by Francois Pinault, the French billionaire who also owns Gucci. 
 The auction house was founded in 1766 by James Christie, whose friendship with craftsmen and artists turned his house into a gathering place for art collectors, dealers and high society. Now, Christie's has 85 offices in 43 countries and employs about 2,100.

HEADLINE: Gulf Oil States Seeking a Lead In Clean Energy

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
With one of the highest per capita carbon footprints in the world, these oil-rich emirates would seem an unlikely place for a green revolution. 
 Gasoline sells for 45 cents a gallon. There is little public transportation and no recycling. Residents drive between air-conditioned apartments and air-conditioned malls, which are lighted 24/7. 
 Still, the region's leaders know energy and money, having built their wealth on oil. They understand that oil is a finite resource, vulnerable to competition from new energy sources. 
 So even as President-elect Barack Obama talks about promoting green jobs as America's route out of recession, gulf states, including the emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, are making a concerted push to become the Silicon Valley of alternative energy. 
 They are aggressively pouring billions of dollars made in the oil fields into new green technologies. They are establishing billion-dollar clean-technology investment funds. And they are putting millions of dollars behind research projects at universities from California to Boston to London, and setting up green research parks at home. 
 ''Abu Dhabi is an oil-exporting country, and we want to become an energy-exporting country, and to do that we need to excel at the newer forms of energy,'' said Khaled Awad, a director of Masdar, a futuristic zero-carbon city and a research park that has an affiliation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that is rising from the desert on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi.
 These are long-term investments in an alternative energy future that neither falling oil prices nor the global downturn seems likely to reverse. Even as the local real estate market is foundering, leaders in politics, business and research from across the globe will flock to this distant kingdom for three days starting Monday for the second World Future Energy Summit, which just one year after its inception here has become something of a Davos gathering on renewable energy. 
 This year's guest list includes a former British prime minister, Tony Blair, and the European Union energy commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, as well as the oil and gas ministers of Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. In attendance will also be executives representing hundreds of companies, large and small, from BP and Credit Suisse to dozens of start-up companies from Europe and the United States. 
 ''Truth is that locally money is tight as everywhere, and the property market is certainly taking a correction downwards,'' said Richard Hease, whose Dubai-based company, Turret Middle East, organized the conference. ''But on the renewable energy front, it is business as usual.''
 This new investment aims to maintain the gulf's dominant position as a global energy supplier, gaining patents from the new technologies and promoting green manufacturing. But if the United States and the European Union have set energy independence from the gulf states as a goal of new renewable energy efforts, they may find they are arriving late at the party. 
 ''The leadership in these breakthrough technologies is a title the U.S. can lose easily,'' said Peter Barker-Homek, chief executive of Taqa, Abu Dhabi's national energy company. ''Here we have low taxes, a young population, accessibility to the world, abundant natural resources and willingness to invest in the seed capital.'' 
 The vision of a renewable future in the gulf is rooted not so much in a fuzzy green sentiment -- though that is starting to take hold -- as in analysis of the region's economic future and the high-end lifestyles of its citizens. 
 ''You see what the gulf states have achieved in terms of modern infrastructure and beautiful architecture, but this has come at a very high environmental price,'' said Mr. Awad of Masdar, standing in a field of 40 types of solar panels that the project's engineers are testing, and using to power offices.
 ''We know we can't continue with this carbon footprint,'' he said. ''We have to change. This is why Abu Dhabi must develop new models -- for the planet, of course, but also so as not to jeopardize Abu Dhabi.''
 The world is now consuming 80 million barrels of oil a day, and that could continue to rise steeply over the coming decades if population and consumption trends continue. That could mean having to add six Saudi Arabias worth of oil output just to keep up, according to Mr. Barker-Homek, at a time when scientists are warning that carbon levels need to be cut significantly to avoid potentially disastrous global warming. 
 To hedge their positions, then, an increasingly sophisticated generation of largely Western-educated leaders in the Middle East are seizing on green business opportunities, by seeding research in faraway nations. 
 The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, announced last January that he would invest $15 billion in renewable energy. That is the same amount that President-elect Obama has proposed investing -- in the entire United States -- ''to catalyze private sector efforts to build a clean energy future.'' 
 Masdar, the model city that will generate no carbon emissions, is tied to the crown prince's ambitions. Designed by Norman Foster, the British architect, it will include a satellite campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a research park with laboratories affiliated with Imperial College London and other institutions. 
 In Saudi Arabia, the new state-owned King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, or Kaust, gave a Stanford scientist $25 million last year to start a research center on how to make the cost of solar power competitive with that of coal. Kaust, now in its first grant cycle, also gave $8 million to a Berkeley researcher developing green concrete. 
 And it has other agreements as well, with Caltech, Cambridge, Cornell, Imperial, La Sapienza, Oxford and Utrecht, to name just a few. 
 In November, the Qatari government signed an agreement with Britain's visiting prime minister, Gordon Brown, to invest $:150 million, or more than $220 million, in a British low-carbon technology fund, dwarfing the fund's investments from home. 
 For the rest of the world, the enormous cash infusion may provide the important boost experts say is needed to get dozens of emerging technologies -- like carbon capture, microsolar and low-carbon aluminum -- over the development hump to make them cost-effective. 
 ''The impact has been enormous,'' said Michael McGehee, the associate professor at Stanford who received the $25 million Saudi grant. ''It has greatly accelerated the development process.'' 
 Director of the largest solar cell research group in the world, Professor McGehee had tried and failed to get money from the United States government or American industries to commercialize cheaper solar cells. Research money is tight, he noted.
 With the Saudi money he has hired 16 new researchers and expects the new energy cells to dominate the market by 2015. ''People are astonished to see how big this grant is and where it came from,'' he said, noting that his past grants from the United States government were one-fiftieth that amount. 
 Experts say the vast investments from the gulf states have already restarted stalled environmental technologies. 
 Nancy Tuor, vice chairwoman of CH2M Hill, the Canadian construction firm that is building Masdar city, said that the sheer size of the investment had had a ''forcing effect,'' pushing polluting industries to experiment with cleaner solutions.
 For example, initial plans for Masdar excluded both aluminum and conventional concrete because the production of those materials generates high levels of carbon emissions, which warm the planet. Aluminum manufacturers protested and came back with a product that reduced emissions by 90 percent compared with regular aluminum; it is now included in the project. 
 Proponents say Masdar goes beyond creating new materials and is in fact exploring a new model for urban life. Masdar will use one quarter of the energy of a conventional city its size (about 50,000 people) -- an amount that it will produce itself. 
 ''When people think about sustainability, they think about devices,'' said Gerard Evenden, a partner at Foster and Partners, the British architectural firm that is designing the site. ''But here you're taking it to a city scale, which has much more of an impact -- connecting the devices to the structure to the transportation to the people.'' 
 The city will have no cars; people will move around using driverless electric vehicles that move on a subterranean level. The air-conditioning will be solar powered. 
 With no industrial history, the gulf states say they have the advantage of starting from scratch in developing green manufacturing; countries like the United States are forced to retool ailing industries, like car manufacturing. 
 Also, although the gulf states have previously showed little interest in green energy like wind or solar, they have another advantage, Mr. Awad noted as he stood in the shimmering desert. ''The sun shines 365 days a year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Missing in Inaction

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
INTRODUCED (NOT) ON SATURDAY 2010 Mercedes-Benz E-Class.
 IS IT REAL? Not until its official global introduction occurs in March at the Geneva auto show. The bread-and-butter sedan in the Mercedes-Benz lineup was unofficially introduced in Detroit at an off-site -- but on-the-record -- unveiling. This was done to take advantage of the motoring press herd gathered at the Detroit show, without jeopardizing Geneva's bragging rights to call it a global debut. 
 WHAT THEY SAID ''With more than 20 new or further technical developments, this saloon further consolidates the leading position of Mercedes-Benz in the luxury class,'' the press materials said (using the European word for sedan,'' not a drinking establishment on wheels).
 WHAT THEY DIDN'T SAY Though still a luxury class powerhouse, Mercedes is feeling the heat from the competition, particularly BMW, Audi and Lexus. This E-Class needs to put to rest past issues with reliability and unimpressive fuel economy.
 WHAT MAKES IT TICK? When it goes on sale in the United States, only two engines will be initially available: a 268-horsepower V-6 in the E350 and a V-8 with 382 horsepower in the E550. In other markets buyers will also be able to choose from a wide range of 4 and 6-cylinder diesels.
 HOW MUCH, HOW SOON? Pricing is an unlisted number until it goes on sale this spring in Europe and this summer in the United States. A 50-state-legal E350 Bluetec diesel arrives next year and the E63 V-8 screamer will break cover late in 2009. Overall, expect to shell out a bit more than the current base price range of $52,500-$89,000.
 HOW'S IT LOOK? The grille evokes the sleek ConceptFascination wagon shown recently; the rest is disconcertingly Lexuslike.

HEADLINE: In Madoff, A Court Trusts

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
''Is Madoff here yet?''
 ''Where's Bernie?''
 ''Do you think he's going to jail today?''
 A scrum of 20 photographers gathered in the January chill on Monday morning outside the courthouse on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan, waiting to know if Bernard L. Madoff, accused in a Ponzi scheme extraordinaire, would have his bail revoked and be sent to jail.
 They had come to catch a glimpse of the supervillain of the financial crisis, each hoping to get ''the last shot of him before he gets hauled away,'' as one photographer put it. Another team of photographers was camped outside of Mr. Madoff's apartment building on East 64th to catch him as he left for the courthouse. 
 By now, you probably know what happened: Mr. Madoff never left home. And he did not go to jail, either. He is probably lounging around his living room watching repeats of ''SportsCenter'' on his flat-panel television. 
 Ronald L. Ellis, the federal magistrate judge, had promised to make his ruling by noon, and a few minutes after 12 o'clock, the news arrived that Mr. Madoff would not be remanded. 
 Despite Mr. Madoff's sending 16 watches -- including diamond-encrusted timepieces from Tiffany and Cartier -- 4 diamond brooches and an emerald ring to family and friends, and having 100 signed checks worth $173 million in his desk ready to be sent, Judge Ellis decided that Mr. Madoff could remain under house arrest.
 Mr. Madoff's investors are fuming. The authorities say that he admitted to stealing as much as $50 billion, which, if true, would place him at the top of financial scoundreldom. Mr. Madoff also may have sought to obstruct justice by trying to get rid of whatever valuables remain -- which ostensibly should go to the estate and its victims.
 Someone without Mr. Madoff's bank account surely would be locked up by now. Of course, this has always been the way of the white-collar world -- though Martha Stewart never tried to smuggle jewelry through the mail. Kenneth L. Lay, L. Dennis Kozlowski and Bernard J. Ebbers all remained out on bail until and during their trials by posting millions of dollars in bail. Phillip R. Bennett, the former chief executive of Refco and a British national, was required to post a whopping $50 million to stay out of jail. 
 Welcome to the two-tiered system of justice: one for the super-rich, the other for the rest of us.
 Judge Ellis's explanation is not very satisfying. He says that to be remanded to jail, a defendant must pose a flight risk or be at risk of obstructing justice. Fair enough.
 But he goes on to justify his decision by essentially saying that Mr. Madoff can afford to buy his way out of the pokey. Indeed, as part of Mr. Madoff's house arrest, his wife has agreed to pay for personal security to ''monitor'' him by video 24 hours a day at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars. By doing so, the chances are low that Mr. Madoff will hop a flight to Namibia. (His passport has also been confiscated.) 
 And the judge added a new condition (with another expense) to keep him from trying to obstruct justice: Mr. Madoff will no longer be able to try to transfer assets because all of his valuables will be taken by a security firm and locked in a vault; the items that remain portable and in his apartment will be monitored by another security firm, which is supposed to take an inventory every two weeks.
 All of those services will be paid for by Mrs. Madoff. (Oddly enough, Judge Ellis instructed Mr. Madoff to conduct the initial inventory of assets, which puts the entire idea of monitoring them into question.)
 Judge Ellis clearly understands that people who lost money with Mr. Madoff are outraged. ''The issue at this stage of the criminal proceedings is not whether Madoff has been charged in perhaps the largest Ponzi scheme ever, nor whether Madoff's alleged actions should result in his widespread disapprobation by the public, nor even what is appropriate punishment after conviction,'' he wrote in his opinion. 
 ''The legal issue before the court,'' he continued, ''is whether the government has carried its burden of demonstrating that no condition or combination of conditions can be set that will reasonably assure Madoff's appearance and protect the community from danger.''
 At this point, it appears Mr. Madoff and his lawyer are playing for time. Ira Lee Sorkin, Mr. Madoff's lawyer (and no relation to me), seems to know his client is going to jail; the real question is how long he can prevent it. So far, he's done a good job a convincing the judge that Mr. Madoff can finance his own incarceration -- in a penthouse apartment.
 What is less clear is whether Mr. Madoff is cooperating with the authorities. Mr. Sorkin has waffled on this, at one moment saying that his client was cooperating and at another saying that he, Mr. Sorkin, was cooperating. Mr. Madoff hasn't been indicted in the Ponzi scheme as the investigation continues, and he probably won't for at least another month, if not longer.
 Whatever the case, Mr. Madoff will probably find himself in his living room on the couch for as long as an entire year before he gets officially ''hauled away.'' And the photographers will still be waiting to get the shot.

HEADLINE: Place Your Bets In Priceline's Casino

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY; E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I HAD never booked a hotel room using the ''Name Your Own Price'' feature on Priceline.com. But last month, as I was planning a business trip to San Francisco, I decided to spin the wheel.
 The feature, which accounts for most of the domestic hotel bookings on Priceline.com, works this way: You select a date and a general location in a city, and then choose among price categories, from economy to luxury. 
 Then you put in your bid as a flashy image of the company's advertising pitchman, William Shatner, urges you on. Next comes a screen informing you if your bid is accepted. But only after you have put in your credit card number do you actually see which hotel you have booked. The money is not refundable.
 I booked three hotels on consecutive nights in San Francisco. For the night of Dec. 13, I bid $50 on a ''three-star upscale'' near the airport. For the next night, I bid $100 on a four-star deluxe near Union Square. For the night of Dec. 15, I bid $160 for a four-star deluxe near the airport.
 All three bids were accepted. Here's what I got on successive nights: The perfectly nice Four Points by Sheraton (standard rate $85); the old-style luxury Mark Hopkins Intercontinental on Nob Hill (standard rate $229); and the modern luxury Hyatt Regency near the airport ($199). 
 I probably could have gotten the Four Points and the Hyatt for a little less, but that's part of the game. In their own ways, all three hotels were excellent values.
 Do I recommend the blind-bidding option on Priceline.com? Yes, if you're flexible and if you have done enough research to have a sense of what a hotel in a certain category should actually cost. But you can easily overbid for a hotel that might be had for less elsewhere, including the standard discount booking sites where prices are listed upfront, like Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and even Priceline, which also offers that option.
 Priceline's ''Name Your Own Price'' service is deliberately not marketed to business travelers, said Chris Soder, the president of North American travel for the company. He cited several reasons, including that a reservation was ''absolutely noncancelable.'' (Business travelers typically require more flexibility if plans change).
 Also, hotels depend mightily on business travel revenue. He said that ''business travelers tend to be some of the most valuable customers, the ones who tend to pay more.'' So, he said, hotels were ''not interested in discounting to those customers'' through a blind-bidding service that often offers room rates at discounts of 50 percent or more.
 On the other hand, business travelers and the companies that pay their expenses are becoming far more flexible, resourceful -- and stingy -- in a sour economy. For that reason, many business travelers are behaving more like leisure travelers.
 Online booking sites, which are able to negotiate and design package travel deals that may combine air fare, hotel and car rentals into a single price, are now heavily promoting the benefits of packages. By being part of a package deal, hotels struggling for revenue can offer major discounts without significantly lowering their posted stand-alone rates.
 ''If a hotel lowers their stand-alone price, they condition travelers to expect a lower price'' across the board, said Genevieve Shaw Brown, a senior editor and analyst at Travelocity. ''If they put the discount into a package, it's more opaque.'' 
 Travelers can be misled by ''flight fixation,'' or an obsession with air fares in evaluating the cost of a trip, she said. Actually, Ms. Brown said, citing a recent study by Travelocity, ''hotels are typically the most expensive part'' of a trip -- and the part where negotiated savings are now most readily available.
 As to the blind-bidding option on Priceline.com, I should mention that there is an element of fun in it, just as in most forms of recreational wagering.
 Aware that hotels in New York are quietly lowering prices as demand falls, I decided on Monday to see whether I could score a top luxury hotel in Manhattan. I went to Priceline's ''Name Your Own Price'' section and bid $50 for the arbitrarily chosen night of Jan. 20.
 The site warned me that the ''median price in this niche is $299'' and that my bid had ''small chance'' of being accepted. Ha! The bid was accepted. An unnamed top luxury hotel in Manhattan was willing to sell me a room for $50 (plus $15.93 in taxes).
 I was going to put in my credit card number and see which hotel I had won, but prudence stayed my hand. It occurred to me that it was going to be a little tricky to submit an expense account item listed as ''Hotel wagering: $65.93.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The On the Road column on Tuesday, about blind bidding for hotel rooms on Priceline.com, misstated the results of a $50 bid for a luxury hotel in Manhattan. The bid was not in fact accepted. (Although the computer displayed a total price of $65.93, including taxes, the bid was never reviewed by Manhattan hotels because it was not confirmed with a credit card.)

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Diocese Moves to Shut 14 Schools as Enrollment Slides

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO and WINNIE HU; Ann Farmer, Angela Macropoulos and Mick Meenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Diocese of Brooklyn has proposed closing 14 elementary schools at the end of the current academic year, a plan that would mean that one of the nation's largest Catholic dioceses would have shuttered nearly 40 percent of its grade schools in the past seven years.
 The proposed closings and mergers, announced on Monday, are the latest retrenchment for a school system that was once a bedrock of neighborhood stability, and a magnet for families of many creeds and homelands seeking safe, reliable education at a relatively modest cost.
 The news, passed along at midday to principals of schools from Flushing, Queens, to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, shook students, parents and teachers, many of whom had joined in desperate fund-raising efforts in recent months to avoid the ax. In a well-publicized process that began in September, diocesan officials had been scrutinizing the finances and neighborhood dynamics of its 109 elementary schools to determine which areas might no longer be able to support a school.
 Some accepted the decision with resignation. 
 ''The community has already disappeared,'' said Harry Connell, picking up his grandson Monday at one of the schools proposed for closing, Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Sunset Park, a Brooklyn neighborhood where the population has gradually shifted toward Asian and Hispanic immigrants who have not sent their children to parochial schools in the same numbers as the white residents they have replaced.
 Likening himself to a passenger on the Titanic, Mr. Connell said: ''You've already hit the iceberg, and you're on Deck 3 or 4, and you're just waiting for the lifeboat.''
 The Brooklyn diocese, with 1.5 million Catholics in Brooklyn and Queens, is still the fifth most populous in the United States. But while there are pockets across the country -- some suburbs and parts of the Southwest -- where Catholic education still prospers, schools in urban areas like Brooklyn have heard bad tidings for decades.
 Where its parish schools once anchored the neighborhoods from which they drew students, changing demographics have made filling those schools more difficult. Though many new arrivals in the neighborhoods are Catholic, they tend to be poorer than those who have moved on, and less able to afford the average $3,500 tuition at the diocese's elementary schools, officials say. The presence of public charter schools has also been cited as a factor in the decline of parochial schools.
 As a result, enrollment in the grade schools has dropped to about 35,000 from 55,000 since 1998. While the average vacancy rate is 15 percent, some schools have student gaps of another order: Blessed Sacrament School in Jackson Heights, Queens, one of those slated to close, once had 2,500 pupils; its enrollment today is 180.
 Meanwhile, the cost of running the system has ballooned. Priests and nuns, once the low-cost heart of the instructional corps, have largely been replaced with comparatively high-cost lay teachers.
 Diocesan officials emphasized that the proposed closings were still under review and would not be made final until the end of February by Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio, who is scheduled to hold meetings with parents and then with school administrators.
 Officials were reluctant to discuss the impact the closings would have on the faculty. Auxiliary Bishop Frank Caggiano, who is leading the reorganization effort, said that prior school closings have generally led to some job losses, but that ''80 percent of our teachers have been able to find other positions'' in diocesan schools, in part because of retirements.
 The Brooklyn diocese closed 25 schools in 2005, and seven more in the next two years. 
 The new proposals are part of a larger five-year plan, called ''Preserving the Vision,'' that would include new emphasis on fiscal management. A new tax on each parish would raise about $3 million over the five years of the plan -- an amount that would go to offsetting school deficits that routinely approach a total of $1 million a year, and are now made up by subsidies from the diocese.
 Bishop Caggiano said the fiscal stability of the schools was crucial, not only for the obvious reasons but for the long-term prospects of Catholic education. 
 ''If you know that a school is going to be here, is on solid footing for the future, you are far more likely to enroll your child in that school,'' he said. 
 But on Monday, many whose schools were slated to close found little consolation in that.
 ''We fought hard for this school,'' said Rachel Connolly, president of the parent association at Our Lady of Angels school in Bay Ridge. ''My husband's whole family went here -- generation after generation of his family went through this building.''
 Mrs. Connolly wiped tears from her face as she stood outside, waiting to pick up her two children after hearing the news. She dialed another mother to deliver the news. ''Guess what,'' she said into the phone. ''They're closing our school.''
 Just inside the front door of the school, hanging on a wall outside the main office, was a large facsimile of a check for $40,000, donations raised by parents and their friends in a golf outing.
 Ledy Sanders, a home health aide who has managed to scrape up the $3,000 yearly tuition at Flatbush Catholic Academy in Brooklyn for her son Varni, 10 -- ''plus $200 a month for after-school'' -- expressed anger and shock when she learned that the school would be closing. ''Oh my God, oh my God, why can't they do something?'' she said. 
 She would not send her son to the local public school, which she said was plagued with ''too much teasing and fighting.'' But she said she would need time to figure out what to do.
 Similar closings have occurred recently in the Archdiocese of New York -- which has shut 15 schools since 2007 and is looking at additional closings this year -- as well as in New Jersey and Long Island dioceses. 
 Among parents interviewed on Monday, the distress over the possible loss of a child's place in a particular school was compounded by a sense of the community bonds that would be torn. Many said that the closings would ''hurt the neighborhood,'' or that their children would be separated from schoolmates with whom they had grown up.
 At some of the schools on the closing list, teachers and pupils were seen crying and holding one another for support as they left. ''We're in a state of terrible shock,'' said Debbie Dagiau, a parent at Blessed Sacrament.
 Like many parents yesterday, Ms. Dagiau said she was displeased with the way the information was conveyed to parents. ''The kids were handed envelopes with letters in them at the end of the day with no knowledge of what was in them,'' she said. 
 The plan for the reorganization began a year ago when Bishop DiMarzio, who took over the diocese in 2003, convened a committee of diocesan officials to create a communion of schools in which he said every school would be ''vital, enduring, and excellent.''
 The underlying mission, officials said, was to stop the hemorrhaging.
 ''When we determined that our schools are operating at only 85 percent of capacity, it became clear that we had to consider why this was happening and how we might reverse the trend,'' Bishop DiMarzio said in a statement on Monday.
 Diocesan administrators, including Bishop Caggiano, held meetings with parents. At one such meeting in December, attended by parent representatives from all 109 schools, Bishop Caggiano said the diocese was hard pressed to continue paying the bills of parish schools that were not able to meet their expenses. He said an across-the-board 15 percent cut in state aid to schools for mandated services would also cost the diocese dearly this year.
 The diocese's scholarship endowment, which distributes about $12 million a year to students attending the elementary schools, had suffered losses in the recent economic turmoil, Bishop Caggiano said.
 ''We have to find a new paradigm,'' he said.
 In an interview on Monday, Bishop Caggiano said that the new plan calls for creating three ''diocesan mission schools'' in low-income neighborhoods, heavily subsidized by the $3 million parish tax. He said the new lay-administrative boards -- helping each school manage its finances, recruit new students and hire key personnel like principals -- would meanwhile free parish pastors to handle education.
 Three schools will merge with other schools: in Brooklyn, Immaculate Heart of Mary would move into Holy Name; in Flushing, Queens, St. Michael and St. Ann schools would close to consolidate with St. Mary's Nativity.
 Eleven schools will close outright. In Brooklyn, they are Flatbush Catholic Academy, St. Vincent Ferrer, Most Precious Blood, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Our Lady of Angels.
 In Queens, the schools are St. Anthony of Padua, St. Benedict Joseph Labre, St. Catherine of Sienna, St. Aloysius and Blessed Sacrament.
 In the 2010-11 school year, the diocese is recommending that four schools in northern Brooklyn -- Northside Academy, St. Stanislaus Kostka, Saints Joseph and Dominic Academy and St. Nicholas -- be merged, but the number of sites and the new campus have not been determined.

PERSON: Earl Blumenauer 

HEADLINE: A Bicycle Evangelist With the Wind Now at His Back

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
For years, Earl Blumenauer has been on a mission, and now his work is paying off. He can tell by the way some things are deteriorating around here.
 ''People are flying through stop signs on bikes,'' Mr. Blumenauer said. ''We are seeing in Portland bike congestion. You'll see people biking across the river on a pedestrian bridge. They are just chock-a-block.''
 Mr. Blumenauer, a passionate advocate of cycling as a remedy for everything from climate change to obesity, represents most of Portland in Congress, where he is the founder and proprietor of the 180 (plus or minus)-member Congressional Bicycle Caucus. Long regarded in some quarters as quixotic, the caucus has come into its own as hard times, climate concerns, gyrating gas prices and worries about fitness turn people away from their cars and toward their bikes.
 ''We have been flogging this bicycle thing for 20 years,'' said Mr. Blumenauer, a Democrat. ''All of a sudden it's hot.'' 
 But Mr. Blumenauer's goals are larger than putting Americans on two wheels. He seeks to create what he calls a more sustainable society, including wiser use of energy, farming that improves the land rather than degrades it, an end to taxpayer subsidies for unwise development -- and a transportation infrastructure that looks beyond the car.
 For him, the global financial collapse is ''perhaps the best opportunity we will ever see'' to build environmental sustainability into the nation's infrastructure, with urban streetcar systems, bike and pedestrian paths, more efficient energy transmission and conversion of the federal government's 600,000-vehicle fleet to use alternate fuels.
 ''These are things that three years ago were unimaginable,'' he said. ''And if they were imaginable, we could not afford them. Well, now when all the experts agree that we will be lucky if we stabilize the economy in a couple of years, when there is great concern about the consequences of the collapse of the domestic auto producers, gee, these are things that are actually reasonable and affordable.'' 
 All this might still be pie-in-the-sky were it not for one of Mr. Blumenauer's fellow biking enthusiasts, Representative James L. Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, avid cyclist and chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has jurisdiction over surface transportation. 
 ''He's been wonderful,'' Mr. Oberstar said of his Oregon colleague. And as support for cycling grows, he said, builders, the highway construction lobby and others have stopped regarding biking as a ''nuisance'' and started thinking about how they can do business. 
 With an eye on the potential stimulus package, cycling advocates ''have compiled a list of $2 billion of projects that can be under construction in 90 days,'' Mr. Oberstar said, adding that prospects are ''bright.'' 
 In addition, after many attempts, this fall Mr. Blumenauer saw Congress approve his proposal to extend the tax breaks offered for employee parking to employers who encourage biking. The measure, which Mr. Blumenauer called a matter of ''bicycle parity,'' was part of a bailout bill. 
 Mr. Blumenauer has spent a lot of time on another issue that ordinarily draws little attention: the federally subsidized flood insurance program. The program serves people who own property along coasts and rivers who otherwise would pay enormous premiums for private flood insurance, if they could obtain it at all. 
 The insurance ''subsidized people to live in places where nature repeatedly showed they weren't wanted,'' he said. They might be better off if they did not live there, he said, but ''it's un-American to say, 'Get out.' '' Politicians who should confront the problem ''are betting Nimto, not in my term of office,'' he said. They hope that disasters will spare their districts or, if they strike, that the government will come to the rescue, Mr. Blumenauer said. 
 A Portland native, Mr. Blumenauer, 60, has spent his adult life in elective office. He graduated from Lewis and Clark College in 1970 (after organizing an unsuccessful 1969 campaign to lower the state's voting age to 18) and worked until 1977 as assistant to the president of Portland State University. In 1972, he won a seat in the Oregon House of Representatives. He moved to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners in 1978, and from there, in 1986, he won election to the Portland City Council. Though he lost a mayoral election in 1992, he easily won election to the United States House in 1996 and has not faced serious opposition since. 
 Mr. Blumenauer entered Congress just after Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker, killed a stopgap spending measure, shutting down much of the government, out of pique over his treatment on Air Force One. ''Partisan tensions were very raw,'' Mr. Blumenauer said. The bicycle caucus was ''a way to bring people together.'' 
 Sherwood Boehlert, a Republican and fellow bicyclist who represented upstate New York in Congress until 2007, agreed. When ''partisanship was at an all-time high and tolerance of another point of view was at a longtime low,'' he wore the bike caucus's plastic bicycle lapel pin. ''Bicycling unites people regardless of party affiliation,'' he said.
 In addition to bicycles, Mr. Blumenauer is particularly interested in public broadcasting and the plight of pollinators like honeybees. He is a founder of a ''livable communities task force'' whose goal, he said, is to educate members of Congress and their staffs on the benefits of transportation alternatives, open space, sustainability, vibrant downtowns, affordable housing and transparency in government.
 Initially, he said, these interests marked him as ''kind of left coast.'' Not anymore. ''They are becoming very mainstream,'' said Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat who represents in Congress the area around Pasadena, Calif., and who, with Mr. Blumenauer's bicycle advice, now regularly rides to work from his home in Maryland. ''He has been way out in front of the Congress,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''Now the rest of us are trying to catch up.'' 
 When Mr. Blumenauer is in his Portland district, he usually gets around by bike, cycling about 20 miles in a typical day. He has three bikes in Washington and five here, and he cycles in all weather, even in the unusual snow Portland has had recently. ''In falling snow you can get some traction,'' he said.
 But the surge of bicycling in Portland has not been free of incident. The Oregonian newspaper and bloggers have reported on ''bike rage,'' drunken biking, hit-and-run bicycle accidents and other problems. Drivers complain about bikers who ignore traffic rules or hog narrow roads, phenomena some irritated motorists attribute to feelings of entitlement or moral superiority. 
 Mr. Blumenauer brushes off this criticism. ''They are burning calories, not fossil fuel, they are taking up much less space, they are seeing the world at 10 miles per hour instead of 20 or 30,'' he said. ''And even though there are occasionally cranky or rude cyclists, they are no greater a percentage than cranky or rude motorists.''
 Plus, he added, ''they have really fought for their place on the asphalt.''

HEADLINE: Honda Unveils a Cheaper Hybrid Challenger to Toyota's Top-Selling Prius

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Toyota Prius, which currently dominates the American hybrid car market, will face its most serious challenger this year.
 Honda is showing its new Insight hybrid, which looks remarkably similar to the Prius, at this week's North American International Auto Show. It is smaller and less fuel efficient than the Prius, but it is expected to sell for as little as $18,000, about $4,000 less than the Prius.
 ''It's the first direct competitor to the Prius,'' said Tom Libby, senior director of industry analysis at the Power Information Network of J. D. Power & Associates. ''And it's from Honda, so I think it's going to be a major success.'' 
 But Toyota is countering with an improved version of the Prius, which became one of the top-selling vehicles in 2008. Toyota on Monday said the third-generation Prius will average 50 miles per gallon, a 4 mile improvement. The Insight will go an estimated 40 miles per gallon in the city and 43 on the highway.
 Toyota also unveiled the first hybrid-only sedan for its Lexus luxury division, aimed at consumers who viewed a Prius as too basic and underpowered.
 The Ford Motor Company plans to build hybrid versions of its midsize Ford Fusion and Mercury Milan sedans. The Fusion is rated at 41 miles per gallon in city driving, one mile better than the Insight, but will have a price of at least $27,270. 
 Detroit's hybrids, so far, have not developed anywhere near the following of the Prius, which accounted for 75 percent of the American hybrid market last year. 
 Large hybrid vehicles made by General Motors and Chrysler have not sold well, leading Chrysler to eliminate its hybrid full-size sport utility vehicles after only a few months this year.
 Honda also has had difficulty making inroads with hybrids. The company discontinued its original Insight -- a car often likened to an upside-down bathtub -- in 2006 and stopped building the hybrid version of its popular Accord sedan two years ago because of low sales.
 One reason is the price of those vehicles, which generally cost several thousand dollars more than a gasoline-only version of the same model. Only when gas prices surged to more than $4 a gallon last summer did most hybrids begin to make financial sense for many people. Now that gas costs less than $2 a gallon, sales of hybrids have cooled.
 One reason for the popularity of the Prius is its unique body style, which many drivers appear to like because it sends a clear signal to others about what they are driving. Many other hybrids are indistinguishable from gas-only models, save for a small logo on the vehicle.
 Now Honda thinks it can succeed with a similar look and an advantage in price. The Insight will be the least-expensive hybrid vehicle in the United States, and it will face off against the Prius, which is the most fuel-efficient vehicle sold in this country.
 ''Toyota, to their credit, made it a fashionable thing,'' John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda, said in an interview. ''Insight was designed to make hybrid technology more affordable to consumers than it is today. It doesn't carry the high-price stigma that hybrids normally carry.''
 Publicly, at least, Toyota officials do not claim to be concerned about the rival to the Prius. They said Toyota expected to sell 180,000 Prius cars in the first 12 months, 13 percent more than it sold in 2008 and double Honda's goal for the Insight.
 ''I think it's going to help us expand overall consideration for hybrids,'' James E. Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales in the United States, said of the Insight.
 But analysts say Toyota will have to work harder this year to fight for its share of a smaller market.
 ''I don't think having a competitor that's so close in shape and abilities and is undercutting it by several thousands in any way helps Prius sales,'' said Aaron Bragman, an automotive marketing research analyst with IHS Global Insight. ''Cost of ownership is much more important to most people than saving a few more miles a gallon. Right now people are so price sensitive for vehicles.''
 While much of the attention at this year's Detroit show has been focused on electric vehicles that are still several years away, Toyota insists hybrids are not merely a passing fad, regardless of gas prices. It plans to offer a hybrid version of every model it makes by the decade beginning in the year 2020.
 ''We're committed to hybrid as our core powertrain,'' Mr. Lentz said. ''We think it's the most versatile powertrain we can have going forward.''
 Mr. Libby of J. D. Power said that the Prius was still hard to find in some parts of the country. He expects that to still be the case even after the Insight arrives at dealers in April.
 ''There are enough people out there who want to make a statement that they are environmentally conscious to make those vehicles successful,'' he said.

HEADLINE: McGwire Made Choices; Hall Voters Make Theirs

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The public shunning of Mark McGwire continues.
On a day when Rickey Henderson and Jim Rice were voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, maybe it sounds vindictive to dwell upon the rejection of McGwire for the third consecutive year, but he brought it on himself.
The country is taking a look at people who played us for suckers. We may as well include athletes in the scrutiny. 
McGwire was turned down again even though he is eighth in the career standings with 583 home runs. Normally, that total would be enough to get anybody elected to the Hall, but times have not been normal since players' shoulders began merging with their enlarged craniums back in the mid-90's.
Since retiring after the 2001 season, McGwire has become the canary in the coal mine for Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Roger Clemens, all of whom are set to become eligible in 2013.
Come to think of it, Bonds and Sosa may be wise to find some team that needs an immobile designated hitter, to postpone their reckoning with the hangin' jury of baseball writers, who vote for inclusion into the Hall.
That entire generation will be under suspicion for a very long time. McGwire did it to himself in 1998 when Steve Wilstein, then with The Associated Press, noticed a bottle of pills of something called androstenedione in McGwire's locker. The curious reporter discovered it was an over-the-counter body-building substance, a form of anabolic steroid banned in other sports.
At first, McGwire blustered and made it a privacy issue, which it was not, since the bottle was in plain view. After he set the single-season home run record -- now surpassed by Bonds -- McGwire announced that he had stopped taking the stuff because he did not want to set a bad example for the youth of America, a noble sentiment, however tardy. Even more tardy, baseball ultimately banned andro.
McGwire would have been fine with his gesture of getting off the stuff, except that his old Bash Brother, Jose Canseco, wrote a book saying he and McGwire used to inject each other with steroids in Oakland. That brought McGwire to a Congressional hearing on March 17, 2005, along with Canseco and Sosa, plus Rafael Palmeiro, who denied all with a wag of his finger, and Curt Schilling, who knew nothing, nothing.
--
The biggest loser of the day was McGwire, who turned red and had tears in his eyes as he repeatedly told questioners, ''I'm not here to talk about the past.'' An educated man, he seemed to know what he was doing, but he blundered on. One committee member asked if McGwire was pleading the Fifth Amendment, the way mobsters used to do. Another threatened to take McGwire's name down from a five-mile section of interstate in St. Louis.
That hearing still plays like an endless loop in people's minds -- one of the most embarrassing public moments any prominent athlete has ever endured. The eight members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox were too unsophisticated to comprehend the consequences of being permanently barred for their roles in throwing the World Series. Pete Rose was far too much of an addicted gambler to understand what he was doing to himself when he denied betting on baseball.
McGwire has not been ruled ineligible for the Hall the way Shoeless Joe Jackson of the Black Sox and Rose have been. I have no vote because The New York Times has a sensible policy of not allowing reporters to vote for awards, but I would have voted for Henderson, and probably for Rice, but definitely not for McGwire, who received 23.5 percent of the vote in 2007 and 23.6 last year and slipped to 21.9 this year. Players need 75 percent of the vote to be elected.
Tony La Russa, who managed McGwire in Oakland and St. Louis, still supports him for the Hall, saying McGwire was ''overcoached'' for that 2005 appearance. McGwire, who lives quietly in California, could still reveal exactly what he used, and when he used it. It's his only way out.
I could also make the point that McGwire was a somewhat one-dimensional ballplayer who swatted a lot of home runs in an age when everybody else did. I might lump Sosa with McGwire, as a symptom of the times, despite Sosa's 609 home runs.
Clemens was a great pitcher, but I would not vote for him because of growing suspicion that he was dirty. Federal prosecutors have convened a grand jury in Washington to investigate whether Clemens committed perjury last February when he denied ever using performance-enhancing drugs.
Bonds may yet be judged guilty of perjury and tax evasion, but was a great player, even without illegal help from a laboratory. However, if I had a vote, I would hold off on him, just because.
The funny thing is that while Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame have disqualified Jackson and Rose, the decision on the steroid generation is left to the 500-plus voters from the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
--
In a terrible economic time for traditional journalism, the print writers who actually witness games and interview baseball people are still entrusted with this decision. A few knuckleheads occasionally decline to vote for Rickey Henderson or Tom Seaver or Joe DiMaggio, but they are the keepers of a flickering flame.
When the time comes, I expect many writers will vote with their suspicions about Sosa, Clemens and Bonds, the same way they overwhelmingly declined to vote for McGwire. It is his own fault.

A sign of the dynamic times? An acknowledgement that its formula was starting to show a little age? Whatever the reason, the producers of ''America Idol'' say the show will showcase fewer of the obviously untalented aspirants who dominate each season's early episodes. PAGE C1
HOLLYWOOD HONORS THE OFFBEAT
With Hollywood studios scaling back or scuttling their indie divisions, the Golden Globes became a showcase for far-flung, independent cinema, like ''Slumdog Millionaire'' and ''Happy-Go-Lucky.'' PAGE C1
RACE AND THE MEDIA: A COMEDY
Young Jean Lee, a Korean-American playwright, consciously set herself the uncomfortable task of creating what she calls a black identity-politics show. That may sound heavy and intimidating, but Charles Isherwood writes that the result, ''The Shipment,'' is a send-up of media caricatures, as hilarious as it is smart, and would offend only the humorless.

Niall Ferguson, the best-selling author and scholar, adapts ''The Ascent of Money,'' his recent book about financial history, to PBS for a two-hour documentary of the same name.

MAPPING THE OCEAN'S MINUTIAE
With Its Deepest Mysteries
Dr. Sylvia A. Earle has participated in more than a half-century of ocean exploration and protection. She has done pioneering research on algae, probed the ecology of coral reefs and is an author of ''Ocean: An Illustrated Atlas,'' published recently by National Geographic. Its maps and graphs, prose and pictures detail the sea's deepest mysteries. PAGE D1
BOOK STIRS VACCINE MOVEMENT
''Autism's False Prophets,'' a new book that defends vaccines, is written by the doctor Paul A. Offit, who is infuriated by the claim that they cause autism. The book is galvanizing a backlash against the antivaccine movement in the United States. ''When Jonas Salk invented polio vaccine, he was a hero -- and I'm a terrorist?'' he jokes, but there will be no book tour because he has had too many death threats. PAGE D1
LITTLE BOTTLE OF ANTI-LOVE POTION
Can you imagine a love potion? In the new issue of Nature, the neuroscientist Larry Young, who analyzed the genetics of romance, predicts that it won't be long before a pharmaceutical love potion exists. But the really good news, according to John Tierney, is that we might reverse-engineer an anti-love potion. Could any discovery be more welcome? PAGE D1

HEADLINE: Top Officer Urges Limit On Mission Of Military

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday that senior officers must work to prevent the militarization of American foreign policy, and he urged generals and admirals to tell civilian leaders when they believed the armed forces should not take the lead in carrying out policies overseas. 
 Adm. Mike Mullen, who as chairman is the nation's highest-ranking military officer, also called for more money and personnel to be devoted to the civilian agencies responsible for diplomacy and overseas economic development.
 The military is engaged in deep soul-searching over the proper role of the armed forces in foreign policy. The debate has been inspired by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have forced the military to take on responsibilities far beyond combat, including tasks like economic reconstruction and political development that are often described as ''nation building.''
 ''Our military is flexible, well funded, designed to take risk,'' Admiral Mullen said in a speech at an evening ceremony of the Nixon Center, a Washington policy institute. ''We respond well to orders from civilian authorities.''
 Because of those traits, Admiral Mullen said, the military receives vast resources -- and then is asked to do even more.
 ''I believe we should be more willing to break this cycle, and say when armed forces may not always be the best choice to take the lead,'' he said. ''We must be just as bold in providing options when they don't involve our participation or our leadership, or even when those options aren't popular.''
 American national security and foreign policy requires ''a whole-of-government approach to solving modern problems,'' Admiral Mullen said. ''And we need to reallocate roles and resources in a way that places our military as an equal among many in government -- as an enabler, a true partner.''
 Admiral Mullen's tour as chairman will continue into the new administration, and President-elect Barack Obama has asked the current defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, to stay on. Admiral Mullen's speech was wholly in sync with remarks made by Mr. Gates, who has delivered a series of talks, remarkable for a Pentagon chief, calling for more resources for civilian agencies responsible for American ''soft power,'' including the Departments of State, Justice, Commerce and Agriculture.
 Admiral Mullen acknowledged that the nation had ''reached for the military hammer in the toolbox of foreign policy fairly often.'' But he underscored a lesson learned during his time in uniform, dating to the Vietnam War, which he described as ''an acute understanding of the finite application of force abroad -- as well as its impact at home.''
 Admiral Mullen also offered a rule for proper behavior among senior military officers, both in active duty and retirement. He commended those senior military leaders who ''provide strong opinions to leaders in private, when it counts,'' but he said generals and admirals should ''maintain purity from partisanship once their time in service is over.''
 In the spring of 2006, as the war in Iraq risked spiraling into civil war, a group of retired officers openly called for firing Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in what became known as ''the generals' revolt.''

HEADLINE: A Sense of Who We Are

 BODY:
A scene from the last days of the Bush administration: On a snowy afternoon last weekend, a church in New York City is filled to bursting with more than 1,000 people. Parents holding babies, teenagers, old men and women with heavy coats and canes. They murmur and shout in prayer, a keyboard and guitar carrying their voices to the height of the vaulted ceiling. 
 The music has a deafening buoyancy, but as congregants step forward to speak, their testimony is heavy with foreboding and sorrow. They tell of families terrorized and split apart. 
 A young woman from Pakistan describes humiliating conditions at a detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where she was sent with her mother and ailing father. A mother tells of her son, an Army sergeant and citizen, losing his wife to deportation. A Mexican man, with theatrical defiance, waves a shoe at the unnamed forces that have thwarted his desire to legalize.
 It is hard to appear sinister in a church, and the congregation at Iglesia La Sinagoga, a center of Pentecostalism on 125th Street in East Harlem, seemed utterly ordinary. But as undocumented immigrants and their loved ones, they are the main targets of the Bush administration's immigration war. 
 Families like theirs have endured a relentless campaign of intimidation and expulsion, organized at the top levels of the federal government and haphazardly delegated to state and local governments.
 The campaign has been disproportionate and cruel. The evidence is everywhere.
 On Monday, The Times reported that federal immigration prosecutions had soared in the last five years, overloading federal courts with misdemeanor cases of illegal border crossers, who are tried and sentenced in groups of 40 to 60 for efficiency. At the same time, prosecutions for weapons, organized crime, public corruption and drugs have plummeted. The Arizona attorney general called the situation ''a national abdication by the Justice Department.''
 And last week, Attorney General Michael Mukasey, in an appalling last-minute ruling, declared that immigrants do not have the constitutional right to a lawyer in a deportation hearing and thus have no right to appeal on the grounds of bad legal representation. Mr. Mukasey overturned a decades-old practice designed to ensure robust constitutional protection for immigrants -- one needed now more than ever in the days of the Bush administration's assembly-line prosecutions.
 The event at the Pentecostal church was organized by local ministers and Democratic politicians to spur the cause of immigration reform this year.
 It could be a difficult case to make. We heard far too little about the need for immigration reform from President-elect Barack Obama during the general election -- and virtually nothing from the nation's leaders since then. But the United States cannot afford to put immigration on a back burner and merely continue with the existing enforcement regime. The costs are too high for the country's values. And they are too high for the economy. 
 Defending immigrants' rights defends standards in all workplaces. Workers who are terrorized into submission, in families that are destroyed by deportation and raids, are more likely to undercut other workers by tolerating low pay and miserable job conditions. 
 Restoring proportionality and good sense to the criminal justice system also would free up resources for fighting serious crimes. Most important, repairing a system warped by political priorities into hunting down and punishing the wrong people -- like those bringing their suffering to a Pentecostal church -- would help restore a sense of what the country stands for, and remind us of who we are.

HEADLINE: All Roads May Lead Here, but They Aren't Bringing Big Spenders

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
On a recent chilly afternoon, Andrea Eluca was standing outside the Roman Forum dressed as a gladiator. Small groups of tourists passed by and smiled at his leather breastplate, sword and motorcycle helmet festooned with a red broom brush. But none stopped to pose for a picture. 
 Winter is always tough going for gladiators -- or rather ''centurions,'' as Mr. Eluca described himself -- but this season is proving particularly tough. 
 ''The quantity isn't down, but the quality is,'' Mr. Eluca said with a sniffle. ''People are coming, they're just not spending.'' 
 The strong euro and worsening economic crisis have taken their toll on tourism -- even in Rome, where tourists are as reliable as death and taxes, and probably more reliable than people who pay taxes. 
 The number of foreign tourists to Rome and the surrounding Lazio region was off 12 percent in November, compared with the previous November. In the first 11 months of the year, the total number of tourists, from Italy and elsewhere, dropped 5 percent. 
 Returns are not in yet for December, but they are not expected to be stellar, thanks to the poor economy, frequent cancellations and strikes by Alitalia, not to mention the rainy deluge before Christmas that almost put the Tiber out of its banks in the city's historic center. Visits by Americans are expected to be off by 15 percent for December.
 Things were not any better at the Vatican, where the number of visitors to papal audiences dropped by half a million in 2008, to 2.2 million.
 Near the Coliseum, the horse-drawn carriage drivers were glum. ''Business has dropped about 35 to 40 percent compared to three or four years ago,'' said Fabrizio Manzone, who charges between $65 and $135, depending on the route. 
 Tourists ''will all go out for a pizza,'' he said. But when you're trying to save, ''a carriage ride is the first thing you drop from the list.'' 
 Steve Born, vice president for marketing at the tour operator Globus, which offers 33 package vacations to Italy, said business to Italy was off 10 percent in 2008. 
 Things are even worse in high-end tourism. On Via Veneto, la vita is decidedly less dolce these days. 
 At the swanky Excelsior hotel bar, famous for the best martinis in Rome, things were slow on a recent rainy weeknight. When a bartender was asked how things were going, his face dropped nearly to the floor in a neo-realist expression of gloom. 
 The staff had just been informed of layoffs, said the bartender, who declined to give his name because he was not authorized to talk to the press.
 An older man walked in with two well-groomed young women, one wearing a Chanel necklace with two interlocking C's. They ordered drinks and chatted in Russian. 
 ''Russians are the only rich Europeans now,'' the bartender said. ''The Arabs come, and some Spanish, but the Americans hardly ever come anymore.''
 At the Hotel Danieli in Venice, which like the Excelsior is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, workers went on strike on New Year's Eve to protest proposed layoffs. Guests who had signed up for a Champagne and beluga caviar dinner were sent to ring in the new year elsewhere. 
 A spokeswoman for Starwood, Sara Migliore, acknowledged that the company was going through ''an internal restructuring.'' But she declined to comment on reports that it sought to lay off 650 of Starwood's 2,200 workers in Italy, citing continuing labor negotiations.
 But amid crisis comes opportunity. The Excelsior and Danieli are offering rooms for as low as $335 a night.
 Indeed, for those who have money, this is the time to come to Rome. Crowds are more manageable, airfare is cheaper, and shops are offering major sales. 
 Admiring the Pantheon, Ron Weintraub, an American telecommunications consultant based in Ankara, Turkey, had a one-word answer for why he came to Rome: ''Saldi.'' 
 Like retailers elsewhere, Italian shops slash prices every January, but this year they are doing so more aggressively than ever. On the upscale Via Condotti near the Spanish Steps, shops like Gucci and Prada are offering discounts as high as 50 percent. 
 At Gucci on a recent rainy weekday morning, the customers eyeing such items as a leather bomber jacket with a fur collar, reduced 50 percent from the initial price of $4,500, were almost entirely Russian and Japanese.
 Back near the Roman Forum, things were still slow for Mr. Eluca, the centurion. He rubbed his cold hands together and scanned the area for picture-takers. Then his cellphone rang. ''Eh,'' he answered after fetching it from a red bag slung at his side. 
 ''No, Mom, I have a little bit of a cold, but I'll be fine,'' he said. ''Don't worry, I'll be home soon for lunch.''

HEADLINE: Markets Fall on a Losing Day for Banks

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A bad day on Wall Street was an even worse one for America's largest banks.
Shares of Citigroup fell 17 percent on Monday as investors reacted to reports that the bank was trying to sell its prized brokerage house. Bank of America fell 12 percent and Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase all finished lower than the wider stock market, which fell about 2 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average slid 125.21 points, or 1.46 percent, to finish at 8,473.97 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 20.09 points, or 2.26 percent, to 870.26. The technology-heavy Nasdaq fell 32.80 points, or 2.09 percent, to 1,538.79. 
The losses occurred as investors braced for what is likely to be a grim earnings season. The aluminum maker Alcoa, which fell 6.9 percent on Monday to close at $10.06 a share, announced after the markets closed that it lost $1.19 billion in the quarter, partly because of lower metals prices.
Companies including Wal-Mart and Intel have issued earnings warnings and lowered their outlooks for this year.
''Everyone accepts that the fourth-quarter earnings are going to be miserable -- that's a given,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. ''Really, what has investors nervous is, where are we going to create demand globally? How are we going to create traction in the global economy?''
Market analysts are paying close attention to President-elect Barack Obama's plans for a $775 billion stimulus package of tax cuts and spending proposals.
The sell-off on Monday compounded Wall Street's losses from last week and erased nearly all the gains from a holiday rally.
Analysts said that soaring unemployment rates and other signs that the recession could drag on all year had revived a sense of gloom on Wall Street. Investors looking for safety bought long-term government debt. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 25/32, to 112 20/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 2.30 percent, down from 2.39 percent late Friday.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, an indicator of instability in the markets, rose to 45.84 points on Monday after weeks of declines, indicating that investors may be getting nervous again.
''They just have to see some light at the end of the tunnel, then the market will go up,'' said Brian Gendreau, vice president at ING Investment Management. ''But we're not there yet.''
Companies that produce staples like plastic, metals and agricultural products also fell steeply, and tumbling oil prices dragged energy stocks lower.
Crude oil for February delivery fell $3.24 to $37.59 a barrel in New York, as stockpiles rise and the global demand for oil declines.
Although supply concerns highlighted by tension in the Middle East and production cuts by OPEC touched off a brief rally two weeks ago, analysts said the economic malaise -- highlighted by news that unemployment in the United States had reached 7.2 percent -- now outweighed nearly every other variable.
In New York, a range of energy companies including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Marathon Oil slid lower on oil's declines.
Oil prices are down nearly 75 percent from their July peaks of more than $145 a barrel, reducing gasoline and energy prices for millions of Americans and lowering the cost of production and transportation for companies.
Analysts said oil prices would probably remain volatile through June if the economy stays in a deep and worsening recession.
Following are the results of Monday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: A Dollar General Public Offering?

BYLINE: By LAUREN SILVA and PIERRE BRIANCON

 BODY:
Is it time for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to take Dollar General public? In the face of economic Armageddon, shares in publicly traded dollar stores have had a fabulous year as strapped American consumers have traded down. K.K.R. could ease its investors' pain a little if it took the ultra-discount retailer public now.
K.K.R. paid $7.2 billion for Dollar General in July 2007. The firm wrote a $2.5 billion equity check and borrowed the rest. 
In the year through October last year, Dollar General's annual operating cash flow was $890 million, 40 percent more than in the year before K.K.R.'s purchase.
Say K.K.R. could convince stock market investors that that figure will grow 15 percent this year, to $1 billion.
On the 7.5 valuation multiple that Goldman Sachs projects for the publicly traded rival Dollar Tree at the end of 2009, Dollar General would be worth about $7.5 billion. Subtract the company's current debt of $4.2 billion, and K.K.R.'s equity stake would be worth a third more than it paid.
Of course, with stock markets still jittery, an initial public offering wouldn't be easy. But if any company can attract investors, it's one in Dollar General's line of business. Moreover, private equity investors are clamoring for cash back, and an initial public offering should deliver some.
It would not, however, signal imminent profitable sales of the vast majority of companies languishing in private equity firms' portfolios. Shares of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, another Dollar General competitor, have both surged roughly 80 percent in the last year. Almost all other sectors have plunged in value, making profitable exits unlikely. Even the dollar stores' shares haven't risen much beyond the record highs of 2007, when K.K.R. bought Dollar General at a premium to its market price.
That is one reason K.K.R.'s potential return on the deal, at an annualized 15 percent or so, only scrapes the minimum that private equity barons promised investors. That doesn't bode well for other leveraged buyouts done during the boom. And while it would ease investors' pain, it also isn't enough to save a portfolio that contains several other struggling companies.
VW and Bailouts
Volkswagen has made the wrong kind of headlines lately -- a creeping takeover by Porsche, an absurd share price and the apparently related suicide of Adolf Merckle, the German billionaire. But the German automaker's recent sales figures are proof that the global slump is separating the sheep from the goats in the industry. The company's relative success shouldn't, however, exclude it from industrywide government aid.
VW managed to sell more cars worldwide last year than in 2007, no small feat. It raised its market share in the United States and now sells almost as many cars in China as in its home market, which in turn accounts for less than a fifth of group sales. Its luxury brand, Audi, is the only one of its kind that booked rising sales last year. Its perennial rivals, Mercedes and BMW, both failed to outrun shrinking markets.
VW has distinguished itself from competitors partly with a successful bet on emerging markets -- where it sells a third of its cars. Its Czech Skoda brand is doing well. Attention to both costs and research has allowed VW to deliver new models at carefully pitched price points.
Yet 2009 will not look as healthy if, as expected, emerging markets feel the full blast of the global slump. This may be part of the reason VW has asked the German government to include it in the aid program for the car industry. It wants its credit arm and its bank to benefit from the same loan guarantees that other manufacturers, like the General Motors-owned Opel, will receive.
This may raise some eyebrows in Germany, and liven a debate about the need for a state bailout in the first place. But if its rivals are to get help, VW is right to ask for similar treatment. It shouldn't become the victim of an aid program that would shore up the weak, thereby penalizing the strong.

HEADLINE: Dispute Stalls an Ambitious Upper West Side Conversion

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
It is one of New York's grandest apartment buildings, a blocklong limestone behemoth with a sprawling courtyard and vaulted entries that has been home to the rich and famous since 1908. 
 But today, the Apthorp on the Upper West Side stands as a cautionary tale in messy condo conversions, with ambitious plans that have soured, a bitter dispute among owners and the looming threat of foreclosure. At the moment, the owners cannot even agree on whether, if the case comes to arbitration, to use Orthodox or Conservative rabbis. 
 The management turmoil has created frustration for residents who have spent two years watching neighbors take buyouts or leave because they could not afford the rising rents. Christine O'Neal, a longtime resident, said that as many as half of the building's apartments seem to be empty. 
 ''It's lonely,'' Ms. O'Neal said. ''Even the staff, the elevator men and doormen are nervous. They're all afraid of losing their jobs.''
 Purchased by investors at the height of the real estate boom in 2006, the management's conversion plan appears unrealistic about meeting its sales and revenue goals, one lender is quoted as saying in court documents in the lawsuit between the owners. That lender, Apollo Real Estate Advisors, could begin foreclosure on Thursday if the owners do not resolve their internal dispute, one group of investors says in the court papers.
 By Monday night, lawyers were negotiating a deal that would force one of the owners, Maurice Mann, to surrender management of the building to another, the Feil Organization, people familiar with the negotiations said. 
 ''The negotiations and litigation are ongoing, as they have been ongoing for the past few weeks,'' said Y. David Scharf, a lawyer representing Africa Israel USA, another owner that supports the removal of Mr. Mann. The company is led by Lev Leviev, the chairman and controlling shareholder. 
 By Monday afternoon, Mr. Mann denied that he had given up any management of the building. In court records, he said that he had made progress removing 17 rent-stabilized tenants from the building and that the lenders were just using their troubled businesses as an excuse.
 ''Right now, I am still the general partner of this deal,'' Mr. Mann said. ''I control the Apthorp 100 percent.''
 The original operating agreement for the property required that if problems arose and the board members could not reach unanimous agreement, they would handle the case through arbitration in a rabbinical court, or beth din. But so far, the two sides have been unable to agree on what branch of Judaism they want to hear their case: Mr. Leviev wants an Orthodox panel and Mr. Mann wants a Conservative panel. The sticking point is over which branch would have the greater experience in commercial matters. 
 If the two sides do not reach an agreement by Wednesday, a lawyer for Mr. Leviev says he will ask a State Supreme Court judge to decide what kind of rabbi should arbitrate the case. An Apollo spokeswoman declined to comment.
 The Apthorp was built by the Astor family and modeled after the Pitti Palace in Florence. In more recent years, it has been home to celebrities like Nora Ephron, Rosie O'Donnell, Conan O'Brien and Al Pacino.
 Like many condo projects in New York City, the Apthorp was sold with hopes that it would generate the profits that other coveted buildings had reaped. 
 Mr. Mann, a New York-based landlord, contracted to buy it for $426 million in November 2006. By the next spring, he had attracted Mr. Leviev's company and others, including Ralph Braha, the Feil Organization and Joe Nakash, chairman of Jordache Jeans, to invest.
 Court records show that the owners borrowed a $385 million first mortgage from Anglo Irish Bank. (Public records do not show that Mr. Mann has missed any mortgage payments or had any problems with his first mortgage.) 
 The owners also took out a $135 million second mortgage, known as a mezzanine loan, with Apollo Real Estate Advisors. But that meant buyers would have to pay at least $2,500 a square foot for the owners to cover their costs, according to data tracked by the real estate firm StreetEasy.com. That is considerably more than other buildings in the neighborhood are asking today. 
 But by the time the Apthorp's owners started selling the condos in 2008, the economy had soured. StreetEasy.com says the data shows that no buyers have reached a contract on the building.
 After the sale of the building, Mr. Mann was put in charge of handling the leasing, condo conversion and condo sales at the building. But Mr. Leviev's executives grew concerned about how he was managing the project. On Oct. 6, the owners met to talk about having Mr. Mann resign and perhaps sell the project, court records show. 
 Mr. Leviev's executives decided to sue Mr. Mann in December when they found out that Apollo had rejected Mr. Mann's business plans as ''extremely unrealistic given current market conditions'' and ''lacking backup or basis for some of the projections.'' The lender asked Mr. Mann to submit a new plan by Dec. 7 and gave him a deadline of Dec. 16. 
 In court papers, Mr. Leviev said Mr. Mann had removed so many residents from the project that it could have created concerns with the state attorney general's office for a practice called ''warehousing.'' Mr. Leviev also said Mr. Mann was placing his employees in Apthorp apartments, including some of the penthouses. 
 ''Mann is hell-bent on this path of destruction, and his reckless conduct is destined to result in the lenders refusing to work with the parties in this challenging market, the ultimate foreclosure of the loans, the failure of the condominium conversion,'' those court records say.

HEADLINE: Trade Losses Rise in China, Threatening More Jobs

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
China's exports and imports shrank at an accelerating rate last month, a trend likely to set off more job losses in the country's export-oriented coastal regions. 
 The job losses, in turn, could cause further worries about social stability as millions of unemployed migrant workers return home to interior provinces.
 Train stations across China are already mobbed with workers home early for the Chinese New Year holiday, which does not start until the end of next week.
 Millions of workers have lost their jobs, according to Chinese officials. Others have been given extended furloughs by their employers because there is little work for them. And some workers have resigned from their jobs early to collect their paychecks before an expected wave of bankruptcies in the manufacturing sector over the holidays.
 Measured in dollars, exports were 2.8 percent lower in December than a year earlier, while imports were down 21.3 percent, according to figures released on Tuesday morning by China's customs agency.
 The decline in exports followed a drop of 2.2 percent in November, and was the steepest drop since April 1999. China's trade surplus narrowed slightly, to $39 billion from $40 billion in November. But while China releases its trade figures in dollars, the economic impact of falling exports on the Chinese economy is best seen by converting the figures into China's currency, the yuan. 
 Exports were down 9 percent from a year earlier in yuan -- a jolting deceleration for a country where exports were still growing at an annual rate of nearly 30 percent in the summer of 2007.
 The slowdown mainly reflects slumping demand in China's two biggest export markets, the European Union and the United States. The even steeper decline in imports shows that China is benefiting from lower prices for oil and other commodities, but also suggests that many exporters have cut back purchases of imported components in anticipation of continued weakness in their sales abroad.
 A lack of trade finance has also hurt exports. Chinese suppliers have become more wary of shipping goods on the promises of American retailers and other overseas buyers that they will wire the payments later.
 Exporters are increasingly demanding that overseas buyers obtain letters of credit from banks, and those letters of credit are becoming more expensive and harder to get.

HEADLINE: As an Officer, He Looked Out for Her; Now Both Need Looking After

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Many decades ago, Jerome Britton was on patrol as a police officer in Trinidad when he saw, across the street, a young woman with a baby in her arms and a child clinging to her dress. It was 10 p.m., and they were trying to cross two lanes of traffic.
Mr. Britton, now 68, shined his flashlight, stopped the cars and ushered the woman safely to his side. In a way, she never left. 
''He asked me, do I have more children?'' said Leonora Wilkes, describing the brief exchange of words that were the start of a life together. ''I said, 'I have four more where that came from.' ''
''That did not stop him,'' she said.
Sitting at a small dining table in their apartment on Olinville Avenue in the Bronx on a recent afternoon, Mr. Britton and Ms. Wilkes, also 68, recounted the years between that meeting on a Port of Spain street in 1962 and their life now, as a couple struggling with failing health.
In Trinidad, Ms. Wilkes raised six children, all the offspring of her siblings and other relatives. Mr. Britton often encountered Ms. Wilkes during his patrols after that first meeting.
''I kept on seeing her when she was walking in my jurisdiction,'' Mr. Britton said. ''I used to check on her to see everything was all right.''
Their acquaintance grew. She met his family, and he met hers. One day, Ms. Wilkes's father asked Mr. Britton what his intentions were. ''I love your daughter,'' he said he told Ms. Wilkes's father. ''I can't do anything for her now, but as soon as I am able to provide a home for her, then we will get married.''
It was a hard promise to fulfill on a policeman's salary of about $100 a month. But Mr. Britton eventually bought a rural house for about $1,000. It had a breezy porch and two bedrooms.
They married in 1969. Ms. Wilkes, who kept her name, sewed her own wedding dress: light blue satin lining, white lace on top, three-quarter sleeves, a fishtail train. ''I looked good in it,'' said Ms. Wilkes, as a smile crept across her face at the memory.
But they met economic difficulties. Mr. Britton got in touch with an aunt who lived in the Bronx, and a few years later they moved to New York City. Mr. Britton found work in a meat-packing plant and as a limousine driver. She did domestic odd jobs.
But the bills kept coming, as Ms. Wilkes puts it, and their health has failed in recent years, making it hard for them to care for themselves, and each other.
Ms. Wilkes had a stroke in 2006, is blind in her left eye and struggles with diabetes and complications from a slipped disc. She has tried to care for Mr. Britton, who also had a stroke and has sarcoidosis, a disease that affects the immune system, leaving him unable to function independently.
They receive home care from the Bronx Caregiver Respite Program, part of the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged. JASA is a member agency of the U.J.A.-Federation of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
In July, JASA used $300 from the Neediest Cases Fund for an air-conditioner that helped relieve symptoms complicated by sweltering weather. ''A lifesaver,'' Ms. Wilkes said.
They live on $189 in food stamps and about $1,000 in Social Security, barely meeting bills that include $800 in monthly rent. The caregiver program helped them apply for Medicare and Medicaid, and an aide prepares meals and helps them dress. Ms. Wilkes's niece Patricia helps out.
Mr. Britton and Ms. Wilkes finish each other's sentences and fill in each other's gaps in memory. When Mr. Britton says they have been together since 1969, when they married, Ms. Wilkes gently corrects him: They have been together since 1962, the year they met.
''I was a stand-up person at that time,'' Mr. Britton said of his youth, mustering his humor. ''Now I am a lie-down person. I can't stand on my own anymore.''

HEADLINE: In the Wrong Job? Monster.com Wants Your Attention

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
THERE are 11.1 million unemployed people in the United States, and the unemployment rate is at a 16-year high.
 Those are bleak numbers. But as it tries to appeal to job seekers in a new advertising campaign, Monster Worldwide, the parent company of the employment Web site Monster, decided to use a humorous touch.
 ''We did a lot of homework, we talked to people about what their mood was and about what their aspirations were,'' said John Osborn, the chief executive of BBDO New York, part of the Omnicom Group, which created the campaign.
 They found that people wanted humor, even in a cheerless economy. 
 In one television spot, a construction worker clings to a beam, crying and whimpering; the camera then pans up to show he is only a few feet off the ground. In another, a crew of emergency medical technicians jumps out of an ambulance as heroic music plays. They run to a car accident -- and an E.M.T. faints. 
 ''Are you in the right job?'' the ads ask.
 It is a high-profile campaign that promotes Monster's redesigned Web site. Ads began running during the Golden Globes on Sunday, and are scheduled during the Super Bowl and the January season premiere of ''Lost.''
 With the ads and the redesigned site, Monster is trying to attract not only the unemployed, but also people who currently have jobs, which it calls ''passive seekers.'' That's because Monster is paid when employers list jobs and when they contact a candidate. The more resumes employers like, the more revenue Monster should get.
 ''That passive seeker, if you think about it, a lot of passive seekers are the best candidates,'' said Ted Gilvar, Monster's chief global marketing officer.
 Monster has added three features to the site, based on the 40 million resumes it has collected in its nine years in business, that are intended to attract passive seekers.
 One presents profiles of jobs, called Career Snapshots. Enter ''fire ranger,'' and users can review duties (direct crews during forest fires, ensure fire-regulation compliance at campsites); the rate of job growth in the industry from 2006 to 2012 (12.1 percent) and the number of similar jobs posted on Monster (more than 1,000).
 The second is called Career Benchmarking. Users enter information about their career, education, salary and benefits and see how they compare with others in their field.
 The third is called Career Mapping. Users enter a starting job and an ending job, and Monster plots how other people who have made that transition have done it. To go from nanny to spy, for instance, one suggested path is nanny, to youth behavioral counselor, to probation officer, to police officer, to intelligence analyst/security specialist, to intelligence analyst/imagery.
 Monster lists relevant and available jobs on the pages showing those tools, in the hopes that passive seekers will click on them and submit a resume. 
 ''It's a typical funnel. The more people you draw at the top, the more people come through,'' Mr. Gilvar said. ''This notion of dislodging the passive seeker is an attractive thing.''
 Monster's job postings have fallen because of the economy, Mr. Gilvar said, though employers were still hiring in areas like information technology, manufacturing and health care.
 ''If the economy turns, our postings will begin to turn,'' he said.
 With this campaign, Monster's advertising spending in the United States will be higher this year than last, when it introduced a rebranding effort and a new tagline, ''Your calling is calling.''
 ''Before that, it was very transactional,'' Mr. Gilvar said. ''We broadened the aperture to try to be as emotionally compelling as we could.'' 
 The most expensive ad in the campaign, which is not yet finished, is intended for the Super Bowl, where 30-second spots cost up to $3 million.
 ''Basically, if you stop and think about the degree we've changed, for the company, we needed a big stage to do that. There isn't another stage in the advertising world that replicates the Super Bowl,'' Mr. Gilvar said.
 Monster's biggest rival, CareerBuilder.com, is running two Super Bowl spots. Michael Erwin, a CareerBuilder spokesman, said that CareerBuilder's ads would be funny, and he was not worried about Monster's ads. ''We come from a similar industry, but what we offer job seekers is a different experience than what they would get at Monster,'' he said.
 Though having similar companies pitch similar services during the Super Bowl could confuse viewers, Mr. Gilvar said he thought Monster's ad would stand out. Mr. Gilvar also said that Monster had become an official sponsor of the N.F.L. in November. As part of its deal with the league, it will run a spot during the Super Bowl promoting an N.F.L.-Monster contest in addition to its other 30-second ad. Monster would not give details on the contest. 
 While Mr. Gilvar declined to give details on the Super Bowl ad, he did say it would be humorous. Before BBDO designed the ad, executives at Monster and the agency researched whether people had different expectations of Super Bowl ads given the economy, asking about what they wanted to see, and found that people just wanted to laugh.
 The entire campaign features humor, even in print ads aimed at employers running in human-resources magazines -- not quite havens for comedy. Lines in the ads include, ''Our new Web site is so easy to use it will make the glue stick seem intellectually challenging,'' and, ''It's like online dating without that awkward kiss good-night.''
 ''We talk a lot about that, sort of, is that appropriate for a business environment?'' Mr. Gilvar said. ''Our feeling is, employers are people too.''
 Monster is devoting about 40 percent of its budget to online advertising, split between search and display ads. 
 The new campaign, and the redesigned Web sites, are in 24 of the 53 countries where Monster does business. Globally, Monster's advertising spending for the year will be a little lower than in 2008.
 The media plan is different in each country. In the Netherlands, for instance, radio ads perform particularly well, while in ''some of our smaller markets, there's no way you could ever afford television,'' Mr. Gilvar said.
 Still, the television ads are created to work around the world. They feature little speaking, and include a six-second graphic at the end so Monster can promote the site and its features in a particular language. BBDO can lengthen or adapt that segment.
 ''It's our desire to make sure these spots can travel,'' Mr. Osborn said. ''The limited use of dialogue, and the visual aspect to the campaign, will allow us to adapt them to global markets quite easily.''
 Mr. Osborn said that although the spots were not inspirational per se, he hoped they caused people to think about their ideal careers. ''People could use some betterment, especially in a time like this,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Celebrate 30 Years of Diplomatic Ties

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
They waxed nostalgic about secret negotiations in Beijing, a cold war alliance against the former Soviet Union, and the first visit to the United States by Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader. 
 They mentioned some touchy issues, including tensions over Taiwan and Tibet.
 But in the end, the American and Chinese leaders who gave speech after speech in Beijing on Monday afternoon chose to focus on China's stunning economic growth and its place in the world today, and how that might be different had relations between Washington and Beijing taken another course 30 years ago.
 ''There is no more important diplomatic relationship in the world than the one that has grown between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America,'' said Jimmy Carter, the former American president.
 Mr. Carter's speech opened a two-day conference to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the normalization of relations between the United States and China. Mr. Carter was president when the American government restored diplomatic relations with mainland China on Jan. 1, 1979. Around the same time, Deng adopted a new policy of encouraging economic growth, transforming the Chinese economy into the juggernaut that it is today. Now, the two countries do nearly $400 billion of annual trade. 
 Cross-border capitalism was well represented at the conference: Mary Kay, the American cosmetics maker, is a co-sponsor of the event, and some attendees on Monday received a pink cosmetics bag with bottles of samples.
 The American and Chinese officials who helped engineer China's re-entry into the world were in attendance, sitting at a long table at the front of the room. Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were at the center. 
 On the American side, the names were familiar: Henry A. Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, all former national security advisers, and a handful of other officials and diplomats.
 The Chinese were represented by, among others, Qian Qichen, former vice premier of the Chinese cabinet; Tang Jiaxuan, former foreign minister; and Li Zhaoxing, also a former foreign minister.
 ''In the past three decades, thanks to our joint efforts, the ship of China-U.S. relations has moved forward, braving winds and waves,'' Mr. Qian told those assembled. Mr. Tang mentioned the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, in what was then Yugoslavia, in 1999, and noted differences over Taiwan and Tibet.
 Other officials talked of the entwining of the two nations, citing a range of statistics like 145 pairs of sister cities and 10 percent of undergraduates at Yale University studying Chinese. 
 Mr. Brzezinski gave a laundry list of international problems for which China could help the United States find solutions: the global financial crisis, climate change, Iran's nuclear program, disputes between India and Pakistan and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But at a reception afterward, the Chinese government quietly underscored its own priorities. Prominently placed on a table were piles of government-published books with titles like ''The Historical Status of China's Tibet.''

HEADLINE: Where The Money Is

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
A trillion here, a trillion there ...
 President-elect Barack Obama is warning us to expect trillion-dollar budget deficits ''for years to come.''
 The economy is in a precipitous downturn and no one, on the left or right, is advocating tax increases that would jeopardize a recovery.
 In the meantime, we're spending money as fast as we can: the Troubled Asset Relief Program ($700 billion and counting); Mr. Obama's proposed stimulus program ($800 billion and counting); and important initiatives still to come, like an overhaul of the way we pay for health care. 
 China, which has purchased more than $1 trillion of American debt, is getting antsy. As Keith Bradsher of The Times has reported, the global downturn has prompted Beijing ''to keep more of its money at home, a move that could have painful effects for U.S. borrowers.''
 Mr. Obama has tried to assure the public that his administration will be as careful as possible with its monumental spending, promising to invest wisely and manage the expenditures well. And he has made it clear that he is aware of the minefields that accompany mammoth long-term deficits.
 At some point, however, someone is going to have to talk about raising revenue. The dreaded T-word is going to come up: taxes. 
 Well, there's a good idea floating around that takes its cue from the legendary Willie Sutton. Why not go where the money is?
 The economist Dean Baker is a strong advocate of a financial transactions tax. This would impose a small fee -- ranging up to, say, 0.25 percent -- on the sale or transfer of stocks, bonds and other financial assets, including the seemingly endless variety of exotic financial instruments that have been in the news so much lately.
 According to Mr. Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, the fees would raise a ton of money, perhaps $100 billion or more annually -- money that the government sorely needs.
 But there's another intriguing element to the proposal. While the fees would be a trivial expense for what the general public tends to think of as ordinary traders -- people investing in stocks, bonds or other assets for some reasonable period of time -- they would amount to a much heavier lift for speculators, the folks who bring a manic quality to the markets, who treat it like a casino.
 ''It raises money in a way that comes primarily at the expense of speculation,'' said Mr. Baker. ''The fees would be a considerable expense for someone who is buying futures, or a stock, or any asset at 2 o'clock and then selling it at 3. The more you trade, the more you pay.
 ''For the typical person holding stock, who is planning to hold it for a long period of time, paying the quarter of one percent on a trade is just not that big a deal.''
 The fees, though small, could amount to a big deal for speculators because in addition to the volume of their trades they often make their money on very small margins. Someone who buys an asset and then sells it an hour later at a one percent appreciation might feel quite pleased. He or she would be less pleased at having to pay a quarter-percent fee to purchase the asset in the first place and then another quarter percent to sell it.
 This, according to Mr. Baker, is part of the beauty of the transfer tax; it tends to curb at least some speculation. ''It's a very progressive tax,'' he said, ''that discourages nonproductive activity.''
 A hallmark of the Bush years has been the rampant irresponsibility -- by the White House, Congress and the general public -- when it comes to matters of finance. The costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were placed on credit cards and off the books. Their ultimate overall costs will be in the trillions.
 Incredibly, President Bush and Congress cut taxes in wartime, which is insane.
 Budget deficits and the national debt are streaking toward the moon. And the only remedy anyone has come up with for fending off Great Depression II has been deficit spending on a scale reminiscent of World War II. 
 Excuse me, but did somebody say the baby boomers are about to start retiring?
 Maybe the piper will never have to be paid. Maybe the deficits will someday magically right themselves. Maybe some prosperous future generation will be more than happy to clean up the mess we left behind.
 If none of that is true, we should start looking now for some real money somewhere. A stock transfer tax is not a bad place to start.

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S CLOSING OF GUANTANAMO MAY TAKE A YEAR

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON and HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama plans to issue an executive order on his first full day in office directing the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, people briefed by Obama transition officials said Monday. 
 But experts say it is likely to take many months, perhaps as long as a year, to empty the prison that has drawn international criticism since it received its first prisoners seven years ago this week. One transition official said the new administration expected that it would take several months to transfer some of the remaining 248 prisoners to other countries, decide how to try suspects and deal with the many other legal challenges posed by closing the camp.
 People who have discussed the issues with transition officials in recent weeks said it appeared that the broad outlines of plans for the detention camp were taking shape. They said transition officials appeared committed to ordering an immediate suspension of the Bush administration's military commissions system for trying detainees. 
 In addition, people who have conferred with transition officials said the incoming administration appeared to have rejected a proposal to seek a new law authorizing indefinite detention inside the United States. The Bush administration has insisted that such a measure is necessary to close the Guantanamo camp and bring some detainees to the United States. 
 Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he wants to close the camp. But in an interview on Sunday on ABC, he indicated that the process could take time, saying, ''It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize.'' Closing it within the first 100 days of his administration, he said, would be ''a challenge.'' 
 The president-elect drew criticism from some human rights groups Monday who said his remarks suggested that closing Guantanamo was not among the new administration's highest priorities. But even if the detention camp remains open for months, the decision to address Guantanamo on the day after his inauguration seemed intended to make a symbolic break with some of the most controversial policies of the Bush administration.
 Several national security and legal analysts have argued in recent weeks that Mr. Obama is in a delicate political position after having committed himself to closing the prison. Sarah Mendelson, the author of a report for the Center for Strategic and International Studies on how to close the prison, said Mr. Obama's remarks on Sunday appeared intended to indicate the difficulty of the task, which she said it could take a year to complete. 
 ''I thought he was trying to manage expectations of how quickly those detainees who remain can be sorted into two categories: those who will be released and those who will be prosecuted,'' Ms. Mendelson said.
 Aside from analyzing intelligence and legal filings on each of the remaining detainees, diplomats and legal experts have said the new administration will need to begin an extensive new international effort to resettle as many as 150 or more of the remaining men. Portugal and other European countries have recently broken a long diplomatic standoff, saying they would work with the new administration and might accept some detainees who cannot be sent to their home countries because of concerns about their potential treatment. 
 The transition official, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the plans, said the administration expected to announce its Guantanamo plans next Wednesday.
 Brooke Anderson, a transition spokeswoman, declined to comment on any plans, saying only, ''President-elect Obama has repeatedly said that he believes that the legal framework at Guantanamo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists, and he shares the broad bipartisan belief that Guantanamo should be closed.'' 
 In formulating their policy in recent weeks, Obama transition officials have consulted with a variety of authorities on legal and human rights and with military experts. Several of those experts said the officials had expressed great interest in alternatives to the military commission system, like trying detainees in federal courts, and appeared to have grown hostile to proposals like an indefinite detention law. 
 They also said the transition officials were intensely focused on new international efforts to transfer many of the detainees to other countries.
 Several said the officials appeared concerned that a proposal for a new law authorizing indefinite detention would bring the new administration much of the criticism that has been directed at the Bush administration over Guantanamo. A former military official who was part of a series of briefings at the transition headquarters in Washington said the officials had spoken about the indefinite detention proposal as a way of creating a ''new Guantanamo someplace else.''
 ''That is very much not the desire of the Obama team,'' said the former military official, who insisted on anonymity because of his concerns about how the transition officials would react to public discussion of their comments.
 Catherine Powell, an associate professor of law at Fordham, said transition officials appeared most interested at a meeting last month in showing international critics that they were returning to what they see as traditional American legal values.
 ''They are really looking for tools that we have in our existing system short of creating an indefinite detention system,'' Ms. Powell said.
 Mark P. Denbeaux, a Seton Hall law professor who has been a prominent lawyer for Guantanamo detainees, said that at a briefing he attended with senior officials of the transition last month the officials seemed to have decided to suspend the military commissions immediately.
 ''Their position is they're a complete and utter failure,'' Mr. Denbeaux said. 
 The Pentagon has been pressing ahead with plans to begin a trial on Jan. 26 of one of its high-profile suspects, a Canadian detainee named Omar Khadr. Mr. Khadr's case has drawn wide attention, partly because he was 15 when he was first detained on charges of killing an American soldier in a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. 
 Some human rights groups said Monday that they were alarmed by Mr. Obama's vague timetable and lack of specifics in his remarks Sunday. They said they worried that the administration might yield to pressure to display its toughness in dealing with terrorism in its detention policies. 
 ''The devil is in the details,'' said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, who has been pressing the new administration to publicly commit to immediately close Guantanamo. 
 Mr. Romero said he had grown concerned because transition officials had provided details of their plans for dealing with the economic crisis, but had yet to provide details for how they will close Guantanamo, which has brought worldwide criticism.
 ''Just like we need specifics on an economic recovery package,'' Mr. Romero said, ''we need specifics on a 'justice recovery package.' ''

HEADLINE: Despite Skepticism, Release of $350 Billion More in Federal Bailout Money Gains Favor

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republican and Democratic Senate leaders signaled on Monday that they would support the release of the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund, despite anger among many rank-and-file lawmakers over the Bush administration's management of the program. 
 As Congress prepared to act, regulators directed thousands of banks to provide more information about how they have used the money received through the bailout program, responding to concern that financial institutions were hoarding the cash rather than lending it to businesses and consumers. 
 President-elect Barack Obama said on Monday that like Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, his administration would demand substantially greater oversight of the program.
 President Bush on Monday formally requested the $350 billion from Congress at the urging of Mr. Obama. 
 Under the bailout law, Congress can block the money but only if the House and Senate act to do so. The Senate is expected to vote on the request as early as Thursday. 
 Aides said that Mr. Obama would attend the weekly lunch of Democratic senators at the Capitol on Tuesday, where he was expected to encourage his former colleagues to approve the bailout money as well as discuss details of his proposed $800 billion recovery package. 
 Mr. Obama made calls to a number of senators in both parties Monday, including Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee.
 After a meeting with the president of Mexico on Monday, Mr. Obama said the additional $350 billion would be critical to his efforts to stabilize the economy. 
 ''It is clear that the financial system, although improved from where it was in September, is still fragile, and I felt that it would be irresponsible for me with the first $350 billion already spent, to enter into the administration without any potential ammunition should there be some sort of emergency or weakening of the financial system,'' Mr. Obama said. 
 ''I think many of us have been disappointed with the absence of clarity, the lack of transparency, the failure to track how the money's been spent and the failure to take bold action with respect to areas like housing, consumer credit, so that we can maintain credit,'' he said. 
 In conjunction with Mr. Bush's announcement, Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's designee to be director of the National Economic Council, sent a letter to Congressional leaders, pressing them to approve the funds and promising to overhaul the bailout program, including more oversight and a sweeping new effort to prevent home foreclosures.
 Mr. Summers said the Obama administration would also impose tough conditions on companies receiving aid, including limits on executive pay and shareholder dividends. ''We will ensure that resources are directed to increasing lending and preventing new financial crises and not to enriching shareholders or executives,'' he wrote.
 Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also moved on Monday to reassure critics who had complained that banks were not using the bailout money as intended to increase the flow of credit. 
 The F.D.I.C. directed the 5,100 banks that it regulates to document how they have used government money that they have received. 
 The agency did not spell out or even imply how much of the money that banks receive should go toward new lending, as opposed to building capital reserves or making acquisitions. But in requiring the banks to provide information, the F.D.I.C. went further than any of the other federal regulators to put pressure on lenders. 
 The Senate's approval of the $350 billion would be a big relief for the Obama administration, which is hoping to avoid a messy legislative battle just as the new president takes office. That outcome seemed increasingly likely as some influential senators said they would urge their colleagues to approve the money. 
 ''It's extremely important that we make these dollars available to the new administration so there is as much flexibility as possible to stabilize the financial system,'' Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said. Critics, including an oversight panel, have accused the Bush administration of badly mismanaging the program, in part by not adequately tracking how private banks have used bailout funds. 
 But some lawmakers said the bailout, formally called the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, had accomplished its main goal by preventing a further deterioration of the credit and stock markets. 
 ''Without the first TARP, we may have a Dow at 4,000 right now and the economy in an absolutely free fall,'' Mr. Conrad said.
 But the request for the bailout money is still certain to generate impassioned debate. 
 Mr. Conrad, in an interview, said that the letter from Mr. Summers and the phone call from Mr. Obama had addressed all of his concerns and convinced him that the new administration should be trusted with the $350 billion. But he said other lawmakers could be harder to convince. 
 ''I think it is going to take communications from the president-elect and repeated outreach to my colleagues because people feel so burned by the previous administration's handling of the authority given to them,'' Mr. Conrad said.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he was reluctant to provide the additional money. 
 ''The American people have a lot of questions about how additional funds would be used,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''I would be hard pressed to support additional funding for the TARP without sufficient assurances this money will not be wasted, misspent or simply used for more industry-specific bailouts.'' 
 Some lawmakers, including the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, have said they will oppose disbursing the $350 billion. 
 Other critics, including Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, have expressed a willingness to release the money provided conditions are attached to it. Mr. Frank has drafted a bill that would impose those controls and would also require at least $40 billion of the new money be used for home foreclosure prevention efforts. And in a sign that Mr. Obama's assurances just might not be enough, House Democratic leaders said they would push to approve Mr. Frank's bill this week. 
 Even if the Senate approves the bailout money, the House will have to vote as well. And some Democratic aides said it was difficult to envision approval of the money without Mr. Frank's bill also being adopted. 
 The Treasury Department, under threat of a subpoena, agreed on Monday to turn over to Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, copies of the 10 contracts it had signed with major Wall Street firms under the $700 billion federal bailout program.
 The documents were requested in late October by Mr. Levin, who heads the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
 The companies are American International Group, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, State Street Corporation and Wells Fargo.
 The subcommittee has no plans to make the contracts public, an aide to Mr. Levin said.

HEADLINE: A Cash Machine Runs Low

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For a few brief weeks, it seemed as if Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, was regaining a bit of trust on Wall Street. But on Monday, as the struggling financial giant moved toward a deal with Morgan Stanley for its Smith Barney brokerage unit, all the old demons returned.
 Shares of Citigroup, which had regained their footing after two recent lifelines from Washington, plunged 17 percent, to $5.60, as investors worried that the Morgan Stanley venture was a sign the bank's troubles may again be deepening. 
 The decline brought Citigroup stock back to the lowest level since the government last gave it backing in November, as a broader slump in banking stocks helped drive the Dow Jones industrial average below 8,500.
 Wall Street analysts say they believe regulators are pushing Citigroup to sell its brokerage unit because the company desperately needs capital. Splitting off Smith Barney, analysts say, may not be enough to plug a widening hole at the bank, which has lost an average of nearly $100 million a day in the fourth quarter. After nearly a decade of raking in billions as a global cash machine, Citigroup is expected to report its fifth consecutive quarterly multibillion loss next week.
 Analysts say Mr. Pandit must act quickly to avoid having this latest downward spiral turn into another crisis of confidence, like the one that led the government to inject more than $45 billion into the bank in November to guarantee about $269 billion in illiquid mortgage-related assets. Citigroup is guaranteeing another $37 billion.
 While Citigroup is seen as too big to fail, the use of taxpayer funds to stabilize it and other banks hit by the crisis has come under fire as banks hold onto the capital. On Monday, Lawrence H. Summers, President-elect Barack Obama's top economic adviser, promised to give lawmakers a five-point plan to ensure that the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion bailout fund being sought by Mr. Obama would be used for lending or preventing further crises.
 His pledge came as Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat of Michigan, said he had won an agreement from the Treasury to give Congress copies of the contracts signed by Citigroup and eight other banks that received capital injections from the first part of the bailout fund. Mr. Levin had sought the documents in part to determine what commitments Citigroup made in exchange for government aid.
 With expectations of at least a $10 billion operating loss at Citigroup, regulators sensitive to the politics of the bailout have turned up the pressure on Mr. Pandit to streamline the bank's unwieldy structure and raise fresh capital.
 ''Because the banks haven't been able to raise capital, the government has had to raise it for them,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, an Oppenheimer banking analyst. ''The environment continues to devolve and these assets continue to devalue. As a result, more and more capital is needed to put against these sludgy high-risk assets.''
 Indeed, analysts say it now appears that the government is calling more of the shots. Breaking apart from the banking industry, Citigroup recently reversed its longstanding opposition to a change to the bankruptcy code for troubled mortgage borrowers. 
 Regulators have put pressure on Citigroup to remove its chairman, and shake up its board. Although the board adamantly denies it, there are rumors that Mr. Pandit's own job is on the line.
 Some analysts believe broader organizational changes may be on the way. The government invoked rarely used powers known as the ''systemic risk exception'' when it supported Citigroup last month. This type of open bank assistance is used only for deeply troubled institutions, and some analysts say they believe it could result in the bank selling even more of its divisions. 
 ''What all this is about is the beginnings of a resolution,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing partner of Institutional Risk Analytics. ''The reason we haven't done that with Citi is that it is so big and there is no obvious buyer.''
 Citigroup's consumer and investment banking businesses are both expected to have suffered further losses amid the global economic slump. Just last week, for example, it announced a $1.4 billion pretax charge on loans made to the United States operations of LyondellBasell, the chemical giant that last week filed for bankruptcy.
 While Mr. Pandit has been trying to shore up the bank's finances by shedding billions of dollars of assets, the challenge could hardly come at a worse time. It is difficult to sell assets when the markets remain frozen. The bank could consider cutting back more sharply on lending, but lawmakers are pushing the banking industry to make new loans.
 Now, after endorsing plans to reduce costs but keep Citigroup's global financial supermarket model intact, Mr. Pandit is reversing course by selling part of the bank's Smith Barney brokerage unit to Morgan Stanley. That move will give Citigroup about a $2.5 billion cash payment, and free up capital with a pretax gain of about $10 billion through an accounting maneuver. Citigroup executives say they believe the deal will put the bank on a stronger footing and benefit shareholders, but analysts question whether the move is a sign of the bank's desperation. 
 The renewed concern about Citigroup came as investors drove down the shares of other banks planning to release a stream of negative earnings. As unemployment soars, more consumers are defaulting on their mortgages, credit cards and other loan payments. Trading results during the period were brutal. Banks are also expecting heavy losses on loans made to small businesses and commercial real estate developers. 
 JPMorgan Chase, whose share price fell 4 percent Monday, said it would move up its earnings announcement to Thursday rather than Jan. 21. The KBW Index, which tracks the banking sector, fell 6.1 percent Monday.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Citigroup's increasing need for capital misstated the size of the federal guarantee of the bank's assets. The government has guaranteed about $249 billion in illiquid mortgage-related assets, not $269 billion.

HEADLINE: Mistakes, I've Made a Few, Bush Tells Reporters

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Bush held what he called ''the ultimate exit interview'' on Monday, using the final news conference of his presidency to dispute the idea that the nation's ''moral standing has been damaged'' by his actions and to warn President-elect Barack Obama that, despite the turbulence in the economy, his most urgent priority must be fighting ''an enemy that would like to attack America and Americans again.''
Looking back over the long arc of his turbulent presidency, Mr. Bush was by turns impassioned and defiant, reflective and light-hearted, even as he conceded that some things ''didn't go according to plan.'' He confessed a litany of mistakes, refused to talk about pardons, cautioned the Republican Party to be inclusive and wondered aloud what it would feel like to make coffee for his wife, Laura, at their ranch in Crawford, Tex., on the morning after Mr. Obama takes his place.
He showed flashes of the humor that helped elect him, as when he said -- without offering specifics -- that he intended to get busy quickly after leaving office. 
''I just can't envision myself, you know, with a big straw hat and Hawaiian shirt, sitting on some beach,'' the president said, adding, ''particularly since I quit drinking.''
But the most striking moment of the 47-minute question-and-answer session, by far, was Mr. Bush's rousing defense of his record on fighting terrorism. With human rights advocates accusing his White House of condoning torture and demanding an inquiry into its counterterrorism tactics, the departing president used his platform to admonish reporters, and by extension, his successor and the nation, not to forget the lessons of Sept. 11, 2001, and the climate of fear in which his policies were forged.
''All these debates will matter not if there is another attack on the homeland,'' he said, his voice rising as he leaned over the lectern for effect.
''You remember what it was like right after September the 11th around here?'' he demanded, adding: ''People were saying, 'How come they didn't see it? How come they didn't connect the dots?' Do you remember what the environment was like in Washington? I do.''
Mr. Bush would not address the possibility, widely debated in legal and political circles, that he might issue so-called pre-emptive pardons to counterterrorism agents or administration officials who could face criminal prosecution for a range of activities, including harsh interrogation techniques like waterboarding or the firing of United States attorneys.
''I won't be discussing pardons here,'' he said, cutting off the question. It was the only question he refused to answer.
The last time Mr. Bush took questions from reporters was in Baghdad, where an Iraqi journalist made international headlines by throwing a shoe at him.
The news conference on Monday featured only questions, no shoes, and it will not be the final word from the president. The White House said Mr. Bush would deliver a farewell address on Thursday night on the ''greatest challenges facing the country and what it will take to meet them'' -- a parting shot, in a sense, from a leader who is well aware that historians will debate his policies for decades.
Mr. Bush said he was not certain why he had become so divisive. ''I don't know why they get angry,'' he replied to a question about those who disagreed with his policies so vehemently that it became personal. ''I don't know why they get hostile.'' He added that he had learned not to pay attention.
''I don't see how I can get back home in Texas and look in the mirror and be proud of what I see, if I allowed the loud voices, the loud critics to prevent me from doing what I thought was necessary to protect this country,'' Mr. Bush said.
It has been nearly eight years since Mr. Bush arrived in Washington vowing to be ''a uniter, not a divider,'' with the idea that his presidency would focus on domestic issues like education, Social Security and immigration reform.
He leaves behind two unfinished wars and an economy in turmoil, and the wear and tear of the office shows. At 62, he is grayer and a bit more wrinkled now. Yet Mr. Bush said that he had ''never felt isolated'' during his time in office, and dismissed the idea of the presidency as a burden.
''Even in the darkest moments of Iraq,'' the president said, he and his staff found that there were times ''when we could be light-hearted and support each other.''
Mr. Bush began Monday's news conference by thanking the reporters who covered him, although the relationship has often been tense. He fielded a variety of questions, including whether he would ask Congress to release $350 billion in bailout money -- he later did so, at the request of Mr. Obama -- and why his efforts to bring about a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians had failed.
''I know we have advanced the process,'' he said.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly said that he believes history will be the judge of his presidency, and while he said so again on Monday, he did deliver his own assessment. Four years ago, he was asked if he had made any mistakes during his presidency, and struggled to come up with an answer, a moment that came to define him as unwilling to engage in critical self-analysis.
''Clearly, putting a 'Mission Accomplished' on an aircraft carrier was a mistake,'' Mr. Bush began, referring to the banner displayed during his shipboard speech in May 2003 declaring that major combat operations in Iraq had ended. ''It sent the wrong message,'' he said, adding, ''Obviously, some of my rhetoric has been a mistake.'' Mr. Bush said he had ''thought long and hard'' about Hurricane Katrina, which had become an iconic low point of his years in office. But he did not say what might have been done differently.
He also said, for the first time, that he believed he should have pressed immigration reform -- he had come to office calling it his first priority -- instead of calling for an overhaul of Social Security after the 2004 election.
He predicted Republicans would make a comeback but said he was ''concerned that in the wake of the defeat that the temptation will be to look inward.''
Looking ahead, Mr. Bush has said he intends to write a book and to work on his library and public policy institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
One thing he does not intend to do, he said Monday, is make news.
''When I get out of here, I'm getting off the stage,'' Mr. Bush said, adding, ''I've had my time in the klieg lights.''

HEADLINE: Congress Set To Renew Health Care For Children

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress is poised to give President-elect Barack Obama a quick victory by passing a bill to provide health insurance to millions of low-income children. 
 The House Democratic leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, said the bill, scheduled for a vote in the House this week, was ''very much like'' legislation twice vetoed by President Bush in 2007. Legal authority for the program expires on March 31.
 Congressional Democrats said they had decided to add a major provision allowing states to restore health insurance benefits to legal immigrants under 21, a goal of Hispanic groups since those benefits were terminated in 1996. 
 This part of the bill deals only with legal immigrants. But it could revive the emotional debate over immigration, as many Republicans want to establish stricter verification procedures to prevent illegal immigrants from getting health benefits.
 Under current law, legal immigrants are generally barred from Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program for five years after they enter the United States. The Democrats' proposal would give states the option of covering children and pregnant women, with the federal government subsidizing the costs as usual under both programs. 
 Supporters of the bill said it would cover 10 million children, providing benefits for nearly 4 million who are uninsured, while continuing coverage for 6.6 million youngsters already enrolled. The federal government now spends more than $5 billion a year on the program, and while precise figures are not yet available, the expansion would more than double that cost.
 Experts estimate that 400,000 to 600,000 immigrant children affected by the restrictions could get insurance under the bill.
 ''Children should not be forced to wait five years for health care,'' said Jennifer M. Ng'andu, a health policy specialist at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic rights group. ''Five years is a lifetime to a child.''
 Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican whip, said Republicans had concerns about expanding the program, to immigrants or any other group, before the original purpose of the program was achieved.
 ''The program has not fulfilled its initial mission, to serve children of the working poor,'' Mr. Cantor said in an interview.
 Among children, legal immigrants are less likely than citizens to receive immunizations and routine dental care. Likewise, among women, legal immigrants are less likely to receive prenatal care.
 Leighton C. Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said the five-year wait had harmed children who would become citizens. ''About half of all low-income immigrant children are now uninsured,'' Mr. Ku said. ''Most immigrant children become U.S. citizens. When they grow up, they make contributions to the economy, pay taxes and serve in the military.''
 Aides to Speaker Nancy Pelosi briefed advocacy groups on their plans on Friday.
 ''There were cheers in the room,'' Ms. Ng'andu said. ''It was a joyous moment when we learned that legal immigrant children would be covered.''
 House Democrats are taking their bill directly to the floor, but in the Senate, Democratic leaders plan to work through the Finance Committee, led by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. Mr. Baucus has drafted a bill similar to the House measure. As of late Monday, his proposal did not include benefits for immigrants. 
 But other Democratic senators, like Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, have said that they, like Mr. Obama, want to allow states to cover children who are legal immigrants.
 The new bills, like those vetoed, would be financed by tobacco taxes, including a 61-cent cigarette tax increase, to $1 a pack.

HEADLINE: Unvarnished Conclusions After Covering, and Uncovering, the White House

BYLINE: By GARY J. BASS. 
Gary J. Bass, a Princeton professor, is the author of ''Freedom's Battle: The Origins of Humanitarian Intervention.''

 BODY:
THE INHERITANCE 
 The World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to American Power 
 By David E. Sanger 
 Illustrated. 498 pages. Harmony Books. $26.95. 
 Last Sept. 2, Barack Obama went into the F.B.I. building in Chicago to get a 90-minute secret briefing from Mike McConnell, director of national intelligence, about the world Mr. Obama would face if he won the presidency. As David E. Sanger recounts in ''The Inheritance,'' Mr. McConnell warned Mr. Obama about a sickening range of intractable problems: Al Qaeda's regrouping along the ungoverned border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Iran's headlong progress toward getting nuclear weapons, totalitarian North Korea's expanding nuclear arsenal, Russian belligerence, an overheating planet -- and more. The sensible reaction would have been to walk outside and drop out of the race immediately. 
 Rarely will a president enter office so thoroughly challenged on Day 1 as Mr. Obama. This dazzling and mordantly hilarious book is a history of how we got into this particular ditch. Mr. Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, drops the strict detachment of a daily reporter and lets rip, delivering a withering indictment of his longtime subject: President George W. Bush's foreign policy, which he writes ''has left us less admired by our allies, less feared by our enemies and less capable of convincing the rest of the world that our economic and political model is worthy of emulation.'' 
 After seven years covering Mr. Bush, Mr. Sanger, a shrewd and insightful strategic thinker, is left stunned by ''the president's inexplicable resistance, until the final quarter of his term in office, to changing course.'' Mr. Bush, he says, saw strategic change and negotiation as signs of weakness. This is a Nixon who never went to China.
 These unvarnished conclusions by Mr. Sanger will of course confirm the perfidy that Karl Rove and Bill O'Reilly presume lies in the black hearts of Times reporters. But Mr. Sanger's criticism, the product of extraordinarily diligent reporting, is too hawkish to be easily dismissed by conservatives. He believes in putting brute military power behind diplomacy, wants to win the war in Afghanistan and hates the thought of a nuclear-armed Iran and North Korea.
 Unlike other accounts of Mr. Bush's foreign policy, ''The Inheritance'' is not about Iraq but about the crushing opportunity costs paid elsewhere for that quagmire. With America bogged down in Iraq, a rising China has expanded its global influence. Mr. Sanger reports of the peril from unsecured nuclear arsenals: ''As the situation in Iraq worsened, the post-9/11 efforts to create a multilayered defense against a domestic W.M.D. attack waned.'' 
 The ripples from Iraq go as far as Darfur, Sudan's ravaged western region. According to Mr. Sanger's interviews with senior administration officials, Condoleezza Rice told Mr. Bush, ''I don't think you can invade another Muslim country during this administration, even for the best of reasons.'' 
 The Iraq war hobbled America's ability to threaten North Korea and Iran credibly. Mr. Sanger points out that in 2003, as North Korea kicked out international weapons inspectors and raced to complete the fuel for perhaps six nuclear weapons, the Bush administration was gunning to invade nuclear-free Iraq. 
 ''Had a few other things on our mind,'' said a senior Bush administration official, when Mr. Sanger reminded him that the North Korean crisis was unfolding at the same time. 
 Most directly, Mr. Sanger bats back at the argument made forcefully to him in 2007 by Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, that the administration never shortchanged Afghanistan because of Iraq. Mr. Sanger writes, ''Time and again, Afghanistan -- the country where the 9/11 plot was hatched -- was overshadowed by the war in Iraq.'' 
 When Gen. Dan K. McNeill, commanding NATO forces in Afghanistan, called the White House in the winter of 2008 to ask for about 37,000 more American troops, he was rebuffed. According to Mr. Sanger, crucial Special Forces units, seasoned combat troops and C.I.A. personnel were shuffled over to Iraq, taking pressure off Al Qaeda and the Taliban. New Predator drones were sent to Iraq, not Afghanistan. 
 ''We're simply in a world of limited resources, and those resources are in Iraq,'' a senior administration official told Mr. Sanger. ''Anyone who tells you differently is blowing smoke.'' 
 Mr. Sanger's book is a Woodwardian trove of inside dope. He draws upon his own interviews with Mr. Bush, Ms. Rice, Robert M. Gates, Colin L. Powell, Pervez Musharraf and many more. He offers astonishing details on how the C.I.A. penetrated A. Q. Khan's network of nuclear technology for sale and sabotaged some of Iran's efforts to get nuclear technology. And he has a terrifying chapter in which he describes Pakistan's unsteady efforts to keep Islamist radicals from infiltrating or stealing from its burgeoning nuclear weapons program, bolstered with $100 million of secret American aid. 
 ''The Inheritance'' offers up a painfully long catalog of squandered opportunities. Mr. Sanger slams Mr. Bush for not exploring the post-Sept. 11 possibilities of an alliance of convenience with Iran against Sunni Arab extremists until the end of his second term and notes that in 2005, at a potentially opportune diplomatic moment when Iran had only a few centrifuges to enrich uranium, Mr. Bush was preoccupied with Iraq. 
 Mr. Sanger quotes Christopher R. Hill, the skillful veteran diplomat spearheading the joint American and Asian effort to denuclearize North Korea, on administration hard-liners: ''These'' -- here an epithet unprintable in The New York Times -- ''don't know how to negotiate. Everything is Appomattox. It's just 'Come out with your hands up.' '' 
 Looking forward, Mr. Sanger delivers a series of hard truths. He states bluntly that it may take decades before American troops can leave Afghanistan without risking a Taliban return to power. He reports about a July 2007 American intelligence assessment that Al Qaeda, sheltered in Pakistan, had, in Mr. Sanger's words, ''reorganized its command structure and was once again planning attacks against the United States.'' Unless something big changes, he writes, Iran will get nuclear weapons, which will most likely start Egyptian and Saudi nuclear programs in response. 
 Of course, some of the problems that bedeviled Mr. Bush also confounded other presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Bill Clinton, who failed to stop China, Israel, India and Pakistan from getting nuclear weapons. And Mr. Bush has some achievements to point to: soberly handling China, helping create the six-party talks as a promising framework for future Asian security and upgrading America's commitment to fighting the AIDS pandemic.
 Still, Mr. Bush has taken to citing Harry S. Truman, implying that history will vindicate his legacy in Iraq and beyond. ''The Inheritance'' is a devastatingly effective pre-emptive strike against that.

HEADLINE: Uneasy Times for Blagojevich and His Colleagues

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Malcolm Gay contributed reporting from Springfield, Ill.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
In the long, cold month since his arrest on corruption charges, Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich has lost to resignations his chief of staff, general counsel, state tollway director and a deputy governor. Other aides are actively searching for jobs, and the governor has not appeared at a single meeting of the full staff that remains.
 Outside his 16th-floor office in the glassy downtown state building here, most everyone is avoiding him -- even the elected state officials who work a floor or two below and lawmakers who would ordinarily be holding meetings with his budget staff on the state's troubled fiscal situation. 
 With the State Senate preparing the governor's impeachment trial for later this month, a choking reality has descended on Illinois: Many here are profoundly worried that the trial will mean weeks, maybe longer, of more of the same. More sinking state financial ratings and losses, like the $21 million the state treasurer says the governor's arrest already cost Illinois on one bond deal. No hope of solving -- or really even pondering -- the state's huge and growing deficit or its record level of unpaid bills to day care and health care providers and others. 
 And, in the state office building, where Mr. Blagojevich has long had strained relations with other state officials, there seemed no hope of a shred of collaboration, or, in some cases, even a polite hello.
 ''Reasonable people and reasonable companies don't want to have anything to do with Governor Blagojevich,'' said Lisa Madigan, the attorney general who, like Mr. Blagojevich and most other leaders here, is a Democrat. ''Do you even want to call? What are you going to do? Ask for a tax credit now? What's he going to do now?''
 Though it is hardly unheard of to remain in office while facing accusations of wrongdoing, the circumstances have created a peculiar, bifurcated universe inside the James R. Thompson Center, as the state office building is known. On one floor, the governor has apparently prevailed in his contested effort to appoint Roland W. Burris to the Senate seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama and goes right on issuing daily evidence of his work -- pleas for more screening for cervical cancer, increased radon testing and new money for ramps for the disabled. On many lower floors, meanwhile, state officials openly scoff at his leadership and call, in ever-sharpening terms, for him to resign. 
 ''This image of him still being on the job is just a smoke screen,'' said Daniel W. Hynes, the Illinois comptroller, with offices one floor below the governor's.
 ''There's no communication with the constitutional officers,'' Mr. Hynes said, referring to the state elected officials like himself. And, he added, ''there's no communication with the legislators.'' 
 Opportunities, for instance, for Illinois to gain advantage in Mr. Obama's economic stimulus plan may have fallen by the wayside, some fear, in all the focus here on the governor's scandal, on thousands of salty phone calls intercepted by federal agents, on Mr. Obama's old Senate seat that prosecutors say Mr. Blagojevich was bargaining to sell.
 ''We now have our own in the White House, but they can't read our minds,'' Mr. Hynes said. ''Our governor should be out there pointing out areas where we could use help, but here we are.''
 In fact, on Monday, United States Representative Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois, said he planned to introduce legislation in Washington to further divorce Mr. Blagojevich from whatever stimulus money may be pondered for Illinois; Mr. Kirk wants such money sent to the State Legislature instead of to Mr. Blagojevich's office.
 Here, even mundane, day-to-day co-existence has turned awkward. Trying to come to the office on a recent day, Mr. Hynes was irked, he said, when workers told him to wait to pull into the Thompson Center parking garage because, they said, the governor needed his vehicle ushered through first to avoid members of the news media.
 Another day, Mr. Blagojevich, flanked by aides, bumped into Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn in a 15th-floor hallway. Mr. Blagojevich called out, ''Hey, Pat.'' Mr. Quinn was carrying a portable television-and-radio he had been using to follow the governor's travails. He was so startled that he said nothing in reply.
 Through it all, Mr. Blagojevich, who has proclaimed his innocence to the corruption charges, which have yet to be proved in court or even brought in a formal indictment, has seemed, at least publicly, to ignore his alienated circumstance. In the month since his arrest, he has signed more than a dozen bills, issued 22 pardons (before his arrest, he had granted 115 pardons over six years), and actually showed up to his Thompson Center office more often, say his bewildered building mates, than ever before.
 Lucio Guerrero, the governor's spokesman, said Mr. Blagojevich would press ahead with his agenda -- his annual budget address is expected next month -- and on Wednesday would preside over the swearing-in of the new State Senate.
 ''This isn't only about him,'' Mr. Guerrero said. ''If this drags on, and people refuse to work with the governor, they are responsible. I know the game is politics, but one side suffocating the other isn't going to help Illinois.''
 As to signs that Mr. Blagojevich has overwhelmingly lost support in this state of more than 12 million, and that, in the words of the lieutenant governor, ''nobody will get within 10 feet of him,'' Mr. Guerrero looked to other indicators. He said that the governor had received 400 letters of support since his arrest on Dec. 9, and that there were perhaps less tangible glimmers of hope, too, like thumbs-up signs from passers-by at places like Starbucks.
 Still, there are other intangible but unavoidable signs that Mr. Blagojevich, whose term ends in January 2011, cannot expect to solve much by energetically throwing himself into his work now, even through an impeachment hearing, which some have predicted will result in his removal by Lincoln's birthday, and even as prosecutors prepare an indictment, expected by April.
 So far, legislators known informally as ''budgeteers,'' a group assigned to keep a particular focus on the budget, seem reluctant even to meet with the governor's staff, despite the state's more than $2 billion deficit, sinking revenues and unpaid bills that in December reached more than $4 billion.
 ''It seems that the Blagojevich administration is crumbling, and we're at a point where I'm not really sure it makes any sense to negotiate with him anyway,'' said one of the budget leaders, Representative Gary Hannig, Democrat of Gillespie.
 Mr. Quinn said he had practical worries for the state. Among the most pressing ones was that Mr. Blagojevich, after his arrest, lost his federal security clearance for classified information, including news of a terror threat to the state.
 Mr. Quinn said the scandal had evolved into a giant distraction for state workers, particularly those in the governor's office. 
 ''The place is totally adrift,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''Anybody who rides the elevator up and down this building can see it. It's 'The Wizard of Oz' here. This state is being run by Rod Blagojevich and his criminal defense lawyers.''
 Much misery and mistrust predated Mr. Blagojevich's arrest. Relationships between the governor and many other Illinois officials were never warm; other Democrats saw him as unavailable, insular and uninterested in collaboration -- impressions that seem only to exacerbate his isolation now. 
 In a disputelate last year between workers and Republic Windows and Doors, a Chicago factory that had shut down with little warning to its workers, Mr. Blagojevich announced that he was halting state business with the Bank of America, which was one of the factory's lenders and which some workers blamed for their circumstances. But Mr. Blagojevich failed to consult with or even notify Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer, of his plans, Mr. Giannoulias said, even though Mr. Giannoulias was involved in meetings with Bank of America and representatives for the factory workers. 
 One day after the governor's announcement about Bank of America, he was arrested. His order about the bank was never carried out, Mr. Giannoulias said.
 ''It was dysfunction with him at the helm before, but it's paralyzed now,'' Mr. Giannoulias said. ''We're dealing with the most challenging financial crisis we've had since the Great Depression, and there really is no one at the helm.''

HEADLINE: Advice for Obama on the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Plan to Jump-Start Economy With No Instruction Manual'' (front page, Jan. 10):
 The Obama stimulus plan includes about $150 billion of tax cuts for individuals and families. Despite the fact that our economic problems are due in large part to a $400 billion-a-year decrease in consumer spending, many Congressional Democrats and economists have criticized this part of the stimulus plan because they think that a large portion of the tax cuts will be saved rather than spent. Consequently, they believe that more direct government spending, rather than tax cuts, will provide a better economic stimulus.
 But there may be a way to increase consumer spending, without incurring the risk that tax cuts will be saved, not spent. Instead of distributing tax cuts in cash, or lower payroll deductions, the government could distribute the tax cuts in the form of gift or debit cards.
 These ''gift cards from Uncle Sam'' would be for a stated dollar amount, would be valid only for consumer purchases and would expire if they aren't used by a certain date. Everyone would use the cards, since they either ''use it or lose it.'' With ''gift cards from Uncle Sam,'' overall spending would increase by the exact amount of the tax cut. 
 Andy Rush Scarsdale, N.Y., Jan. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The plan to jump-start the economy should be based on the nation's true economic condition: poverty.
 We are currently a poor nation because we have run ourselves into six deep debts: a federal debt (owed heavily to other nationals); a balance-of-payments debt from buying much more from other nations than we have sold them; personal debt from credit cards and other loans; infrastructure deterioration that must be repaired and replaced; education quality compared with our competitor countries; and most serious, an environmental debt from depleting nature's assets of clean air (without climate-changing gases), clean water, fertile soil, diverse species and a healthy ocean.
 We cannot afford a stimulus package aimed at sending people back to the mall. It must aim at repaying our debts, particularly restoring the environment, rebuilding infrastructure and improving our schools.

 To the Editor:
 I applaud your Jan. 11 editorial ''The Stimulus Debate,'' in which you oppose proposed tax cuts by the coming Obama administration for people making up to $200,000 a year. You do, however, say tax cuts make ''good sense for low- and middle-income Americans.''
 I am a retired journalist and consider myself a middle-income American. Speaking for myself and my wife, we do not need a tax cut. We live modestly on my pension and our Social Security checks. We own our own home and have few debts. And even though, like so many Americans, we have lost a substantial portion of our retirement I.R.A., we have been frugal and lucky. So far we're doing O.K. 
 I absolutely agree with you that ''every dollar spent on a politically expedient tax cut is money that is not spent where it could do more good.'' 
 Do the right thing, Mr. Obama -- and don't worry. We'll support you.
 James Houtrides Brooklyn, Jan. 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your concern with tax cuts in the stimulus package is a distraction. Far more troublesome is the conventional assumption that the recession is a more or less classic business cycle that an infusion of cash through infrastructure projects and tax cuts will turn around. It isn't, and it won't be. 
 The current recession is not cyclical; it is structural, and it is unprecedented. During the 1930s, thousands of factories closed. But their buildings and equipment remained in place and intact, and they could be reactivated to meet World War II mobilization needs. That model no longer exists. 
 Most of the thousands of manufacturing facilities that closed since World War II closed for good. Their equipment was crated and shipped overseas; their buildings are boarded up, their workers laid off. These factories didn't close because of a cyclical shortfall in demand but because they lost their markets to imports. 
 No fiscal stimulus can possibly match the benefits of using low-wage overseas labor for such production. Thus, the hollowed-out manufacturing sector will not be able to create the advertised millions of new jobs. I believe that this structural issue looms larger than who gets what tax cuts.

 To the Editor: 
 Re ''Obama's Biggest Challenge,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Jan. 10):
 Mr. Herbert writes what everyone already knows: ''There is one overriding mission for the incoming Obama administration when it comes to dealing with the economy, and that's putting Americans back to work.''
 But the way that Mr. Herbert and Barack Obama plan to put people back to work is an illusion. Building roads and bridges as well as green technology will not have any meaningful effect on immediate job creation. Jobs will continue to be lost until people start buying houses and automobiles again, and that is not going to happen unless the consumer is motivated to buy.
 The first order of business is to scrap all the bailouts, which are a nonproductive use of taxpayer money. Instead of bailouts, the government should insist that banks start lending again. This can be accomplished with government guarantee of the loans. Such guarantees would be for both the housing and automobile industries. 
 In addition, first-time buyers of houses should get a $10,000 rebate from the government, and those buying hybrid vehicles a $5,000 rebate. Nothing less will get the economy back on track quickly. 
 Paul Schoenbaum Williamsburg, Va., Jan. 10, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I applaud Bob Herbert's column. If President-elect Barack Obama fails to achieve an aggressive program to sustain and expand employment, we are headed for a real domestic disaster. As he put it, we have an economic emergency.
 Mr. Herbert makes the important point that unemployment (and underemployment) creates a vicious cycle, because those who are unemployed must draw on public benefits, including unemployment insurance, food stamps, Medicaid and public assistance. Since the unemployed generally do not pay taxes, the public coffers become strained and depleted.
 One point he did not make, but is very important -- especially since Mr. Obama has already hinted that he may move to curtail Social Security benefits -- is that the unemployed (as well as those who are employed but poorly paid) and their potential employers do not contribute to the Social Security system, thus making that system less secure and providing more excuses for cutting benefits.
 What our country needs is a true full-employment policy, supported by government as employer of last resort if needed, where everyone who wants to work can get a decent job at a living wage. Such a pro-active policy would go a long way to fulfilling individuals' and families' lives as well as securing our promise as the one nation that Mr. Obama so eloquently called upon us to be.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Confidence Surplus,'' by David Brooks, and ''The Obama Gap,'' by Paul Krugman (columns, Jan. 9):
 Yes, the economy is complex and the effects of government actions are unpredictable. But I have carefully read The Times's Op-Ed page and paid attention to events these many years, and the best course of action for President-elect Barack Obama and Congress is very clear: Do what Paul Krugman tells you to do!

HEADLINE: Energy Nominee Shifts His Stance

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Physics met politics at the confirmation hearing Tuesday for Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate scientist chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to head the Department of Energy, and the physics bent a bit, as Dr. Chu backed away slightly from earlier statements he has made -- that gasoline prices should be higher, and that coal was his ''nightmare.'' 
 Dr. Chu, whose last job was director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, answered an array of questions from the Senate committee on Energy and Natural Resources -- about his position on new nuclear reactors (yes, at least for a few plants), offshore drilling (only as part of an energy package) and new coal-burning power plants (a few, until we figure out a better way). He told the lawmakers that ''last year's rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices not only contributed to the recession we are now experiencing, it also put a huge strain on the budgets of families all across America.'' 
 Last September, though, he told The Wall Street Journal, ''Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' At the hearing, responding to a question about that statement, he said, ''What the American family does not want is to pay an increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, for energy costs, both in transportation and keeping their homes warm and lit.''
 The answer is efficiency, using less so that even if the price rises, the bill does not, he said. 
 He also said that coal, which has a wide political constituency, would continue to be used, and that the trick was to convert it to electricity cleanly.
 Dr. Chu, who is 60, got a friendly welcome from the committee, but really warmed up when Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, asked him how plants could be turned into substitutes for petroleum.
 ''Actually, now we're getting to science, I love this,'' he said, to laughter around the room. He said he had supervised research to figure out, ''How do you break those plants down into the kind of sugars these little critters, the yeast and bacteria, can actually use.'' Gene-altered bacteria have been developed to turn sugar into substitutes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, he said. 
 Several senators reiterated the idea that the Energy Department faced terrific scientific challenges, and that a Nobel physicist was the appropriate person to head it. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who introduced him to the committee, referred to him as ''one of the great brilliant thinkers of his generation.'' Around Washington, Dr. Chu draws wide approval for emphasizing energy efficiency and new technology as approaches to the problems of energy prices and global warming. 
 But his science-based frankness sometimes contrasts with ordinary energy politics, which are often more centered on narrower economic interests.
 For example, in a presentation at Berkeley in April 2007, now preserved on YouTube, he declared, ''coal is my worst nightmare,'' words previous energy secretaries would be unlikely to utter.
 ''We have lots of fossil fuel,'' he said in that presentation. ''That's really both good and bad news. We won't run out of energy but there's enough carbon in the ground to really cook us.''
 And he has said frankly that some of the technologies that federal dollars are pursuing would be nice to have, but are not today ready for use, either because they are too expensive to be practical, or not demonstrated to be safe. In this category he puts sequestering the carbon dioxide from power plants, recycling nuclear fuel to reduce its volume and recover unused fuel, and making ethanol from cellulose, which is essentially woody wastes or non-crop plants. 
 In the course of the hearing, the main mission of the department -- making, maintaining and dismantling nuclear weapons, and cleaning up from six decades of nuclear weapon production -- got intermittent mention. According to a report on nuclear weapons spending by Stephen I. Schwartz and sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment, the budget for nuclear weapons in 2008 was over $52 billion. Robert Alvarez, who was a policy advisor to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration, said in an interview that the department is spending about 11 times more money on nuclear weapons than on energy conservation. 
 Dr. Chu's plans for steps that would reduce consumption of oil and electricity may come at an inopportune moment, as consumption is falling anyway, taking pressure off the electric grid and other energy systems. The Energy Information Administraton, which analyzes data for the department, predicted on Tuesday that for 2009, electricity consumption would fall 0.5 percent, and oil product consumption by 2 percent. Dr. Chu faces a variety of conflicting mandates. For example, he said that using more renewable energy was a national priority and thus would require a national electric grid. To help create such a grid, a 2005 law gives the department the authority to designate high-priority corridors, to overrule local objections to new power lines. But Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, complained that the department had designated his entire state, New Jersey, as part of a corridor. Mr. Chu promised to investigate. 
 Another problem is nuclear waste. Dr. Chu repeatedly said that of the carbon-free power generation in this country, 70 percent was nuclear. But Mr. Obama has expressed deep skepticism about the plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the government has worked for 20 years to develop. A solution would have to be found, Dr. Chu said, but construction of new plants should resume now, after a hiatus of 30 years, even before the solution is developed.

HEADLINE: Budget Director Pick Sounds Alarm

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Peter R. Orszag, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for budget director, called for urgent action at his confirmation hearing to ''jump-start the economy out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression'' and said the new administration wanted $775 billion to $800 billion for public works, transportation and other projects. 
 But Mr. Orszag warned the Senate Budget Committee that even without new stimulus spending, the federal budget deficit in the current fiscal year was ''likely to exceed $1 trillion -- more than 8 percent of gross domestic product and the largest in our history with the exception of the Civil War and the two World Wars.''
 And under current policies, the government faces years of red ink -- budget deficits equal to 5 percent of the gross domestic product over the next 5 to 10 years, Mr. Orszag said. The deficit last reached 5 percent of the G.D.P. in 1986 and has not exceeded 4 percent in any year since 1992.
 Mr. Orszag, chosen to be director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, worked closely with members of both parties as director of the Congressional Budget Office from January 2007 to November 2008, and he faced a largely friendly audience on Tuesday. He said he hoped to ''continue that spirit of bipartisanship.''
 Without action by Congress to solve the current slump, he said, ''the gap between how much the economy could produce each year and how much is actually being produced amounts to roughly $1 trillion a year -- an average of about $12,000 a year for a family of four.'' 
 At present, the United States has ''significant maneuvering room'' because it can borrow money at low interest rates, Mr. Orszag said, and ''our debt is viewed as the safest investment in the world.''
 But, he said, if the United States continues to spend beyond its means, ''that perception could shift,'' and that ''could not only trigger a fiscal crisis, but also severely limit our ability to respond flexibly to any future economic difficulties.''
 The principal cause of the nation's long-term budget problems, Mr. Orszag said, is rising health costs. He suggested several steps to increase the efficiency of the health care system: greater use of health information technology, research comparing the effectiveness of different treatments, and new incentives for disease prevention, ''healthy living'' and ''better care rather than more care.'' But he said it might be years before the returns on such investments showed up in a significant way

HEADLINE: A Taste for Breakfast And the Super Bowl

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the term ''grand slam'' is associated with baseball rather than football, the restaurant chain that sells the Grand Slam breakfast -- Denny's -- is becoming a Super Bowl advertiser for the first time.
 The Denny's Corporation is buying commercial time for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl XLIII, to be played on Feb. 1. The ad, scheduled for the third quarter, will be the first work for Denny's from its new creative agency, Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. 
 ''If you want to go on the Super Bowl, with that large audience, you better have something to say,'' said Mark Chmiel, chief marketing officer at Denny's in Spartanburg, S.C.
 The commercial will have a ''consumer offer that is a first ever for sit-down restaurants,'' Mr. Chmiel said, and it reinforces a message that Denny's sells what he described as ''real breakfast'' rather than the ''candy breakfast'' served by competitors.
 Mr. Chmiel declined to discuss further details before the spot appears. The commercial being considered has cowboys as characters; a 15-second spot, with gangster characters, will run in the postgame coverage. 
 Denny's is joining a list of Super Bowl sponsors that includes other newcomers like Pedigree dog food and Teleflora, as well as returnees like Anheuser-Busch InBev, Cars.com, Coca-Cola, GoDaddy.com, Hyundai Motor America, PepsiCo and several movie studios.
 Some marketers that have advertised during the Super Bowl in recent years are skipping this one for financial or other reasons; they include FedEx, Garmin, General Motors and Salesgenie.com.
 NBC, which will present the game, is charging an estimated average of up to $3 million for 30 seconds of ad time during the game. The comparable price tag for the Super Bowl in February 2008, on Fox Broadcasting, was estimated at around $2.7 million.
 ''We think it's worth that money,'' Mr. Chmiel said, because of the size of the audience.
 ''Where else can I hit 97 million people?'' he said, referring to the average viewership for Super Bowl XLII.
 As the new Denny's creative agency, Goodby, Silverstein will replace the Dallas office of Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, after an account review that was limited to those two agencies, Mr. Chmiel said.
 ''They did a very good job with us,'' Mr. Chmiel said of the Publicis ads, but ''creatively we need it a little bit plussed-up.'' 
 Goodby, Silverstein has a long list of Super Bowl credits for advertisers like Anheuser-Busch, Emerald nuts, E*Trade, Frito-Lay and Hyundai.
 ''I like the Super Bowl,'' said Jeff Goodby, co-chairman at Goodby, Silverstein. ''It's TV's last stand.''
 ''You get to act like it's 1955 again,'' he added, when the broadcast networks dominated the medium and everyone stayed tuned for the commercials rather than zapping them with remote controls or zipping through them with TiVos and other digital video recorders.
 Goodby, Silverstein also has experience in creating campaigns for restaurant brands, among them Carl's Jr., Chevys, Pizza Hut and Subway and, in the agency's early days, Mr. Goodby recalled, a California chain named Velvet Turtle.
 That will come in handy, too, as Denny's faces a pair of daunting challenges. First, the breakfast category is more crowded than ever as Denny's confronts not only longtime competitors like IHOP but also fast-food chains like Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's.
 There are millions of people who ''go to quick-service restaurants and eat in the restaurant,'' Mr. Chmiel said. ''That's the Denny's customer, but they sort of forget about us because of the billions of dollars in marketing spent by the quick-service restaurants.''
 To counter the inroads made by the fast feeders, he added, Denny's has introduced a sandwich based on the Grand Slam breakfast called the Grand Slamwich.
 The other challenge for Denny's is, of course, the economy, which is sending home countless consumers who once liked to go out to eat. 
 ''What people dining out less often are looking for is something that really resonates with them,'' Mr. Chmiel said, like value, convenience and tasty menu items.
 Mr. Goodby said he believed that Denny's was ''the sort of down-home American place, not too expensive, that can continue to thrive in this environment.''
 In creating the Super Bowl commercial, Mr. Goodby said, the agency plans to take an entertaining approach, which is ''the right thing'' for the national mood.
 Still, Madison Avenue needs to be sensitive, he said, adding, ''I don't think it would be good to make jokes about people losing their jobs or not having enough money to purchase something.''
 NBC, part of the NBC Universal division of General Electric, had a fast start in selling commercial time during Super Bowl XLIII. The network planned to sell 65 to 67 30-second ad slots in the game and about 80 to 85 percent were taken by September.
 After the financial crisis erupted, however, the pace slowed, and some trade publications speculated about the ability of the network to sell the remaining time at premium prices. In the last month, more advertisers have bought commercials or have come forward to say they are buyers. 
 They include, in addition to Denny's, General Electric, also a first-time advertiser; and the returning advertisers Audi, a division of Volkswagen; CareerBuilder, owned by a consortium of media companies; H & R Block, which will run a commercial by Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies; and Monster.com, part of Monster Worldwide.
 The trade publication Variety last week identified numerous movie studios that planned to be Super Bowl sponsors. Among them are DreamWorks Animation; Paramount, part of Viacom; Sony Pictures, part of the Sony Corporation of America; and Universal, a sibling of NBC.
 The Walt Disney Company and the 20th Century Fox division of the News Corporation may also buy spots, Variety reported.

HEADLINE: An Owner of Towers Walks a Tightrope

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
With Wall Street hemorrhaging jobs and the commercial real estate industry poised to take a big fall, this might not seem the ideal year to be completing a luxury hotel and condominium building near the World Trade Center.
But the $240 million W Hotel and Residences, which is rising on Washington Street, is not the only project that could cause headaches for Joseph Moinian, its developer. One of the largest private real estate magnates in the country, Mr. Moinian is a former garment manufacturer who has amassed more than 20 million square feet of office, residential and industrial space since the early 1990s.
Like many of his peers, Mr. Moinian, 54, expanded his portfolio in recent years by taking advantage of the fierce rivalry among lenders that began in 2005 and ended in mid-2007. That competition led to a rapid escalation in sale prices based on projected rent growth rather than the actual cash flow generated by the buildings.
Using little of his own equity and often investing with partners, Mr. Moinian was able to outbid other potential buyers and secure highly leveraged, interest-only financing for most of the purchase price. When the New York market began to seem overpriced, he bought buildings in other cities. 
Mr. Moinian recently missed part of a mortgage payment for 60 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and later made it up. He is not known to have any delinquent loans.
But some brokers wonder if he and his partners would be willing to pour millions of dollars into various buildings in order to hold onto them. ''Do they want to put good money after bad?'' asked one broker who has worked with Mr. Moinian. (Like other brokers who asked to remain anonymous, he did not want to alienate Mr. Moinian by speaking publicly.)
Realpoint, a credit rating agency in Horsham, Pa., that monitors loans that have been bundled together and sold on Wall Street as commercial mortgage-backed securities, has placed half a dozen Moinian Group loans on its watch list: 60 Madison Avenue and 245 Fifth Avenue, both in Manhattan; the Sears Tower in Chicago; 2100 Ross Avenue in Dallas; and two residential development sites in downtown Los Angeles.
Having several properties on the watch list is not necessarily calamitous, said Frank Innaurato, a Realpoint managing director, ''but it does raise some red flags from a credit concern if multiple loans and properties are showing signs of distress.''
Mr. Moinian, who emigrated from Iran alone at the age of 16, acknowledges that these are tough times, though he said his company was doing fine, given the state of the economy.
''Everybody has to work harder to get through this thunderstorm,'' he said in an interview at his Manhattan headquarters. Like many other borrowers, he is negotiating with his lenders to buy back some of his debt at reduced prices.
For example, Mr. Moinian and his partner Whitehall Street recently bought back at an undisclosed discount the $53 million in mezzanine debt (similar to a second mortgage) on 245 Fifth Avenue that had been issued by Credit Suisse. That acquisition was financed for more than the $190 million purchase price, according to Realpoint.
Mr. Moinian is far from the only real estate executive facing difficulties as office vacancies rise and property values decline. And unlike some companies that flipped properties at a dizzying pace during the go-go years, Mr. Moinian is a long-term holder who rarely sells a building. He has relatively little near-term refinancing risk.
But a $328 million loan from Wachovia, a frequent lender to Mr. Moinian, for 180 Maiden Lane in Manhattan's financial district comes due in November and could be difficult to refinance, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company. ''My guess is that Moinian will have to come up with more equity to get it refinanced,'' he said.
This year, American International Group, the troubled insurance giant, assumed Goldman Sachs's lease for 803,000 square feet, or two-thirds of the Maiden Lane building. Goldman has guaranteed the lease, but a lender may worry that A.I.G. will shed space after the lease expires in 2014, Mr. White said.
Mr. Moinian, who owns a triplex on Park Avenue and an estate in the Hamptons that once belonged to Saul Steinberg, wins praise from brokers as a hands-on developer. But he has also been sued for taking his time to pay his bills.
In a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court in September, a law firm, Greenberg, Trager & Herbst, said it was owed nearly $108,000 in fees in conjunction with several development projects. (Mr. Moinian was asked about the lawsuit last week; on Tuesday, lawyers at Greenberg said the dispute had been resolved.)
Of the investments on Realpoint's watch list, the most prominent is the Sears Tower, the nation's tallest building. Mr. Moinian has a 25 percent stake in the 110-story building, which he and his partners bought in 2004 for $840 million, with $825 million in financing and $40 million in reserve funds.
But many tenants view the building as a potential terrorist target. ''They are losing tenants faster than they are gaining them,'' said Joseph B. Learner, an executive vice president at Studley, a brokerage company. ''They misread the sentiments in the marketplace.'' The building's largest tenant, Ernst & Young, recently decided to give up its 352,000 square feet in 2012.
Just as the market was peaking, Mr. Moinian acquired 2100 Ross Avenue in Dallas for $73 million. But Ernst & Young is also giving up its huge presence in that building, leaving it with a vacancy of 40 percent, said Greg Biggs, an executive director at Cushman & Wakefield of Texas. ''In Dallas, you really have to be careful about your expectations for your returns,'' he said.
Another building that has fallen short of expectations is the International Jewelry Center in Los Angeles, which Mr. Moinian bought in March 2007 for about $144 million. Hit by the economic downturn, some jewelers are fleeing to cheaper buildings, said Peklar Pilavjian, an owner of the nearby St. Vincent Jewelry Center, which caters to the lower end of the market.
Whatever Mr. Moinian's other problems may be, the W Hotel and Residences will turn out fine, said Richard Bassuk, the mortgage broker who arranged the financing for the project. The condominiums were underwritten with an expectation that they would sell for $1,500 a square foot, but instead they have commanded $2,000 a foot, he said. ''There's a lot of room to reduce the price,'' Mr. Bassuk said.
The hotel portion of the project was subsidized with $50 million in tax-exempt Liberty bonds, ''which gives it a very low carrying cost,'' Mr. Bassuk said. But John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting, a national research and hotel advisory firm, said that with the downturn in the economy, the new W hotel will probably struggle to fill rooms initially, though it is a good long-term bet.
Mr. Moinian said his long experience has given him the confidence to meet the current challenges. ''These times will show who loves this business and who doesn't and will separate the real real estate people from the people who are here just to make a little money and run away,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Some States In a Pinch May Raise Gasoline Tax

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
Several states are considering the rare step of raising gasoline taxes to help fill growing budget gaps and potholed roads. 
 Politicians in California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Illinois and Oregon, for example, are introducing bills that would raise gasoline taxes for road and bridge repair, as state legislatures around the country begin their new sessions. 
 In Iowa, top legislators in both houses would support an increase. And in Ohio, a state task force last week recommended raising the gas tax by 13 cents a gallon. 
 There are political risks in raising taxes of any kind, and legislators have been loath to raise their gas taxes, which are imposed in every state but Alaska. In many states, gas taxes have not been raised for more than a decade and they often are not indexed to inflation.
 ''I've opposed virtually every revenue enhancer in terms of tax increases up to this point,'' said John E. Bradley, an Illinois state representative who is chairman of the House Revenue Committee.
 This year, he is introducing a bill with a motor-fuel surcharge of 8 cents a gallon. He was persuaded to change his stance, he said, because of the urgent needs of Illinois roads and highways. 
 State lawmakers clearly see an opportunity to push through a tax. The recent sharp drop in gasoline prices, to less than half of last summer's high of more than $4 a gallon, means that drivers may be less hesitant to pay slightly higher prices. 
 For states, acute revenue shortfalls, combined with years of rising construction costs and a backlog of projects, are forcing difficult choices between raising taxes or imposing drastic cuts. 
 ''Do you cut snowplowing? Do you cut salting roads? Do you cut maintaining and fixing bridges?'' asked Representative David B. Campbell, of New Hampshire, vice chairman of the House Public Works and Highways Committee. He is introducing a bill to raise the state gasoline tax by 15 cents a gallon over three years, which would help close what he says could become a cumulative $1 billion hole in the state Transportation Department's budget over 10 years. The gasoline tax in New Hampshire has not been raised since 1991.
 As of last October, the average state tax was 30 cents a gallon, led by California at 48.7 cents, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
 The federal government also takes a flat 18.4 cents at the pump, a number that has not budged in essentially 16 years. The National Commission on Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing, a federal group that analyzes future highway and transit needs, is expected soon to release a report to Congress that includes a recommendation to raise the federal gasoline tax by 10 cents a gallon. It also will recommend raising the federal tax on diesel fuel. (States have diesel fuel taxes as well.)
 Half of highway funds for states come from state and federal gasoline tax revenues, according to a pending National Governors Association report. (The federal tax is routed through the federal Highway Trust Fund, with about 20 percent of that going to mass transit.) The rest of state highway funds come from a variety of sources, like tolls, vehicle registration fees, bonds and general funds. Compounding the budget problems for states is the fact that people are driving less, in large part because of the weakening economy and last year's high gasoline prices. Last October, Americans traveled 3.5 percent fewer miles, on average, compared with a year earlier, according to the federal Department of Transportation. 
 When people drive less, and buy fuel-efficient cars like the Toyota Prius, they buy less gas, causing gas-tax revenues to fall. In Georgia, for example, motor fuel tax revenues fell 10.4 percent, or $8.8 million, in December 2008 compared with a year earlier.
 Even the federal government has been left short of highway funds. Last fall, Congress provided $8 billion in emergency funds to the Highway Trust Fund, which distributes federal gas tax revenue to the states, because of rising costs and shrinking revenue as Americans drove less.
 States are hoping that President-elect Barack Obama will make good on his promise of huge stimulus spending on roads and bridges. Many states have already submitted wish lists.
 In California, both Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and Democratic lawmakers are prepared to raise the gasoline tax, last directly raised in 1994. But they disagree on the means. The governor's proposal would indirectly raise the tax as part of an overall sales tax increase, for an effective gasoline tax rise of about 3 cents a gallon (which could later rise if fuel prices rise). The proposal by the Democrats, recently rejected by Governor Schwarzenegger, would change the structure of gasoline taxes and result in an increase of 8 to 9 cents a gallon.
 ''It is the first time anybody has talked about this in some time,'' said John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, based in Sacramento.
 In Massachusetts, which still needs to pay off debt from Boston's Big Dig, a debate is under way over whether to impose higher tolls, which Gov. Deval Patrick has said he was willing to support, or higher gasoline taxes, which some state lawmakers are discussing. Governor Patrick has also indicated that he is conditionally open to supporting an increase in gasoline taxes. 
 Naturally, legislators proposing higher gas taxes are certain to face some opposition. ''One of the biggest economic drivers for New Hampshire is tourism, and we feel this may have a negative impact,'' said Timothy G. Sink, president of the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce. 
 He is worried that gas prices could rise again, so the tax would just add to the driver's burden. ''Who's got the crystal ball to tell us what's going to happen in the next two years?'' he said. The chamber has not taken an official position on the tax, he said. 
 And with the advent of more fuel-efficient vehicles -- including hybrids and all-electric cars that some automakers are now promising to bring to market -- some states are rethinking the traditional gas tax. North Carolina and Ohio, among others, are starting to consider the concept of a tax on ''vehicle miles traveled.'' That system has been tried on a small pilot scale in the Portland, Ore., area, but has never been tried on a large scale.

HEADLINE: More Manhattan Shop Windows Are Expected to Be Empty This Year

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
One year into a steep recession and just after the most dismal holiday shopping season in decades, real estate brokers in New York say they expect store closings in the city to rise this year. But, they say, the market for retail space in Manhattan should still fare better than the national market as a whole, especially compared with the suburban shopping malls.
''The national retail scene is a mess, and it is going to impact us,'' said Gene P. Spiegelman, an executive director in Cushman & Wakefield's retail services group. He predicted that demand for space would soften throughout the city's many shopping districts this year, and in fact, landlords in some of the trendiest areas have already begun lowering asking rents. 
Industry experts say they also expect the pace of store closings to pick up in February and March, after retailers have tallied the cost of exchanging unwanted holiday gifts for cash.
A handful of stores have closed in Manhattan in the two weeks since New Year's Eve. Early Saturday morning, for instance, bargain hunters descended on the Steve & Barry's store on the second floor of the Manhattan Mall in Herald Square, where T-shirts, swimsuits and shorts were on sale for $1 each. By noon, the 14,000-square-foot store had been picked bare.
Shoppers who missed this sale could still find deals downstairs, at the KB Toys store on the first floor of the mall. Both of these retail chains declared bankruptcy last year and were in liquidation.
Even chains that are in better financial shape are closing some stores in Manhattan, including Starbucks Coffee Company, Ann Taylor and the Gap. Cutting back underperforming stores is a normal part of the business -- even in happier times -- but retailers may wield the pruning shears more aggressively this year.
Suddenly, retail brokers say, this is shaping up to be one of the best tenants' markets in years.
''Tenants definitely believe that the market has flipped in their favor,'' said Michael J. Hofmann, a senior managing director at Colliers ABR, who represents both tenants and landlords. He said the tenants he was working with were negotiating more aggressively with landlords. Their offers, he said, ''are at levels that we never would have proposed six months ago.''
Landlords have gradually begun lowering asking rents, even in some of the city's most desirable shopping districts. For example, average asking rents fell by 3 percent last year on Madison Avenue, ending the year at $1,057 a square foot annually. And asking rents fell by 5 percent in SoHo, to $263 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
But asking rents are amorphous, said Robert K. Futterman, chief executive of Robert K. Futterman & Associates. ''When a tenant steps up to the plate, that's when you know what a space is really worth,'' he said.
Besides lowering asking rents, brokers say, landlords are offering more concessions, like longer periods of free rent at the beginning of a lease.
Even so, leasing activity in Manhattan has fallen sharply. Retailers signed 32 leases in the fourth quarter, including lease renewals for stores. That was a decline of 33 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
Landlords have also begun negotiating short-term lease extensions with favorable terms for some tenants. ''Savvy landlords are keeping tenants in place, even if it means accepting a rent that they might feel is under market,'' said David LaPierre, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis.
Mr. LaPierre added that this was easier for landlords to do if they had owned a building for several years and were not carrying a lot of debt on it. ''If landlords purchased a building recently, then they have very little margin to play with,'' he said.
Brokers say that in the worst case, a wave of store closings could put space back on the market when many retailers have little desire to open new stores in Manhattan -- no matter how attractive the terms.
Last week, Ann Taylor closed an Ann Taylor Loft store in SoHo. And this month, the Gap will close a Banana Republic store in the West Village. Spokeswomen for both chains said that they currently had no plans for further closings in Manhattan.
Starbucks included five New York stores in a plan that it announced last summer to close hundreds of stores nationwide. Even after the closings, Starbucks will have almost 200 coffee shops on the island.
Circuit City, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year and is in reorganization, recently handed the keys to its only store on the Upper East Side back to the landlord. Although the entrance to this 17,000-square-foot space was at the street level, the store itself is on the lower level of the building at 240 East 86th Street, between Second and Third Avenues. ''It was a challenging space for us,'' said Bill Cimino, a Circuit City spokesman. Circuit City plans to keep its four other stores in Manhattan.
Mr. Futterman is marketing the space in combination with 27,000 square feet of retail space directly above it, on the ground floor and second floor of the building. That upper space is occupied by a Barnes & Noble store, which is planning to move around the corner. Combining both stores would give a retailer about 45,000 square feet.
Last week, one fashion company, KP Fashion, shuttered all three of its New York stores -- in SoHo, in Herald Square and on Fifth Avenue. KP was named for Kira Plastinina, a 16-year-old Russian designer whose stores were bankrolled by her father, a Russian multimillionaire. Her clothing line was aimed at teenagers, and the signature color was pink.
Last weekend, eviction notices had been pushed under the glass door of the Herald Square store, visible to passers-by. At the SoHo store, a video loop of the Russian teenager flashed above a chalkboard with the message ''Out of Business'' scrawled in pink chalk.

HEADLINE: A Climate That Favors Comfort

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
THE West Branch and BarBao opened only about a week and half a dozen blocks apart in late October.
 Over the next months I never ate dinner at the West Branch when it wasn't packed.
 BarBao, on the other hand, had more empty seats than full ones.
 A fluke of the nights I went? Maybe. But I get the strong sense that one of these Upper West Side newcomers is faring appreciably better than the other. And I think the discrepancy may say a lot about which types of restaurants this cruel economy is going to be kinder to, which are in for a less merciful and less certain run, and the fact that quality isn't necessarily the chief determinant.
 Both the West Branch, a mostly Mediterranean brasserie, and BarBao, which interprets Vietnamese cuisine, deserve to make it. While their kitchens aren't consistent enough or their menus quite original enough to brand them destination restaurants, they have real talent in their DNA and bring serious food to a patch of Manhattan that, for all its recent strides, could still use more of it. At a different moment, in a different climate, both could probably count on success. 
 But in this one, merit and good intentions aren't enough. Caution, classics and French fries -- these may matter more. Our next president himself, Barack Obama, perhaps said it best, though back in 2001, when taping a restaurant-related television show in Chicago.
 ''I'm not looking for some fancy presentations or extraordinarily subtle flavors,'' Mr. Obama said, defining his epicurean bent. ''What I'm looking for is food that tastes good for a good price.''
 That's a sensibility perhaps better fed by the West Branch than by BarBao, even though BarBao's cooking is more exciting and slightly more memorable.
 An offshoot of the beloved Upper West Side restaurant Ouest, the West Branch has a ready-made clientele in all the grateful diners who consider the chef Tom Valenti, who runs both establishments, a hero for improving their ZIP code's culinary lot.
 It maintains Mr. Valenti's Franco-Italo inclinations and meaty preoccupations while adjusting to a miserable economy by having lower prices than Ouest's. About half the entrees are less than $20.
 It also has a looser spirit, symbolized by a large TV playing sports events over the front bar. Beyond the bar are a series of rooms that look instantly weathered and utterly familiar, the dark woods, dark booths and distressed mirrors straight out of the pub-cum-brasserie playbook. 
 Approachability is the guiding ethos, manifest as well in raw bar selections, crowd-pleasing salads (Caesar, frisee aux lardons, beets with goat cheese), starchy sides (including, of course, fries) and an overall collection of dishes with an emphasis on comfort foods from the past and present.
 This emphasis tugs the menu beyond the Mediterranean: for example, to Britain (for an excellent fish and chips) and to the Caribbean (for an even better Cuban pork sandwich).
 Like Secession most recently, the West Branch opens up the brasserie format to Italy, taking advantage of the popularity (and affordability) of pasta by putting a half dozen such dishes into play. Only two delighted me, the squash and ham tortelli and the shrimp raviolini.
 Unevenness plagued the whole menu. Among the appetizers a gorgeous lobster salad kept company with an undersauced vitello tonnato, and superb steak tartare was dragged down by insipid duck liver mousse.
 I enjoyed the choucroute garni that accompanied (and rhymed with!) duck confit and the potato salad with the fried quail. But the star of each of those entrees gave the least commanding performance.
 Opt instead for the hearty veal stew or the calf's liver. Know that there are many red wines in the $50-a-bottle range to go with either and that you can finish the night with a generous cookie plate for just $7.
 BARBAO exhibits price-consciousness as well, with only one main course exceeding $25. It teams the owners of the restaurant Rain -- whose space has been redesigned in a less gimmicky, classier vein -- with the chef Michael Bao Huynh, who ran the kitchens at Bao 111, in the East Village, and Mai House, in TriBeCa.
 Although hardly anonymous, Mr. Huynh has a lower profile than Mr. Valenti and doesn't have Mr. Valenti's traction in this part of town. He's also working in a genre less immediately recognizable to his audience.
 Sizzling cuttlefish? Daikon duck hash? A diner spotting these on the menu may not be sure what's in store. And that, coupled with glossy good looks that may tag BarBao as more of a splurge than it is, probably works to its disadvantage.
 Although the wine list is a bit too expensive and the specialty cocktails a bit too sweet, the food at BarBao is more ambitious and nuanced than at the West Branch, and it reflects Mr. Huynh's gift for refracting Asian conceits and ingredients through a contemporary prism.
 The duck hash, combining cubes of rice cake with shredded duck confit and a poached egg, has one foot in the Far East and the other in fatty, gut-busting Momofuku Manhattan. The cuttlefish defers cunningly to many New York diners' Mediterranean sensibilities by coming up with a version of salsa verde that adds Vietnamese mint, Thai basil and yuzu to anchovy.
 It's an excellent dish, and so is a loup de mer entree that floats morels in an unusually light, luxuriant coconut and green curry emulsion. Afterward try the yucca waffle with sweet corn, peanuts and dulce de leche. I'm not sure how it fits ethnically into everything else, but it has the mix of savory and sweet -- and the degree of salt -- that often make a dessert stand out. 
 The argument for BarBao is undercut somewhat by Mr. Huynh's readiness to repeat himself. He has been cooking more than a few of these dishes, or close approximations, for years.
 And in the case of the iron pot chicken and the crispy whole red snapper, which was overcooked, he has done them better.
 But I suspect it's not dry fish but rather larger forces that are keeping diners away. Although BarBao could certainly improve, it deserves more attention and affection than it's getting.

HEADLINE: Sharp Drop In Oil Price Helps Shrink Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Skidding oil prices helped push the United States trade deficit to its lowest point in five years in November as the country imported fewer goods amid a sharp economic slowdown. 
 The gap between the value of imports and exports narrowed to $40.4 billion in November, from $56.7 billion a month earlier, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. That represented a 28.7 percent decline in one month.
 The trade deficit shrank as American consumers clipped their demand for foreign-made consumer goods, and tumbling energy prices slashed the value of imported oil and gas. Petroleum imports dropped 36.5 percent, to $23.6 billion.
 Even excluding energy prices, the so-called core trade deficit narrowed in November.
 Although American exports fell by $8.7 billion between October and November, the losses were marginal compared with the 12 percent, or $25 billion, drop in imports. The United States exported a total of $142.8 billion in goods and services in November and imported $183.2 billion. 
 ''It's still a pretty sizable trade deficit, but it's going in the right direction,'' said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at Barclay's Capital. ''Unfortunately, it comes with a lot of pain.''
 The imbalance with China dropped 17.5 percent, to $23.1 billion, in November, the smallest deficit since June. The decline was fairly broad, including toys, clothing and electronics. 
 The trade deficit through November is at an annual rate of $688.2 billion, down from $700.3 billion a year ago. 
 Over all, trade between the United States and the rest of the world has plunged since the summer as the financial crisis ravaged global markets, deepening the economic downturn. 
 ''Trade flows have been crushed by the credit crunch, which has reduced demand for traded goods and services and made it more difficult for ex- porters and imports to obtain trade finance,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note.

HEADLINE: British Media Company Sells German Holdings

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
An unusual foreign foray into the German newspaper business ended Tuesday when Mecom, a British media investment company, sold its German publications in an effort to reduce its debt.
 Mecom, which is led by a former Fleet Street executive, David Montgomery, said it had sold its German operations to M. DuMont Schauberg, a publisher in Cologne, for 152 million euros, or $204 million. The deal includes Berliner Zeitung and Berliner Kurier, as well as Hamburger Morgenpost and 10 Web sites. 
 When Mecom, in partnership with the private equity firm, Veronis Suhler Stevenson, acquired the Berlin papers in 2005, employees and journalists worried that Mr. Montgomery, who had a reputation for cutting costs in his previous role as chief executive of the Mirror Group in Britain, would do the same in Berlin.
 But analysts said that Mr. Montgomery failed to get the savings that he hoped for from the publications and from the Hamburg paper, which Mecom and Veronis Suhler Stevenson acquired in 2006. Meanwhile, Mecom has focused on building a stable of more than 300 newspapers in Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Ukraine. The acquisition spree has weighed down Mecom's balance sheet with debt.
 Simon Davies, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said Mecom received a good price for the German papers, given that some other newspapers that have recently been shopped around have failed to find buyers at all. Mecom paid Veronis Suhler Stevenson 163 million euros in 2007 when it bought out its 75 percent stake in the German operations.
 ''Ultimately these are attractive brands, and Germany is a consolidating market, where smaller players want to get bigger,'' Mr. Davies said.
 Achieving economies of scale has been difficult for newspaper publishers in Germany because of rules against media consolidation that were imposed after World War II. While German papers have suffered from a recent slump in advertising, readership remains higher than in many other European countries or the United States. German publishers have also kept free papers at bay.
 DuMont Schauberg, which is privately held, owns or controls several German newspapers, including Kolner Stadt-Anzeiger in Cologne, Frankfurter Rundschau and a tabloid called Express. In 2006, it acquired a 25 percent stake in the Haaretz Group of Israel.
 The company declined to detail its plans for the Berlin and Hamburg papers, pending a regulatory review of the deal. 
 Mecom still faces a potential financing squeeze. It has already negotiated a moratorium on banking covenants governing its credit lines, but analysts say sales of additional assets will probably be necessary. Mecom has declined to comment on reports that its Norwegian newspaper group, Edda Media, has attracted the attention of local bidders. 
 Several suitors are also said to be interested in Mecom's 51 percent stake in the company that publishes Rzeczpospolita, a leading Polish daily.
 ''Mecom will continue to concentrate its efforts on the leading market positions it enjoys in its four other territories,'' the company said in a statement.

HEADLINE: For Sale in ... Istanbul

BYLINE: By LISA KEYS

 BODY:
A TWO-BEDROOM FURNISHED PENTHOUSE APARTMENT AT THE POLAT TOWER RESIDENCE IN ISTANBUL
 $800,000
 This 146-square-meter (1,572-square-foot) apartment, on the 26th floor, has city views. There are hardwood floors, two bathrooms (one en-suite with a Jacuzzi) and a modern kitchen. The furnishings, included with the price, is a mix of modern and traditional Turkish styles: crystal chandeliers, Ottoman antiques and a piano. 
 The apartment is in a mixed-use skyscraper in central Istanbul. The 42-story building (with 33 stories of residential apartments) has a fitness center, a 24-hour concierge service, a heliport and a fingerprint security system. The tower was built in 2001. 
 The neighborhood, Fulya, is on the European side of Istanbul -- close to Besiktas Stadium and the high-end shopping area of Nisantasi. The airport is about 10 miles away. 
 MARKET OVERVIEW
 The recent modernization of Istanbul's residences -- along with Turkey's booming economy and the introduction of mortgages in 2007 -- ushered in a property boom, according to Cameron Deggin, an owner of Place Overseas, a London-based real-estate consulting firm that specializes in Turkish property. From late 2004 through late 2007, property prices rose -- in some cases by 50 percent, in others by more than 100 percent, depending on quality and location, Mr. Deggin said. 
 Foreigners can get financing--up to 70 percent -- but most buyers tend to pay in cash or obtain financing in their home country, as interest rates in Turkey are high.Today, prices throughout Istanbul vary widely. Villas along the Bosporus (the strait that divides the European and Asian parts of Turkey) can be upwards of $10,000 a square meter ($929 a square foot), said Keith Boyle, an agent at Beyoglu Apartments Real Estate. A historic fixer-upper starts at about $500 a square meter ($46 a square foot), while a nice apartment in a prime area with views can run $6,000 a square meter ($558 a square foot), he said. 
 Despite a global economic downturn, Turkey's economy is still growing, according to Feroze Bundhun, managing director of CB Richard Ellis Turkey, a real estate research company. So is Istanbul's population, as well as its demand for property. Though the volume of residential sales has slowed over the past year, prices have not dropped significantly, he said. 
 WHO BUYS IN ISTANBUL
 The majority of foreign buyers are English, followed by a mix of French, Germans and Americans, Iranians and Gulf Arabs, Mr. Boyle said. 
 Most foreign buyers seek property in Istanbul's established districts along the Bosporus, in Nisantasi and Bebek. In these neighborhoods, real estate prices are often given in several currencies -- for instance euros, British pounds, United States dollars and Turkish lira. Many buyers have either business or familial connections to Turkey, Mr. Deggin said.
 BUYING BASICS
 Foreigners seeking to buy property in Turkey must be citizens of a country that reciprocates by allowing Turks to buy. An American can buy a Turkish home, for instance, because Turks are allowed to buy property in the United States. 
 There are additional restrictions, though they are largely irrelevant in Istanbul: Foreign buyers are restricted from buying properties larger than 2.5 hectares (6 acres) or in certain rural areas, said Ayse Ozcan, the director of Acacia International Legal Services, a London-based legal firm that specializes in Turkish law. They may not own more than 10 percent of the land in a town or a province subject to zoning. 
 Buyers should estimate 5 to 7 percent of a property's price for purchase-side costs, Mr. Deggin said. This figure includes a 3 percent stamp tax, title and registration fees, lawyers' fees (roughly $1,500), and the 3 percent buyer's fee that many agents charge. 
 All foreign buyers must obtain military clearance. The process is generally a formality (''I've yet to see one declined,'' Mr. Deggin said) and costs about $600, though prices vary by region. The clearance process can take up to seven months, though for properties in Istanbul, it's typically one to three months, Ms. Ozcan said. Earthquake insurance is mandatory for property owners. Prices vary, Ms. Ozcan said.

HEADLINE: Screen Actors Guild Plans To Take Strike Consent Vote

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The Screen Actors Guild appeared determined to go ahead with a strike authorization vote after a group of board members failed in an attempt to oust the union's lead contract negotiator. 
 The national board of the Screen Actors Guild adjourned a marathon 30-hour meeting on Tuesday afternoon without voting on a proposal calling for the removal of Doug Allen, the union's national executive director, from his role as lead negotiator for the 120,000-member union.
 The ouster had been proposed by a group of moderate board members who were seeking to overturn a previously approved referendum to submit a strike authorization vote to the union's 120,000 members. 
 Though that group recently won a majority of seats on the union's national board, they apparently were not able to overcome parliamentary measures that kept their proposal from coming to a vote in a meeting that lasted throughout the night on Monday and into Tuesday afternoon.
 The lack of action appears to leave the union essentially unchanged in its efforts to restart talks with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over the actors contract, which expired last June. Attempts to use a federal mediator to broker an agreement collapsed in November.
 The union's board had previously planned to mail ballots for the strike-authorization vote on Jan. 2, but that vote was postponed after a group of directors had begun arguing that the declining economy required the union to alter its stance.
 Two board members who spoke on the condition of anonymity said their proposal had been thwarted by parliamentary moves taken by Alan Rosenberg, the union president, and supporters of the strike authorization measure.
 In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Rosenberg said that a group of board members had submitted a document to the union ''that purports to deal with'' Mr. Allen and his role in the union negotiations. But, he said, the union's lawyers ''have concluded that the document does not constitute a valid written assent'' by those who signed it.
 The statement said that Mr. Allen and the negotiating committee ''remain committed to advancing the cause of actors and our crucial contract negotiations.'' A spokeswoman for the union declined to comment further.
 The union is battling the producers over a contract that, in addition to setting base pay rates for actors in filmed productions, would outline pay scales for work transmitted digitally over the Internet and by other means. The actors union is the last of several major Hollywood unions to reach agreement with the producers.
 A strike authorization must be approved by 75 percent of those voting to allow a strike to go forward. The negotiating committee had said that approving an authorization did not require members to strike, but said that the authorization was needed to get the producers to return to the bargaining table.
 Uncertainty over the union's intentions has caused some studios to begin to slow production of feature films in anticipation of a possible strike.

HEADLINE: Blocks of Stock, Hard to Unload

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
Block trades are back. In just the last week, Bank of America dumped $2.8 billion worth of its shares in China Construction Bank. And Li Ka-shing, the Chinese billionaire, sold a $500 million chunk in Bank of China. It's easy to see why these fast and risky trades are back in vogue.
The trades occur when an institution wants to sell a large amount of stock -- and fast. The holder sells the shares to an investment bank, usually at a fixed price. The bank then tries to immediately sell the shares on the market at a premium to the price it paid. 
The Chinese sales are being driven primarily by the expiration of lockups that prevented sales from taking place sooner. Western banks that made big investments are eager to cash in some of their winnings and shore up their balance sheets. The current crop of trades may be mostly China-related, but the need for cash is global. And selling large blocks of stock that is unwanted, or at least nonstrategic, is a favorable means of raising it.
Yet investment banks have been burned badly by this practice in the past. The market price for shares can quickly drop once news of a large overhang of unwanted stock gets out. Banks that buy blocks of stock at too small a discount can end up with a huge loss. For example, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank took losses that exceeded $100 million each on a block of Vivendi Universal stock in 2002.
Now, less competition means equity capital markets desks are under reduced pressure to buy the stock at an insufficient discount. Banks used to buy blocks at less than a 5 percent discount, but now it is as high as 12 percent. That's because many of the banks that used to participate have simply disappeared, leaving the field open for Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Goldman and others.
The business still contains big risks, however. Market volatility has surged, pushing up the price of hedging and the risk of holding unwanted stock on a bank's already-stretched balance sheet. Block trades may be back and more tempting than ever. But rest assured, blowups will still take place.
Support for Trade
Trade among major economies, as defined by exports plus imports, fell some 8 percent in November from the year before. Some of the decline was because of tight financing, so trade may recover as financial conditions improve. If not, preventing trade from falling into a 1930s-style death spiral may become the world's top priority. The 66 percent decline in trade is what made the Depression great.
Trade statistics for November are remarkably consistent across all major economies. Trade in the United States was down 7 percent, primarily through lower imports. Japanese trade was down 20 percent, partly as a result of the strong yen, and German trade fell 7 percent. Chinese trade slipped 9 percent, an extraordinary reversal of that country's usual rapid trade growth. Britain appears to be an exception, but when corrected for the drastically weakening pound, its trade too fell by 8 percent.
None of this is necessarily catastrophic. For one thing, November was the first month in which the financial crisis of September and October made trade financing hard to obtain. Since November, financial conditions have eased, so trade may have already rebounded. In any case, an 8 percent decline is still modest compared with the slide during the Great Depression.
Collapsing world trade, caused by the Smoot-Hawley tariff act and other protectionist actions, made the Great Depression pathologically persistent. It reversed the operation of comparative advantages, forcing goods to be manufactured in less efficient locations (for example, steel in small-scale, high-cost Britain rather than efficient Germany or Pennsylvania).
Collapsing trade also caused pockets of extreme poverty like the shipbuilding town of Jarrow in Britain, which suffered without new orders. Absent a multilateral trade agreement, government attempts to stoke an economic recovery proved ineffectual.
Creeping protectionism is a threat in all recessions, including today's. If world trade continues to decline, the beneficial effects of globalization may reverse, while frightened politicians erect new trade barriers that actually worsen the problem.
Then only a reverse Smoot-Hawley -- a multilateral agreement requiring much freer trade -- could halt the decline and prevent a repeat of the 1930s. In fact, such a deal might do more to end the recession than any stimulus package. ROBERT CYRAN and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

HEADLINE: Athletes and Colleges Feel a Recruiting Pinch

BYLINE: By MARK VIERA

 BODY:
Morgan Moses is one of the top-rated high school offensive linemen in the country. He is 6 feet 7 inches, weighs nearly 350 pounds and has scholarship offers from colleges like Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio State, Virginia and Virginia Tech.
 But the economy has begun to factor into his family's discussions about how far he will go from their home in Richmond, Va. While his mother, Marion, said she wanted her son to choose the right university for him, she said the family's ability to watch him play would ''make a big impact on the decision.'' 
 ''I can tell you already,'' Marion Moses said in a telephone interview, ''I am not going to be able to make every game that he would have if he would go to California.''
 The economy has affected college sports programs across the nation, and recruiting is another area that is starting to be touched by tightening budgets of universities and the prospects they are seeking. 
 Some smaller universities have scaled back on recruiting trips or found new ways to identify talent. Coaches have had to answer tough questions about the financial assistance available to nonscholarship athletes. Some high school recruits and their families are considering the costs associated with living far from home.
 Still, some of the most prominent programs have not yet cut recruiting efforts. U.C.L.A., for instance, is looking to trim costs in some areas, though not in its recruiting budget, said Dan Guerrero, the university's athletic director. And Notre Dame has commitments from 17 highly rated prospects from across the country.
 Dick Baddour, the North Carolina athletic director, described recruiting as the lifeblood of a program. ''You've got to be careful if you're cutting back on recruiting,'' he said. ''That would be a major issue for us.''
 But other programs have had to rethink their approach to finding athletes.
 Colorado College, a private institution of about 1,900 students, consistently fields one of the country's top N.C.A.A. Division I men's hockey teams. To stay within its budget, the program has reduced its recruiting reach in talent-rich areas like the Northeast and Canada. Coaches at the college typically make one stop in the Northeast to watch the prep school hockey tournaments around Christmas and make four trips to Canada, spending up to five days there for each visit. This season, they have skipped the prep school tournaments and will make one fewer trip to Canada. 
 ''I think we have to be a little more selective in determining our trips these days because things are costlier,'' Coach Scott Owens said. ''And it's not just airfare, but hotels have been more expensive, and then rental cars and gas and those things. I think the answer to the question is we have to be a little bit wiser with our recruiting dollars.''
 At Amherst College, coaches have been asked to be more selective when sending out a bulk of recruiting letters and encouraged to send e-mail messages to recruits instead of worrying about telephone bills.
 Amherst, a Division III college in Massachusetts, is mobilizing its alumni in an effort to have select graduates monitor their local newspapers and academic honor roll announcements to identify potential recruits. The college's athletic director, Suzanne R. Coffey, said the alumni recruiters might meet on conference calls with coaches to discuss their findings.
 ''Before the financial crisis occurred, we were talking about ways to identify prospects outside our normal channels,'' Coffey said. ''Then in the past couple of months, we said this is the type of thing that will make even more sense with financial constraints even more prevalent.''
 Another area of concern for administrators includes the relative uncertainty of financial aid availability for nonscholarship athletes. 
 Certain government loan programs have been protected through legislation, but some prospective students have had difficulty obtaining private loans because of the credit crunch.
 ''The biggest place we are seeing an impact is actually with families' and parents' credit ratings,'' said Christopher Penn, the chief media officer for the Student Loan Network, which provides loans and related information to students and families. ''We've seen a huge drop-off in people who don't meet the credit credentials. You're going to need every last point on your credit score you can.''
 The issue of financial aid has typically been felt at Division III colleges, which do not award athletic scholarships. But now, it can also affect athletes at the Division I level.
 For a private university like Wake Forest, which costs nearly $50,000 a year to attend, the difficulty associated with obtaining certain financial aid can pose problems for recruits not receiving athletic scholarships. 
 Although the university said its full-time students with need received an average of $30,300 in the 2008-9 academic year, the Demon Deacons' men's soccer coach, Jay Vidovich, said prospects' parents had shown an increased awareness of how the economic package factored into the decision.
 ''I'm not a financial analyst or anything, so I can't make any sweeping statements, but it's always been a major hurdle for us anyway,'' Vidovich said. ''I don't know how it's going to shake out. It's not like, 'Yeah, what a great opportunity.' It's like, 'Yeah, that's a very nice opportunity; I hope we can afford it.' I'm hoping we can still stay very competitive.''
 To enable their parents to watch games in person and to reduce travel costs to and from campus, athletes may decide to stay closer to home, said Tom Lemming, a national football recruiting analyst.
 It has largely not happened yet -- for Moses, the lineman from Virginia, it has just entered into the discussion -- but it could be around the corner. 
 Programs like Southern California or Florida will continue to draw talent from a national base, Lemming said, but those a step or two down may have to look closer to home.
 ''For most of the country, it will be more regionalized,'' Lemming said. ''They'll have to recruit within a 300-mile radius more than they have in the past.''
 That has rung true at Alabama State, a historically black university in Montgomery, Ala. Its football program has outlined parameters for recruitment, although its campus is near deep talent pools in Florida and Georgia.
 ''We find that we can sell the student-athletes if they're 300 miles or less to Montgomery, Ala.,'' Ron Dickerson, the university's interim athletic director, said in a telephone interview before his retirement Jan. 1. ''And we're hoping it's not going to last for a long time. We're hoping that the downside is just for a year or two.''

HEADLINE: A Bank With Its Own Woes Lends Only a Trickle of Bailout

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON and RON NIXON. 
Eric Lipton reported from Troy, Mich., and Washington, and Ron Nixon from Washington.

 BODY:
TROY, Mich. -- The bad bets made by executives at Independent Bank of Michigan are on display in spots across the state: a defunct bowling alley, a new but never occupied shopping center and the luxurious Whispering Woods Estates, which offers prime lots for never-constructed dream homes.
Now it is the federal government making the big bet here.
The Treasury Department has invested $72 million out of the $700 billion in federal bailout funds to help prop up this community bank, which traces its roots back 144 years in Michigan. It is a small chunk of the giant rescue fund being wagered by Washington to encourage banks like Independent to resume lending and jump-start the frozen economy. 
But Independent, hard put to find good borrowers in a suffering economy, and fearful of making the kind of mistakes that got it into trouble in the first place, is not doing much lending these days. So far it is using all of the government's money to shore up its own weak finances by repaying short-term loans from the Federal Reserve. ''It is like if you are in an airplane and the oxygen mask comes down,'' said Stefanie Kimball, the bank's chief lending officer. ''First thing you do is put your own mask on, stabilize yourself.''
This is not what the Treasury Department had in mind when it started this program, saying it would give the nation's ''healthy banks'' enough money to start lending again, so that people could buy homes and businesses could invest and create jobs, thereby invigorating a disintegrating economy.
A close look at Independent Bank's handling of its government money demonstrates just how much harder this has turned out to be, and the conflicting challenges that banks across the United States are confronting in the new bailout era. Like hundreds of other banks, it is caught between the government's push to increase lending and its own caution.
As of Tuesday, 257 financial institutions in 42 states had received $192 billion in capital injections from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, out of $250 billion set aside for this purpose. Seven giant banks -- like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- have received more than 62 percent of the total so far, and have gotten most of the attention.
But it is the smaller community banks like Independent that are seeing the largest number of investments, with 186 banks so far getting allocations of less than $100 million. With little public attention, this money in recent weeks has been streaming out to community banks across the nation, in dollops as small as $1 million -- the amount set aside for Independent Bank of East Greenwich, R.I. Ultimately, more than 1,000 banks are expected to take part in the program.
While most of the banks that have received money appear to be relatively healthy, dozens of other banks that received federal funds are, like Independent Bank of Michigan, financially stressed by a high volume of delinquent loans.
Bailout Is Questioned
Economists say the decision by banks like Independent to use the federal money for purposes other than lending, while perhaps disappointing, is not surprising, given that the Treasury Department did not honor its plan to give the money only to healthy banks.
''It's a matter of logic -- when you are in a perilous position, like many of them are, you try to bolster your balance sheet,'' said Alan S. Blinder, a monetary policy economics professor at Princeton. ''But this is a real flaw in the program.''
Some banking experts are even questioning if the bailout may be doing more harm than good, in some cases, by giving banks like Independent a cushion as they struggle to fix their problems, rather than forcing them to sink or swim on their own. It could also delay mergers of weaker banks with healthier ones.
''You are keeping a lot of troubled institutions in kind of a status quo state,'' said Eric D. Hovde, the chief executive of a Washington-based hedge fund that invests in the banking industry. ''They can continue on their merry ways.'' In Congress, anger over the management of the TARP program runs deep. Many lawmakers say that there is little oversight, and that they can see no evidence that the taxpayer money is making its way from the coffers of banks to businesses and consumers. The program is likely to be fundamentally changed under the administration of Barack Obama, who on Monday asked President Bush to request that Congress release the remaining $350 billion.
Some lawmakers have criticized the Treasury for allowing banks to use the government's bailout money to acquire rival banks.
As additional evidence of the growing anxiety, bank regulators on Monday sent a notice to banks receiving federal money ordering them to disclose how they are using it. It also pushed them to emphasize new loans. ''A lot of the money is already out there and the inspector general needs to get up to speed on how banks are using it,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. ''We need to make sure we get this money back and the only way we can do that is with strong oversight on how this money is spent.''
Neel Kashkari, the interim assistant secretary at Treasury running the bailout program, said he was convinced that it was delivering the promised results by stabilizing banks while also encouraging them to help out their communities. Even if overall lending is not up, it is higher than it would have been without the program, he said.
''We're still in a period of fairly low confidence,'' he said. ''So, banks are understandably nervous about extending a lot of new credit. And consumers are nervous about taking on new credit.''
Independent, which has 106 branches and $3.1 billion in assets, illustrates all of these complexities.
By no means is Independent the worst off among the country's community banks. Some banks that sought TARP funds were considered so weak that Washington officials discouraged them from even applying. Other banks were rated slightly stronger but still were required to raise private capital before they were approved for federal help.
When it applied, Independent was considered ''well capitalized'' by federal standards. It had not been subject to any recent regulatory orders to change management or lending practices, for example.
But it was struggling nonetheless. Indeed, of all the banks that received bailout money as of Jan. 6, it had the second-highest ratio of bad loans, when compared with its capital and its cushion of reserves in case of further loan losses. Its assets are shrinking and it lost money in the third quarter. It began cutting its dividend last year, when it stood at 21 cents a share. It is now a penny a share. And it had lost millions of dollars from bad stock market investments.
But Independent is hardly a high roller plagued by gold-plated executive perks, and it was not a big subprime lender, as many banks were.
Disappearing Dreams
Based in Ionia, Mich., 30 miles east of Grand Rapids, it is the kind of local institution that foots the bill so the state's high school bands can march in the annual Grand Rapids Santa Claus Parade. This month it has George Foreman grills stacked up in its lobbies to reward customers who bring in friends and neighbors to open new accounts. Independent is one of the biggest employers in Ionia, a city of 10,000 with classic, turn-of-the-century storefronts dominating its main street. Driving across suburban Detroit in his black Mercedes sedan, Keith Lightbody, a senior vice president at Independent Bank, said it was easy, in retrospect, to see how banks like his ended up where they are today.
Mr. Lightbody, a former JPMorgan Chase bank executive hired almost two years ago by Independent, tours the sites of the bank's many broken dreams, like the Whispering Woods residential subdivision in Farmington Hills. The bank financed the construction of roads and utilities for the subdivision, only to see the developer go belly up before most of the lots were sold. Snowdrifts now nearly cover the ''for sale'' signs.
Perhaps even more distressing are the empty storefronts in Shelby Township, Mich., where a developer backed by the bank built what was supposed to be a vibrant streetscape, bustling with shops and shoppers.
Instead, other than a restaurant at the front of the complex, there is only a row of darkened windows, with the work halted on the would-be stores even before their floors were built, leaving the insides looking like a sandbox filled with random construction debris.
As of the end of September, the bank was burdened by $115 million in bad debts, or nearly 5 percent of its overall loan portfolio, compared with less than 1 percent in 2005. Each of these failed projects has something essential in common, Mr. Lightbody said.
''We didn't step back and look at the big picture, asking ourselves, are we really doing the right thing with this loan?'' he said. ''Everyone was making a lot of money.''
Independent is publicly traded and under pressure from investors to shrink its troubled loan portfolio before lending anew. Yet it still very much wants to make loans, said Robert N. Shuster, Independent's chief financial officer.
In normal times, Independent would lend up to $8 for every $1 in bank capital. The $72 million in federal money, therefore, could generate up to $576 million in loans -- a powerful leveraging effect that was the goal of the TARP program.
''Our whole business is predicated on making loans -- that is what we do, that is the mission of the bank,'' he said. But the bank cannot afford to simply pass out money, Mr. Shuster said, or everyone involved will lose -- the borrower, who would probably default on the loan; the bank, which would experience bigger losses; and the federal government, which is counting on Independent to pay back the $72 million, along with 5 percent dividend payments.
''That is what got us where we are today,'' Mr. Shuster said, of the bank's past easy-lending practices. ''You can't put consumers in a position where they aren't going to be successful.''
Making Loan Decisions
Ms. Kimball, the chief lending officer, comes face to face with this debate each day.
She has continued to tighten lending standards, generally turning away applications, for example, for single-use commercial buildings, like restaurants, because of the difficulty in selling the properties if the bank needed to foreclose on the loan, she said. Independent is also taking a more critical look at appraisals submitted to justify housing loans, which is considered a necessity now, because national companies that buy up mortgages from banks like Independent are demanding such scrutiny.
''We are not going to lower our credit standards at this point to make a whole bunch of extra loans just to deploy the money,'' Ms. Kimball said. ''We need to make loans that are reasonable in this day and age.''
Working from the Troy office, Ms. Kimball, who has a cool, stern tone, and a self-confidence that comes from 25 years in the financial services business, is overseeing this effort as the bank moves, in particular, to cut the size of its real estate loan portfolio.
''It is not something that changes overnight,'' she said from her corner office overlooking Troy. ''It is like turning a ship around in the ocean.''
She knows many of the bank's big commercial borrowers personally -- taking the time to go out on the road and visit their factories or businesses to get a better sense of just how well positioned they are to repay their loans.
One manufacturer from western Michigan, a customer of another bank, came to Independent looking for a business loan. Her examination of the company's books showed that its sales were slipping and, worse, that it was having a hard time collecting on bills it had sent to its remaining customers, who also were suffering from the economic downturn.
So the bank had to make the hard choice of turning the company down.
''That is just not something we can do,'' Mr. Shuster said, declining to name the company. ''We just can't lend there.''
With the tighter lending standards and the damage the miserable Michigan economy has done to so many of its businesses, the pool of eligible borrowers has shrunk considerably. The net result is that the overall balance of outstanding commercial loans the bank carries -- which was about $1 billion as of last June -- has shrunk by $50 million and will most likely continue to shrink through much of the first half of this year, Ms. Kimball said.
There are, of course, exceptions.
Ultimate Hydroforming of Sterling Heights, Mich., which makes prototypes for the aviation and automobile industry, like the battery casing for the new Chevrolet Volt, a planned electric car, has been able to obtain new credit recently and will probably get even more from Independent.
A Growing Business
The company's manufacturing plant is only a few miles from a half-dozen giant automobile assembly plants. But Ultimate Hydroforming had started several years ago to look for ways to diversify, so its business is still growing, even as the automobile industry goes into a deep slump.
Ms. Kimball, on a recent visit, was greeted by the plant operations manager, Shane Klyn, and then given a tour of the factory, which is installing towering new hydraulic presses -- thanks to loans from Independent -- as part of an expansion that it hopes will lead the company into profitable work making parts for solar energy devices.
''This will allow us to move into new projects and markets,'' Mr. Klyn said as he walked through the plant with Ms. Kimball, who by then had a big smile on her face, despite the freezing winds and piles of snow just outside. ''The bank is giving us the opportunity to expand.''
But companies like Ultimate Hydroforming are extremely hard to find, particularly in Michigan, where the unemployment rate is far above the national average.
With no surge in lending taking place right away -- and the bank very much looking for a way to improve its own balance sheet -- Independent took the $72 million check that arrived from Treasury in mid-December and immediately transferred it to the Federal Reserve to pay down short-term loans it had taken out.
This month, the bank is planning to leverage that bailout money to buy about $160 million in mortgage-backed securities from institutions like Fannie Mae, an investment that it hopes will produce enough interest income to pay the dividend it owes the federal government. Again, this will bring little immediate benefit to Michigan businesses and residents. In essence, the $72 million has been stuffed into Treasury's own mattress.
Mr. Hovde, the hedge fund investor who says he believes the bailout program is putting off judgment day for many banks, said his fear was that many of the banks would burn through their federal money only to face a squeeze again. And they will never have made the extra loans that the Treasury had hoped would jump-start the economy.
Treasury officials remain confident that the investments are wise ones.
''There's going to be more lending than had we not done this,'' Mr. Kashkari said. ''Even if the overall numbers are down year-over-year, it's going to be a lot more than if we had not put the capital in the system.''
And Mr. Shuster, back in Michigan, said he was determined to prove that Mr. Kashkari -- whom he has never spoken to or met -- is right.
''Even if things get tougher, I am confident we can work our way through this and pay every dime back to the U.S. Treasury,'' he said. ''There is no stone we won't turn over to make sure we are good stewards of this money. We feel an enormous responsibility to this Treasury. I am a taxpayer too.''

HEADLINE: Intel Shifts Image Advertising to a Smaller Agency

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Intel is shifting an important advertising assignment -- to create brand and corporate image campaigns -- to a smaller, independent agency from a Madison Avenue giant.
 Intel is hiring Venables Bell & Partners in San Francisco, which works for advertisers like Audi of America and Barclays, as its lead global creative agency, replacing McCann Erickson Worldwide. Venables Bell will handle what Intel calls its master brand assignment, which involves campaigns to burnish Intel's image rather than specific products. 
 The amount of money that Intel spends on master-brand ads changes from year to year. Intel has not made final decisions on its budgets for 2009, but by some estimates, master brand ads could total from $50 million to $150 million each year.
 The change is part of what a spokesman for Intel, David Dickstein, described Tuesday as a shift to an ''open-source'' model of agency relationships, to borrow a term from technology.
 That means that Intel plans to work with a panoply of agencies rather than limiting itself to the traditional model of designating an agency of record.
 The McCann Worldgroup, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, became agency of record for Intel in 2005. At the time, the Intel account was estimated at $300 million. McCann Erickson is the creative agency inside the McCann Worldgroup.
 Since 2005, Intel has hired several additional agencies, among them two owned by the Omnicom Group, Doremus and OMD, and Razorfish, part of Microsoft.
 The MRM unit of the McCann Worldgroup will serve as the Web production agency for intel.com.
 A spokeswoman for McCann Erickson in New York, Susan Irwin, had no comment on the report.
 Because Venables Bell has the single office in San Francisco, the campaigns the agency creates will be handled in overseas markets by various locally based agencies. Those may include offices of McCann Erickson Worldwide in regions like Europe.
 Paul Venables, co-creative director at Venables Bell, said the agency might seek ''a partner that will help on work to be distributed around the world and tailored to individual markets.''
 The recession may accelerate the trend of large marketers looking for ''more nimble, more creative solutions'' to advertising problems, Mr. Venables said. ''A company like ours is in a fantastic position.''

HEADLINE: 2 Hospitals in Queens May Face Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Two Queens hospitals are facing bankruptcy and may close by February, the Queens borough president said Tuesday, in one of the first indications that New York State's budget shortfall is hurting the hospital industry.
 The two private hospitals, St. John's Queens and Mary Immaculate, had sometimes been given millions of dollars in state subsidies just to meet their payrolls, according to other hospital officials who have been briefed on the matter. But with the state facing a $15 billion budget gap, the state was less likely to help hospitals that had limited long-term viability.
 Helen M. Marshall, the Queens borough president, said in her State of the Borough speech Tuesday that she was ''extremely concerned today about the stability'' of the two hospitals. Her spokesman, Dan Andrews, said later that Ms. Marshall had learned from officials at Caritas, which runs the two hospitals, that St. John's and Mary Immaculate could file for bankruptcy this month and could close by next month. He said she has appealed to the governor's office for help, and chose to mention the hospitals in her speech just hours before delivering it. 
 Ken Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said Tuesday that he was concerned that these could be the first of several hospital casualties of the bad economy. ''I am worried that this is a precursor of things to come,'' he said. Mr. Raske added that he did not think Ms. Marshall's warning was a political ploy aimed at building public support for the hospitals. ''I think this is a hard dose of reality,'' he said.
 But Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department, said that the hospitals' problems had more to do with their sustainability than with the state's fiscal crisis. She said that the state had done its best to help them survive, extending a total of $44 million in loans and grants to the two Caritas hospitals over the last two years. ''It wasn't meant to be a permanent source of funding,'' she said, adding that ''we don't have any pending loan applications from them.''
 The two hospitals have just over 400 beds and about 3,000 employees between them, and have been in precarious financial condition since at least 2005. John Kastanis, chief executive of Caritas, did not return repeated calls for comment.
 Joe Baker, the governor's deputy secretary for health, also did not return a call for comment on Tuesday.
 Mr. Andrews said Mary Immaculate, in Jamaica, had a trauma center that would be sorely missed if it closed because demand for its services is brisk. St. John's is in Elmhurst, a more middle-class area. 
 Indeed, Mary Immaculate frequently shows up on the police blotter. Just last weekend, two of the three victims of a triple shooting were taken to Mary Immaculate, where one was pronounced dead. Vivian Squires, an 86-year-old woman who fought off a knife-wielding intruder who broke into her home in South Jamaica on Jan. 4, was also treated there. Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, who were wounded in the 50-shot police fusillade that killed Sean Bell at his bachelor party in November 2006, were also taken to Mary Immaculate.
 Long Island Jewish Medical Center, which runs several hospitals in Queens, has expressed interest in taking over the two hospitals, but only if it can consolidate the two antiquated facilities into a single plant, Terry Lynam, a spokesman for Long Island Jewish, said Tuesday. But he added that Long Island Jewish would need a bond issue and state support to build a new hospital, both of which are increasingly unlikely because of the economy.

HEADLINE: In Festival, Biography, Beckett And Blues

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY and JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
''A thugged-up Campbell's Soup kid'' is how one of his former girlfriends described Lemon Andersen as a cocky teenager. The tag still fits the arrestingly paradoxical presence of this performance artist, whose ''County of Kings: The Beautiful Struggle'' is part of the Public Theater's Under the Radar festival. Mr. Andersen -- an alumnus of the youthful, adrenaline-charged rhyme fest ''Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam on Broadway'' (2002) -- retains the air of a choirboy with a shiv in his robe, forever putting the world on notice that he's way tougher than his cherubic face suggests.
 The same dynamic, of an angel working hard to earn his devil's trident, informs much of this account of Mr. Andersen's fluid but surprisingly conventional self-portrait of growing up in the projects in Brooklyn. Tracing his path from baby crack dealer to Broadway rapmeister, Mr. Andersen gracefully shimmies in and out of the identities he assumed to survive in locations that include the apartment he shared with his drug-addicted mother; a Manhattan ballet school; a county jail in Ohio; and Rikers Island. 
 It comes as no surprise that the role that always fit most comfortably was that of a sweet but salty professional showoff. Salvation in Mr. Andersen's story is as much a matter of a natural performer's finally receiving public attention as of an artist's giving shape to chaos. 
 In structure and sentiment, ''County of Kings,'' directed by Elise Thoron, often brings to mind the mean-streets tales of degradation and redemption that stoke Oprah's Book Club selections. But Mr. Andersen has a gift for rhythmic time-capsule set pieces that capture the flavor of a moment in history, turning boldface and brand names into propulsive song. His poeticized version of a news flash about the advent of AIDS (the disease that killed his mother) electrifies, as it should, like unexpected lightning. 
 And his account of his teenage self making love for the first time with a girl he actually loved, told from her perspective, pricelessly captures the awkward and startling grace of sex at an early age.
 ''County of Kings: The Beautiful Struggle'' runs through Sunday at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 967-7555 or publictheater.org.BEN BRANTLEY
 ENGLAND Chelsea Art Museum 556 West 22nd Street Through Saturday
 Tim Crouch and Hannah Ringham are very different-looking people, striking in their own ways. He is bald with expressive, intense eyes that seem buried deep in his head, while her more ingratiating face is sliced in half by a flat, wide grin. 
 Working together to play one character, the narrator in ''England,'' the most absorbing production of this year's Under the Radar festival, they share a disarmingly similar manner: a Mona Lisa smile, an almost naive good cheer and a trembling fragility that eventually, surprisingly, strangely, becomes rather ominous.
 ''England,'' a rich drama created with rigorous, poetic economy by Mr. Crouch, belongs to that wonderful genre of thoughtful plays that could be discussed for hours without exhausting its ideas. The work is hardly more than 60 minutes, yet it addresses themes of the challenges of translation, connection and communication in a shrinking world; the blurring of art and commerce; the relationship between moral and aesthetic values; and the unbalanced relationship between England and America (not to mention the dysfunctional one between East and West). 
 It is most of all a play about transplants -- physical, cultural and even artistic. After all, the play itself is a piece of theater repurposed for an art museum, where the two actors guide the audience around an art gallery.
 If that description makes this very entertaining play seem like heavy lifting, it is not. Mr. Crouch has a lot on his mind, but his ideas are rooted in credible, deftly sketched characters and a suspenseful, disorienting plot that with the help of a canny sound design (pay close attention to the musical shifts) slowly comes into focus.
 The first act features Mr. Crouch and Ms. Ringham alternating lines -- doubling is a constant theme -- explaining the many virtues of their boyfriend, a hard-headed art dealer who becomes increasingly concerned that the narrator (who could be a man or a woman; it's never specified) has become ill. The narrator, a sweet childlike figure, is English; the boyfriend is American; and their imbalanced relationship can easily be read as a critique of Britain's deferential treatment of the United States.
 It emerges that the narrator's heart has failed, and the boyfriend, always can-do and confident, struggles to fix the problem. In the second act the audience sits down, and the scene shifts to an unnamed Muslim country where the narrator and an interpreter talk to the widow of the man whose heart was transplanted in the narrator. 
 Tellingly, the interpreter, speaking in English, boils down the condescending remarks of the narrator into something simpler. Other times, lines like ''He gets what he likes'' stick in the mind, adopting different meanings in new contexts. This tricky script repeatedly reminds you of the many ways one sentence can be interpreted. 
 Going to a Muslim country to find a new heart is an evocative metaphor for our time, and in this story it becomes a moral challenge to the narrator, who finds carefully preserved innocence and passivity increasingly difficult to maintain. Tortured by certain decisions made on the narrator's behalf, the character seems to find solace in musing on the fine arts. 
 ''Art can make you feel better about going to die,'' Mr. Crouch says, adding, ''Thanks art!'' But along with comfort for the narrator, art serves as something else too, a symbol of how anything in the global economy (a human organ, a de Kooning) can be turned into a transaction. 
 It's an idea that dawns on the narrator, transforming the early, absent stares and smiles of Mr. Crouch and Ms. Ringham into something approaching panic. ''Look! Look!'' they keep telling the audience, begging for attention. Do yourself a favor and give it to them. JASON ZINOMAN 
 FIRST LOVE Public Theater Through Sunday
 Every year actors try to convince audiences that Samuel Beckett, despite his gloomy reputation, is actually a hilarious guy -- and it almost never works. Fiona Shaw came close in her brilliant performance in ''Happy Days'' last year, and Nathan Lane and Bill Irwin, who are starring in a coming Broadway production of ''Waiting for Godot,'' will surely make their case. What usually happens is that the talented performers do a better job proving their own comic chops riffing on the script, adding physical humor and verbal accents. 
 Conor Lovett's supremely funny performance in ''First Love,'' a solo stage adaptation of an early postwar Beckett novella, is such a pleasing triumph because its gallows humor emerges so organically, the result of a prepared actor with a deep understanding of the text. 
 To be sure, this muscularly written tale (presented by the Gare St. Lazare Players Ireland) in which the narrator impregnates a prostitute and abandons the child may not sound like the plot of a comedy, especially since the narrator, a misanthrope who prefers his own company to that of anyone else, has been expelled from his home after the death of his father. Scatological, vulgar and occasionally shocking, the levity here is of the ''laughing wild amid severest woe'' variety. Call it a love story for loners.
 Mr. Lovett begins with a firm belief that there is a laugh (or a tear) in almost every other sentence. And with the able help of his wife and director, Judy Hegarty Lovett, the interpretation of the precisely formed language has the rhythm of a Bob Newhart routine. A shrugging Irish actor with floppy ears, Mr. Lovett begins quickly with aggressive, attention-getting force, discussing the virtues of a graveyard. 
 ''The smell of corpses,'' he says, as if he were a singer belting out a note before gradually reducing the volume, ''distinctly perceptible under those of grass and humus mingled. I do not find it unpleasant, a trifle on the sweet side perhaps, a trifle heady, but how infinitely preferable to what,'' he stops abruptly, his stammer working like a setup to the punch line: ''the living emit.'' 
 But even worse than the smelly living is the cry of his child, loudly echoing in his ears no matter how hard he tries to forget it. It's a credit to the commanding actor that you feel for this haunted misanthrope without his sinking into sentimentality. ''I could have done with other loves perhaps,'' Mr. Lovett says at the end with no remorse. ''But there it is, either you love or you don't.'' JASON ZINOMAN 
 TRANSITION Public Theater Through Saturday
 Reginald Lucien Frank Roger Watts has as many talents as he does names. He sings, raps, acts, dances, cracks jokes, does a mean human beat box, composes songs using a loop sampler that layers sounds, and he also manages, somehow, to stand up straight despite a titanic Afro that hangs about his large, lumpy frame like a willow tree. 
 Mr. Watts is, to understate, a little different. Located at the fairly quiet intersection of alternative comedy, absurdist theater, musical satire and the fine art of just messing around, his chaotic shows are collages of stunts and songs that proudly refuse to cohere into anything. At last year's Under the Radar festival, I was impressed by his ''Disinformation,'' in which he mixed funny accents, video snippets and all manner of manipulations of his nimble voice into catchy beats. If some of the material was half-cocked, he made up for it with speed and charm. 
 His latest show, ''Transition,'' tries a similar strategy, and while it's undeniably entertaining in a scattershot way, it's something of a step backward.
 Once again, he creates some melodic music using only his nimble vocal instrument and some deliriously silly lyrics. (There's a goth metal parody that is terrific.) But the loose parts seem tossed together haphazardly, with little thought paid to theme or quality control. There are some tedious monologues, a lame satire of Victorian romance and some downright boring skits. 
 Why didn't Tommy Smith, the co-creator and director, integrate any of the elements or at least edit out some of the weaker ones? I suppose the randomness is part of its charm. You have to smile when -- after a video of a romantic scene from the Michael J. Fox film ''Teen Wolf'' (acted out earlier in the show) -- a giant still photo of Kirk Cameron, Mr. Fox's teenybopper rival from the 1980s, pops on the screen. 
 It's funny, sort of, and kind of a lark. But Mr. Watts is such a charismatic showman that it would be interesting to see him at the center of a production with a stronger point of view. Or something that doesn't seem, as its title suggests, a work in progress. JASON ZINOMAN 
 PATAPHYSICS PENYEACH Summa Dramatica/Porco Morto Mabou Mines Studio 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village Through Sunday
 So there's this pig, see, and he loves The New York Times. After a romantic affair with the Gray Lady, they commit suicide together with a ''Diamond Sutra dagger,'' but not before the pig, played by a puppet, offers a few sweet nothings to a stack of newspapers. 
 ''You, my lady, are a Geisha of old Osaka,'' says the strange swine. ''And I, the bankrupt antihero wedded unhappily to his muse, am enraptured by a whore owned by that house of prostitution called The System.'' 
 If you're trying to figure out what is going on here in ''Porco Morto,'' part of a double bill of one-acts together called ''Pataphysics Penyeach,'' you're not the only one. The two overwritten pieces by the venerable avant-garde troupe Mabou Mines ramble with the goofy, satirical style of one of Bob Dylan's least comprehensible songs. It stars animal puppets and features a lot of bad puns, pretentious jargon (''normative soulfulness''?), some jokey video and barely coherent mockery of commercialism and this news organization. 
 In ''Summa Dramatica,'' Ruth Maleczech, a founding member of the company, wears a cow head and, with the help of another actor sitting beneath her dress, plays a bovine acting teacher (she's part of ''animal equity'') in a sendup of a Stella Adler-like diva. At the end she asks the audience members to stand up, raise their right hands and repeat after her: ''I believe the life of the spirit is not a sitcom,'' she says, raising a hoof. ''I believe in reality.'' 
 Directed and written by Lee Breuer, another original member, the short, silly plays are perhaps most interesting as pseudo-period pieces, portraits of a counterculture from a bygone era. It should leave some audiences nostalgic and others just confused. JASON ZINOMAN 
 SIGHT IS THE SENSE THAT DYING PEOPLE TEND TO LOSE FIRST Public Theater (Web exclusive)
 ''Sight Is the Sense That Dying People Tend to Lose First'' is a play. Most plays include dialogue, plot and characters, but not this one. This script consists of hundreds of simple, mostly unrelated declarative sentences, like, ''Frank Sinatra was a singer,'' or ''Buses rarely arrive when you are waiting for them,'' or ''It is dangerous to drive a forklift when you have been drinking.''
 Tim Etchells is the playwright. Mr. Etchells is the artistic director of Forced Entertainment. Forced Entertainment makes shows it calls ''durational works,'' which can be up to 24 hours long. A 24-hour play is not always trying to entertain. ''Sight Is the Sense'' is part of the Public Theater's Under the Radar festival. The last performance was Sunday. The running time was one hour. One hour can seem much longer. Free association is a psychoanalytic technique in which a patient is encouraged to reveal unconscious thoughts. Free association is also used in art. Randomness can be funny.
 Jim Fletcher is the only actor. Mr. Fletcher has appeared in many plays by the downtown director and playwright Richard Maxwell. Calmness is not easy to project onstage. Solo plays are very popular in the Under the Radar festival. Solo plays are inexpensive to produce. An actor is someone who reads lines. Mr. Fletcher holds bottled water and wears rumpled clothes as if he just walked off the street.
 Remembering eight pages of sentences does not make you a good actor, but it can seem impressive. Clint Eastwood has squinty eyes and a stubbly chin, too, but that also doesn't make a good actor. Monotone line readings sound absurd. 
 Experimental theater often questions the limits of drama. Experimental theater can also make you sleepy. Sleeping people snore. Audience members usually keep their eyes open. Leaving a show early is considered rude, but occasionally understandable. 
 The Under the Radar festival runs through Sunday. Information: the Public Theater, (212) 967-7555 or publictheater.org.

HEADLINE: Sony and Toshiba Shares Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Stocks in Japan's leading electronics companies fell sharply on Tuesday amid reports that the industry giants Sony and Toshiba would report operating losses in the current financial year, as plummeting demand and a strong yen took their toll on sales. 
 The Reuters news service, quoting a person with knowledge of the matter, said that Sony might post an operating loss of about $1.1 billion in the business year that ends in March, in comments that echoed reports in several Japanese media on Tuesday. 
 If confirmed, it would be the first full-year loss in 14 years for the maker of the iconic Walkman portable player and PlayStation 3 games console. 
 Sony declined to comment on the report, but its shares fell 7.7 percent by early afternoon as investors worried that Sony's third-quarter earnings announcement, due Jan. 29, could include nasty surprises as the economic environment continues to worsen. 
 Among other things, the company has said it will detail far-reaching cost and job cuts it announced on Dec. 9, as it looked to cut costs by 100 billion yen a year. 
 Similarly, Japanese media reported that Toshiba, too, would post what would be its seventh full-year loss because of worsening chip operations. A Toshiba spokesman, Keisuke Ohmori, said the company had not revised its figures ''at this time, despite the difficult environment.'' 
 Like Sony, Toshiba is due to report its third-quarter performance, for the three months to the end of December, on Jan. 29. 
 Toshiba shares fell 7.4 percent by early afternoon, while the overall Nikkei 225 index was 4.2 percent lower in Tokyo. Elsewhere in the sector, Canon fell 6.7 percent, Sanyo 4.2 percent and Panasonic 7 percent. 
 The coming earnings season -- and Japanese trade data next week -- is expected to reflect several challenges facing Japanese exporters: demand in the United States and Europe has been flagging for months as consumers cut back or delay spending on goods that are not essential, like computer games, flat-screen televisions and cars, while the yen remains strong compared to the dollar and euro, making Japanese goods more expensive for American and European shoppers. 
 With the Japanese economy already in recession, in recent months companies have delivered a string of profit warnings, scaled back output and cut jobs. More such announcements are widely expected, analysts and economists say. 
 In October, Sony revised its operating profit forecast for the financial year to 200 billion yen, 58 percent lower than its earlier target. On Dec. 9 it announced that it would cut 8,000 full-time jobs -- 5 percent of the work force of 160,000 at its electronics business -- and rein in planned investment, while shutting several plants in response to what it called the ''sudden and rapid changes in the global economic environment.'' 
 Analysts at the time said that more measures might be necessary as the global downturn dragged on.

HEADLINE: A Poet's Dream, Born in Prison, Begins to Come to Life After Her Return Home

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
It was around her 22nd birthday that Chenara Ryan decided she would do everything it took to become a nurse. It was going to take a lot: She was poor and had no high school diploma, and she was serving a two-year sentence at the Rose M. Singer Center, a women's prison at Rikers Island.
 When she was arrested, in May 2005, Ms. Ryan knew her boyfriend at the time was selling drugs. She did not know that not turning him in amounted to a felony. This she learned at the prison's law library. 
 ''By not telling on someone, you're committing a crime,'' said Ms. Ryan, her disbelief undimmed. ''Where I come from, that makes you a rat.''
 To pass time, she worked at the library, helping other prisoners research their cases. In July 2006, she pleaded guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence. When she was moved to a medium-security prison upstate, she started writing again.
 Ms. Ryan, now 25, had been composing poems since she was a teenager. Until her arrest, her verse had addressed troubling aspects of her childhood: her complicated relationship with her mother, who brought her to New York from Trinidad when she was an infant; her entrance into the foster-care system at age 15; the murder back home of her father, whom she had rarely seen. 
 Prison gave her fresh themes. One poem, titled ''Who, What, Why, When,'' was made up of 51 questions.
 ''Why did I not believe all the things I was taught?'' reads one passage. ''Why did I give up on my dream? Why did I give up on life?''
 Another she wrote for her daughter, Angel, then 5, on Mother's Day. ''The love your mother has for you has a lot of feeling,'' one couplet began. ''Angel, I love you!''
 Ms. Ryan was determined to get back to her daughter, who was living with Ms. Ryan's mother in Connecticut. This meant avoiding any trouble that might lead to an extension of her sentence. She wore an amulet against derailment: a photograph of Angel, tucked into her bra.
 ''Like, if someone tried to tempt me into a fight, my heart would start beating and I'd feel the picture against my chest,'' she said. Ms. Ryan was allowed home on a work-release program in April 2007, and officially discharged two months later.
 She and Angel moved in with her aunt in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Ms. Ryan took a job as a sales clerk at a department store and began working toward her high school diploma at a correspondence school. She also started taking budgeting classes at the Osborne Association, an organization that helps former prisoners, and enrolled in a training program to become a home health aide.
 All went well until January 2008, when she was laid off from the department store. She and Angel were by then renting a room in an apartment in Flatbush, for $600 a month, rent that became harder to meet once they were relying on $600 in monthly unemployment payments and $300 in food stamps.
 Ms. Ryan continued the health-aide training, and, in March, received her high school diploma. But with minimal income, she occasionally fell behind on rent, owing $300 by October.
 The Osborne Association referred Ms. Ryan to Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Catholic Charities drew $300 from the fund to pay off Ms. Ryan's arrears.
 In weekly meetings at its offices, the organization is helping Ms. Ryan with her job search. Present at one recent session was Angel, now 7, who spent much of the hour writing the name of her elementary school, P.S. 260, on a dry-erase board and practicing her catwalk in a hallway.
 ''She wants to be a model,'' said Ms. Ryan, now, 25, who shares with Angel a slim build and fine features. ''God help this child.''
 Ms. Ryan has not written a poem since she left prison. She senses a period of productivity ahead, though, one she suspects will deal with less heart-rending material. The other day, the phrase ''soaring in the sky'' popped into her head. Her next poem might begin with it.

HEADLINE: Yankees Try New Strategy To Market Premium Seats

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Yankees have hired a division of a prominent Manhattan residential real estate brokerage, Prudential Douglas Elliman, to help sell some of their prime real estate: unsold premium seats and luxury boxes at the new Yankee Stadium. 
 ''They have some customers we may not be able to reach, and they can, so we entered into a nonexclusive agreement with them,'' Randy Levine, the Yankees' president, said Tuesday. ''They have customers they have sold real estate to, or will in the future, and they can sell our seats in an innovative way.'' 
 Levine said that hiring Prudential Douglas Elliman was not an indication of a slow sales pace on high-end seats at the $1.3 billion stadium. Seven luxury suites remained to be sold, out of 59, and about 1,000 of 4,000 premium seats were available. 
 The Yankees hope Douglas Elliman will accelerate the sales of seats that range in cost from $350 to $2,500 a game. 
 ''There's been a lot of press about how expensive the premium seats are,'' said Neil Sroka, president of Douglas Elliman Worldwide Consulting, which promotes and markets real estate projects for developers. 
 He said buyers can still get a 20-game package for $7,000 a seat. 
 ''It's obtainable,'' he said. ''In this economic time, people are still looking for things to take their children or grandchildren to.'' 
 Sroka said the company will send targeted mailings to prospective customers and create special events, including one at the Super Bowl, to promote the seats and suites. 
 ''Just like everything else, in different economic times, they probably wouldn't have needed our help,'' Sroka said. He added, ''We believe we can add value to what they're doing.'' His firm is receiving a consulting fee from the Yankees. 
 Jim Grinstead, the editor and publisher of Revenues From Sports Venues, an industry newsletter, said he had never heard of real estate brokers marketing premium seating. 
 ''The Yankees are tapping into a constituency to which real estate agents have better access than Yankee executives do,'' he said. ''It's an interesting play. When people talk about pricing seats in stadiums and arenas, the phrase is 'location is everything.' ''
 With the new Yankee Stadium and the Mets' Citi Field scheduled to open in April, both teams say tickets are selling well despite the woeful economy and some higher prices. Each team hopes their gilded homes and new acquisitions (like C. C. Sabathia and Mark Teixeira by the Yankees and Francisco Rodriguez by the Mets) will buoy interest and attendance during the deepest recession in decades.
 The Mets said Tuesday they have sold just under 2 million out of a maximum 3.4 million at Citi Field, ahead of the pace for last year's final season at Shea Stadium.
 The team expected to sell more than 3 million tickets at the 45,000-seat stadium. 
 ''The general trend is very good,'' said David Howard, the Mets' executive vice president for business operations. ''The interest and demand are there, but people are definitely shopping price. It's a difficult environment, but we think we'll come close to achieving our goal over all. We're still optimistic because we have a compelling product.''
 At the Yankees' 52,325-seat stadium, the team has sold 24,564 full season-ticket packages, up from 19,400 last year. By combining full and partial packages, the team said it has sold the equivalent of 39,393 full season tickets.
 A comparable figure for 2008 was not available.
 Both teams said they have not lowered any prices to accommodate the sour economy or those fans who have to pay more to have tickets that are equivalent to where they sat at the old stadiums.
 Richie Brown of Manhattan downgraded his location at the new Yankee Stadium to pay about what he paid last year, $220 a seat -- rather than triple his cost to $650. But he would rather have kept his field-level seats. 
 ''What they should have done is like rent stabilization for people like me who've been here for more than 25 years,'' he said. ''You get marginal increases every year.''
 David Epstein, a longtime buyer of a Saturdays-only Mets package of 13 games, accepted a 15-game package (including 10 Saturdays) that took him from a loge box near home plate to left field. 
 ''I'm not satisfied at all,'' said Epstein, an NBC executive who was upset that he did not get priority location after 24 years at Shea.
 The Mets waited until December to start selling partial season-ticket packages to existing ticket holders after determining what was available after full season-ticket holders had renewed their plans. Howard said the delay upset partial season-ticket holders ''because we couldn't give them definitive answers.'' 
 The Mets are planning to start selling partial season-ticket packages to the public this week, with the sale to incumbents nearly over.
 Nick Ragone, a writer and lawyer from Jersey City, is paying $110 a ticket at Citi Field, double what he paid last season, as part of a group that will watch the Mets. 
 ''They'd better be twice as good,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Barclays to Cut 2,100 Jobs, Mostly in 2 Units

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Barclays, the British banking giant, said on Tuesday that it would cut 2,100 jobs in its investment banking and wealth management units, a stark sign that the global financial crisis continues to deepen. 
 The cuts represent 7 percent of the bankers and back-office workers in what was once a big profit center at the bank but has become a drag as banking and investment activity has ground to a halt.
 The cuts come shortly after the $1.75 billion acquisition of a part of Lehman Brothers -- a deal that Barclays' president, Robert E. Diamond Jr., hopes will vault the bank into the upper tier of global universal banks.
 Barclays Capital, the investment bank, will absorb the bulk of the job losses, 1,300 in total, while the wealth management unit will lose 500 positions and Barclays Global Investors 300. 
 The cuts are the latest to grip financial institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. Once high-flying banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and UBS, have taken a sharp knife to their investment banking divisions. With the outlook glum, analysts expect the trend to continue.
 ''We can confirm that we have begun a process to reduce head count in some parts of investment banking and investment management to ensure that we are appropriately sized, given the current market conditions,'' a spokesman for Barclays Capital, Simon Eaton, said.
 This fall, Barclays' investment banking division in the United States absorbed 10,000 employees with the acquisition from Lehman Brothers, but 3,000 jobs were subsequently cut. 
 The 1,300 layoffs are in areas hardest hit by the market slowdown -- fixed income and all areas related to the structuring and securitization of investment products. 
 While the cuts were to be expected, given the paring done by rivals of Barclays, they also highlight the challenge facing bank managers as the bank tries to expand at a time that institutions like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are becoming more conservative and risk averse. 
 In the wake of Citigroup's expected dismantling, Barclays' aggressive push to become a diversified investment bank puts it in a small group that includes Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and, to a lesser extent, HSBC.

LENGTH: 256 words

HEADLINE: Alternatively, Toyota Spreads Out

BYLINE: By REX ROY

 BODY:
INTRODUCED ON SUNDAY Toyota FT-EV Concept
 IS IT REAL? Not yet. The FT-EV looks forward to 2012.
 WHAT THEY SAID The vehicle is part of a plan ''to launch an urban commuter battery-electric vehicle by 2012. This announcement, coupled with its compressed-natural-gas-powered Camry Hybrid concept display at the 2008 Los Angeles Auto Show, signal Toyota's intention to broaden the scope of its advanced alternative-fuel vehicle development.'' 
 WHAT THEY DIDN'T SAY Toyota doesn't know whether Americans will accept the limitations of battery technology, namely the 50-mile range, when the production Toyota iQ with a 1-liter engine offers 56 miles a gallon economy with a much greater range.
 WHAT MAKES IT TICK? An electric motor generating 45 kilowatts of power allegedly pushes the FT-EV to a maximum speed of 70 miles an hour. Engineers hope to achieve a cruising range of 50 miles after a 7.5-hour lithium-ion recharge at 110 volts, or just 2.5 hours of juicing from a 220-volt outlet.
 HOW MUCH, HOW SOON? Since the FT-EV is a concept, the car you see isn't for sale. An educated guess regarding the price could begin with the iQ. In Great Britain the car starts at around $14,000 at current exchange rates. An electrified iQ might cost about this, or less, when it arrives in 2012.
 HOW'S IT LOOK? Like a car designed by Playmobil that's wearing a Power Ranger mask. Curiously, the FT-EV lacks the production iQ's attractive wrap-around rear window. The flower-bird-leaf motif obviously panders to tree huggers. Toyota can do better.

HEADLINE: Deeper Hole For Bankers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and ERIC DASH; Eric Dash reported from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even before word came on Tuesday that Citigroup might split into pieces to shore up its finances, an unpleasant message was moving through Congress and President-elect Barack Obama's transition team: the banks need more taxpayer money.
 In all likelihood, a lot more money. 
 Mr. Obama seems to know it; a week before his swearing-in, he is lobbying Congress to release the other half of the financial industry bailout fund. Democratic leaders in Congress seem to know it, too; they are urging their rank and file to act quickly to release the rescue money. And Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, certainly knows it. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke publicly made the case that one of the most unpopular and most scorned programs in Washington -- the $700 billion bailout program -- needs to pour hundreds of billions more into the very banks and financial institutions that already received federal money and caused much of the credit crisis in the first place.
 The most glaring example that the banking system needs even more help is Citigroup. Though it already has received $45 billion from the Treasury, it is in such dire straits that it is breaking itself into parts. 
 Like many banks, Citi is finding that its finances keep deteriorating as the economy continues to weaken. 
 Even some of the bailout program's harshest critics acknowledge that things most likely would be even worse without it, and that the bailout had accomplished its most important goal, which was to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system.
 Since last September, no major banks have failed and the credit markets have thawed somewhat. 
 But analysts said the problems are still acute, if less apparent on the surface. Banks have received $200 billion in fresh capital from the Treasury since last fall and have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars more from the Fed. But in the meantime, the economy fell into a severe downturn last fall that is likely to continue until at least this summer.
 Industry analysts estimate rising unemployment and business failures will lead to another $500 billion to $750 billion of losses in coming months. That could bring total losses from the credit crisis to $1.5 trillion to $1.8 trillion, twice as high as earlier estimates. 
 Citigroup is not alone. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and most other big banks all expect enormous losses as millions of consumers default on their mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans. Other losses are expected on loans made to commercial real estate developers, small businesses and for highly leveraged corporate buyout deals. 
 Mr. Bernanke bluntly warned on Tuesday that the government would probably have to infuse more money into financial institutions in the months ahead. 
 ''More capital injections and guarantees may become necessary to ensure stability and the normalization of credit markets,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the London School of Economics. 
 Mr. Bernanke, tacitly acknowledging the unpopularity of the bailout program, said the public was ''understandably concerned'' about pouring hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into financial companies -- especially when other industries were getting the cold shoulder.
 But, he insisted, there was no escape. ''This disparate treatment, unappealing as it is, appears unavoidable,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Our economic system is critically dependent on the free flow of credit.''
 Mr. Obama and his economic team have assured Congress that they would use a sizable chunk of the new money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to help distressed homeowners refinance mortgages and escape foreclosure. That would be a big shift from the Bush administration, which refused to use TARP for reducing foreclosures.
 Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's choice to head the White House National Economic Council, assured Democratic lawmakers in writing on Monday that the administration would use some of the money to help reduce foreclosures. 
 But Mr. Bernanke appears to be warning Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats that most of the remaining $350 billion -- and possibly more -- has to go to shoring up banks if they are to resume lending at normal levels.
 During the first three quarters of 2008, banks were able to raise enough capital to offset more than their hundreds of billions in losses by tapping the giant government bailout fund as well as some early private investors.
 But that was only a stopgap.
 ''The capital raises finally caught up with the losses,'' said Michael Zeltkevic, a partner at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm specializing in the finance industry. ''It doesn't make the situation better, but at least we caught up.'' 
 The new tidal wave of losses stems from the worsening economy and rising unemployment, and analysts say it will take several quarters before it peaks. 
 Regulators require banks to keep a healthy cushion of capital. But this time around, the banks are struggling to plug their deepening holes. Private investors are scarce. For all but a small group of healthy banks, bankers and analysts say, the government may be the only investor left. 
 ''Most banks are going to be in a defensive posture,'' said Christopher Whalen, a managing partner with Institutional Risk Analytics. ''You are probably not going to see the industry expand its overall balance sheet until 2010 or 2011.''
 Mr. Obama's economic team is planning a broad overhaul of the program to impose more accountability and more restrictions on executives at companies that receive government money. 
 Policy makers are also looking at reviving the original idea of TARP -- have Treasury buy up unsalable mortgage-backed securities from financial entities. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, had dropped the idea, concluding it would be more efficient to inject capital directly into banks by buying preferred shares. 
 Mr. Bernanke revived the idea, along with several other approaches, in his speech in London. So did Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a hearing on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee. He suggested the Treasury could buy the unwanted securities directly, or set up special banks to buy them. 
 Some analysts, even those who agree that the government needs to prop up the banking system with more taxpayer money, were skeptical about TARP. 
 Adam S. Posen, deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that the Bush administration had been right to inject capital into banks but wrong in not pushing banks hard enough to fix their problems or accounting. 
 ''The problem isn't that we've wasted money,'' Mr. Posen said. ''The problem is that we've put too few conditions on the banks.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Picks Nominee for Top Judge, and Objects That His Choices Included No Women

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson nominated Justice Jonathan Lippman on Tuesday to be the next chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.
 Justice Lippman, 63, the presiding justice of the First Judicial Department of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, one of the state's midlevel appeals courts, is expected to be introduced at a news conference in Albany on Wednesday.
 Despite the nomination, Mr. Paterson renewed his criticism of the selection process. 
 The Commission on Judicial Nomination gave Mr. Paterson a list of seven male candidates last month, and the governor was required to select one of them to replace Judith S. Kaye, who was the first woman on the Court of Appeals and the first female chief judge..
 ''Though I am thrilled to choose Judge Lippman to serve as our next chief judge, I firmly believe that we must revise the process for future judicial nominations to ensure that those under consideration represent all New Yorkers,'' the governor said on Tuesday. ''That is why I will propose revising the judicial nomination statute.''
 The selection process was also criticized by State Senator John L. Sampson, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said he would hold hearings concerning the criteria used by the commission in its selection process. 
 Justice Lippman's nomination needs the confirmation of the State Senate.
 As the chief judge, he would sit on the state's high court, as well as run the entire state court system, which has a budget of more than $2 billion.
 He was widely considered to be the choice favored by Ms. Kaye, who was forced to step down at the end of last year after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70. Ms. Kaye served 25 years on the court and 15 years as chief judge, the longest tenure of any chief judge in state history.
 Justice Lippman also has the support of Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly and a Manhattan Democrat.
 Justice Lippman served under Ms. Kaye as the state's chief administrative judge from 1996 through 2007. As a confidant of Ms. Kaye's, Justice Lippman is expected to continue some of the innovative approaches that Ms. Kaye championed, like drug courts and domestic violence courts.
 ''He was my vital partner in those initiatives,'' Ms. Kaye said Tuesday in an interview.
 ''I couldn't be happier,'' she added. ''I think he has a proven quality both on the judicial end and on the administrative end.''
 Ms. Kaye said Justice Lippman would be particularly effective during the economic downturn.
 ''In these very difficult times, I always relied on him for his unique familiarity with the budget,'' she said. ''He knows how every penny is spent in the court system.''
 While Ms. Kaye has been widely regarded as having reformed the courts, a major issue lingers: judicial pay raises. Judges in the state have not received a pay increase in 11 years, and Ms. Kaye filed a lawsuit last year seeking one. 
 Mr. Lippman has spent his entire legal career in the state court system. He graduated from New York University Law School in 1968 and took an entry-level court job. 
 In 1989, he became the deputy chief administrator for management support, responsible for the day-to-day management of the court system. In 1995, Gov. George E. Pataki appointed him a judge of the New York Court of Claims. In 2005, he was elected to the State Supreme Court for a 14-year term. Gov. Eliot Spitzer assigned Justice Lippman to the appellate division in May 2007.

HEADLINE: A New Yankee Stadium, The Same Old Politics

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
These may be the last days that officials in New York can make decisions about how much more help the city will give the Yankees baseball company to finish its new stadium in the Bronx -- a building with a steakhouse, a museum, more private suites and fewer ordinary seats than the old stadium, protected by moats of garages and privilege.
 On Tuesday, the comptroller said the city had made a bad deal, a complaint that the mayor's office dismissed as ''political posturing.'' 
 Without a doubt, politics is part of the invisible cost benefit analysis of the Yankees and Mets stadium deals -- not only for those who now criticize them, like the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., who approved them in 2006, but also for those few who champion them, like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 Such political values may not turn up on any public balance sheet, but it would be unwise to ignore them simply because they are invisible.
 Suppose you are Mr. Bloomberg, your hopes of becoming president or vice president all but vanished. You have to step down as mayor in 2009 because a law that you unequivocally supported says you only get two terms. 
 How handy, then, to have powerful allies, like the developer, Jerry I. Speyer and the lobbyist, Howard Rubenstein, to convince other influential people that term limits will deprive the city of an essential leader during an era of financial crisis.
 Mr. Speyer is building Yankee Stadium. Mr. Rubenstein represents the Yankees. Their stated case for Mr. Bloomberg never rested on the mayor's support for the stadium, but on his qualities as a manager and their view that he would be the most capable steward of the city during hard economic times. 
 Mr. Bloomberg not only abandoned his own emphatic support for term limits, but his own opposition to corporate welfare for professional sports. After canceling deals made by his predecessor, Mr. Bloomberg has gone on to subsidize the most expensive baseball stadiums in the country. 
 The balance sheet should reflect that Mr. Bloomberg's advocacy of the stadiums came well before he revealed that he wanted a third term in office. Moreover, his administration argues that these new deals are different and better than those made by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- that they will cost the city little and pump money and jobs into the Bronx. 
 ''The Yankees are paying for the entire construction of the new stadium -- the plasma television screens and all,'' David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, wrote in an e-mail message that took exception to a column I wrote last week about the deals. ''The more expensive stadium they build, the more debt they take on and the more money they must pay back.''
 The Yankees are indeed paying off the tax-exempt bonds that will finance the bulk of the stadium construction, but they are doing so instead of paying property taxes. 
 Moreover, the claims that the Yankees are paying for the entire construction -- trumpeted throughout the process -- rests on an illusion achieved through precision language. 
 There is far more to building a stadium than simply its construction. To replace the 22 acres of parkland the city turned over to the Yankees, to build sewers and roads that will support the stadium, the city will spend $325 million -- money that will be borrowed by the taxpayers, leaving that much less for other public projects.
 With interest, that $325 million could come to $700 million, an aide to Mr. Thompson said. The city must also pay to tear down the old stadium, a cost now put at $27 million. It is contributing $39 million toward a new Metro North station. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is paying another $52 million.) 
 Both Mr. Bloomberg and his predecessor, Mr. Giuliani, even gave the Yankees and the Mets a $5 million annual rebate on rent the teams were paying to the city for their old stadiums -- money that could have restored at least some music programs to public schools, but instead was turned back to the baseball teams for the explicit purpose of planning ballparks that the public is paying for.
 The Yankees have already received $942 million in tax-exempt financing; the team has come back for another $370 million. A hearing on the latest request will be held on Thursday at the Industrial Development Agency, which is run by nine representatives of the mayor, plus the five borough presidents and the city comptroller. 
 The city is proud of the deal, officials say, because it will create ''1,000 permanent new jobs.'' If you scratch into the official filings, it turns out that there are actually only 22 new full-time jobs expected. The rest are seasonal positions -- valuable, certainly, but only if they really exist.
 And what if the team doesn't create 1,000 new jobs? Does the city have any mechanism to hold the team accountable, to get back some of its investment?
 Asked about this on Tuesday, Mr. Lombino, the spokesman for development corporation, said there is none.
 It seems only prudent -- honest, even -- to move the promise of 1,000 new jobs onto the balance sheet of the invisible.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PLEDGES TOUGH DIPLOMACY AND A FAST START

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Helene Cooper and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday deflected calls for greater limits on her husband's fund-raising, struck a sharper tone toward Israel on violence in the Middle East and emerged from a daylong confirmation hearing headed for swift approval as secretary of state.
Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mrs. Clinton showed a mastery of the issues that won praise from her fellow lawmakers, and outlined a muscular view of American foreign policy that she said would put diplomacy front and center in the Obama administration.
On most important issues, including Iraq and Afghanistan, Mrs. Clinton broke little ground, saying that she did not want to undermine President Bush before President-elect Barack Obama took office. But she left little doubt that she intended to be in the thick of all of these issues.
''I assure you that, if I am confirmed, the State Department will be firing on all cylinders to provide forward-looking, sustained diplomacy in every part of the world,'' she said. 
Mrs. Clinton was one of five officials picked by Mr. Obama who faced hearings on Tuesday as Senate leaders laid the groundwork for confirmation votes next Tuesday.
The only testy notes in a day of cordial exchanges came when Republican senators warned that Mrs. Clinton could face conflicts of interest because of foreign donations to the charitable foundation run by her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton stood her ground, saying that restrictions hammered out between Mr. Clinton and the Obama transition team were ''probably as close as we can get'' without hampering the foundation's work.
In addressing the spiraling violence in Gaza, Mrs. Clinton spoke more fully than either she or Mr. Obama had done previously, and she seemed to part from the tone set by the Bush administration in calling attention to what she described as the ''tragic humanitarian costs'' borne by Palestinians as well as Israelis.
Mrs. Clinton said she was ''deeply sympathetic'' to Israel's right to defend itself against rocket attacks by Hamas militants from Gaza, a stance that has been central to the Bush administration's message.
But Mrs. Clinton also said that the price being paid by Palestinian civilians as well as Israelis ''must only increase our determination to seek a just and lasting peace agreement'' that included a Palestinian state. Her emphasis on the civilian costs of the violence in Gaza suggested that the incoming administration might be more inclined than President Bush has been to urge restraint on the Israelis.
The top Republican on the panel, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, was among those who expressed disappointment over Mrs. Clinton's refusal to accept further restrictions on her husband's fund-raising. But he told Mrs. Clinton that he still intended to vote in favor of her confirmation. ''Your qualifications are remarkable,'' he said.
Other senators tried with limited success to plumb how the next administration would conduct foreign policy differently from the current one.
On issues as varied as Iraq reconstruction, arms control and nuclear nonproliferation, Mrs. Clinton described a fortified State Department that would be an equal partner to the Pentagon. She noted that Robert M. Gates, who is staying on as defense secretary, has also urged that the State Department be given additional resources and that diplomats play a more active role.
Although Mrs. Clinton ranged widely in five hours of testimony, speaking in detail on topics that included the coming negotiations in Copenhagen on climate change, she acknowledged that the eruption of violence in Gaza was likely to dominate her first days as secretary of state. She reiterated her opposition to direct negotiations with Hamas unless it renounces violence and recognizes Israel.
Still, Mrs. Clinton said that ''real security for Israel, normal and positive relations with its neighbors,'' as well as genuine security for Palestinians, must continue to be America's ideal.
''As intractable as the Middle East's problems may seem -- and many presidents, including my husband, have spent years trying to help work out a solution -- we cannot give up on peace,'' she said.
Likewise, Mrs. Clinton predicted a grinding process of diplomacy with North Korea, saying the United States would continue to press the government in Pyongyang on its nuclear program through multiparty talks with China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.
Mr. Clinton did not attend the hearing, but he cast a shadow over it. His foundation, which includes several initiatives to improve health and living standards around the world, has accepted large contributions from foreign governments. Donations have included multimillion-dollar gifts from Saudi Arabia, Australia, Brunei, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, Qatar and Taiwan.
''This was bound to be a dilemma from the moment the president-elect asked you to be secretary of state,'' Mr. Lugar said.
In the day's only tough questioning, Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, challenged Mrs. Clinton to pledge that her husband's foundation would report its donations on a quarterly basis. The memorandum of understanding between Mr. Clinton and the Obama team stipulates annual disclosure.
''I really do think this poses a lot of real and perceived conflict issues,'' Mr. Vitter said.
Mrs. Clinton deflected the questions, saying, ''This is an agreement that has been worked out between all the parties.'' At one point, the committee's chairman, Senator John Kerry, intervened to dispute Mr. Vitter's claim that the Clinton Global Initiative, which is a venture of the foundation, does not disclose its donors.
Under questioning, Mrs. Clinton defended her husband's acceptance of donations from foreign governments, but pledged to keep a close eye on the issue. ''I hasten to add,'' she said, ''my career in public service is hardly free of controversy.''
The generally polite tone of the hearing was set at the start by Mr. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, who is the new chairman of the panel, but who had hoped to be picked as secretary of state himself. He said that Mrs. Clinton's ''presence overseas will send a strong signal that America is back.''
Mrs. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, sat in the row behind her.
In addressing other issues, Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Obama favored more engagement with Iran but offered no details.
She was more specific about American policy in the Darfur region of Sudan, saying that Mr. Obama might impose no-flight zones or other sanctions to rein in the actions of pro-government militia forces.
Mrs. Clinton said little about the next administration's approaches to Iraq and Afghanistan. But transition officials said that in addition to keeping Mr. Gates as defense secretary, Mr. Obama would be keeping another holdover from the Bush administration on his national security team -- Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, who will keep his job coordinating Iraq and Afghanistan policy out of the National Security Council.
In addition to her answers on foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton made it clear that the State Department would have a higher profile on economic issues, which, she noted, had implications for relations with Russia. She also laid out an ambitious agenda for working on women's health.
''Of particular concern to me,'' she said, ''is the plight of women and girls, who comprise the majority of the world's unhealthy, unschooled, unfed and unpaid.''
Mrs. Clinton noted that Mr. Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, had worked on microfinance in Indonesia and that she had been scheduled to attend a microfinance forum at the women's conference in Beijing in 1995, in which Mrs. Clinton took part. Ms. Dunham, she said, was too ill to travel.
''We will be honored to carry on Ann Dunham's work in the months and years ahead,'' Mrs. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Alone Won't End Crisis, Bernanke Says

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Julia Werdigier reported from London and Edmund L. Andrews from Washington.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned Tuesday that the highly unpopular job of using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions in the United States and other countries was far from over.
 One day after President Bush, at the request of President-elect Barack Obama, asked Congress to free up the second half of the money for the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial rescue program, Mr. Bernanke cautioned that banks and other lending institutions were still not functioning properly and would probably need additional money.
 ''More capital injections and guarantees may become necessary to ensure stability and the normalization of credit markets,'' Mr. Bernanke said during a speech at the London School of Economics. 
 Though the Fed chairman acknowledged that people in many countries were ''understandably concerned'' about pumping government money into the financial industry while often turning a cold shoulder to other sectors, he defended the effort as unpleasant but necessary.
 ''This disparate treatment, unappealing as it is, appears unavoidable,'' he said. ''Our economic system is critically dependent on the free flow of credit, and the consequences for the broader economy of financial instability are thus powerful and quickly felt.''
 Indeed, Mr. Bernanke suggested that Mr. Obama might want to revive the original idea of the rescue plan to buy unsellable mortgage-backed securities and other illiquid assets. That idea was originally the centerpiece of the program as it was first promoted by the current Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. Mr. Paulson abandoned the idea before getting started, arguing that it would be faster and more efficient to inject capital directly into the biggest banks and investment firms.
 In a separate appearance on Tuesday in Washington, the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said that financial institutions were still ''clogged'' by hard-to-sell assets and still needed help.
 Mr. Bernanke supported the efforts by Congress and President-elect Obama to put together a fiscal stimulus program worth roughly $800 billion over two years that would be weighted heavily toward big new spending on infrastructure projects, like bridges and schools, ''green'' energy projects, and expanded safety-net programs like unemployment benefits.
 Both Mr. Kohn and Mr. Bernanke seemed to be warning lawmakers that they could not focus exclusively on comparatively popular spending and tax-cut programs. 
 A stimulus package relying on extensive borrowing ''could provide a significant boost to economic activity,'' Mr. Bernanke said. But ''fiscal actions are unlikely to promote a lasting recovery unless they are accompanied by strong measures to further stabilize and strengthen the financial system.''
 Beyond buying troubled assets from banks, Mr. Bernanke said, another option is to provide asset guarantees under which the government would absorb part of the banks' losses in exchange for warrants or other forms of compensation. He also expressed support for the idea of creating a so-called bad bank that would allow the government to buy financial assets in exchange for cash or equity.
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had already done a great deal to help stimulate the economy -- like lowering its benchmark interest rate to virtually zero in December -- but that it still has ''powerful tools'' at its disposal.
 It could help lower mortgage rates by buying longer-term securities, Mr. Bernanke noted. Other tools include further lending to financial institutions and providing liquidity to investors against triple A-rated securities that are backed by recent consumer and small-business loans. 
 He argued that the Fed's approach is different from the quantitative easing policy used by the Bank of Japan from 2001 to 2006 and should be described as credit easing. Even though both methods involve the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet, the Fed's focus is on reducing credit spreads that are much wider in the United States now than was the case in Japan. 
 In his remarks, Mr. Bernanke also sought to calm concerns that the Fed's actions will fan inflation by effectively printing money. Risks of inflation remain low in the near term, he said but added that once the credit markets begin to recover the Fed will have to unwind its lending programs.
 ''To some extent, this unwinding will happen automatically,'' he said, and short-term assets can just be allowed to ''run off.'' Still, the Fed might hold on to some of the longer-term assets for a while, which could slow down efforts to shrink its balance sheet.
 The Fed chairman reiterated the need for ''stronger supervisory and regulatory systems'' while being careful not to introduce rules that would ''forfeit economic benefits of financial innovation and market discipline.'' 
 ''Even as we strive to stabilize financial markets and institutions worldwide, however, we also owe the public near-term, concrete actions to limit the probability and severity of future crises,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Budget Woes Expose Rifts Over Tobacco Money

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Gary Fineout contributed reporting from Tallahassee, Fla.

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Lawton Chiles spent his last years as governor battling Big Tobacco, pushing one of the first major cases against cigarette companies, which resulted in an endowment of almost $2 billion and a ''truth campaign'' against smoking that became a national model. 
 Now, a desperate Florida stands poised to raid the endowment, cutting it by more than half to help close a huge budget gap brought on by the economic downturn. 
 ''For the governor to say that this is just a rainy day fund is really disrespectful of my father's legacy and what he fought for,'' Lawton Chiles III, 55, son of the former governor, said of Gov. Charlie Crist. ''They're just looking to plug a hole.''
 Florida's proposed withdrawal is perhaps the starkest example of the growing addiction to tobacco-related money. Since 2001, cigarette tax increases and diversions of tobacco settlement payouts have become a favorite solution for budget crises nationwide. But as the current recession deepens, disputes about how the money should be spent have intensified, even as tobacco money's potency has been weakened by past use. 
 ''While states have viewed tobacco as the first 'go to' tax for the better part of a decade, it won't be anywhere near enough,'' said Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a research arm of the State University of New York. ''Increases in other taxes -- yet to be proposed and enacted -- will be far larger than in the last recession, and the relative importance of tobacco tax increases will be less.''
 At least 17 states, including California and New York, have already sold bonds based on future tobacco settlement payouts and spent some or all of the money before they have it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Moreover, cigarette taxes are also less lucrative than they were a decade ago because cigarette sales in the United States have dropped by more than 20 percent.
 Nonetheless, two weeks into the year, conservative, tobacco-friendly states like Kentucky, Georgia and Mississippi are considering sizable tax increases on cigarettes, while some with liberal Democratic governors -- including Michigan, Ohio and New Mexico -- are looking at ways to redirect tobacco settlement money to close budget gaps or for economic stimulus packages. 
 Florida lawmakers have considered both options. The state is being squeezed more than most by the vise of falling revenue and rising demand for services. In some counties, the number of families receiving food stamps has jumped more than 50 percent over the last year, while Florida's real estate collapse has brought an especially steep slide in income.
 Mr. Crist, a Republican, has already overseen $6 billion in cuts from the state's $66 billion budget in the last year. Lawmakers meeting this week for a special session to deal with a new $2.4 billion deficit, which is expected to grow, have proposed an additional $1 billion or so in cuts. They are also calling for increases in traffic fines and raiding reserves to pay for affordable housing and other programs. 
 Yet the proposal to tap the Chiles Endowment has stirred up the most debate. It pits the state's Republican leaders, with their stated aversion to new taxes, against the relatives of a populist Democratic governor and health advocates nationwide who have rarely been pleased with where tobacco money goes. 
 In Florida and many other states, tobacco money has often been used like an inheritance from a distant uncle. A 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office found that only a third of the settlement money paid out nationally from 2000 to 2005 went to health care or tobacco control. 
 Mr. Chiles, a Democrat who was elected governor twice, was an anomaly, not only because he pushed Florida to settle its cigarette case a year ahead of the 1998 master settlement, for $11.3 billion, but also because he allocated large parts of early installments to the prevention of smoking. 
 Mr. Chiles died in office in 1998. The next year, the Legislature cut financing for his antismoking campaign by nearly half, but Gov. Jeb Bush pushed to set up the endowment in Mr. Chiles's name, with an initial investment of $1.1 billion and three $200 million deposits to follow. 
 The endowment was intended to live beyond the settlement's tenure. By law, investment income would support ''health and human services programs for children and elders,'' which has amounted to about $55 million annually in recent years. 
 Peter Fisher, an expert on state tobacco laws at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said Ohio might be the only other state with a similar entity -- the Ohio Tobacco Prevention Foundation. And this, too, Mr. Fisher said, is in jeopardy. 
 Last year, Ohio enacted a law to clean out its account, with $230 million of its $270 million going to an economic stimulus package and the rest for health care. The foundation sued, arguing that the money could be used only for tobacco prevention; the account has been frozen as the dispute plays out in court. 
 That may be where the Chiles Endowment also lands. Mr. Chiles's relatives, who have no formal control over the endowment, say they have tried to be understanding. Last spring, when Mr. Crist asked the former governor's 78-year-old widow, Rhea Chiles, if the state could borrow $354 million from the endowment, Mrs. Chiles gave her approval. 
 Mr. Crist later offered to host a dinner in her honor. But by then, the relationship had curdled. ''It was already clear that they were going to come back and look at another hit on the fund,'' said Mr. Chiles, whose father also served three terms in the United States Senate. 
 His mother refused the invitation. In a letter dated June 11, Mrs. Chiles told the governor that ''when, in two years, this loan is fully repaid to the fund, I will be greatly relieved and most happy to celebrate with you.'' 
 They have not spoken since, according to Mr. Chiles. He said his family feared that another major withdrawal would decimate the endowment. 
 State lawmakers say they want an additional $700 million, more than half of the endowment's current $1.2 billion value. The money would be taken out in June, and Mr. Crist has said that less may be needed, depending on whether all or part of a proposed federal economic stimulus can be treated as general revenue. 
 ''I'd rather not to have to use it,'' the governor said in a recent conversation with reporters, referring to the endowment. ''That money will be repaid; I think that's an important point to make.''
 Yet on this issue, the measure is vague; the final version scheduled for a vote Wednesday says only that ''it is the intent'' of the Legislature to pay back the money once general revenue receipts grow by 5 percent a year. 
 Mr. Chiles said he doubted it would ever be returned, even if the federal stimulus package came through. ''That's contrary to what the Obama administration is trying to do,'' he said. ''They're trying to get a stimulus out, not to refill a fiscal hole.'' 
 He said his family was thinking of suing. Several lawyers who were involved in the state's original tobacco litigation have already lent their support. If they go to court, they plan to argue that raiding the endowment violates the law that set it up with a specific purpose. 
 ''We're near the bottom in all these indicators of children's health, and we're one of the largest, wealthiest states,'' Mr. Chiles said, adding, ''It's part of a pattern: 'Let's patch this up and get out of town before the chickens come home to roost.' ''

HEADLINE: Wine Auctions Become a Buyer's Market

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
IF you haven't heard, the economy flamed out, the stock market nose-dived and year-end bonuses evaporated. Here's what this means if you love older, hard-to-find wines: things are looking up.
 Unless you have come upon an inheritance or have been buying wines in quantity for years, you, like most people who have an interest in older wines, depend on the auction market for access to properly aged bottles. 
 Not that ordinary wine drinkers are rushing to put in their bids on legendary vintages, but many restaurants or wine shops that sell older vintages get much of their stock through auctions or sales of private cellars.
 Here's where the economy comes in. After several years in which wine prices shot up like Google's initial public offering, auction prices have plunged in recent months. Jamie Ritchie, senior vice president for wine at Sotheby's in New York, estimates prices have dropped 25 to 50 percent since last summer. John Kapon, president and auction director at Acker Merrall & Condit, put it at 20 to 40 percent, and Jeff Zacharia, president of Zachys Wine Auctions, at 30 percent. 
 ''It's kind of a buyer's dream right now,'' said Daniel Johnnes, wine director for Daniel Boulud's restaurant group, who trawls auctions for older vintages to add to his lists. ''Now, the opportunity is for extraordinary value.''
 Whoa there, Hoss, don't roll out the auction buggy just yet. We're still talking about an expensive business. A $20 million apartment that has lost half its value is still $10 million. If you're like me, bedeviled by tuition bills and other accounts payable, you may want to redouble your attendance at Auctions Anonymous meetings. But if you have some spending money, now is a great time to investigate what's available.
 In the wispy stratosphere of top Bordeaux and Burgundies, prices are still astronomical, but definitely down. Chateau Haut-Brion 1989, which Mr. Ritchie said was selling for $20,000 a case in November 2007, is now about $9,500 a case, though still up from the $5,000 a case cost in 2004. Meanwhile, those who in 2005 paid $6,500 for a mere bottle of 1990 Romanee-Conti from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti might even consider drinking that bottle since the $22,000 it would have fetched in October 2007 is now down to about $8,000.
 For Mr. Johnnes, the real action has been below the top tier, where he said he's found good deals in older bottles of Rhone reds and lesser-known Bordeaux labels. At Cafe Boulud he's selling bottles of 1985 Clos du Marquis, the second label of Leoville-Las-Cases, for $205, while at Bar Boulud he's added five vintages from 1985 to 1991 of Alain Voge Cornas Vieilles Vignes for $180 to $230. While these bottles are not inexpensive, it's worth considering that a 2005 Vieilles Vignes would probably cost at least $150 on a restaurant list.
 ''It's an opportunity for us to put mature bottles on the wine list and to pass the economy on to the consumer,'' Mr. Johnnes said.
 At this, relatively speaking, down-to-earth level, ordinary consumers can begin to conceive of getting in on the action. The catalog for Acker Merrall's next New York auction, to be held Jan. 28, reveals more than a few temptations. A case of 2005 Corton-Charlemagne from Bouchard Pere et Fils does not exactly offer mature bottles, but it's an exceptional wine and an excellent deal at its estimated range of $750 to $900.
 For something older, how about six bottles of 1964 Barbaresco from Angelo Gaja, estimated range $500 to $650? It was a fine vintage in Piedmont, and historic in the sense that Mr. Gaja had taken over the winemaking from his father in 1962. By the way, if you wanted to taste the last Barbaresco vintage of Gaja senior, six bottles of Gaja 1961 will cost you a little more, estimated range $1,200 to $1,500. 
 An auction itself can be a heady experience. Justin Chearno, the wine buyer and manager at Uva Wines, a small but selective shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, attended a Zachys auction held late last year at Daniel in New York. He decided to attend the auction with his boss, who usually handles acquisitions of high-end collector wines.
 ''I was really curious about that world, if only because I heard the buffet was so good at Daniel,'' he said. He watched as his boss bid and lost on cases of wine that went for thousands of dollars, outside Uva's budget. Suddenly, a case of 1988 Hermitage from Jean-Louis Chave came up for bidding, at a price lower than anything else in the auction, and Mr. Chearno felt a call to action, not for Uva but for himself.
 ''Before I knew it I started bidding on it,'' he said. ''I got it for $1,800 and felt really good about it. It was the cheapest thing.''
 Cheapness, of course, is relative, especially when you figure in what Mr. Chearno calls the Swinging the Heavy Bat theory. Watching far more expensive lots go by, Mr. Chearno said, he felt like a baseball player warming up to hit by swinging a weighted bat. When the less-expensive lot appeared, bidding became almost too easy. ''You take that weight off and it feels like you're swinging nothing,'' he said.
 It turned out he swung a little too hard. Not really wanting to spend $1,800 after the fact, he found a friend who took half the case for $900. Another person bought three of the remaining bottles for $200 apiece, leaving him with three bottles of '88 Chave Hermitage for $300. ''It's a wonderful wine, and I feel like I got a really great deal,'' he said.
 Not everybody will play it as cannily as Mr. Chearno, but the opportunities are there. 
 ''The one thing that the world has proven to us is that when things go down, they only go up higher than ever before,'' said Mr. Kapon of Acker Merrall. ''I don't see why this particular situation would be any different.''

HEADLINE: Obama Nominees Face Committees on Capitol Hill: Peter R. Orszag

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Peter R. Orszag, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for budget director, called for urgent action at his confirmation hearing to ''jump-start the economy out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression'' and said the new administration wanted $775 billion to $800 billion for public works, transportation and other projects. 
 But Mr. Orszag warned the Senate Budget Committee that even without new stimulus spending, the federal budget deficit in the current fiscal year was ''likely to exceed $1 trillion -- more than 8 percent of gross domestic product and the largest in our history with the exception of the Civil War and the two World Wars.''
 And under current policies, the government faces years of red ink -- budget deficits equal to 5 percent of the gross domestic product over the next 5 to 10 years, Mr. Orszag said. The deficit last reached 5 percent of the G.D.P. in 1986 and has not exceeded 4 percent in any year since 1992.
 Mr. Orszag, chosen to be director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, worked closely with members of both parties as director of the Congressional Budget Office from January 2007 to November 2008, and he faced a largely friendly audience on Tuesday. He said he hoped to ''continue that spirit of bipartisanship.''
 Without action by Congress to solve the current slump, he said, ''the gap between how much the economy could produce each year and how much is actually being produced amounts to roughly $1 trillion a year -- an average of about $12,000 a year for a family of four.'' 
 At present, the United States has ''significant maneuvering room'' because it can borrow money at low interest rates, Mr. Orszag said, and ''our debt is viewed as the safest investment in the world.''
 But, he said, if the United States continues to spend beyond its means, ''that perception could shift,'' and that ''could not only trigger a fiscal crisis, but also severely limit our ability to respond flexibly to any future economic difficulties.''
 The principal cause of the nation's long-term budget problems, Mr. Orszag said, is rising health costs. He suggested several steps to increase the efficiency of the health care system: greater use of health information technology, research comparing the effectiveness of different treatments, and new incentives for disease prevention, ''healthy living'' and ''better care rather than more care.'' But he said it might be years before the returns on such investments showed up in a significant way. ROBERT PEAR

HEADLINE: Democrats See Progress On Proposal For Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After lunch at the Capitol with President-elect Barack Obama, Senate Democrats said that the proposed $800 billion economic recovery plan was on track for passage by mid-February, and that the incoming administration had agreed to substantially increase the amount of money in the package for energy-related tax breaks. 
 The overwhelmingly positive tone of the meeting -- the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, called it a ''love-fest'' -- suggested that Mr. Obama was enjoying some success in pushing the centerpiece of his agenda: a giant one-two punch of tax cuts and government spending intended to jolt the moribund economy back to life. 
 But it was also clear that tough negotiations lie ahead. Mr. Obama has told Republicans he is open to suggestions, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said his conference would urge Mr. Obama to consider a two-year suspension of payroll taxes to benefit individuals and corporations. 
 Mr. McConnell said Senate Republicans were intensely interested in the idea, which was presented at their own weekly lunch by Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was President Bush's top economic adviser from 2001 to 2002, and John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. 
 Mr. Obama met with his former Senate colleagues for an hour, spending much of the time taking questions in front of a portrait of George Washington. At one point, uneasy with the formalities, he urged the senators not to call him Mr. President-elect. ''Come on, guys,'' he said, ''I'm Barack until next week.''
 In addition to pushing the recovery package, Mr. Obama also pressed for the release of the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund. Many lawmakers, angry over how the bailout has been managed, have said they are reluctant to grant the request. 
 Congress can block the money with votes by both chambers. At the lunch, Mr. Obama said he would respond with a veto. 
 The president-elect and Congressional Democrats have worked carefully over the last two weeks to avoid much of a paper trail on Capitol Hill, even as they have begun intense negotiations over components of the stimulus plan, of which 60 percent will be new spending and 40 percent will be tax cuts. 
 ''We deliberately did not come to the Hill with a plan on paper from beginning to end, saying, 'This is the Obama plan, you have to do this,' '' said an Obama transition official who spoke anonymously to avoid complicating the talks. ''We came to the Hill with a series of suggestions.'' 
 The precise details of what amounts to about $480 billion in spending and $320 billion in tax cuts will be hammered out over the next four weeks, with the most arduous haggling and lobbying expected to kick into high gear after the inauguration.
 According to lawmakers, however, parts of the plan have already taken shape. 
 Officials said House and Senate Democrats had tentatively settled on $87 billion in additional aid to help states cover rising Medicaid costs, and $80 billion in grants to cover state and local education expenses. 
 After Senate Democrats complained last week that the tax package proposed by the Obama team did not focus enough on job creation or on the energy sector, lawmakers said that the incoming administration had agreed to drop a proposed $3,000 tax credit per new employee and to add more energy-related tax breaks. 
 Lawmakers said the energy tax provisions would now total more than $20 billion, including incentives for the production of energy from renewable sources, like wind, as well as added tax breaks for energy conservation. 
 Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said she hoped the package would include as much as $2 billion to encourage the production of lithium-ion batteries for use in automobiles. 
 House and Senate Democrats were also debating the merits of some business tax breaks that the Obama team had proposed, including allowing companies to speed the depreciation of capital investments and applying current losses to prior years' income to claim tax benefits. 
 Some lawmakers would like to remove one or both of those tax breaks in favor of a roughly $75 billion provision to spare millions of middle-class Americans in 2009 from having to pay the alternative minimum tax, which applies when tax filers do not pay enough taxes to meet certain thresholds under the traditional income tax system. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that House Democrats had at least agreed to include the A.M.T. fix. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said he had won some support for a $3,000 college tuition tax credit.

HEADLINE: Obama Nominees Face Committees on Capitol Hill: Shaun Donovan

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE

 BODY:
Members of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday urged President-elect Barack Obama's nominee as housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, to be aggressive in fighting home foreclosures and in shaping responses toward the broader economic crisis. 
 Talk of metaphorical tables dominated the confirmation hearing, with a consensus that he deserved seats at the really important ones.
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development ''has been sitting at the kids' table, and it is time for that to change,'' said Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey.
 Get ''a seat at the main table -- insist on it,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida. 
 For Mr. Donovan, a New York City housing official, it was a warm welcome that may portend a more influential role for the head of a department often described as a backwater.
 As waves of foreclosures increased over the last year, the housing department has taken a low-profile role, overshadowed not only by the Treasury Department but also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 One senator after another praised Mr. Donovan's resume, which includes two graduate degrees from Harvard (in public policy and architecture), a stint at HUD and four years as commissioner of housing preservation and development under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 ''He's far more qualified than I was,'' said Senator Martinez, who served as President Bush's first housing secretary.
 Plenty of problems await. ''The housing crisis has shaken not only the foundation of our economy, but the foundation of the American dream,'' Mr. Donovan said.
 The department's main program to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, Hope for Homeowners, is widely viewed as a failure. Mr. Donovan noted that while it was supposed to help 400,000 people, it received only about 100 applications in its first month.
 Several senators expressed concern about the Federal Housing Administration's insurance program for single-family homes. And there are the chronic HUD problems: a maintenance backlog at public housing that approaches $30 billion, homelessness and outdated computer systems that can make budgeting all but impossible.
 If confirmed as expected, Mr. Donovan, 42, would have an automatic place on the boards that oversee the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, an economic recovery fund, and the agency for restructuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the home loan repurchase giants.
 Those are seats at two important tables. JASON DePARLE

HEADLINE: A Stimulus Plan That Values Learning

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Tax Cuts for Teachers,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Jan. 11):
 Mr. Friedman is right. America must invest in its people.
 If President-elect Barack Obama hopes for technology and innovation to jump-start our nation's economy, he will have to expand federal financing for scientific research through agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
 In particular need of increased federal assistance are fellowships to support graduate studies, like the graduate research fellowship awarded by the N.S.F. The program's alumni have included more than 20 Nobel laureates, as well as a co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin. 
 As research institutions across the country slash their budgets, the nation's ability to maintain its scientific edge is tied ever more closely to government financing. Federal support is necessary to spur American innovation, train the next generation of American scientists, and combat climate change and disease.
 Let's start investing in our people -- it's one investment that is sure to outperform the stock market.
 Andrew L. Chang
 Stanford, Calif., Jan. 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman's proposal to eliminate federal income taxes for all public schoolteachers is a refreshingly creative and workable idea. It's relatively easy to put into effect, shows teachers that we appreciate them in a tangible way and has broad appeal, including for conservative tax-cutters.
 Fred Haag 
 Burnt Hills, N.Y., Jan. 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Eliminating federal income taxes for public schoolteachers, as Thomas L. Friedman proposes, would do nothing to increase the perceived value of teachers or address their strategic position. 
 If such a proposal were put into effect with no defined minimum salary, market pressures would give municipalities the opportunity to cut teacher salaries until their take-home pay was the same as before the income taxes were eliminated, with the savings most likely going into reduced local taxes. 
 The net result would be a further corrupted tax system. John Hutson 
 Santa Clara, Calif., Jan. 11, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman wants to ''double the salaries of all highly qualified math and science teachers'' to encourage more people to become teachers and help make the United States more innovative. 
 But without highly qualified language arts teachers to teach students to read and comprehend increasingly complex material and how to communicate it clearly to others (and, preferably, in more than just the English language), and without highly qualified social studies teachers to teach students about the global economy and the diverse societies around the world with whom we must interact, knowledge of math, science and technology in and of themselves will not increase American competitiveness. 
 To accomplish that, the salaries of all teachers should be raised, since all subjects are equally vital in stimulating students' minds. Susan L. Schwartz 
 Haverhill, Mass., Jan. 11, 2009
 The writer is a public schoolteacher in Methuen, Mass.
 To the Editor:
 Here is a math problem. Subtract the number of hours that a typical math teacher spends outside of school grading student work, tutoring and preparing for class from those spent by a typical English teacher. 
 As the wife of an English teacher and a teacher myself, I can tell you that the number of hours that an exemplary English teacher must volunteer of his or her own time in order to teach the essential skills of literacy and writing far exceeds that which we ask other teachers to contribute.
 As someone who is not opposed to the idea of merit pay, I would suggest that exemplary math and science teachers be rewarded for their work. But to pay people differently based on their title or perceived value at a given political moment, and not based on their work, effort or skill at teaching, is blatantly unfair. Lauren Friend

HEADLINE: Few Specifics From Education Pick

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Arne Duncan, the Chicago schools chief, told the Senate on Tuesday that he would work for ''real and meaningful change'' in the nation's schools if confirmed as education secretary and said he hoped President-elect Barack Obama's example as a model student could inspire millions of American children.
 ''Never before has being smart been so cool,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 But in a confirmation hearing before the Senate education committee, Mr. Duncan did little to resolve the curiosities of educators and policymakers about how he and Mr. Obama intend to bring about change in American education, or about what kind of rewrite they will support for the Bush-era No Child Left Behind law, the most important statement of federal policy on public schools.
 ''I have seen the law's power and its limitations,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''I agree with the president-elect that we should neither bury N.C.L.B. nor praise it without reservation.'' 
 He laid out a thoroughly pragmatic agenda, vowing ''to scale up what works'' to raise student achievement. He said the Obama administration intended to expand early childhood programs, encourage charter schools, improve teacher training and recruitment, reduce the high school dropout rate and increase college access. He called education a moral obligation, an economic imperative and ''the civil rights issue of our generation.'' 
 Mr. Duncan, 44, walked a careful line among factions of the nation's educational reform movement, neither fully endorsing nor rejecting those who want to squeeze teachers harder to raise student achievement, nor a rival wing that contends schools alone cannot close achievement gaps between poor and affluent students without broader investments in school-based health clinics and other social programs.
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who was chairman of the hearing in place of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, predicted that Mr. Duncan would receive a unanimous vote of approval, and none of the dozen senators present disagreed.
 ''I think you're the best,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander, one of several Republican senators who praised Mr. Duncan's record as chief executive of the nation's third largest school district. ''I hope I still think that a year from now.''
 Mr. Duncan only rarely tilted his hand on changes he may seek in the No Child law. He praised provisions that require schools to break out test scores for all student groups, thus enabling educators to focus on achievement gaps between minority and white students. But he said the law should not sanction schools where only a few students are behind academically.
 ''To label a school a failure because of one child -- there's a lack of logic behind that,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''Let's not take too blunt an instrument to an entire school.''
 Mr. Duncan's friendship with Mr. Obama began in pickup basketball games but blossomed seven years ago when he became Chicago's top school official, and Mr. Obama began to use him as a sounding board for education reform ideas.
 Mr. Duncan played basketball while attending Harvard University in the 1980's, and for several years after college he played professionally in Australia, where he met his wife, Karen. She sat behind him at the hearing, between their 4-year-old son, Ryan, and 7-year-old daughter, Claire. Ryan read to himself quietly during much of the hearing, drawing the attention of Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska.
 ''My first impressions are very strong and very favorable,'' Senator Murkowski told Mr. Duncan. ''I'm glad to see that your boy is there reading books instead of playing with an electronic gadget.''
 The hearing involved a string of similarly glowing endorsements from senators on both sides of the political aisle.
 Last summer, rival groups of educators circulated competing educational manifestos. One, which included some former leaders of Teach for America, espoused a get-tough policy based partly on pressing teachers and administrators to dramatically improve student achievement. Another faction argued that schools alone could not close America's racial acheivement gap and urged new investments in school-based social programs to help poor students learn. Mr. Duncan was the only big city superintendent to sign both manifestoes.
 In the hearing, Mr. Duncan warmly endorsed Teach for America and its founder, Wendy Kopp, as well as the larger movement of social entrepreneurs seeking to improve public education through tactics like founding charter schools and seeking to end teacher tenure. He called himself a ''big supporter'' of charter schools. But he warned that only thoroughly qualified educators should be allowed to open charter schools, which receive public money but enjoy less governmental oversight than traditional public schools. 
 ''This is not let a thousand flowers bloom,'' Mr. Duncan said. 
 And he also endorsed turning public schools into community centers that provide social and health services to needy students.
 ''The more our schools can become community centers,'' Mr. Duncan said, ''the better we'll do.'' Public schools, he said, should be ''open not 6 hours but 12 hours a day.''

HEADLINE: Bush's Final News Conference, and His Legacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mistakes, I've Made a Few, Bush Tells Reporters'' (front page, Jan. 13):
 First, a ''few'' is an understatement. 
 Second, President Bush tells us of the climate of fear that existed after the 9/11 attacks in which his policies were forged. President Bush stoked the fires of fear like an artist to deceitfully force his agenda to attack Iraq on the nation. 
 I agree with President Bush that we must not forget -- not forget and allow our president to use fear to lead!
 Brant Thomas
 Brooklyn, Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 President Bush's defense of his pursuit of the war on terror is emblematic of his vigilance to hold steady to this misguided course, and for that, he does not atone. While he gives a nod to lesser errors, the days of the Bush presidency are haunted by the following laments: 
 A lament for the war dead, and for the Iraqi families that have gone without food, water and electricity, even as the largest American embassy took root from the desert floor and United States companies bided their time while oil contracts were set up for their taking; 
 A wail for the quiet erosion of the Constitution, the privacy of citizens, and those interned and tortured without trial or hope;
 A cry for the eviscerated social programs failing the American people, and the debt that saddles the future;
 And a tear for the earth, cordoned from the caution of science and left, wounded, to its own overwhelmed defense. Nancy Dickeman
 Seattle, Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 George W. Bush's performance -- for indeed, that is what it was -- on Monday at his final scheduled news conference would have made for fine theater if it had been fictional. Sadly, it was real -- or at least as real as this president would allow it to be. The level of self-rationalization, defiance, willful ignorance and simple denial was extraordinary. 
 Here is a president whose most significant legacy was to plunge our country into a devastating and unnecessary war in Iraq, one that has made the Middle East demonstrably more unsafe while demolishing our standing in the world; and who has devastated our economy, our civil liberties and the very sense of commonwealth that has held this country together. 
 And yet, as he has said in interviews, he exits with his ''head held high.'' 
 May we never be subjected to such an arrogant, ignorant man as our president again. Mark Hagland
 Chicago, Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Say what you will about George W. Bush's place in history, he managed to accomplish the most amazing feat of positive change for our culture since women and blacks were given the right to vote: thanks to Mr. Bush's incompetence, America voted overwhelmingly to elect Barack Obama and give the Democrats control over Congress. 
 And for that, Mr. Bush, we thank you.

2ND AVENUE DELI,
 No. 2 ... or Is It 3?
 The first new Second Avenue Deli is not on Second Avenue, but rather off of Third Avenue, on 33rd Street. A second new Second Avenue Deli will be similarly misnamed, as it seems headed to First Avenue, at 75th Street. (Though, if you average them, you get Second Avenue.) 
 Jeremy Lebewohl confirmed that his family was in advanced discussions to buy the building at 1442 First Avenue, the current home of the Wicked Wolf bar, whose owners are retiring, said Mr. Lebewohl, a nephew of Abe Lebewohl, the owner of the original deli. 
 In the ideal world, he said, the deli would open before the Jewish High Holy Days in September. However, he warned, ''With all my experience with construction, there are unforeseen problems.''
 Given the economy, the planned expansion uptown is not purely a bottom-line decision, Mr. Lebewohl said, noting that the businesses were in memory of his uncle. ''The first restaurant was a tribute to him, and the second one, too,'' he said. 
 The original deli, in the East Village, operated from 1954 to early 2006 before the 33rd Street location opened in 2007.
 The family has been looking to expand for a while, focusing on the Upper East Side, home to much of its clientele. Many of the deli's customers complain that 33rd Street is still too far to go for matzo ball soup and kugel: ''We New Yorkers are spoiled,'' Mr. Lebewohl said. ''To go from Midtown to the Upper East Side might as well be another city.'' JENNIFER 8. LEE 
 A CITY-CENTRIC LIST
 For the New Chief
 President-elect Barack Obama is still a week away from taking the oath of office, but a research group in Manhattan already has a to-do list for him. 
 The group, the Center for an Urban Future, released a report Tuesday with 51 recommendations for Mr. Obama. 
 The report, ''50+1: A Federal Agenda for New York City,'' lays out a mostly unsurprising agenda that liberal groups have advocated, including, for example, expanding the federal earned-income tax credit, providing universal health insurance and giving more money to Amtrak for intercity rail service. 
 But a few of the recommendations are intriguing, at least in terms of how they would directly affect the city.
 For example, the group calls for including more ferry projects in transportation infrastructure plans; expanding the dredging of New York City's waterways; creating a large national initiative to retrofit older buildings to be more energy efficient; altering the No Child Left Behind Act; and creating a nationwide strategy to combat obesity.

HEADLINE: Treasury Nomination Hits Snag Over Issue of Past Unpaid Taxes

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Timothy F. Geithner, President-elect Barack Obama's choice for Treasury secretary, failed to pay more than $34,000 in federal taxes over several years early this decade, and also faces questions about the employment papers of a former household employee, suddenly complicating what had seemed to be an easy confirmation process in the Senate.
 Mr. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, huddled privately with members of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday afternoon to explain that he had now paid the back taxes and interest. Senate Democratic leaders quickly released statements of support lest the controversy threaten the nomination.
 Two senior Senate Republicans likewise gave endorsements, echoing the argument of Obama transition officials that Mr. Geithner's failures were innocent mistakes or technicalities. 
 The Finance Committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, tentatively scheduled a hearing on Mr. Geithner's nomination for Friday, though it would be delayed until next week if any members of the panel objected. Any delay would raise the prospect that Mr. Geithner might not be confirmed in time to take office on Tuesday, when Mr. Obama will be sworn in.
 At the least, the flap is a major embarrassment for the man chosen to head the Treasury Department, which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, especially as Mr. Geithner worked at the Treasury under three presidents. And it is the latest of several stumbles by the previously smooth-running Obama transition office -- the most serious being the withdrawal of Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico as the choice for commerce secretary because of questions over state contracts and political contributions.
 In Mr. Geithner's case, he has paid a total of $43,200 in back taxes and interest for underpayments from 2001 to 2004, according to the Obama transition office. The Finance Committee disclosed that he paid a slightly higher total of $48,268, which includes payments on unrelated tax liabilities the committee uncovered. 
 The issue involving a former housekeeper of the Geithner family is separate. The woman was in the country legally and was authorized to work when Mr. Geithner and his wife hired her in 2004, but her employment authorization expired three months before she quit working for them. The issue was discovered by the Senate Finance Committee, not by the Obama team, and it came as news to Mr. Geithner, according to a Democrat who was briefed on the situation.
 The more serious questions surround the previously unpaid taxes. The bulk of them were detected in 2006 after an audit by the Internal Revenue Service for 2003 and 2004, and Mr. Geithner paid back taxes and interest then for those years.
 In November the Obama vetting team found other unpaid taxes for 2001 and 2002, and Mr. Geithner immediately paid those plus interest when the matter was brought to his attention, transition officials said. 
 The underpayments all involve Mr. Geithner's income as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003, including a small payment in 2004 after he had left. Mr. Geithner worked there after leaving the Treasury, where he had risen to under secretary for international affairs in the Clinton administration, and before becoming president of the New York Fed, a post that has put him at the center of the economic crisis.
 The I.M.F., as an international organization, does not withhold payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare from its American employees' paychecks. Those workers are required to pay the roughly 15 percent tax themselves, as if they were self-employed.
 However, the I.M.F. does pay its American workers an amount equal to an employer's half of the payroll taxes, with the expectation that they will use that to pay the I.R.S. The organization also gives them quarterly wage statements that include United States tax liabilities. 
 Mr. Geithner fully paid his state and federal income taxes. In failing to pay his payroll taxes, he in effect kept the money the I.M.F. had contributed toward his liability. However, Mr. Geithner's accountant told him he was exempt from self-employment taxes, according to Obama transition officials. 
 As Obama officials pointed out, and I.R.S. documents attest, the failure to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes is common among Americans who work for international organizations, including foreign embassies. A 2007 I.R.S. notice reported that up to half of such employees incorrectly file their tax returns.
 The I.R.S. waived penalties for Mr. Geithner in 2006, according to an account provided by the transition office and the Senate committee. A three-year statute of limitations had precluded the agency from auditing the 2001 and 2002 tax returns, a committee aide said. 
 Mr. Geithner volunteered to amend the earlier returns and pay the taxes and interest, a total of $25,970, after Mr. Obama indicated that he wanted to nominate him for the Treasury job, according to the account. Mr. Obama announced the nomination in Chicago on Nov. 24, three days after the issue had come to Mr. Geithner's attention.
 That chronology raises the question, however, of why Mr. Geithner did not voluntarily correct the earlier nonpayment of self-employment taxes after the 2006 I.R.S. audit identified the problem for 2003 and 2004.
 Late Tuesday, Republican and Democratic sources were still predicting that Mr. Geithner would be confirmed. Before the tax disclosures, the toughest questions he was expected to face were over his role in the government's bailout program for financial institutions. 
 The Senate Finance Committee has known about the tax matters since Dec. 5, and staff members have reviewed Mr. Geithner's tax records and interviewed three of his accountants and an I.M.F. representative.
 Mr. Geithner met with committee staff members on Dec. 19 to answer questions about the taxes on his I.M.F. income and about other relatively minor issues the staff had found. Those issues, for which Mr. Geithner recently paid $4,334 in back taxes and $1,232 in interest, include his mistaken claim of the dependent care credit on his income taxes for the costs of sleep-away camps in three years. The Geithners have two teenage children.
 After Mr. Geithner's meeting with senators on Tuesday, Mr. Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, issued a statement calling the nominee the ''right person to help lead our economic recovery during these challenging times.'' It continued: ''He's dedicated his career to our country and served with honor, intelligence and distinction. That service should not be tarnished by honest mistakes, which, upon learning of them, he quickly addressed.''
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, restated his support, as did other Democrats. The senior Republican on the Finance Committee, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, declined to take a position, but two others from his party stood behind Mr. Geithner.
 ''I still support him,'' Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah said. ''He's a very, very competent guy.'' 
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, called the matter ''a lot to do about nothing.'' 
 ''I just find it to be really unfortunate,'' Mr. Gregg said, ''because here is an extraordinarily qualified guy who we really do want to have in leadership here in Washington.''

HEADLINE: Technical Adviser Said to Be Choice for F.C.C. Chairman

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON--President-elect Barack Obama intends to nominate Julius Genachowski, an adviser on technology issues and a longtime friend, to become the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, advisers to Mr. Obama said.
Mr. Genachowski, 46, played a leading role in the Obama campaign's highly successful online strategy and was a major fundraiser for the campaign. He and Mr. Obama both attended Columbia, though they were in different classes. They became friendly at Harvard Law School, where they both served in top positions at the Harvard Law Review . They have also been basketball buddies.
During the campaign Mr. Genachowski shaped many of Mr. Obama's telecommunications and technology policies. He advocated an open Internet in the debate over so-called net neutrality, and media ownership rules that promoted a diversity of voices on the airwaves. 
While it is difficult to predict what direction Mr. Genachowski will take the commission, an analysis by Stifel Nicolaus, an investment firm, said that it expected that ''the regulatory initiative is likely to shift'' away from some from incumbent -- like the large telephone companies -- to new entrants and other ''nontraditional telecom and media players'' including such companies as Google, Yahoo and eBay.
It speculated that Mr. Genachowski would seek to spur competition among the wireless carriers as a counterbalance to the dominance of the telephone and cable companies. And it said that Mr. Genachowski is unlikely to be as aggressive in his approach to regulating the cable industry as the current chairman, Kevin J. Martin, has been.
Mr. Martin has not set a departure date, although he is widely expected to step down soon. If he leaves before Mr. Genachowski's confirmation, then Mr. Obama is expected to name one of the two remaining Democratic commissioners -- Michael J. Copps or Jonathan S. Adelstein -- as interim chairman.
People involved in the transition said that Mr. Genachowski was a top candidate for both F.C.C. chairman and a new White House position overseeing technology issues that has not yet been fully defined.
If confirmed, one of his first challenges at the commission would be the conversion to digital television. The Obama transition team has asked Congress to delay the conversion, set for Feb. 17, because millions of viewers have been unable to obtain coupons to pay for converter boxes that would enable their sets to receive signals once broadcasters drop their analog signal. (The conversion would not effect viewers who subscribed to cable or satellite services.)
Over the last decade, the chairman of the F.C.C. has played a more expansive role in regulating the economy, particularly with the rise of the Internet and wireless communications. Now, as the new administration plans to make the expansion of broadband and Internet services a significant part of its stimulus package, Mr. Genachowski, with his close ties to Mr. Obama, could have a larger role in shaping economic policy than many of his predecessors.
Mr. Genachowski, the son of Eastern European Jews who fled during the Holocaust, is married to the documentary filmmaker Rachel Goslins, whose latest film, ''Bama Girl,'' documents the 2005 homecoming queen contest at the University of Alabama.
Upon graduating from law school, he clerked for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals. Mr. Obama had turned down a clerkship with Judge Mikva. Mr. Genachowski later clerked for Supreme Court Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and David H. Souter.
He was chief counsel to Reed Hundt, an F.C.C. chairman during the Clinton administration. He then worked for eight years as a senior executive at the IAC/Interactive Corporation, run by Barry Diller. He also founded an investment and advisory firm for digital media companies and co-founded the country's first commercial ''green'' bank.

HEADLINE: Obama Nominees Face Committees on Capitol Hill: Steven Chu

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Physics met politics at the confirmation hearing on Tuesday for Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate scientist chosen by President-elect Barack Obama to head the Department of Energy, and the physicist, if not the physics, bent a bit by backing away from earlier statements that gasoline prices should be higher and that coal was his ''nightmare.'' 
 Dr. Chu answered an array of questions from the Senate energy committee -- about his position on new nuclear reactors (yes, at least for a few plants), offshore drilling (only as part of an energy package) and new coal-burning power plants (a few, until we figure out a better way). He told the lawmakers that ''last year's rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices not only contributed to the recession we are now experiencing, it also put a huge strain on the budgets of families all across America.'' 
 Last September, though, he told The Wall Street Journal, ''Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.'' At Tuesday's hearing, responding to a question about that statement, he said, ''What the American family does not want is to pay an increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, for energy costs, both in transportation and keeping their homes warm and lit.''
 The answer is greater efficiency, he said. 
 In April 2007, he declared in a presentation at the University of California, Berkeley, that ''coal is my worst nightmare'' and that the world's abundance of fossil fuels is ''really both good and bad news. We won't run out of energy, but there's enough carbon in the ground to really cook us.''
 Dr. Chu's plans for steps that would reduce consumption of oil and electricity may come at an inopportune moment, as consumption is falling anyway, taking pressure off the electric grid and other energy systems. The Energy Information Administration, which is part of the Department of Energy, said on Tuesday that for 2009, electricity consumption would fall 0.5 percent, and oil product consumption by 2 percent.
 Dr. Chu, 60, warmed up when Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, asked him how plants could be turned into substitutes for petroleum.
 ''Actually, now we're getting to science, I love this,'' he said, to laughter around the room. He said he has supervised research to figure how to turn sugar into substitutes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: Anti-Smoking Advocate Is Named to Health Post

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama said Tuesday that he had chosen the head of a leading anti-tobacco organization to be the No. 2 official at the Department of Health and Human Services.
 The prospective nominee, William V. Corr, is executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a nonprofit group that seeks to reduce tobacco use among children and adults. 
 As a member of the Obama transition team, Mr. Corr has led efforts to review and evaluate the work of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 Mr. Obama has selected Tom Daschle, a former Senate Democratic leader, to be secretary of health and human services. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Corr would be the deputy secretary. From 1998 to 2000, Mr. Corr worked as chief counsel and policy director for Mr. Daschle, when Mr. Daschle was minority leader.
 The new Congress is expected to move aggressively against the tobacco industry, by increasing federal regulation of cigarettes, raising taxes on tobacco products and approving an international tobacco control treaty. 
 As a senator, Mr. Obama, an intermittent smoker, was a co-sponsor of a bill that would have given the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate ''the manufacture, marketing, and distribution'' of tobacco products, including cigarettes.
 On its Web site, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids says its goals are ''to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and protect everyone from secondhand smoke.''
 In reports filed with Congress, the campaign has listed Mr. Corr as a lobbyist and said it lobbied not only Congress, but also federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Trade Commission.
 The anti-tobacco group reported lobbying expenses that totaled $2.4 million from 2003 to 2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group that tracks the influence of money on politics and government policy.
 As a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama often criticized the influence of lobbyists in Washington. But some of his strongest allies here have worked as lobbyists for consumer groups, labor unions, environmental groups and civil rights organizations.
 In the Clinton administration, Mr. Corr was chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services, where he worked for Secretary Donna E. Shalala. 
 Before joining Mr. Daschle's staff, Mr. Corr worked for two liberal Democrats known as tenacious investigators and consumer advocates: Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, who was chairman of the antitrust subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who was chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
 Mr. Waxman was the chief sponsor of a bill passed overwhelmingly by the House last year that would have empowered the F.D.A. to regulate tobacco products. The Senate did not act on the measure.
 As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the new Congress, Mr. Waxman will play a major role in efforts to provide coverage to the 46 million people who have no health insurance.
 Before coming to Washington, Mr. Corr worked at several community-run primary health care centers in Appalachia. He has a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia and a law degree from Vanderbilt University.
 ''Reforming our health care system will be a top priority of my administration and key to putting our economy back on track,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday. ''Under the leadership of Tom Daschle and Bill Corr, I am confident that my Department of Health and Human Services will bring people together to reach consensus on how to move forward with health care reform.''

HEADLINE: A Vote Against the Bailout Checks the Show in Detroit

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
One of Detroit's biggest critics, Senator Bob Corker, showed up in the car companies' backyard on Tuesday to examine the new fuel-efficient vehicles and talk briefly with executives at the auto show.
 Mr. Corker, the outspoken Republican who voted against aid for carmakers last month, spent several hours touring the North American International Auto Show surrounded by a crowd of reporters. 
 He said the visit confirmed his feelings about the companies: that they were an important part of the economy but that their labor costs and other operational aspects needed to change before federal assistance could help them succeed. 
 ''If anything,'' he said, ''being here makes me even more committed to the things I said, and that is, we need to cause these companies to get their capital structure and competitiveness right so we can see these great products that they've been working on for years sold to Americans and sold to people around the world.''
 Mr. Corker of Tennessee acknowledged that his stance had made him unpopular in Detroit but said resentment toward him -- particularly by members of the United Automobile Workers union, who have vilified him and other Republican senators -- was misplaced.
 ''I truly want to see these companies flourish,'' he said. ''The solution I offered was tough love, but it was a solution to this problem.''
 Some of Mr. Corker's proposals ultimately were adopted as part of the loan package that President Bush approved for General Motors and Chrysler in late December.
 As the Detroit show opened this week, Mr. Corker was one focus of a protest by some U.A.W. members outside the convention hall.
 ''Senator Corker has the mentality of someone who comes from a right-to-work state,'' said Ron Lare, a former executive board member of U.A.W. Local 600 in Dearborn, Mich. ''I think Congressional members who opposed us were completely hostile. They want to kill all unions.''
 Mr. Corker is undoubtedly most unpopular among workers at Chrysler. During hearings last month on aid to the auto industry, Mr. Corker insisted that Chrysler's days as an independent company were numbered, and on Tuesday he said that his stance had not changed, even after a somewhat awkward tour of the company's rather bare-bones exhibit.
 ''They have not invested in technology and those kinds of things necessary to be a stand-alone,'' Mr. Corker said. ''My hope is that they will in fact merge and again be a viable part of Michigan and our country.''
 Mr. Corker began his visit Tuesday by sitting down with G.M. executives, including the company's president, Frederick A. Henderson, and Elizabeth A. Lowery, its vice president for environment, energy and safety policy. Ms. Lowery then showed Mr. Corker the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in vehicle due out next year, and the Cadillac Converj, a concept vehicle unveiled this week that is based on the same technology.
 ''Anytime you get a chance to show the product and what you're working on, it helps,'' Tom Wilkinson, a G.M. spokesman, said. ''There's still a lot of misperceptions about the U.S.-based companies and what they're capable of.''
 Mr. Corker also stopped to see Volkswagen, the German automaker building a new plant near Chattanooga, Tenn. 
 He was unable to visit with Nissan, whose North American operations are based outside Nashville, because the company skipped this year's Detroit show to save money.

HEADLINE: In Trenton Speech, Corzine Addresses Fiscal Crisis and Plants Seeds for 2nd Term

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
With his popularity shaky and his state facing daunting fiscal challenges, Gov. Jon S. Corzine on Tuesday delivered his final State of the State address before facing voters in November, offering a defense for his sometimes rocky first term and a forceful argument for why he should earn a second. 
 In both tone and substance, the speech contrasted markedly from his previous addresses, in which Mr. Corzine, a former Wall Street executive, seemed almost to pride himself on putting forth an unvarnished view of the sorry state of New Jersey's finances. 
 Mr. Corzine, a Democrat and former United States senator who is expected to face a robust re-election challenge this year, offered plenty of applause lines for the Democratic faithful who control both the Senate and the General Assembly. He described his joy in watching Barack Obama's election victory, and criticized President Bush over his failure to expand health care coverage for children. 
 And he reinforced his commitment to traditional Democratic priorities like education, low-income housing and the environment. At one point, he even recited what he said was only a partial list of his agenda and accomplishments, including enacting a paid family leave program, appointing a record number of women and minorities as judges, creating a homelessness task force and delivering a plan to reduce carbon emissions. 
 ''We've done a lot,'' he said, prompting vigorous applause from Democrats, but not Republicans.
 At the same time, though, Mr. Corzine did not shy away from addressing the impact of the national recession on a state that relies heavily on Wall Street profits, and has been reeling for years under the weight of high taxes and questionable fiscal practices by both parties. 
 As a result, he said, he will be forced to take emergency steps, like giving local governments the option of postponing their contributions to employee pensions, that he normally would not take.
 ''When good people are at the end of their rope, they need to know that government is there to lend a helping hand,'' he said. ''It is in this context that we have made the economy Priority No. 1, Priority No. 2 and Priority No. 3.'' 
 Mr. Corzine's line about the state's top three priorities was one that he repeated several times throughout his 45-minute address before a joint session of the Legislature. So do not be surprised, said legislators, political analysts and lobbyists, if Mr. Corzine returns repeatedly to that theme as November draws near. 
 Mr. Corzine did not make any overt references to the campaign. Nor did he mention -- as he has in the past -- Christopher J. Christie, a Republican and former United States attorney who has been given the best chance of unseating the governor. But Mr. Corzine hinted that he was up to any challenge. 
 ''Given the magnitude of the national economic crisis, the challenges we face are unprecedented and daunting,'' he said. ''I've never run from a challenge, and I'm not running from this one.''
 Indeed, Mr. Corzine said the kinds of things that are typical of a State of the State address given by anyone other than him. He singled out a number of exceptional residents, including high-achieving students and a social worker, who were sitting in the balcony of the Assembly chamber. And in contrast to years past, when some of his glum speeches about the state's fiscal woes prompted applause only twice -- upon his entering and his exiting -- Mr. Corzine received at least two dozen ovations on Tuesday. 
 When asked afterward whether he viewed the address as a campaign stump speech, Richard J. Codey, president of the Senate, said: ''I think you can view it that way. The issue before the electorate today is No. 1, 2 and 3 -- the economy. And what he's able to do and not do in the budget will plant seeds for his re-election, no question about it.'' 
 Bonnie Watson Coleman, the Assembly majority leader, said: ''I think it was a very good speech in that it laid forth what we've already accomplished. You compare us to other states, we think there's a lot of hopefulness for our citizens.'' 
 But the Senate minority leader, Thomas H. Kean Jr., a Republican, found the speech wanting. He credited New York's governor, David A. Paterson, with summoning the Legislature in November for a special session to at least try to tackle pressing financial needs. ''Governor Corzine has clearly relied on poll-testing, and he has clearly relied on partisanship,'' Mr. Kean said. 
 Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III, a Republican who has sometimes crossed party lines, said that he was disappointed as well, given Mr. Corzine's experience as a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. 
 ''The governor can do much better, and I expect more from him,'' he said. ''We need a governor who says, 'I'll straighten out government, as I would straighten out business.' '' 
 Mr. Corzine did offer two new ideas. To encourage development, he proposed a one-year moratorium on a 2.5 percent fee charged to developers and an exemption for projects that are already in the pipeline. He also urged the Legislature to place on the November ballot a bond referendum to continue financing for open-space initiatives.
 But those were small-bore forays compared with last year, when Mr. Corzine unveiled his ambitious -- though ultimately unsuccessful -- bid to refinance the state's toll roads as a way to generate billions of dollars.
 Jon Shure, president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, gave the speech mixed marks, perhaps analogous to Mr. Corzine's recent poll numbers, which have shown that an equal percentage of residents -- around 40 percent -- like and dislike his performance. He said he would have liked to hear more concrete plans, rather than a campaign-style list of greatest hits.
 ''The ratio between the accomplishments of the past and proposals for the future was far more in favor of the past, especially compared to his past speeches,'' he said. ''So it lacked a coherent vision of what we want the state to be.''

HEADLINE: Wider Role Urged for Housing Choice

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Members of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday urged President Obama's nominee as housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, to be more aggressive than his predecessors in fighting home foreclosures and more prominent in shaping responses toward the broader economic crisis.
 Talk of metaphorical tables dominated Mr. Donovan's confirmation hearing, with senators agreeing he deserved seats at the really important ones. 
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development ''has been sitting at the kids' table, and it is time for that to change,'' said Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat.
 Get ''a seat at the main table -- insist on it,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican. 
 ''I want you at the table,'' said Senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the committee. ''If I hear you're not there, I'm going to be very disappointed.''
 For Mr. Donovan, a New York City housing official, it was an unusually warm welcome to Washington, and one that may portend a more influential role for the head of a chronically besieged department often described as a backwater.
 As waves of foreclosures increased over the last year and broader economic distress has spread, the housing department has taken a notably low-profile role, overshadowed not only by the Treasury Department but also the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 One predecessor, Alphonse Jackson, resigned under pressure after boasting that he awarded contracts on the basis of political favoritism. (He later claimed to be joking.) The current secretary, Steve Preston, has a background in financial services with little experience in housing policy.
 By contrast, one senator after another praised Mr. Donovan's extensive resume, which includes two graduate degrees from Harvard (in public policy and architecture), a previous stint at HUD, and four years as Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
 ''He's far more qualified than I was,'' said Senator Martinez, who served as President Bush's first housing secretary.
 Plenty of problems await.
 The department's main program to aid help homeowners avoid foreclosure, Hope for Homeowners, is widely viewed as a failure. Mr. Donovan noted that while it was supposed to help 400,000 people, the voluntary program only received about 100 applications in its first month.
 Several members of the committee urged him to follow the more aggressive approach taken by the F.D.I.C., which requires some lenders to modify the terms of troubled loans. 
 ''We are looking very closely at the F.D.I.C. program,'' Mr. Donovan said. 
 Several also complained about difficulties with the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which is dispensing nearly $4 billion to help state and local governments buy foreclosed properties.
 Mr. Donovan expressed concern that some recipients of the money may not have experience in handling foreclosed properties. He promised an ''outreach and education'' campaign to help quicken the use of the funds.
 Senator Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, expressed concerns about the financial health of the Federal Housing Administration's insurance program for single family homes. The program insures nearly $500 billion worth of mortgages, and its reserves have fallen sharply over the past year as more homeowners fail to pay their loans.
 With private insurers pulling back, the program now insures 21 percent of mortgages, up from 4 percent several years ago.
 The fund's health, Mr. Donovan said, was ''clearly an issue of concern,'' though he said more study was needed to determine whether the problem was short-term or lasting.
 In addition, there are the chronic HUD problems: a maintenance backlog at public housing that approaches $30 billion, homelessness, and outdated computer systems that can make budgeting all but impossible.
 Mr. Donovan pledged to get on the case. ''I'm a numbers guy,'' he said.
 If confirmed as expected, Mr. Donovan, 42, would have an automatic place on the boards that oversee the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program, an economic recovery fund, and the agency the restructuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the home loan repurchase giants.
 For a new man in town, those are seats at two important tables.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the days leading up to President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration, his message of hope and change has become tangible -- and commercial -- here.
 On the sides of buses, inside Metro stations and over the radio, Ikea promotes its home furnishings by proclaiming ''Change Begins at Home.'' In other Metro stations, advertisements using the words ''hope'' and ''optimism'' are splashed on walls and pillars -- with the O's replaced by Pepsi logos.
 Around town and across the Internet, hope does not come free, and change will cost you. 
 Amy Fettig, a Washington lawyer who was out last Sunday buying a T-shirt from the Presidential Inaugural Committee's store, said, ''America is excited about Obama, so this all makes sense because when Americans want to express their excitement, they turn to merchandising.'' 
 Among the Obama yo-yos and piggy banks, Ms. Fettig noticed the $70 tote bags by the designers Diane von Furstenberg and Tory Burch. 
 ''I just wonder if this is part of the stimulus package,'' Ms. Fettig said.
 From mom-and-pop vendors to big-box retailers, an army of people are trying to make a bounty off of Mr. Obama's inauguration next Tuesday, the culmination of his historic campaign. His impending presidency has taken consumerism to another level, even in this less-is-mandatory economy.
 ''Nothing will touch this,'' said Bahman Shafa, the owner of Focus Sports, which last month opened an inauguration superstore here with 10 cash registers. His company also works the Olympics, the Super Bowl and World Cup soccer. 
 ''Obama has rock-star appeal, whereas Bush certainly did not,'' Mr. Shafa said.
 There are Barack Obama Inauguration Hot Sauce, sold for $6.99 by the Kentucky company TooDarnHot.com; a ''Hope and Change'' necklace for $24 at Chico's, the women's clothing chain; and Barack Obama Topps trading cards priced at $1.99 per six-card pack.
 There is Obama toilet paper, a tribute that features his likeness, sold for about $8 by Jeremy Rupke, who lives outside Toronto. His advertisement says, ''This roll would look great on the desk of any Democrat.'' 
 The rolls are ''very popular right now!'' Mr. Rupke wrote in an e-mail message. (He warned that the paper is just for show. The ink is toxic.)
 There are more than three price points on Obama soap alone: $20 Hope on a Rope soap; $9.99 for Obama Bars declaring, ''This is our moment to clean up America''; and $44.99 for an inauguration gift pack sold by the Obama Bar online store. The pack, with eight Mini-Bama bars, is going fast, said a co-owner of the store, Salah Boukadoum.
 ''We're happy to see that Obama is already doing his part to stimulate the economy,'' Mr. Boukadoum said.
 Everyday Obama items are also doing well. Obama-themed $10 Metro farecards for the Washington subway system sold out at $10, then reappeared on eBay for $25.99.
 Obama sex toys, which will not be described here, are available for $34.95 at one online company. At another, I Obama Classic Thong Undies are selling for $8.99.
 Lynn R. Kahle, a marketing professor at the Lundquist College of Business of the University of Oregon, said, ''People are looking for all sorts of things, even outlandish things, to show their support because they want to say: 'I was there. I supported Obama in his historic road to the presidency.' '' 
 HSN, the home-shopping company, is expecting another sales boom since $3 million worth of Obama coins sold days after the Nov. 4 election, said Nancy Caplan, a senior vice president at the company.
 For the first time, QVC, another home-shopping network, will broadcast from Washington during the inauguration. Its host will wear a ball gown. 
 Lawrence Mitchell, a Department of Defense employee in Washington, has noticed the corporate advertisements and the hype, but said he was not buying into any of it.
 ''I can see the little guy trying to make a buck off of Barack Obama's inauguration, but major corporations?'' Mr. Mitchell said Monday on the Metro. ''Everyone's trying to make money off of this historical moment instead of just celebrating it.''

HEADLINE: Rearranging the Tables in Washington: Chefs Settle Down In 'the Real D.C.'

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 GILLIAN CLARK calls fried chicken the curse of the black chef.
 Ms. Clark's parents are from Panama. She graduated from a Long Island, N.Y., high school. She enrolled in a French-influenced cooking school and was first taught by French chefs. But whenever she opens a restaurant, people want her to fry some chicken.
 ''I'd be more at home making knish,'' she said.
 But like politics, relationships and neighborhoods, cooks change. 
 Later this year, Ms. Clark plans to open Georgia Street Meeting House in her working-class neighborhood in Northwest Washington. The menu will be unabashedly Southern, in the style of the late Edna Lewis, with lard pie crusts and whole roast pigs at formal Sunday suppers.
 Recently, Ms. Clark realized that she could draw a line connecting her West Indian ancestors with America's Deep South and the earliest African-American residents of this city, where she has lived for nearly 25 years. That Ms. Clark's new place is on a street she was once afraid to walk on after dark is a sign of another kind of change, too. 
 In Petworth, Columbia Heights, the U Street district and even the dicier parts of North Capitol Hill, a little restaurant revival is under way. Washington neighborhoods that for years were considered too dangerous or too poor for a viable sit-down restaurant are suddenly entertaining quite a few. 
 Some places, like Ms. Clark's ode to Southern food in Petworth and the pan-Latin Rumberos in Columbia Heights, reflect the flavor of their neighborhoods. Others could open just about anywhere, but they all are part of a renewed excitement among the segment of this city that doesn't wash in and out with each new administration.
 ''It's such an interesting time for the real D.C., because for years there has been a whole lot of nothing going on,'' Ms. Clark said.
 You could trace the roots of the revival in part to developers who in the late 1990s took advantage of city-led urban renewal projects and began investing in neighborhoods that had been torn by riots, drugs and civic inattention.
 In the ensuing years, Washington's population began growing instead of shrinking, and crime rates started to drop. But lately, something has been going on that is harder to quantify. 
 ''For the past two or three years, you kind of feel this energy, this current, going through D.C.,'' said Neil Glick, who for eight years has served as the advisory neighborhood commissioner for Capitol Hill East. ''It's really kind of a hip place to be. Suburbia is dead.'' 
 Diane Gross and her husband, Khalid Pitts, just wanted to live, work and eat out in their neighborhood, which bridges Logan Circle and U Street. 
 Initially, their brokers didn't get it. ''When we were looking for a space, they all wanted to show us the Hill,'' Ms. Gross said. 
 A year ago, they opened Cork Wine Bar. ''One thing we've been most surprised and delighted by is the diversity,'' Ms. Gross said. That not only means black eating next to white, but gay next to straight and young next to old. Ms. Gross, who is white, is a former civil rights lawyer. Mr. Pitts, who is black, directs legislative and issue campaigns for a labor union. They were looking to create a comfortable neighborhood place where all kinds of people could mix.
 The place is all tin ceilings, bare wood tables and votive candles. The Eurocentric wine list features more than 40 wines by the glass; the chef, Ron Tanaka, prepares food like braised lamb shank set over flageolet beans and topped with Japanese eggplant chips. 
 Cork is riding the recent comeback of the nearby U Street district in the Shaw neighborhood. Long the cultural center for many in the city's African-American community, U Street went into economic free fall in the 1970s and '80s. By the late 1990s, business started to re-emerge in fits and starts. Now, dozens of clubs and restaurants stay open late, pulling crowds from all over town and even the suburbs. 
 One of those places is Marvin, which opened in the fall of 2007 as an homage to the singer Marvin Gaye, who grew up in a public housing project in Southeast Washington. The bar upstairs has a cool, P. M. Dawn feeling during the week and is too packed to move in on the weekends. Downstairs, where a huge folk art image of Mr. Gaye dominates one wall, the restaurant feels like a stylish American speakeasy. 
 The menu blends dressed-up country dishes like liver and onions (a well-seared slice of foie gras with caramelized Vidalia onions for $17) with moules frites (five versions, $16). 
 Just a few blocks away on U Street, Warren Brown opened his bakery, Cake Love, in 2002. ''No one was really doing much around me then,'' he said. But things took off fast. He has since opened five other retail locations in the greater Washington area and a cafe in Dupont Circle.
 Ms. Clark, a veteran of seven restaurant openings, knows there is great opportunity in being an urban pioneer. For seven years, she ran the tiny Colorado Kitchen in Brightwood, a predominantly black neighborhood in the far northern reaches of the city. It was, she said, the first sit-down restaurant the area had seen in 20 years. Before she closed it last summer, she would see young tattooed emo-rockers sitting next to well-dressed church ladies, everyone enjoying the fresh donuts and cornflake-crusted pork chops.
 She is about to open a restaurant called the General Store in Silver Spring, Md., and another spot called Avenue Oven in Takoma Park, a neighborhood on the Maryland border. But Ms. Clark sees the most potential in areas that are emerging from decades of high crime and neglect, like Petworth.
 One good way to see the changes around Washington is to jump in Ms. Clark's car for a tour, which I did last week. She starts out with a stop at Columbia Heights Coffee. Five years ago, Ms. Clark said, good espresso from a La Cimbali machine was unimaginable in this neighborhood. 
 Columbia Heights, which is north of U Street and borders Howard University, was decimated by riots in 1968. Thirty years later, the city led a development project that brought a new Metro stop, the renovation of a 1920s theater and several stores and restaurants.
 Ann Cashion, a chef who has helped start many food careers in Washington, including Ms. Clark's, lives there. The neighborhood, she said, ''is truly still black, Latino and Caucasian in almost equal measure, despite the introduction of lots of new housing and D.C.'s only Target and Bed Bath & Beyond.''
 A short drive north is Petworth, where Ms. Clark has lived for a decade. 
 At the neighborhood's main intersection, the smell of grilling jerk chicken from Sweet Mango drifted over to the construction site that will be home to her Georgia Street Meeting House, a 4,000-square-foot restaurant she hopes to have open by late fall. Condos are being built on the top floors of the development, which will also house a new Metro entrance. 
 Neighbors, who have watched the open-air drug and prostitute markets go away and home values rise, are looking forward to the development, said Dan Silverman, who writes a blog called the Prince of Petworth. ''For sure people are excited because for many years in this neighborhood and Columbia Heights there were not options except take-out Chinese,'' he said.
 A restaurant revival is also happening on H Street, so Ms. Clark pointed the car toward an even tougher neighborhood, bouncing over a few dozen blocks of rough asphalt northeast of the Capitol. Some people call it the Atlas District, others call it lower Capitol Hill and still others say it is Trinidad. The area had 22 killings in 2008. 
 ''I don't care what you call it, it's still the 'hood,'' Ms. Clark said.
 Still, new places to eat and drink are popping up among the barbershops, boarded-up corner stores and well-worn seafood carry-outs. 
 Joe Englert, a local developer who has opened dozens of clubs and restaurants over the years, bought up a bunch of vacant buildings a few years ago and began rolling out a series of eclectic restaurants and clubs. One of the most successful is Granville Moore's, where people line up on weekend nights to work through big, steaming bowls of large mussels simmered with bacon and wine, and dip perfect hot fries into curry mayonnaise. The place also has what might be the best Belgian beer list in the district.
 The restaurant was named after an African-American doctor who worked and lived in the building in the '40s. The first floor felt like a Belgian tavern. Upstairs, old coolers held the beer and people huddled on bar stools. Eating there feels (not unpleasantly) like being part of a secret club that meets at night in an unfinished attic.
 Ms. Cashion calls H Street ''a kind of post racial Georgetown, as it once was before the national retailers staked their claims there.'' She's consulting on the Mexican menu for the H Street Country Club, which is supposed to open in February. It will feature an irony-laden miniature golf course that requires putters to work through the swinging briefcases of K Street lawyers and shoot around Marion Barry, the former mayor and councilman.
 ''The D.C. culture has evolved now to a point where we can be proud of it,'' said Lee T. Wheeler, the artist who designed the course.
 The most daring bit of expansion Ms. Clark has planned is in an area that might make H Street seem tame. She has signed a letter of intent to buy a shuttered restaurant called the Chef's Table in the Benning Heights neighborhood across the Anacostia River.
 She was convinced a Southern-style meat-and-three restaurant could work after she saw the Denny's parking lot across the street jammed with cars at 11 a.m. on a weekday. It was the only restaurant with table service around. ''People won't open things down there because they think, 'those people don't go out to eat,' '' she said. ''So why is the Denny's so packed you can't even get into the parking lot?''
 All the changes in Washington are not without challenges. Bloggers, some city officials and longtime residents worry about the people who get priced out of gentrified neighborhoods. There is grumbling about chain stores that threaten to paint over neighborhoods with a Starbucksian sheen. And no one knows whether the economic downturn will stop the restaurant revival cold. 
 ''The thing I keep in mind is that D.C. is looking good,'' Ms. Clark said. ''We all feel like the sun is shining on us, finally.''

 CORRECTION:
An article last Wednesday about Washington neighborhoods where a number of restaurants have recently opened misspelled part of the name of a neighborhood. It is North Capitol Hill, not North Capital Hill. The article also misstated the name of a restaurant. It is Georgia Avenue Meeting House, not Georgia Street Meeting House.

HEADLINE: Yankee Stadium Subsidy Becomes Mayoral Campaign Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With a vote set on Friday on whether to extend $372 million in additional tax-free financing for the new Yankee Stadium, challengers to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are trying to halt the subsidies. State lawmakers have subpoenaed team and city officials to an emergency hearing on Wednesday, and what once looked like a gleaming example of the mayor's financial skill is suddenly looking like one of his biggest vulnerabilities.
 On Tuesday, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. accused the mayor of mismanagement and demanded a postponement of Friday's vote by the city's Industrial Development Agency. 
 Mr. Thompson, a member of the agency's board who is running for mayor this year, voted in 2006 to issue nearly $1 billion in bonds to pay for the stadium. But cost overruns, extras and ''financial incompetence,'' he said, had turned the Bronx ballpark project into ''simply a bad deal for New York,'' and ''at a time when we can least afford it.''
 Mr. Thompson's likely Democratic rival in the race, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, said on Monday that ''enough is enough'' and that the city had more than amply subsidized the stadium by providing, along with the state, $500 million in tax breaks for the team.
 And in a swipe at the team's costly player acquisitions this winter, as well as the stadium's expensive amenities, including a $10 million video board, he added: ''Maybe C. C. Sabathia can buy the big-screen TVs.''
 Voters may recall a similar controversy: four years ago, Mr. Bloomberg's push for a West Side stadium gave his Democratic opponent what seemed like a huge campaign issue -- until the stadium project was killed by state legislative leaders, and the issue quickly evaporated.
 What could give the stadium issue traction this year, however, is the city's dire financial condition -- presenting a stark contrast between struggling, insecure New Yorkers who don't earn major league salaries, and the hundreds of millions of dollars the new stadium complex is costing them.
 ''Bloomberg is the businessman mayor, that's been his big claim to competence, and here they're whacking him where he is the strongest,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. 
 ''My guess is this won't be the end of it by a long shot,'' he added. ''These are tough economic times, people are being told we've got to economize, we've got to tighten our belts, and the Yankees are blowing money by the carload for players.''
 Having the Industrial Development Agency issue the bonds is desirable to the Yankees because the team would pay tens of millions of dollars less in interest, since payments to bondholders are exempt from city, state and federal taxes. 
 A spokesman for the mayor, Andrew Brent, dismissed Mr. Thompson's attack as ''political theater.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg is already distancing himself from the more controversial parts of the deal with the Yankees. After embarrassing e-mail messages surfaced that showed his aides zealously pursuing a luxury suite in the new stadium, his administration announced that it would give the luxury box back to the Yankees in exchange for payments of at least $100,000 a year.
 But in a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Thompson seized on that move. He said the city had given away too much to get the suite in the first place, including 250 parking spots worth $500,000 a year, and $750,000 in yearly revenue from three billboards that the Yankees hope to use for advertising. 
 Mr. Thompson said the city's capital outlays for the stadium complex were originally estimated at $129 million but had jumped to $325 million, including an extra $12 million for a park on the roof of a garage, and $5 million in work on a recreation building because early estimates omitted the cost of its interiors.
 Randy Levine, president of the Yankees, said on Tuesday that the team expected to recover at least $550,000 for the city by reselling the suite on the open market, but that the $100,000 was a ''sign of good faith'' in case the luxury-suite market collapsed entirely.
 Mr. Levine -- who, along with Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Industrial Development Agency, is to testify under subpoena on Thursday at a hearing called by Assemblymen Richard L. Brodsky and James F. Brennan -- went further, disputing Mr. Thompson's numbers on the billboards and other items, and accusing him of playing politics with a project that he said had created thousands of construction jobs.
 ''Surprise, surprise -- Billy Thompson is running for mayor,'' Mr. Levine said. ''Billy voted for this deal in the beginning, I continually briefed him, and only after the term-limits law does he now decide to criticize the deal. What a coincidence.''

HEADLINE: In the Lap of Luxury, Paris Squirms

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Maia de la Baume and Basil Katz contributed reporting.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
 FRANCE is the birthplace of luxury fashion, and here the recession biting the world has the feel of a morality play. 
 As high-end consumers everywhere have suddenly suppressed their appetite for luxury goods, what was once considered a recession-proof industry has been hit hard.
 High-end stores in the United States watched in horror as holiday sales tanked, while in Tokyo, Louis Vuitton canceled plans for what would have been its largest and most glittery store anywhere.
 For the French, each wave of bad news has brought high anxiety here. 
 When Chanel recently announced the layoff of 200 temporary employees -- only slightly more than 1 percent of its 16,000-member work force -- the daily newspaper Le Parisien called the news a bombshell. 
 The television channel LCI described the move as the most serious setback to the company since Coco Chanel fired her entire staff and closed shop when war broke out in 1939.
 But there is also, paradoxically, an underlying satisfaction here that an era of sometimes vulgar high living is over and that a more bedrock French way of life will emerge.
 Only in France is the recession lauded for posing a crisis in values. 
 A recent issue of Le Figaro Magazine featured a 12-page guide to scaled-down living in 2009, with predictions that people will work less and put family (even in-laws) first. A French trend expert quoted in the magazine dramatically described the changes as nothing less than ''a revolution in values.'' 
 Alain Nemarq, the chairman of Mauboussin, the prestige jewelry firm, noted in an interview that saving the luxury industry should be an important national priority because it employs 200,000 people in France, is part of French heritage, brings prestige to the country and seduces not just the ''happy few'' but a large swath of the public.
 Rather than trying to keep the machine running by pumping out high-price hand bags, watches and other goods, he proposed the unthinkable: the entire luxury industry should slash prices. ''We need a return to reason, decency, discretion, beauty and creativity -- in other words, to true values,'' Mr. Nemarq said. (Mauboussin has lead by example.
 It has sold its one-carat diamond solitaire ''Chance of Love'' ring for about $14,500, roughly a third less than its normal price, and its lower-end 0.15-carat diamond ring was priced at $895, Mr. Nemarq said.) 
 Some French intellectuals want to go much further, calling for the death of the entire luxury industry as a sort of national ritual of purification. 
 ''Since the ancient Greeks, luxury goods have always been stamped with the seal of immorality,'' said Gilles Lipovetsky, a sociologist who has written several books about consumerism. ''They represent waste, the superficial, the inequality of wealth. They have no need to exist.''
 The political champion for the new economic morality is a recent convert: President Nicolas Sarkozy, formerly known as ''President Bling-Bling.'' He entered office pledging to inject more Anglo-Saxon-style capitalism by getting the French to ''work more to earn more.''
 But last week in Paris, Mr. Sarkozy and the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair hosted a conference of political leaders and Nobel Prize-winning economists to find ways to instill moral values into the global economy. The old financial order had been ''perverted'' by ''amoral'' and uncontrolled capitalism, Mr. Sarkozy said, deploring the fact that, ''the signs of wealth count more than wealth itself.'' 
 He praised the ''return of the state'' as a regulator of capitalist excess.
 Paradoxically, that sentiment may not be all that difficult for the French to accept. France's national identity may seem wrapped up tight in the aura of luxury -- elegant dress, sophisticated perfume, good food and wine, and no shortage of Champagne for the flimsiest of celebrations. But even though the French more than most Europeans appreciate the finest quality they can afford, they pride themselves on balance. France remains a deeply conservative country, one in which it traditionally has been unacceptable to show off material possessions. Most French use debit cards, not credit cards, which means they tend not to spend more than they have in their bank accounts. Getting a mortgage is a torturous process. 
 And so, many see in the closing of an era of free and easy spending on luxury goods -- when luxury became associated with flash and ostentation around the world -- the potential for a restoration of the classic French virtues of restraint and modesty. Even a bit of suffering and sacrifice might be in order.
 ''This whole crisis is like a big spring housecleaning -- both moral and physical,'' Karl Lagerfeld, the designer for Chanel, said in an interview. ''There is no creative evolution if you don't have dramatic moments like this. Bling is over. Red carpety covered with rhinestones is out. I call it 'the new modesty.' ''
 Still, Mr. Lagerfeld is quick to point out that his house is doing just fine, that the layoffs this month were blown out of proportion and that Chanel's Paris-Moscow collection last month brought in 17 percent more in sales than his Paris-London show in 2007. 
 In keeping with the new national mood -- and in deference to hard economic realities -- the designer Nathalie Rykiel said she will show the new Sonia Rykiel collection in March not with a grand theatrical spectacle for 1,500 people in a vast rented space, but with two small 200-guest mini-shows in her boutique on the Boulevard St.-Germain.
 ''In the end it probably is not going to cost much less so this is not about the money,'' she said over lunch at the Cafe de Flore. ''It's a desire for intimacy, to go back to values. We need to return to a smaller scale, one that touches people. We will be saying, 'Come to my house. Look at and feel the clothes.' ''
 Certainly, retrenchment was felt over the holiday season in Paris, where caterers were hurt by cancellations of year-end cocktail parties. If there were parties at all, there was more duck mousse and a lot less foie gras. Champagne, the global wholesale sales of which dropped in October by 16.5 percent compared with the previous year, was served less at French tables; fizzy French wine without the official Champagne appellation was served more. 
 At La Grande Epicerie, the vast food hall in Le Bon Marche department store, French and Italian caviar sold as well as the much more pricey Russian variety; the pastry chefs resisted the temptation to bake 100 euro designer Buche de Noel cakes.
 ''Luxury products that have savoir faire -- rather than bling-bling -- offered a sense of refuge,'' said Frederic Verbrugghe, the food hall's director general. ''Sales of Dom Perignon didn't suffer, but ostentatious packaging didn't move. In the past, customers would buy an entire block of foie gras; this year it was just five slices.'' 
 Many French executives take the long view that the economy will eventually rebound. Some vintners recall that the French nobility stopped buying Champagne during the country's revolution in 1789, forcing winemakers to find markets abroad. 
 ''We have been in business for 300 years,'' said Dominique Heriard Dubreuil, chairman of the Remy Cointreau Group, which produces Remy Martin cognac and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne. ''We were hit by the phylloxera insect in the 19th century that destroyed our vines and our capacity to produce. We have faced two world wars. I see the crisis as a challenging but constructive event.''
 And for Mr. Lagerfeld, cutting back his own spending at Chanel is not part of his ''new modesty'' strategy. He said he is not being forced by the private company's owners to bend or adapt because of financial constraints. ''We have no budget, we do what we want and throwing money out the window brings money back in through the front door,'' he said. ''The bottom line is that I don't deal with the bottom line. The luxury in my life is I never have to think about it.''

Lisa P. Jackson, chosen to head the Environmental Protection Agency, said Wednesday at her confirmation hearing that she would restore scientific and legal integrity to an agency battered by charges of political interference and coziness with industry. 
 But Ms. Jackson evaded questions on whether she would grant authority to California and 16 other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions, promising only a speedy review of the issue. Nor did she directly answer questions on whether and how the agency would address carbon dioxide regulation under the Clean Air Act, an authority granted the agency by the Supreme Court in 2007.
 Her promise to be guided by science and the law was an implicit rebuke of the management of the agency in the Bush administration, where career officials' recommendations were at times ignored. 
 ''I understand the laws leave room for policy makers to make policy judgments,'' Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement to members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A.'s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes.''
 Ms. Jackson holds degrees in chemical engineering from Tulane and Princeton. 
 Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who heads the committee, said she had been waiting a long time for new leadership at the agency. 
 ''E.P.A. works for the American people,'' Mrs. Boxer said, ''and in my view we have seen it hurt the American people these past eight years.'' 
 Ms. Jackson, who was a career employee at the agency for 15 years and most recently served as head of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said President-elect Barack Obama believed that sound stewardship of the environment could co-exist with economic growth.
 ''Done properly,'' she said, ''these goals can and should reinforce each other.''
 Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, cautioned against using the Clean Air Act to regulate so-called greenhouse gases.
 ''Ranchers and miners in Wyoming know that addressing climate change through the Clean Air Act is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Mr. Barrasso said.
 After questioning Ms. Jackson, the committee considered the appointment of Nancy Sutley, deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
 Both nominees are expected to win quick confirmation.

HEADLINE: Businesses Find a Silver Lining In Inland California's Downturn

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

 BODY:
At the moment, California's Inland Empire -- the local name for San Bernardino and Riverside Counties east of Los Angeles -- would seem an inhospitable place for starting a business.
Unemployment has already reached 9.5 percent, a third higher than the national average. And 126,000 homes have been foreclosed on -- one house in nine in an area with a population of 4.3 million. Commercial construction and expansions have halted, leaving unfinished projects and vacant buildings. The forecast is that ''it will take three years, to 2011-2012, for the area's economy to come back,'' said John Husing, an economist whose company, Economics and Politics Inc., issues quarterly reports on the Inland Empire economy.
Yet the area, which had one of the nation's fastest-growing economies in the last decade, has been attracting newcomers and small businesses. One of its advantages, paradoxically, is the result of its economic travails: low real estate prices for both houses and factories. But the other is the concerted support for small enterprises and start-up companies from the area's universities and nonprofit organizations -- programs that were set in place long before the current downturn. 
That is why energy and hope were evident at a recent gathering of small-business owners at the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship, a part of the College of Business and Public Administration at California State University, San Bernardino.
One of the business owners was Shawn Barker, a student in the master of business administration program who started a company, Virclom Technologies Services, last October to provide tutoring in mathematics and physics to high school and college students. Mr. Barker, who holds a degree in physics from Talladega College in Alabama, records lectures by teachers, adapts them to iPods and other formats and distributes them to students. ''Our technology allows students to review the material and reinforces learning,'' said Mr. Barker, who is looking to sell the service to school districts.
He also hopes to automate the distribution system so that students can download tutorials from servers. That improvement will cost about $100,000, he estimated, and Mr. Barker is seeking to attract financing from angel investors or grants from federal and state governments. This is a difficult time to raise capital, Mr. Barker acknowledged, but he has sent descriptions of his company's innovations to members of Congress and feels confident, he said, because ''the new administration and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan are in favor of new approaches.''
Felix Zuniga, who holds a master's degree in business from California State in San Bernardino, started Armada Business Services last September to help independent truck owner-operators cope with many demands of regulation, financing, insurance and management. The Inland Empire is a major center for freight transportation. Trucks carry cargo containers 60 miles from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail terminals in San Bernardino County, where they are transferred to railroad cars for transport to other parts of the United States.
But these are difficult times for truck owners. International trade volumes are down in the recession even as truck owners need to meet new environmental regulations by modifying engines. At the same time, banks and other lenders are pulling back on financing for small-business owners. ''Truckers have a high failure rate, an average 14 months from going into business to failing,'' Mr. Zuniga said. But perhaps adversity can mean opportunity, he said. ''It's when times are tough that the owners especially need our help.''
More than start-ups find opportunities in the current climate. Gem Power L.L.C. is an eight-year-old company that developed software under research contracts for the United States Navy to recharge and extend the life of batteries. ''We can double or treble the life of any battery, whether for computers or heavy machinery,'' said John James, Gem Power's president.
The company is now trying for commercial work for its battery-charging systems, marketing to police and fire departments. The commercial effort follows recommendations of a feasibility study by faculty and students at the California State Entrepreneurship Center, which also operates a computer laboratory under a Defense Department program.
Like similar efforts to help small business at the nearby University of California, Riverside, the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship ranges beyond academia to get involved in the business community. The center finances its $2 million annual budget independently, said Michael Stull, an associate professor of business and the director of the center, ''by selling consulting and technical assistance services to public agencies.'' And the center organizes an annual Spirit of Entrepreneurship award ceremony to encourage and publicize local innovators.
One award recipient is OncoNutrition, which has developed a food supplement that helps cancer patients maintain their appetites and nutritional intake while undergoing chemotherapy. The company, based in the city of Riverside, collaborates with the departments of biology and medicine at the university there. It also benefits from the county's relatively low-cost commercial space for its laboratories, said Olof Mollstedt, the co-founder and president.
In the current recession, the Inland Empire's inexpensive real estate is proving in some cases to be an inadvertent asset. Charlie Mello, president of American Custom Coach, for example, has moved his company into a 23,000-square-foot factory in Redlands from a smaller one in nearby Ontario. The larger plant, said Mr. Mello, will allow his company to expand its output of vans that can be fitted out as mobile units for X-rays, mammograms, dental work and blood testing and donations as well as command posts for law enforcement.
''Don't tell me about a recession,'' said Mr. Mello, an engineer who moved to California from Brazil in 1988. American Custom Coach is busy filling orders for medical vans from Qatar, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Middle East and from Angola in southwest Africa. ''I'm on my way to Angola,'' Mr. Mello said late last month. ''It is ordering 14 vans.'' He said he intended to expand his company's work force from 24 employees to as many as 40 in the next two years.
Giroux Glass, a Los Angeles glass contracting company, recently bought a 40,000-square-foot building in San Bernardino for $3 million. ''I couldn't construct a building for $3 million,'' said Anne-Merelie Murrel, president of Giroux. Having seized the opportunity, Ms. Murrel said she planned to move fabrication work into the building, ''which can help serve our expanding business in Las Vegas.''
Residential real estate is also inexpensive compared with most of Southern California. ''Five-bedroom homes are available for $250,000 in the area,'' said Ms. Murrel, and Giroux's employees are eager to buy there.
Such employees will be a key to the area's recovery, said Lee Searing, president of Searing Industries, a large maker of welded steel pipe in Rancho Cucamonga. ''This area was up so high for so long, it had to plateau,'' he said. ''But a skilled work force wanting to live in the Inland Empire will attract new companies and we'll recover.''
Correction: January 19, 2009, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Entrepreneurial Edge column on Thursday, about support for small businesses in the California counties of San Bernardino and Riverside, misstated the home foreclosure rate in the area. About 126,000 homes in the counties have received notices of default, not 350,000. (An estimated 360,000 homes, or one-third of the homes in the counties, are worth less than their mortgage balances and may be in jeopardy of default.)

HEADLINE: Seeking Self-Esteem Through Surgery

BYLINE: By CAMILLE SWEENEY

 BODY:
WHEN 18-year-old Kristen of River Edge, N.J., began to develop curves at 15, she was disappointed that breasts didn't follow. ''They never grew,'' said Kristen. ''I didn't feel like a woman.'' 
 And, in fact, at 15, Kristen wasn't yet a woman. But to someone raised in a culture of celebrity obsession and makeover TV shows -- not to mention the fact that when Kristen was 16, her mother and older sister had received breast implants -- she believed a shapely bust line was her due. So, last May, as a high school graduation gift from her parents, Kristen underwent breast augmentation surgery with saline implants, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people 18 and older.
 ''I just wanted to look normal, and now I do,'' said Kristen, whose family members asked that their last name not be used. 
 To the rigors of teenage grooming -- waxing, plucking, body training and skin care regimens that were once the province of adults -- add cosmetic surgery, which is fast becoming a mainstream option among teenagers. But with this popularity, some experts are concerned that the underlying motivation for many of the young people seeking surgery -- namely, self-esteem -- is being disregarded in the drive to look, as Kristen puts it, ''normal.'' 
 The latest figures from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery show that the number of cosmetic surgical procedures performed on youths 18 or younger more than tripled over a 10-year period, to 205,119 in 2007 from 59,890 in 1997. This includes even more controversial procedures: liposuctions rose to 9,295 from 2,504, and breast augmentations increased nearly sixfold, to 7,882 from 1,326. (The latter two procedures have been associated with the deaths of two 18-year-olds: Amy Fledderman of Pennsylvania, who died in 2001 of fat embolism syndrome after undergoing liposuction, and Stephanie Kuleba of Florida, who died last spring from complications because of anesthesia used during a breast augmentation and inverted nipple surgery.) 
 At this point, the recession is apparently having little effect on teenage cosmetic surgery. While figures aren't available for 2008, reports from doctors suggest that parents are keeping their commitments for procedures that are covered by insurance only if considered reconstructive, and that can be costly if they aren't covered. The most frequent procedure, otoplasty, or ear reshaping, costs an average of $3,000, while rhinoplasty costs $4,500, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. These costs can be twice as much in the New York area.
 ''If parents have bought into the concept, if they're supportive of a procedure for their child, they seem to be going through with it despite the economy,'' said Dr. Alan Gold, a plastic surgeon in Great Neck, N.Y., and president of the society. 
 In fact, one of the most popular times for procedures for young patients is winter break, and several doctors said they noticed no drop in the number of adolescent patients last month.
 Critics say that with plastic surgery becoming more common, parents are more likely to find themselves having to learn how to say no to a son or daughter with a tarnished self-image who is begging for the same quick surgical fix that the parents themselves may have had. 
 ''Our children are barraged with images of ideal women and men that aren't even real, but computer composites,'' said Jean Kilbourne, co-author of ''So Sexy, So Soon,'' a book on teenagers and pre-teenagers. ''These girls and boys can't compete. The truth is, no one can. And it leaves teens feeling more inadequate than ever and a lot of parents unsure as to the right thing to do.''
 Dr. Frederick Lukash, a plastic surgeon in New York City and Long Island who specializes in treating adolescents, said: ''Unlike adults who may elect cosmetic surgery for that 'wow' factor to stand out in a crowd, to be rejuvenated and get noticed, kids have a different mantra. They do it to fit in.''
 Still, some parents are at least as concerned about their children's discomfort with their appearance as their children are. Jill Marks, whose 11-year-old daughter Julia is a rhinoplasty patient of Dr. Lukash's, said that when Julia was 6 she started taking her to doctors, including ear, nose and throat specialists, to find out what could be done about her crooked nose. ''I knew she was having a hard time with it physically, but also emotionally,'' Ms. Marks said. ''I'd see her in the bathroom pushing her nose to make it straighter. Some kids would ask her, 'Why's your nose so crooked?' I didn't want her to have to go through that anymore.''
 A recent survey of more than 1,000 girls in the United States ages 8 to 17 sponsored by the Dove Self-Esteem Fund -- which has a partnership with the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and is linked to Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty, a program aimed at changing narrow cultural definitions of beauty -- showed that 7 in 10 girls surveyed believed that when it came to issues including beauty and body image they did not ''measure up.'' Only 10 percent found themselves to be ''pretty enough.'' 
 ''It's clear there is an epidemic of low self-esteem among girls,'' said Ann Kearney-Cooke, director of the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute, adviser to Dove's study and author of the book ''Change Your Mind, Change Your Body.''
 ''I work with a lot of teens on body image,'' Dr. Kearney-Cooke said. ''I have girls who say they want lipo when really what they need is to learn how to exercise and diet. If a girl thinks no waist, big breasts and chiseled features is the only definition of beautiful, I try and teach them to recognize the narrow view of what's considered acceptable appearance in our culture, and how to challenge that view.''
 Apart from the fact that what may be considered less than ideal at 15 or 16 may change over time -- baby fat around a chin, say, or small breasts -- experts say adolescents may not fully understand that the change they're making is permanent.
 ''They may not be any happier with their new look, then what?'' asks Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women and Families. ''And even if all goes well at first with breast implant surgery, for example, it may require follow-up procedures. And we know how wrong breast implants can go with breast pain, ruptures, hardening, even a strange sloshing sound that sometimes occurs with saline implants.'' 
 But plastic surgeons say that as body parts develop at different rates in different people, the opportunity to transform a teenager with low self-esteem and a crooked nose into someone with self-confidence is often justified because a well-timed operation could prevent destructive behaviors, including eating disorders, bullying and self-mutilation.
 ''There are general guidelines we follow with regard to physical development, but we take each candidate on an individual basis,'' said Dr. Richard D'Amico, a plastic surgeon in Englewood, N.J. ''Someone can develop at an accelerated or slowed-down rate. And, of course, levels of maturity vary.''
 Michael Laudisio, now 22, of Massapequa, N.Y., admits he might not have been mature enough to understand the full implications when his ears were pinned at age 10, but he said his family's decision to do it changed his life profoundly. ''I had really big ears like no one else and was teased about it all the time,'' he said. ''That surgery made me free.'' 
 But it can be a very fine line between corrective surgery and cosmetic,and even within a family there can be vastly differing opinions. ''I've had mothers dragging their daughters in to have something done, and of course, if the teen is not on board, I'll suggest another appropriate course of action,'' said Dr. D'Amico, adding, ''You don't get self-esteem from a scalpel.''

HEADLINE: 2nd Hudson Rail Tunnel Clears Key Federal Hurdle

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The prospects for a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan received a major boost on Wednesday when federal authorities approved an environmental assessment for a $9 billion tunnel planned by New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority. 
 The agencies can now apply to get their final design accepted and lobby the federal government for the remaining $3 billion needed to begin work on the project, which is expected to be completed by 2017. If all goes well, the agencies believe they will be able to break ground in the summer.
 Known as Access to the Region's Core, or ARC, the tunnel would double the number of trains that can travel under the Hudson between New York and New Jersey to 48 per hour, from 23 now. The extra train service is expected to eliminate 22,000 automobile trips a day.
 The new service also would allow more New Jersey Transit riders to reach New York without having to change trains in Newark or Secaucus. A second tunnel would also relieve pressure on the century-old tunnel that New Jersey Transit shares with Amtrak. The project's six new tracks in Manhattan, which would terminate beneath 34th Street, would also allow commuters to connect underground to the subways and PATH trains at Avenue of the Americas.
 With the approval on Wednesday by the Federal Transit Administration, the Port Authority and New Jersey Transit are optimistic that they can receive the remaining money they need from the federal government, partly because President-elect Barack Obama has said he is committed to spending billions of dollars on large infrastructure projects to revive the economy.
 ''The timing couldn't be better, because the region could benefit from a project like this,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has contributed $3 billion to the project. ''In the near term, it will put a lot of people to work, and in the long term, it will revolutionize how people get into the city.''
 The project is expected to generate 6,000 jobs a year during construction. An additional 44,000 jobs could be created because the tunnel would provide easier access to New York City, according to New Jersey Transit.
 ''By putting boots on the pavement and shovels in the dirt, this project will employ thousands of workers and help jump-start the economy,'' said Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey.
 Critics contend that the new six-track annex under 34th Street is too deep and would be difficult for some people to escape during a fire. They also say that passengers whose trains stop there would have to walk an extra full block to get to Penn Station, where they would be able to catch subways running on the West Side of Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Chinese Officials Gamble, And Their Luck Runs Out

BYLINE: By MARK McDONALD

 BODY:
MACAO -- As mayor of a small city in the Chinese hinterland, Li Weimin started out innocently enough, playing the slots in nearby Macao, games with names like Five Dragons, Chinese Kitchen and Super Happy Fortune Cat.
But he soon began to try his hand at other games, and for higher stakes, financing his increasingly frequent trips to glitzy casinos by dipping into the municipal budget and several real estate firms under his control.
''It was easy for me to borrow or divert money from those places,'' the 43- year-old Mr. Li said at his trial, according to a state-run newspaper, China Daily. Eventually he lost $12 million and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
Mr. Li is one of an increasing number of Communist Party bosses and government officials who, government prosecutors say, pillaged state funds, company accounts and municipal treasuries to try their luck in Macao, which sits just across the border from Guandong Province.
Many of the biggest losers have been sent to prison and at least 15 have been executed. Some have committed suicide. The scandals have become a source of deep embarrassment for the Chinese government, which has now begun cracking down on travel visas for Macao.
While gambling remains illegal in mainland China, it is pure oxygen for Macao, which Portugal handed back to China in December 1999. The tiny territory, which has been enjoying a gambling-tourist-building boom since 2004, relies on gambling for 75 percent of its tax base.
Now the biggest gambling market in the world, Macao has annual gambling revenues higher than the Las Vegas Strip and Atlantic City combined. Among its 31 casinos is the world's largest, the Venetian Macao.
Much of that prosperity is now threatened, experts here say, not only by the global economic crisis but also by the crackdown on gambling by the government in Beijing. The issue is so sensitive in China that more than a dozen interview requests over the past month were refused by government and party leaders.
A Chongqing official, the head of the local Communist Party's propaganda department, was accused of embezzling a total of $24 million. Along with a co-worker, he blew at least half the money at the Casino Lisboa here, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
The Chinese officials who gamble here lose mostly at baccarat, the game of choice in Macao, but they also lose at blackjack, poker and a dice game called Fish-Prawn-Crab. And even though many of them are neophyte gamblers, they often bet thousands of dollars on a single hand.
A 2008 study of 99 high rollers from mainland China showed that 59 had some sort of state affiliation: 33 were government officials, 19 were senior managers at state-owned enterprises and 7 were cashiers at state businesses. They were typically men, between 30 and 49 years old, and lived in mainland areas close to Macao.
The government officials reported losing an average of $2.7 million each, according to the study, which was conducted by Zeng Zhonglu, a professor at Macao Polytechnic Institute. State managers lost $1.9 million each, on average, and cashiers dropped an average of $500,000. Most said their gambling careers lasted less than four years before they were found out.
Their losses at the tables bankrupted at least 10 companies. An editorial in the Beijing Youth Daily said gambling by public officials ''threatens the safety of the national treasury,'' though it is unclear just how much public money has been gambled away.
''I doubt even the Chinese government knows,'' said Desmond Lam, an expert on Macao and Chinese gambling who is currently a senior research fellow at the University of South Australia. ''Still, the figure is likely to be very substantial, at least in the hundreds of millions so far.
''And if you include the undetected money, it must be higher.''
China had tried repeatedly to clamp down on gambling by public officials but had never had much success until hitting on the idea of limiting visas. The new visa regulations, which went into effect last summer, limit mainland officials to just one trip every three months, and for no more than seven days, and have been highly effective, gambling analysts and scholars say.
''It has been a very, very serious problem, but it's better now,'' said Mr. Zeng, the author of the study on high rollers. ''The mainland government has strict controls over officials coming to Macao.''
But along the way, the restrictions have helped turn Macao's boom into something of a bust, a connection that was underscored on Monday, when the stocks of Macao casino companies plunged by a fifth after Beijing announced that it would retain the visa controls. Share prices of the companies are down more than 80 percent on average from their highs a year ago.
Casino bosses, tour operators, shop owners, restaurateurs and hoteliers say they are feeling the pain from what Samuel Yeung, the manager of the landmark Hotel Lisboa, calls ''the tightening control of mainland China.''
Gambling revenues are plunging and luxury shops are empty. Soaring hotel and apartment towers stand half-finished. Thousands of construction and casino workers have been fired. Last month at the Venetian, half the singing gondoliers on its indoor ''Grand Canal'' were abruptly fired.
''The government is saying Macao is going too fast and we need to cool it down,'' said Davis Fong, a business professor and director of the Institute for the Study of Commercial Gaming at the University of Macao. He cited a freeze on new projects and tighter regulations on the territory's casinos.
It is as if the gold is running out in the Klondike.
''It's not so much the global downturn that's having an effect on Macao; it's the visa restrictions that are having the most impact,'' said Anil Daswani, an analyst in Hong Kong who follows the gambling industry for Citigroup. ''Clearly there was way too much capital coming into Macao, and the mainland is trying to cool the economy.
''But it's definitely worrying. Volumes are down materially.''

HEADLINE: A Monetary Horror Story That Looks Like Today's

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
LORDS OF FINANCE
The Bankers Who Broke the World
By Liaquat Ahamed
Illustrated. 564 pages. The Penguin Press. $32.95.
Liaquat Ahamed's ''Lords of Finance'' is supposed to be a history book about the economics of World War I and the Great Depression. But there is terrific prescience to be found in its portrait of times past. Mr. Ahamed, an investment manager who proves to be a writer of great verve and erudition, easily connects the dots between the economic crises that rocked the world during the years his book covers and the fiscal emergencies that beset us today. He does this winningly enough to make his book about an international monetary horror story seem like a labor of love.
In 1999, looking at a Time magazine cover photograph of Alan Greenspan (then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board), Robert Rubin (Treasury secretary) and Lawrence Summers (deputy secretary), Mr. Ahamed pondered the article's headline: ''The Committee to Save the World.'' He knew, because he obviously knows a great deal of things about a dazzling range of subjects, that the fiscal team of superheroes concept was not new. 
In the 1920s the press had been infatuated with an international foursome of elite bankers who took on the challenge of restoring global economic balance after the wreckage created by World War I. They had been called the ''Most Exclusive Club in the World.''
Somehow Mr. Ahamed has been able to peg a many-faceted international economic story to the outsize personalities -- one each from the United States, France, Britain and Germany -- who made up that rescue team. And he succeeds so well that the potential opacity of his material is easily penetrated.
The reader who might not expect to be enthralled by the dangerous mutability of the gold standard, for example, will find it a subject of real fascination. And Mr. Ahamed does a superlative job of explaining the ever-germane way the problems of one shyster, one bank, one treasury or one economy can set off repercussions all around the globe.
Although ''Lords of Finance'' is much more than a personality-driven book, it has personalities to spare. The four men and their distinctive strategies are wonderfully drawn. If only by virtue of the velvet-collared cape and fan-backed oriental chair he used as accoutrements at a top-secret 1927 meeting on Long Island, Montagu Norman of the Bank of England emerges as this book's most exotic figure. The meeting led the Federal Reserve System of the United States to cut interest rates by half a percentage point to prop up the British pound. That it might have been ''the pivotal moment, the turning point that set in train the fateful sequence of events that would eventually lead the world into depression,'' is in no way trivialized by Mr. Ahamed's emphasis on Norman's peculiar personal style.
With the angrily Prussian-mannered Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, the conniving Emile Moreau of the Banque de France and Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as its other principals, and with Winston Churchill, John Maynard Keynes and Franklin D. Roosevelt among its secondary players, ''Lords of Finance'' tracks the shifting balance of economic power that reflected each country's self-interested agenda. But one of the book's most important points is that self-interest, in the world of global economic fluctuations, can be self-defeating.
For an explanation of how a surplus of gold bullion could be as dangerous as a dearth of it, Mr. Ahamed breaks the issue down maneuver by maneuver. He blames each banker for not anticipating how much damage each maneuver could do.
Mr. Ahamed's opinions are made very clear (the Paris Peace Conference's plan for Germany to pay war reparations is presented as a great blunder), but his overriding idea is that blame cannot be easily assigned: not even the most sophisticated economists of the era could accurately predict disaster, let alone guard against it. The effects of a public herd mentality at the time of the 1929 stock market crash are depicted, all too recognizably, as unstoppable.
''One is led to the inescapable but unsatisfying conclusion,'' Mr. Ahamed writes, in anything but unsatisfying fashion, ''that the bull market of 1929 was so violent and intense and driven by passions so strong that the Fed could do nothing about it.''
As for politicians trying to calm a frightened citizenry, Mr. Ahamed sees a version of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle bedeviling them. ''What they have to say about the economy affects its outcome,'' he notes. ''As a consequence, they have little choice but to restrict themselves to making fatuously positive statements which should never be taken seriously as forecasts.'' ''Lords of Finance'' has the flair and wisdom to find a wide readership on the strength of its main ideas. Even better, the book has added assets. It is written by a man so conversant with his material that he appreciates all its nuances, large and small. Among the minor highlights of this eminently readable story are some of the shadier scam artists whom history has all but forgotten (like Marthe Hanau, a spendthrift French divorcee who in the 1920s swindled hundreds of thousands of thrifty, small-town French investors by promoting flimsy stocks, and who always traveled with two limousines, in case one broke down). Then there are the aristocrats: when Mr. Ahamed has the chance to drop a name as memorable as Vere Brabazon Ponsonby, ninth Earl of Bessborough, he most assuredly will.
This book's culture clashes are every bit as memorable as its eerie prefigurings of the present financial meltdowns. It is in a spirit of true affection, rather than in an effort to leaven the mysteries of global economic synergy, that Mr. Ahamed cites one American politician particularly ill suited for a visit to Windsor Castle.
''King, I'm glad to meet you,'' declared Senator Key Pittman of Nevada, who was nominally in England to discuss the remonetization of silver. As if this were not reason enough for him to have stayed home, ''one night he was discovered by floor waiters at Claridges sitting stark naked in the sink of the hotel pantry, pretending to be a statue in a fountain.''
Correction: January 16, 2009, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Books of The Times review on Thursday, about ''Lords of Finance'' by Liaquat Ahamed, a history of the economics of World War I and the Depression, misspelled the surname of a German bank official in the 1920s. He was Hjalmar Schacht, not Schact. The review, using information from the book, also misstated the size of an interest-rate cut the Federal Reserve made in 1927. It was half a percentage point, not 0.5 percent.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Hears Riders' Reaction to Plans for Fare and Service Changes: They're Angry

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
New Yorkers, normally such a quarrelsome bunch, can agree on at least one thing: no one wants a huge fare increase and deep cuts in transit and commuter rail service. 
 Not the members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, who voted reluctantly for the proposed increase and cuts last month. Not the politicians, who dutifully upbraided the board members on Wednesday evening in Midtown Manhattan at the first of eight hearings on the matter. Not the subway, bus and commuter rail riders, many of them irate, many already hard-pressed by the economic times, who showed up at the hearing to protest the proposed changes in often personal terms. 
 The hearing, at the Trianon Ballroom of the Hilton New York Hotel, was attended by more than 400 people, about 300 of whom signed up to speak to 14 authority board members and top officials seated at a long table on the dais at the front. 
 Several strongly criticized a proposal that would more than double the fare for Access-a-Ride service for disabled riders, to $5 from $2, which some called a scare tactic. 
 ''I beg you, do not try to help balance your budget on the backs of people who are on limited incomes or frail, elderly or disabled,'' said Lynne Enman, who sat in a wheelchair at the front. ''That is not the way to do it. Even if it's legal, it is morally reprehensible.''
 About 40 minutes into the hearing, the authority chairman, H. Dale Hemmerdinger, addressed the crowd, which had grown raucous at times.
 ''I want to assure you we don't want to do any of what we have proposed,'' he said over the shouts. ''We don't want to do any of this. We don't want to frighten anybody.'' Over some boos, he encouraged the audience to write to lawmakers to urge them to provide more money for the authority.
 Despite all the shouting, sizable fare increases and service cuts are on the way unless state lawmakers step in to approve a new revenue source for the authority. 
 Even then, however, some cuts may still be necessary and a fare increase, although a smaller one, would still be likely.
 Although the public's input may influence where cuts are made, the authority is confronted by its worst financial crisis in two decades, and has said that it must raise fare and toll revenues by 23 percent, starting in June. That could mean the cost of a single ride on the subway or bus could go as high as $3, up from $2. The seven-day unlimited ride MetroCard could go to $31, from $25; and the 30-day MetroCard could rise as high as $103, from $81.
 On the commuter railroads, many ticket prices could rise by as much as 29 percent. 
 On the authority's bridges and tunnels, the one-way fare at major crossings like the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge could rise to $5.26, from $4.15 for E-ZPass. Cash tolls could rise to $6.50, from $5. 
 The proposed fare and toll increases are intended to help eliminate a $1.2 billion deficit in this year's budget. They would be coupled with reductions in expenses, including the deepest service cuts in years. 
 Those would include eliminating more than two dozen New York City Transit bus routes and cutting nighttime and weekend service on many other routes. The W and Z subway lines would also be eliminated, and off-peak service on other subway lines would be cut. Many subway station booths would be shuttered and five N train stations in Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn would be closed from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. 
 The proposed cutbacks are so extensive that for the subways and buses alone, the list of service cuts fills more than 200 pages. 
 To hold off these extreme measures, the state is considering a rescue plan for the authority that was proposed by a state commission headed by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman. 
 The commission proposed using a new tax on payrolls and charging tolls on the currently free bridges over the East River and Harlem River to generate revenue. 
 If state legislators approve a bailout, officials have said that they could forgo most or all of the worst service cuts, but that an 8 percent increase in fare and toll revenues would still be needed. Under one proposal being considered, that could lead to a base subway and bus fare of $2.25 and a 30-day MetroCard fare of $88. 
 Officials at the authority have said they hope the state will act quickly on a rescue plan. Under its more draconian proposal, the first service cuts could begin before the summer, while many others would not begin before the fall. The fare and toll increases, whether large or small, are scheduled to begin in June. The authority most recently raised fares and tolls last March.
 Waiting for her turn to speak, Dorothy Arkell, a retired teacher, held a bright orange sign calling for the authority to save the M8 bus, which runs crosstown in Manhattan between Greenwich Village and the East Village and is slated for elimination. 
 ''It is a disgrace,'' Ms. Arkell told a reporter of the plan to cut the route. ''Somebody sat someplace with a red pencil and decided to do away with it.''
 Ms. Arkell, who lives in Greenwich Village, said she often took the bus three or four times a day, including trips to a senior center and for shopping. 
 ''It's just a lifeline for getting around,'' she said.
 Christine Heyward, 65, was at the hearing to protest the plan to cancel another bus route, the M10; she lives about a block from the end of the bus line at the northern end of Frederick Douglass Boulevard. She told a reporter she had bad knees, making it hard for her to walk to other bus routes or use the subway. 
 ''We have no alternative,'' she said. ''We've got children there that go to school, a lot of handicapped and elderly.''

HEADLINE: Cabinet Choices Answer Questions From Senators Eric K. Shinseki

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the retired Army chief of staff who presciently predicted that stabilizing Iraq would take more troops than had been committed to the invasion, pledged Wednesday to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs to better fulfill the nation's promises to those who have served in uniform. 
 As President-elect Barack Obama's nominee to head the second-largest bureaucracy in the government, behind the Pentagon, General Shinseki said that if confirmed he would streamline the disability claims system, use new information technologies to improve the delivery of benefits and services, and focus on unemployed and homeless veterans.
 He also said the nation would more effectively fulfill its promise to take care of wounded veterans, those ''bearing scars of battle, some visible and many others invisible,'' a reference not only to those with physical wounds but also to those suffering from post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries.
 General Shinseki said he would apply the same skills to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs that he did in his tenure as Army chief of staff, when he started the nation's oldest armed service on a path to become lighter and more agile and rapidly deployable.
 When he retired in June 2003 after 38 years as a soldier, General Shinseki was the highest-ranking Asian-American in United States military history. He received two Purple Hearts for injuries in Vietnam, one in which he lost so much of his foot that the Army had wanted to discharge him. 
 In the spring of 2003, he was vilified by the Pentagon's civilian leadership after he spoke before Congress less than a month before the invasion of Iraq and warned that securing Iraq would require more troops than were being deployed for the invasion. 
 At Wednesday's hearing of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, members did not ask him about his 2003 testimony and instead showered him with praise. His confirmation is all but certain.
 General Shinseki said he was troubled by the department's history of lost or misplaced medical records. And he said the department must work to ensure that those leaving military service make a seamless transition to veterans' health care.
 If he is confirmed, General Shinseki said, the department ''would treat our veterans with dignity and respect.''
 ''For the V.A.,'' he said, ''the single focus for transformational change should be the veteran -- providing for generations of veterans, who have done their duty, the support and services they have earned and we have promised.'' THOM SHANKER

PERSON: John DeFrancis 

HEADLINE: John DeFrancis, Chinese Language Scholar, Is Dead at 97

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
John DeFrancis, one of the most influential scholars and teachers of the Chinese language in the last century, died on Jan. 2 in Hawaii. He was 97.
 Mr. DeFrancis died in a hospital after falling ill in late December, according to an official Web site memorial dedicated to him.
 Few scholars of Chinese wrote more probingly about the language, considered one of the most difficult for Westerners to master, and fewer still created teaching materials that had so widespread an impact on generations of students of Chinese. 
 Mr. DeFrancis, who spent much of his career as a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, set out in various books to explain the intricacies of the Chinese language. He tried to debunk commonly held myths about the language -- for example, that Chinese characters are ideograms, which represent ideas. He argued that they are morphosyllabic in nature, meaning they constitute a large system of syllables, albeit imprecise, while also conveying meaning.
 Among longtime scholars of the language, Mr. DeFrancis stood out as an iconoclast. Perhaps his most controversial argument was that the writing system needed to undergo a major reformation, with characters that had evolved over thousands of years to be replaced by a phonetic Latin script. 
 ''He was far and away the most important Chinese-language teacher of the 20th century,'' said Victor H. Mair, a China scholar at the University of Pennsylvania who worked closely with Mr. DeFrancis on various projects. ''Plus he was a very influential linguist writing about Chinese, Vietnamese and writing systems in general.''
 His experience with the language was deeply rooted in his living and traveling in China at a time when poverty and violence were endemic across the country. Mr. DeFrancis was born into a working-class family on Aug. 31, 1911, in Bridgeport, Conn. Though his father was a laborer and his mother illiterate, he graduated from Yale in 1933 with a degree in economics. He found it hard to get a job during the Great Depression, and so he boarded a ship for China at the suggestion of a dorm mate from a missionary family.
 Mr. DeFrancis enrolled in the College of Chinese Studies in Beijing. He had intended to work as a businessman, but he soon became disillusioned with the prevailing attitudes toward the Chinese among expatriate businesspeople. In 1935, he was asked by H. Desmond Martin, a military historian, to undertake a trip across China tracing the path of Genghis Khan. 
 Together they traveled 1,000 miles across the Gobi Desert by camel and 1,200 miles down the Yellow River on a raft of inflated sheepskins. Seeing the poverty of rural China up close made Mr. DeFrancis profoundly disillusioned with the Kuomintang, the ruling party at the time. Mr. DeFrancis recounted the journey in the book ''In the Footsteps of Genghis Khan,'' published in 1993 by the University of Hawaii Press.
 The year after the trip, back in Beijing, he met Katharine Wilson, whom he would marry. They returned to the United States, and Mr. DeFrancis became the first Ph.D. student in a new graduate program in Chinese studies at Yale. He later transferred to a Sinology program at Columbia.
 His first teaching job was as an assistant professor in the Paige School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, which was directed by Owen Lattimore, the prominent scholar of Central Asia. Mr. Lattimore became a target of the Communist witch hunts led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and Mr. DeFrancis was himself blacklisted by universities after coming to Mr. Lattimore's defense.
 That prompted Mr. DeFrancis to abandon the field of Chinese studies. To support himself, he became a vacuum cleaner salesman for a time, but his academic career was resurrected by John B. Tsu, the head of Chinese studies at Seton Hall University. Mr. Tsu commissioned Mr. DeFrancis to write a textbook for first-year students of Mandarin Chinese. That eventually led Mr. DeFrancis to write a 12-volume series of textbooks published by Yale University Press. The books, known as the DeFrancis series, were widely used in classrooms in the 1970s and '80s.
 Mr. DeFrancis moved to Hawaii with his wife in 1966 to direct the Chinese program at the University of Hawaii. She died in 1970. Mr. DeFrancis is survived by their son, Charles.
 Mr. DeFrancis retired from teaching in 1976, but he continued writing prolifically. One of his most popular books, ''The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy,'' was published in 1984. It was in this book that he tried to tackle many of the myths about Chinese, asserting, for example, that the speech forms in China commonly called dialects are actually distinct languages quite different from Mandarin.
 His knowledge was not limited to China; he also wrote on the history and the language of Vietnam. But the Chinese language was always at the center of his scholarly pursuits, and he spent the final years of his life editing an ambitious work, the ABC (Alphabetically Based Computerized) Chinese-English dictionary series. The first edition was published by the University of Hawaii in 1996, and two more editions followed. Many software programs have used the dictionary's database.
 In researching the book ''Oracle Bones,'' Peter Hessler, a reporter for The New Yorker, interviewed Mr. DeFrancis at his home on Oahu. Mr. Hessler quoted Mr. DeFrancis as saying he had been so embittered by the fact that Mao Zedong and other Chinese Communist leaders did not follow through with a project to overhaul the writing system that he had not set foot in China for more than 45 years.
 Mr. DeFrancis argued that the Communist revolution had created an epochal opportunity to reinvent the Chinese language and make it much more accessible. So he felt that Chinese leaders had failed him. He did eventually return to China, on a visit in 1982, but he never lived there again.

Latvia is used to a staid, peaceful type of protest. But the demonstration in the Latvian capital of Riga, in response to economic turmoil, ended with about 25 people and 106 under arrest. The aftermath of the protest left Latvia's president threatening a referendum that would allow voters to disband Parliament. Page A11

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Pick Vows to Put Science First

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Lisa P. Jackson, chosen to head the Environmental Protection Agency, said at her confirmation hearing Wednesday morning that her first task would be to restore scientific and legal integrity to an agency battered by charges of political interference and coziness with industry.
 But she evaded questions on whether as administrator of the E.P.A. she would immediately grant authority to California and 16 other states to regulate vehicle tailpipe emissions, promising only a speedy review of the issue. Nor did she directly answer questions on whether and how the agency would address regulation of carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act, an authority granted the E.P.A. by the Supreme Court in 2007. 
 The Bush administration has declined to act on either matter.
 Her promise to be guided by science and the law was an implicit rebuke of the management of the E.P.A. under President Bush, where career officials' recommendations were sometimes ignored in decisions regarding lead in the air, arsenic in water, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
 ''Science must be the backbone of what E.P.A. does,'' Ms. Jackson said in her opening statement to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. ''If I am confirmed, I will administer with science as my guide. I understand the laws leave room for policymakers to make policy judgments. But if I am confirmed, political appointees will not compromise the integrity of E.P.A.'s technical experts to advance particular regulatory outcomes.''
 Ms. Jackson, 46, holds degrees in chemical engineering from Tulane University and Princeton University. She worked as a career employee at E.P.A. for 15 years and most recently served as head of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection,
 Senator Barbara Boxer, chair of the committee, said she had waited a long time for new leadership at the environmental agency. ''E.P.A. works for the American people and in my view we have seen it hurt the American people these past eight years,'' she said. The agency, she added, ''needs to be awakened from a deep and nightmarish sleep.''
 Ms. Jackson said that President-elect Barack Obama believes that sound stewardship of the environment can co-exist with economic growth. ''Done properly,'' she said, ''these goals can and should reinforce each other.''
 She said that the new administration's environmental priorities would be curbing global warming, reducing air pollution, cleaning up hazardous waste sites, regulating toxic chemicals and protecting water quality.
 Republicans on the committee expressed concern that Ms. Jackson would try to do too much at E.P.A. Senator John Barrasso, the newly-elected Republican from Wyoming, cautioned Ms. Jackson against using the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
 ''Ranchers and miners in Wyoming know that addressing climate change through the Clean Air Act is a disaster waiting to happen,'' he said.
 That drew a rebuke from Ms. Boxer, who said that Mr. Barrasso had not read the Clean Air Act or did not accept Supreme Court decision giving the E.P.A. power to regulate carbon dioxide under it.
 The ranking Republican on the committee, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, noted that former Vice President Al Gore and many other experts of global warming had suggested that a tax on carbon would be a more effective means of reducing carbon emissions than a cap-and-trade system like the one advocated by President-elect Barack Obama.
 Ms. Jackson said that it was a legitimate subject for debate, but that she would support Mr. Obama's preference for cap-and-trade, under which a limit is set on emissions and polluters must buy or trade permits to meet it.
 Mr. Inhofe also made Ms. Jackson promise to read a speech he delivered on the Senate floor last week, citing a number of scientists and other experts who question the consensus view on global warming.
 Mr. Inhofe left Ms. Jackson, a native of New Orleans, with a warning. ''This job is no Mardi Gras,'' he said. ''This job is really tough.''
 After committee members finished questioning Ms. Jackson, they turned to the appointment of Nancy Sutley, 46, currently deputy mayor of Los Angeles for energy and environment, to chair the White House Council on Environmental Quality.
 Ms. Sutley told the committee that she intended to move the nation toward reliance on cleaner forms of energy, to protect public health and to combat global warming. She did not detail how she, Ms. Jackson and Carol Browner, the designated White House coordinator for energy and the environment, would divide their responsibilities. Ms. Browner's post does not require Senate confirmation.
 Senator Boxer said she expected the committee to vote favorably on both nominees on Inauguration Day or shortly thereafter.

HEADLINE: A Second Day of Job Cuts at Barclays

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and LANDON THOMAS JR

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Barclays, the British banking giant, said on Wednesday that it was in the process of cutting an additional 2,100 jobs in its retail, commercial banking and credit card businesses. 
 On Tuesday, the bank said that it would cut 2,100 positions at its investment banking unit, Barclays Capital, at its wealth management business and its fund management operation. That brings the total of planned job cuts at Barclays this year to 4,600, including 400 information technology positions that the bank cut last week. 
 The cuts come shortly after the $1.75 billion acquisition of a part of Lehman Brothers -- a deal that Barclays' president, Robert E. Diamond Jr., hopes will vault the bank into the upper tier of global banks. This fall, Barclays' investment banking division in the United States absorbed 10,000 employees with the acquisition from Lehman Brothers, but 3,000 jobs were subsequently cut. 
 Graham Goddard, deputy general secretary of the British trade union Unite, criticized Barclays for failing to communicate the total number of jobs at risk and accused the management of following a strategy of ''death by a thousand cuts.''
 ''We cannot continue with this situation of daily job cuts without any justification or explanation of the broader strategy for the bank,'' Mr. Goddard said. ''In this economic environment, it is not acceptable for Barclays staff to arrive at work each day with the dread that they could be next in what appears to be a lottery of job losses.''
 A spokeswoman for the bank said that most of the positions at risk had already been communicated to the staff. ''We will take all possible measures to mitigate compulsory redundancies through redeployment, using natural attrition, releasing of contractors, closing vacancies and opening voluntary redundancy registers,'' the bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
 The total cuts represented about 3 percent of the bank's global work force of 156,000 at the end of October.
 Barclays Capital, the investment bank, will absorb the bulk of the losses, 1,300 in total, while the wealth management unit will lose 500 positions and Barclays Global Investors 300. 
 The cuts are the latest to grip financial institutions on both sides of the Atlantic. Onetime high-flying banks, like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Credit Suisse and UBS, have taken a sharp knife to their investment banking divisions. With the outlook glum, analysts expect the trend to continue.
 Most of the layoffs are in areas hardest hit by the slowdown -- fixed income and all areas related to the structuring and securitization of investment products. 
 While the cuts were to be expected, given the paring done by rivals of Barclays, they also highlight the challenge facing managers as the bank tries to expand at a time that institutions like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are becoming more conservative and risk averse. 
 Barclays' aggressive push to become a diversified investment bank puts it in a small group that includes Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase.

HEADLINE: Where Is Oil Going Next?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- From the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico, giant supertankers brimming with oil are resting at anchor or slowly tracing racetrack patterns through the sea, heading nowhere.
The ships are marking time, serving as floating oil-storage tanks. The companies and countries leasing them for that purpose have made a simple calculation: the price of oil has fallen so far that it is due for a rise.
Some producing countries are trying to force that rise by using the tankers to withhold oil from the market, while traders are trying to profit by buying cheap oil now to store and sell at a higher price later. Oil storage has become so popular that onshore tank capacity is becoming scarce.
Only six months ago, companies up and down the energy pipeline were rushing oil to market, struggling to keep up with galloping demand and soaring prices. Now, with the global economy slumping and people driving less, demand for oil has plunged -- and the same companies are acting in ways that would have been unimaginable until recently. 
Oil producers are shutting down rigs, refiners are producing less gasoline, and investment planning throughout the industry is in turmoil.
The problem for the companies is not just that prices are lower, but that they have become volatile -- historically, a sign of an unstable market whose direction is uncertain. Between Christmas and a week ago oil prices soared 40 percent, only to reverse course almost as sharply in recent days. Just last week, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped by nearly 12 percent in one day alone.
''The oil markets are suffering acute whiplash,'' said Daniel Yergin, an energy consultant and author of ''The Prize,'' a history of world oil markets. ''Price volatility is adding to the sense of shock and confusion and uncertainty.''
The wild price swings are a continuation of last year's trends, when the price of a barrel of oil swelled to nearly $150 in July from just below $100 in January before collapsing to less than $35 last month. Daily oil prices rose or dropped by 5 percent or more 39 times, versus just four times over the previous two years. The only recent year that was comparably volatile was 1990, the year Iraq invaded Kuwait.
The continuing volatility is sending waves of anxiety up and down the complex production and investment chains of the oil world.
A year ago, oil producers and refiners could not move their products fast enough to meet growing world demand and chase rising prices. Now, with demand and prices slumping, they are sitting on 327 million barrels at tank farms around the country, particularly at Cushing, Okla., a major storage hub and a crossroads for pipelines. That is more than 40 million barrels more in storage than this time last year, and more than 30 million barrels higher than the five-year average.
The mounting buildup has come during the last 100 days or so, as consumption of oil fell behind imports and domestic production.
With storage tanks filling up onshore, private and national oil companies, refiners and trading companies are storing another 80 million barrels aboard 35 supertankers and a handful of smaller tankers, the most in 20 years, according to Frontline Ltd., the world's largest owner of supertankers.
The different players have different reasons for storing oil, whether onshore or offshore.
National oil companies are hoping to reverse the price slide by holding oil off the market. Iran alone is reportedly using as many as 15 tankers to store crude oil in hopes that higher prices will prop up its economy, which is dependent on oil exports.
Private trading companies like Vitol and Phibro are storing oil in expectation of higher prices. They are taking their cues from markets where traders buy and sell contracts for future delivery of oil, which are signaling higher prices down the road.
Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, noted that a trading company could buy oil at the spot price of nearly $40 a barrel, store it and sell a contract to deliver it in a year for about $60. ''You pay between $6 and $10 a barrel to store it, and you can make $10 a barrel,'' he said. ''That's why Cushing is filling up rapidly and people are leasing tankers.''
One small example of how the price uncertainty has affected behavior is the Devon Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma City company that in recent years has excited the energy world with announcements about expensive new investments in Canadian oil sands and deepwater oil exploration projects.
The company recently put off announcing details of its drilling program. Chip Minty, a Devon spokesman, said: ''The volatility we have seen in the last year, and particularly the last few months, is making it more difficult to plan a drilling program that is funded through cash flow. Everybody is laying down rigs.''
Devon's caution is a sign that the go-go days of investment are giving way to more modest expectations. Schlumberger and Halliburton, the two top oil service companies, are cutting jobs. Many oil companies are delaying investments in more expensive projects, like mining Canadian oil sands. A couple of refiners face bankruptcy.
The volatility is showing up at the retail level. Drivers who only a few weeks ago were finding relief from the summer's $4-a-gallon gasoline are now shaking their heads as the average national price for unleaded regular gasoline has surged to $1.79, from $1.62, since Dec. 30.
Oil volatility has complicated the efforts of automobile companies to figure out future strategies. Toyota had to suspend production at one plant that builds the Tundra pickup truck for several months when gasoline prices soared last summer. Toyota then delayed completion of a second plant meant to build the Prius hybrid when falling gasoline prices led to weakening demand for that fuel-efficient model.
The gyrations in prices affect shipping and other businesses around the world. Cathay Pacific, one of many airlines that use fuel hedging strategies, recently acknowledged that it had hedging losses of hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the collapse in fuel prices.
The slowdown in oil investment is so rapid that some analysts say they believe it is a matter of time before shortages appear that will push oil prices to new heights and damage the economy.
From day to day, the price swings reflect a push and pull among the various players in the market, and diverging geopolitical and economic trends.
After months of sharply dropping prices, psychology on the oil markets seemed to shift strongly after Christmas -- sending oil prices to almost $50 in January, from just below $34 on Dec. 19.
Traders were putting investment money back into oil as OPEC appeared to be serious about cutting output. Fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza appeared to threaten a broader Middle East conflict that might crimp oil supplies. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas shipments threatened European supplies, raising fears that Europeans might have to switch from natural gas to oil.
But the mood shifted just as quickly last week when the Energy Department reported that crude oil inventories at Cushing had climbed by four million barrels, to 32 million barrels, for the week that ended Jan. 2, the highest since the government started tracking supplies in 2004. That number jumped again in a report on Wednesday, to 33 million barrels, near Cushing's operating capacity of 35 million barrels.
Spooked by the signs of surplus, traders drove the spot price of oil down to $37.28 a barrel on Wednesday, a drop of 1.3 percent.
Gasoline, meanwhile, has become pricier at the pump because refiners have been producing less of it. Profits from refining have been so thin over the last several months that refiners have been earning little, or even losing money, on producing gasoline. So now they are storing oil or selling it to traders, or retooling their refineries to produce less gasoline and more products with better profit margins, like heating oil, diesel or jet fuel.
Valero has curtailed gasoline supplies by extending maintenance time at some refineries and cutting production at eight of its 16 refineries. ''There is not a lot of incentive right now to produce gasoline because there is lots of it,'' said Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero, the nation's largest refiner. ''Obviously it would be better for us if there were more stability in prices.''
While Goldman Sachs has predicted the slumping global economy will soon drive the price of oil down to $30, a top Kuwaiti oil official predicted recently that big production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon push oil prices back up.
''It's a sure bet that both will be right,'' Mr. Yergin said, basing his opinion on the sharp swings of recent days.
Analysts foresee prices staying volatile for much of the year.
''Volatility is just another way of saying uncertainty,'' said Adam J. Robinson, director of commodities at Armored Wolf, a California hedge fund. ''The demand outlook is very uncertain, the general outlook for prices is very uncertain, and the supply outlook is very uncertain.''

HEADLINE: Fragments Tell a Story of Pain and Pride

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
By now the question that frames a new $14 million exhibition opening on Thursday at the National Constitution Center here is one that shouldn't have to be asked and should have already been fully answered. It comes from the writings of W. E. B. Du Bois, to whom the first gallery in this large exhibition is devoted -- the only black intellectual or writer to get such attention: ''Would America have been America without her Negro people?''
 This show, which ranges over 13,000 square feet and will continue a 10-city, 4-year tour after it leaves here in May, answers Du Bois with a ringing affirmation of black centrality. It isn't just that blacks in America have made important contributions to a country that in significant numbers forcibly absorbed African slaves and forcibly resisted absorbing their descendants, but that the history of America and the history of America's blacks are inseparable. They are so intertwined as to become aspects of a single identity in which neither strand can be considered in isolation. ''America,'' the exhibition says in its title, ''I Am.'' 
 It is astonishing to think that a half-century ago such an idea would have seemed alien to much historical interpretation and would have also been posed with a mixture of anxious aggression. This transformation in historical understanding was one of the most important of the 20th century. Now, it is so mainstream that this show, ''America I Am: The African American Imprint,'' is actually a commercial enterprise created by the television personality and author Tavis Smiley along with Arts and Exhibitions International (whose last great success was the 2007 touring King Tut exhibition). The Cincinnati Museum Center, with which the show's executive producer, John Fleming, is associated, was also involved. 
 This commercial aspect also means that there is some emphasis on spectacle, creating gallery environments to evoke the black experience in the United States, complete with sound effects and lighting. There is much focus too on the overall outline rather than analytic details. That is both the show's greatest strength and its greatest weakness. 
 It is a popular historical survey, never touching down too deeply and keeping the narrative in constant view: we pass through the actual doors of Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, through which captive slaves also passed, before the displayed shackles and brands were used by their European and American buyers. Then comes a survey of how inextricably knit into the Southern economy (and much of the Northern as well) these slaves became, and the painful ironies of the founders' vision of freedom that left slavery as a footnoted exception to their powerful pronouncement of inalienable rights. 
 The overall narrative is so familiar it risks becoming commonplace, touching on the antislavery movement, the Civil War, the failures of Reconstruction, the contributions of black American culture, the civil rights movement, and an upbeat three-screen film in which black and white American identities intertwine. 
 The importance of black churches is rightly singled out for more attention than usual, but it is not in the large sweep of this exhibition that we feel the story's importance, but in the smaller objects on display. These include the abolitionist's defensive cudgel used by the ''league of Massachusetts Freemen'' when confronted with slave hunters, a rare American flag used by a ''black brigade'' in Cincinnati during the Civil War, porcelain figurines of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom, separate bathroom signs from 1927 labeled ''White Ladies'' and ''Colored Women,'' a ''Bill of Sale'' certifying that friends had purchased Frederick Douglass's freedom for $711.66 in 1846, a model of a small screaming black baby whose wide-open red mouth was meant to be used as an ash tray, miniature Ku Klux Klan figures that look like chessmen, the door key and stool from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birmingham jail cell. 
 In these objects, in the sheet music, costumes, films and books, in the glimpses of trial and triumph, there is an epic American story to be told. For museums the climax will come when the National Museum of African American History and Culture opens in Washington, scheduled for 2015. What is missing here, though, is the complexity of the struggle, some sense of the political movements at work in different periods, and even some sense of how those debates have evolved in the present day. 
 Pick any particular subject and you find broad strokes rather than subtle details. The slave trade is summarized in a single map, the Emancipation Proclamation's focus on the Confederate states alone is not fully explained, the immense failure of Reconstruction in the South is not explored. Many objects, including some I've mentioned, receive only cursory identification, so their place of origin or date is left unclear. And in contemporary decades so much has happened that the simple tale told here isn't enough. Just putting Malcolm X's Koran on display doesn't inform the viewer about what issues were being debated in the 1960s in the black civil rights movement, or illuminate the political rage of that era, or provide some idea of the pain and of the stakes. 
 The exhibition gives just one glimpse of that rage, early in the show, in which a jagged American flag is illuminated in blood-red light, draped in chains and images of protest, under which a quotation from Paul Robeson can be read. But it displays the latent anger of the presenters rather than something about its subject; the exhibition would be more powerful if it explored that rage rather than so uncharacteristically depicting it.
 And perhaps, too, the show's design could have been more taut: Why was Du Bois given the honorific centrality of the opening gallery? How did his interpretations evolve? And what impact does he still have?
 What the exhibition does present is a basic primer, which will, perhaps, serve as a popular introduction. The problem is that most of the history here is so well known in outline that it could serve as the foundation for a show rather than its main point, a frame for explanation rather than the object of attention. At any rate, though, this show succeeds in its original purpose. It makes the question, ''Would America have been America without her Negro people?'' seem superfluous.
 ''America I Am: The African American Imprint'' opens on Thursday and runs through May 3 at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia; (215) 409-6700, americaiam.org and constitutioncenter.org.

HEADLINE: New Leader Is Named for Embattled City Opera

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The tottering New York City Opera said on Wednesday that it had found a savior after two years of financial and leadership turmoil, appointing the impresario and conductor George R. Steel as its general manager and artistic director.
 Mr. Steel's selection follows the company's highly public and messy divorce two months ago from Gerard Mortier, director of the Paris Opera, who said he could not fulfill his artistic vision with the reduced budget provided by the board.
 Opera lovers hope Mr. Steel's arrival will quell the turbulent plotlines at what many consider the nation's second most important house. Founded in 1943, with help from Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, as the ''people's opera,'' City Opera has the mission of offering accessible, affordable, innovative productions hospitable to young American singers. The company's recent struggles could fill a libretto of jilted lovers, betrayal and sudden changes of fortune.
 ''George is actually the perfect person for City Opera in this chapter of its institutional life,'' said the house's chairwoman, Susan L. Baker. ''He is scrappy, flexible, adaptable, charming and innovative.'' 
 The board met for final approval late Wednesday, a day before the company was to give the first of two concert performances of Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' at Carnegie Hall, the centerpiece of its minimalist season. At Mr. Mortier's urging City Opera has remained almost entirely inactive while its Lincoln Center home, the David H. Koch Theater, is being renovated. The loss of revenues, high fixed expenses and the recession have all left the company in economic jeopardy. Mr. Steel is to start Feb. 1. 
 His hiring came as a blow to the smaller and less prestigious Dallas Opera, where he had just started as general director in October. The company is to move into the glamorous new Winspear Opera House next fall. 
 ''It's the opportunity of a lifetime,'' Mr. Steel said in explaining his jump to City Opera.
 For months, and as recently as Dec. 22, Mr. Steel sought to quash rumors that he was interested in the job, saying he was happy in Dallas and denying outright that he was in talks. But in an interview this week Mr. Steel said he was seriously approached by City Opera in mid-December and gave it earnest consideration during a Christmas break at the home of his in-laws in Washington. He called the decision wrenching.
 ''Being asked to play a role in its future is something I really couldn't brush off and take lightly,'' he said of City Opera. The ''outpouring of support'' from the opera world for an institution in crisis helped solidify his decision, he added. ''New York is unthinkable without it,'' he said. 
 The president of the Dallas Opera board, Kern Wildenthal, said there were no hard feelings and called the separation amicable. ''George Steel is a very talented young man,'' he said. ''When he accepted this job, I suspect he never thought the opportunity to direct the City Opera would come along in the near future.'' Mr. Wildenthal continued, ''We cannot feel bad about the opera world sorting itself out in a beneficial way for all concerned.'' 
 Mr. Steel, 42, is also a conductor. He made his name as the executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University for 11 years, turning it into an important part of the musical scene in New York with imaginative offerings of contemporary and early music. Other than his three months in Dallas, he has no experience running an opera house, although the Miller presented about a dozen small opera productions during his tenure. He also has no experience raising money on the scale required by City Opera.
 What he will have to work with is up in the air. Ms. Baker said that next season would be truncated, with fewer than 10 productions, partly because of continuing renovations, but also to save money. In its glory days the company produced nearly twice as many operas.
 Mr. Mortier, an iconoclastic Belgian-born opera manager known for provocative productions, was named to lead City Opera in February 2007 but was to take up the post full-time only next season, after finishing his term in Paris. He brought a radical plan for mainly 20th-century operas, off-site performances and nonoverlapping productions. Many in the opera world were skeptical about the choice from the start. Mr. Mortier dismayed City Opera board members by making a bid in August to run the Bayreuth Festival in Germany. 
 But at the time his appointment was also seen as a challenge to the rising fortunes of the Metropolitan Opera across Lincoln Center Plaza, where a relatively new general manager, Peter Gelb, had seized the mantle of innovation. The Met too now faces serious financial pressures, along with the rest of the opera and orchestra world amid declining markets.
 Although Ms. Baker said that it was too early to say what the City Opera annual budget would be, she predicted it would fall in the ''30-ish'' millions of dollars, instead of the roughly $42 million of previous seasons. She painted a dire picture of the endowment. It stood at $22 million at the end of November, she said, compared with $45 million three months earlier. 
 While City Opera is taking in minimal income, it is still paying the chorus and orchestra at least $4.7 million this year, as well as administrative costs. The orchestra's contract expires in the spring. While formal negotiations have yet to begin, Ms. Baker said management would seek concessions, and added that the company's unions are ''aware of the challenging financial situation and the need to create a viable budget.'' 
 Donations remain strong, said Michael M. Kaiser, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, who is advising the company gratis. ''They have a very loyal donor base,'' he said. ''What's been harmed is their ability to go out to get new donors.''
 He said that he was confident City Opera could put on a season despite the lack of planning in a field where casts, directors and conductors are fixed years in advance. ''The level of goodwill toward the City Opera is just mammoth,'' he said. 
 Yet controversy dogged City Opera even as it struggled to right itself this week. Francesca Zambello, a prominent opera and theater director, said she had been offered the job of artistic director on Dec. 30 under a plan that would include a separate executive director. But Ms. Baker withdrew the offer on Jan. 7, Ms. Zambello said, adding that the board chairman wanted a sole leader working ''24-7.'' 
 Ms. Zambello said that her main concern was the long-term health of a much-beloved opera company, which she claimed was being mismanaged by the board. ''They are destroying a public institution by their actions, which are unconscionable,'' she said.
 Ms. Baker said that account was ''absolutely not correct'' and denied having offered Ms. Zambello the position.
 Mr. Steel offered few details of his forthcoming tenure. ''My plans are to dive headfirst into the work and solve both short-term and long-term problems at the same time,'' he said. ''I want to continue City Opera's remarkable legacy in all kinds of operas,'' he added, mentioning the works of Handel, Rameau, Gluck, as well as less familiar 19th-century works and world premieres. He singled out ''A Quiet Place,'' with music by Leonard Bernstein, and ''The Flood,'' a Stravinsky work originally written for television, as ''germs of ideas.'' 
 Mr. Steel said he might try his hand on the podium with a favorite work, but not until after his first season on the job.

HEADLINE: No Evidence of Return Migration Is Found

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Despite the worst United States economy in decades and a slowdown in the growth of the nation's foreign-born population, there is no hard evidence of a return migration tied to the recession, researchers at the Migration Policy Institute said in a report released Wednesday.
 Anecdotal evidence suggests that in the last two years more immigrants than usual, legal and illegal, have left the United States for their countries of origin, the report said. But no data exists to verify such a trend, according to the institute, a nonpartisan research organization. 
 ''Substantial return migration of unauthorized immigrants is unlikely unless there's a protracted and severe worsening of the U.S. economy,'' said Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the institute and a co-author of the report, which draws on historical patterns, demographic studies and ''educated speculation.''
 Instead of leaving the country, unauthorized immigrants seem to be more likely than natives or legal immigrants to move from state to state in search of work, Mr. Papademetriou said. He said, for example, that complaints about a shortage of agricultural hands had died down, in part because some immigrants previously absorbed by the construction boom had headed back to farm work.
 Numbers on annual emigration are skimpy at best; the government abandoned the effort to track departing immigrants in 1957. But even for unauthorized immigrants, whose flows to the United States are far more responsive to the economy than those of legal immigrants or asylum-seekers, the report said, a decision to return home is likely to be a last resort. 
 The downturn in the United States is also hurting the economies of home countries, and recent currency fluctuations have made remittances in dollars more valuable, especially in Mexico and Central America. And unlike Eastern European workers in Britain and Ireland, who have been returning home in the knowledge that they can easily go back if things change, Latin American immigrants in the United States face growing barriers to re-entry.
 Some effects of the economic crisis can be hard to disentangle from those of stricter enforcement, the researchers added, citing stepped up raids and record levels of deportation, about 361,000 in the year ending last Sept. 30, roughly double the number from 2005. 
 But though anecdotal evidence suggests that some noncitizens are leaving states that have enacted particularly tough laws intended to curb illegal immigration, the report said, initially, at least, their destinations are probably within the United States. 
 Still, Mr. Papademetriou added in an interview: ''Everything hinges on how deep and how long the recession will be. People can try to adjust their expectations, take a job for less pay. But there comes a decision point where you say, If this is going to be as nasty as it appears to be, can I survive? Or can I survive better back home?''
 The report cited a growing body of evidence that the historic growth of the foreign-born in the United States had slowed, largely because there has been no growth in the unauthorized immigrant population since 2006 -- as was reported last fall by Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center. 
 In an interview, Mr. Passel agreed that though departures were probably up somewhat, ''the cessation of growth in the unauthorized population is due to the decline in arrivals.'' 
 Over time, 20 percent to 40 percent of immigrants to the United States have eventually returned to their country of origin, he said. But even in the Great Depression, he added, when more people left than arrived, that historic shift was driven by the steep drop in immigration, not by any increase in departures.

HEADLINE: SWINDLERS FIND GROWING MARKET IN FORECLOSURES

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
As home values across the country continue to plummet, the authorities say a new breed of swindler is preying on the tens of thousands of homeowners desperate to avoid foreclosure.
 Until recently, defrauders tried to bilk homeowners out of the equity in their homes. Now, with that equity often dried up, they are presenting themselves as ''foreclosure rescue companies'' that charge upfront fees to modify loans but often do nothing to stave off foreclosure. 
 The Federal Trade Commission brought lawsuits last year against five companies representing 20,000 customers, and state and local prosecutors have brought dozens more. In Florida, Attorney General Bill McCollum recently sued a company that he said had more than 600 victims. 
 ''There's no way for the consumer to sort out the legitimate companies,'' said Mr. McCollum, who added that he had limited resources to fight what he called ''a sheer volume question.'' 
 The companies under suspicion typically charge an upfront fee of up to $3,000 to help borrowers get lower rates on their mortgages from their lenders. But borrowers often cannot afford the fees, the service can be bogus and, in the worst cases, the homeowners lose their chance to renegotiate with their bank or to file for bankruptcy protection because of the time wasted.
 There are companies that provide legitimate foreclosure services, but the industry is largely unregulated, making it difficult for homeowners to separate the good from the bad. Some of the fraudulent companies -- often run by former real estate agents or mortgage brokers -- are local; others are national. Many have official-looking Web sites that suggest that the companies have government affiliations and give homeowners a false sense of security.
 ''That's all I've been doing for the last year,'' said Angela Rosenau, a deputy attorney general in California, citing more than 300 complaints about fraudulent companies last year, not counting those made to local prosecutors.
 Experiences like those of Maria Martinez, of Stockton, Calif., are playing out with greater frequency across the country, the authorities say. Ms. Martinez struggled to pay her mortgage last summer. She had no shortage of people offering to help. Fliers for rescue companies filled her mailbox. 
 At a seminar for troubled borrowers near her home, one company offered a service that promised just what Ms. Martinez needed: for $1,000, the company said it would negotiate with her mortgage company to lower her interest rate. 
 ''I was desperate,'' said Ms. Martinez, 57, a clerk at the San Joaquin County Jail. She made an initial payment of $500 and paid another $500 a few weeks later. 
 Now the house is in foreclosure, and Ms. Martinez is waiting for the sheriff to evict her. She cannot reach the man she paid to modify her loan. 
 In California and 20 other states, including New York, companies are prohibited from collecting payment until they have completed their services, something Ms. Martinez did not know. In Colorado, the attorney general's office has closed 15 mortgage rescue companies that charged fees up front. 
 Carol McClelland, 46, fell into foreclosure on her Chicago home when she lost her job as a waitress in two restaurants. She received a call from a company called Foreclosure Solutions Experts, promising to stop the foreclosure and lower her mortgage payments to around $550 a month, from $1,056, Miss McClelland said. 
 ''She showed me other clients' files, and they were paying $650 a month,'' she said. The charge for the service was $1,300, which Miss McClelland paid in installments, borrowing the money from friends and relatives. 
 When the loan servicer notified her that the house was still in foreclosure, Miss McClelland said, the representative from Foreclosure Solutions Experts told her that the matter had been taken care of.
 ''She told me everything was all settled; I don't have to worry about anything,'' Miss McClelland said. ''All I had to worry about was getting the rest of the money to her.''
 According to a suit brought by the Illinois attorney general in November, Foreclosure Solutions Experts does little or nothing to help consumers, and when it does take action, the result is often a repayment plan unsuited to the borrower's ability to pay. The suit alleges that the company never contacted Miss McClelland's lender, HSBC. 
 Illinois is one of the states that bans upfront payments to foreclosure rescue companies. The attorney general's office has received ''thousands'' of complaints about such companies, said Michelle Garcia, an assistant attorney general, and the suit against Foreclosure Solutions Experts is one of 22 filed by the state.
 Stacy Strong, who runs Foreclosure Solutions Experts, did not return calls for comment. 
 Advocates say foreclosure rescue scams are particularly insidious because they prey on people's desperation and because they victimize those who can least afford it. 
 Borrowers seeking loan modification are often frustrated that they cannot reach the right people at their lender or that the lender insists on a repayment plan they cannot keep, said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. 
 ''When you're desperate, that's when the crooks come out,'' Mr. Rheingold said. ''You've tried everything, and a guy calls you up on the phone or there's an ad on TV, and you have no other options, what do you do? You go to those guys. 
 ''People probably know in their heart of hearts that they may be getting ripped off, just like most people understood on their mortgages that they were getting in too deep, but bankers said yes, so it must be O.K. It's the same thing. The real problem is that we continue to fail to have systems in place that help people.''
 Ms. Rosenau, the California prosecutor, said that even when she told people that they had been swindled, ''they don't believe it, because they want it not to be true.''
 ''And any money they had to possibly work with the lender is now gone to the scam,'' she said.
 In Baltimore, where neighborhoods have been buffeted by successive waves of mortgage scams, Ann Norton, director of foreclosure prevention at the nonprofit St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center, said companies promising loan modifications started to multiply last summer. 
 ''It's the same people that joined the industry during the refinance boom, and now they're making fees for submitting loan remediation forms,'' said Ms. Norton, whose agency provides free help to borrowers. 
 Although Maryland was among the first states to enact legislation defining mortgage rescue fraud, Ms. Norton said, ''it's a growing industry, and it's under the radar.''
 Often the scammers represent themselves as having connections to government groups, or copy the name and typography of the Hope Now program, an alliance of nonprofit, government and lending agencies, said Marietta Rodriguez, director of national homeownership programs at NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit group that provides free government-certified foreclosure counseling through 235 local organizations. 
 ''Several took the Hope Now Web site and just reskinned it with their own information, or they use government seals,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. ''They're very crafty, and their marketing strategies are aggressive.'' 
 Peggy L. Twohig, associate director of the financial practices division at the Federal Trade Commission, said consumers should be wary of companies that promise results, charge upfront fees or tell them not to contact their lender on their own. Ms. Twohig said consumers could get the same help free from nonprofit housing counselors.
 ''Our advice to consumers is to contact their loan servicers directly or to call Hope Now or HUD-approved housing counselors,'' she said.
 Last year, Congress approved $180 million in grants to nonprofit housing counselors. 
 As Ms. Martinez awaits eviction, the temptation to try another foreclosure rescue specialist remains. ''There's other agencies that say they can help,'' she said, ''but I'm scared that I can't trust them. 
 ''One man said, 'You have to be persistent,' '' she said. ''But I'm scared to get someone else, because they probably won't help me, or can't.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Tumble on Retail Sales Slump

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A gloomy retail sales report pushed Wall Street sharply lower on Wednesday as investors received another reminder that business was bad.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 248.42 points, or 2.9 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 3.3 percent or 29.17 points. The technology heavy Nasdaq was down 3.6 percent or 56.82 points.
 Shares in Europe also were hit hard. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 4.9 percent. All of the major exchanges in Europe fell more than 4 percent. 
 The government reported on Wednesday that retail sales fell for a sixth consecutive month in December, as Americans holstered their credit cards and cut back on spending, even as stores offered discounts of 80 percent to entice shoppers.
 Sales at department stores, restaurants, gas stations and a host of other retail businesses fell 2.7 percent last month -- nearly double what economists had been expecting -- and were 9.8 percent lower than sales last December, the Commerce Department reported. 
 Losses on Wall Street were broad, led by financial, energy and retail stocks. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, were down about 1.2 percent, and Citigroup fell 22 percent, to $4.60 a share as the beleaguered banking giant prepared to shear off its prized brokerage unit.
 Investors' optimism buoyed markets after Christmas and in the first days of 2009, but they have run for cover over the last week, erasing those holiday gains. 
 ''There's an enormous amount of money on the sidelines, not knowing where to go,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''If I had a mattress company I'd make a fortune.''
 The new retail numbers offered an epitaph for what economists and retailers called the worst holiday shopping season in decades: Electronics sales were down 1 percent in December from a month earlier; food and drinks fell by 1.4 percent and sales at clothing stores were 2.5 percent lower, the Commerce Department said.
 ''People hunkered down pretty dramatically,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia. ''Yes, everybody celebrated the holidays, but there was far less spending than in prior years.''
 The fact that retailers did poorly this holiday shopping season was not unexpected, but the size of the decline caught some investors by surprise. 
 A sharp drop in the business inventories, the most in seven years, was also a reflection of the drop in consumer spending, as companies tried to reduce their costs. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said Wednesday that business inventories were reduced by 0.7 percent in November, worse than the 0.5 percent drop analysts expected. It was the third consecutive month that businesses reduced stockpiles.
 Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, has slowed sharply since mid-September as the problems on Wall Street began to spread. With the uncertainty of jobs weighing on consumers, economists do not expect a turnaround anytime soon. 
 The recession, which began in December 2007, is expected to last into the second half of 2009, and some economists predict that the current unemployment rate of 7.2 percent could hit 9 percent.
 The Fed's beige book, a regular survey of businesses around the country that was released Wednesday, indicated that the economic slump worsened in December.
 ''Overall economic activity continued to weaken across almost all of the Federal Reserve districts since the previous reporting period.'' the report added.
 To help spur the economy and restore confidence, President-elect Barack Obama has promised to push a stimulus package of about $800 billion, which he is pressing Congress to pass in the weeks ahead.
 ''Consumers are in deep hibernation,'' C. Britt Beemer, chief executive of the America's Research Group, said, ''and there is no sign that they will wake up this spring or that the retail outlook will pick up any time soon.''
 Anecdotal reports in the Fed's report confirmed the weak December. Sales were down, the report, said in almost every category -- jewelry, appliances and electronics were particularly weak.
 According to the Commerce Department, retail sales for 2008 fell 0.1 percent from 2007, with most of the losses coming from a 7.7 percent drop during the last three months of the year.
 Much of December's drop in retail sales came from falling gasoline prices, which have tumbled to a nationwide average of $1.79 a gallon from their peaks of $4.11 in July. Sales at gas stations fell 15.9 percent from November to December, and were down more than 35 percent from December 2007. 
 But even excluding gasoline and automobiles, retail sales dropped by 1.5 percent for the month, said James O'Sullivan, senior economist at UBS.
 ''It was a pretty broad-based decline,'' he said.
 The government's figures were the latest confirmation of a bleak holiday shopping season.
 Last week, an industry group reported that retail sales had fallen 2.2 percent in November and December from a year earlier, and that some of the most widely known brands in America had suffered even worse declines.
 Department stores including Nordstrom, Sak's and Nieman Marcus reported double-digit percentage drops since last year. Abercrombie and Fitch was down by 24 percent and J. C. Penney by 8.1 percent, and even Wal-Mart missed analysts' expectations and cut its outlook for the months ahead.
 And the months ahead will be difficult. January is typically a slow month for retailers, and the significance of a December sales decline is far greater than a drop-off in January because sales in November and December account for 25 to 40 percent of many retailers' annual sales, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry group.

HEADLINE: Biden Outlines Ambitious Plans to Do More With Less Power

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
He was in the Senate for 36 years and visited the White House under seven presidents. But Joseph R. Biden Jr. has never seen the inside of the vice president's office in the West Wing. ''I never thought a lot about the vice presidency,'' he said, ''until I was asked to go on the ticket.''
 Perhaps not, but Mr. Biden certainly has been doing a lot of thinking about it in the last 10 weeks as he prepares to assume the nation's second-highest position. A man who does not even know what the office looks like says he plans to reinvent the vice presidency on the theory that the man now occupying it distorted it out of all proportion.
 While most incoming vice presidents arrive eager to expand the influence of the office, Mr. Biden faces the unusual conundrum of figuring out how to scale it back. He wants to ''restore the balance,'' as he put it, after the unprecedented assertion of authority by Vice President Dick Cheney. Yet at the same time, Mr. Biden hardly wants to return to the days when the vice president was neither seen nor heard. 
 ''The proof of the pudding is in the eating,'' Mr. Biden said in an interview Wednesday. ''The Bush-Cheney relationship hasn't tasted very good. Not a single person you can name for me'' -- at this point, he leaned forward in his chair, jabbed his finger in the air and punctuated his words sharply. ''Look at me, now -- a single one can tell you that the pudding has tasted good. Not one. Name me one serious person, liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican.''
 Mr. Biden's sharp assessment of his predecessor contrasted with the generally polite tone he and President-elect Barack Obama have tried to take since the Nov. 4 election. But Mr. Biden seemed exercised at the suggestion that he would not be as effective because he would not wield the influence Mr. Cheney had.
 ''The only value of power is the effect, the efficacy of its use,'' Mr. Biden said. ''And all the power Cheney had did not result in effective outcomes.''
 The interview was Mr. Biden's first with a newspaper outside his home state, Delaware, since the election and came just hours after he landed from a trip to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. Appearing refreshed and vigorous despite the long flight, Mr. Biden used the session to emerge more from the shadows he has mostly inhabited during the transition.
 He outlined a more robust role for himself than many skeptics perceive. He convenes a weekly meeting of Mr. Obama's national security team, he said, and regularly meets with the top domestic advisers as well. At Mr. Obama's request, Mr. Biden said he produced a memorandum with his recommendations for top appointments, all of which were accepted. ''He had the same list,'' Mr. Biden said. ''It was uncanny.''
 Mr. Biden said he had no plans to run for president in 2016, when he would be turning 74 years old, meaning he will be free to structure his operation to serve Mr. Obama's ambitions rather than his own. That makes him unlike virtually every other modern vice president -- with the exception of Mr. Cheney, who while serving President Bush likewise never harbored his own dreams of the Oval Office.
 ''That is not my intention,'' Mr. Biden said, when asked about running in 2016. ''This is in all probability, and hopefully, a worthy capstone in my career.''
 Mr. Cheney and his supporters have scorned Mr. Biden's plans for the job. ''Biden seems committed to the notion of being less influential,'' said Shannen W. Coffin, who was the vice president's counsel until 2007. ''I'm not sure that benefits the president or the vice president.''
 An editor at The Weekly Standard, the conservative magazine, wrote recently that ''it may be fair to assume that Biden will be the least consequential vice president since Alben Barkley,'' the little-remembered No. 2 under President Harry S. Truman.
 Mr. Biden said that view was fine with him. ''It's O.K. if that's what everyone perceives,'' he said. ''It's irrelevant what the outside world perceives. What is relevant is whether or not I'm value added.'' 
 He said he would bring more to the job than any of his predecessors, except possibly Lyndon B. Johnson. ''I know as much or more than Cheney,'' Mr. Biden said. ''I'm the most experienced vice president since anybody.'' 
 Mr. Biden, who plans to resign his Senate seat Thursday, has focused on building a relationship with Mr. Obama, nearly two decades his junior. When he accepted the second slot on the Democratic ticket, Mr. Biden requested several things, including a weekly luncheon with the president, full access for him and his staff and freedom to range across all areas rather than being ''siloed'' in a handful of policy areas. Mr. Obama agreed. 
 ''Cheney essentially served the president as chief of staff,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. ''That's not the function that Barack Obama was looking to fill in his vice president.''
 Although Mr. Biden does not want to be another Dick Cheney, he does not want to be another Al Gore either. ''I don't want to be the guy who handles U.S.-Russia relations. I don't want to be the guy who reinvents government,'' Mr. Biden said, ticking off two of Mr. Gore's most famous areas of responsibility. ''I want to be the last guy in the room on every important decision.''
 Walter F. Mondale, the first vice president to get an office in the West Wing, said Mr. Biden was taking the right approach. ''Taking on a line assignment from some part of government that is already under way, I never thought was a good use of my time,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''And I thought it could lead to bureaucratic infighting.''
 As it happens, Mr. Biden has hired Mr. Gore's former chief of staff, Ronald A. Klain, who previously worked for Mr. Biden, to serve the same role in his office. But the operation they are constructing in some ways does not resemble Mr. Gore's. Mr. Gore built his staff in part to advance his presidential ambitions, and aides filtered much of what they did through that prism, trying to showcase the vice president's priorities sometimes to the exclusion of others'.
 While Mr. Gore never had an economics adviser, Mr. Biden has hired Jared Bernstein, a prominent liberal economist who was assigned to help write a study on the impact of Mr. Obama's stimulus plan. Mr. Biden will also lead a task force on the middle class. He said he would be ''the middle class cop'' to ensure that the administration made life better for those Americans.
 Although many outsiders assume that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state designate, will jockey to lead foreign policy, Obama aides said Mr. Biden had been crucial in persuading her to take the job, calling her several times. The trip to Pakistan, Iraq and Afghanistan showed he would be heavily involved in international affairs.
 In the end, political advisers said, Mr. Biden will have to find his own identity, one that will depend on his relationship with Mr. Obama. 
 ''To say he will be like this or that vice president misses the point because they are as unique as a marriage,'' said Roy Neel, a top adviser to Mr. Gore. ''All the models are reinvented every time there's a transition. This will be certainly different from Cheney or Gore or Quayle or Bush.''
 One thing, at least, seems sure. In five days, Mr. Biden will finally see the inside of the office.

HEADLINE: Whatever Yankees Want

 BODY:
The new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx is still months away from the first pitch of Opening Day. But suddenly a lot of people are questioning yesterday's package deal for this luxurious ballpark in light of today's struggling economy. 
 Seats for $1,500 a game? Suites fit for the royal family? A scoreboard fit for the Big Board? A fabulous steakhouse and granite ramps (no ordinary cement for this crowd)? This $1 billion-plus pavilion and park financed with a lot of taxpayer help is beginning to sound like something fit for the Wizard of Oz. 
 To pay for many of these add-ons, the Yankees now want -- surprise! -- more help from the city. They have asked the Industrial Development Agency for an additional $400 million in tax-free financing to finish the project. Unless the city's leaders show some courage, the agency is expected to rubber-stamp that request by the end of the week, after a pro forma hearing on Thursday. 
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the development agency should renegotiate this latest round of what has always been an incredibly generous deal for one of the richest teams in the country. At a very minimum, they should insist that the Yankees pick up more of the city's share of the project, which now amounts to $362 million.
 About $326 million of that money will pay for demolishing the old stadium, building new infrastructure and replacing 22 acres of city parkland that was lost to the new stadium. 
 Yankee officials like to say that they are the ones paying to build this stadium, not the city's taxpayers. That is only partly true. The public has subsidized the project in many ways -- providing generous tax-exempt financing and a variety of other assistance like rent abatements. 
 Meanwhile, the total $362 million price tag to the city has almost doubled since the project was announced in 2006. And, according to the Independent Budget Office, the price dwarfs the $138 million the city will provide for the Mets' new stadium across town. 
 Some city contribution to costs for these stadiums makes sense. But the real question is how much New York gets in return on this very hearty investment.
 The Yankees promise over 6,000 construction jobs. But once their new house is built, there could be as few as 22 full-time, year-round positions. 
 What makes this latest request feel like ''icing on the cake,'' as Assemblyman Richard Brodsky puts it, is that the rest of the city is staring at such hard times and a looming $1.5 billion budget deficit. 
 Mayor Bloomberg has -- rightly -- had to cut city budgets and increase property taxes and explain to residents how times are bad and how we all will have to share the pain. It is time for Mr. Bloomberg to make that same pitch to the Yankees.
 If the Yankees can sign megamillion-dollar contracts (C. C. Sabathia just landed one for $161 million over seven years), they should be flush enough to contribute more toward their new stadium and to the parks for people living nearby. 
 Mr. Bloomberg should insist that the Industrial Development Agency postpone consideration of this latest Yankee request and then renegotiate this deal. Is A-Rod's agent available?

HEADLINE: War on Hamas Saps Its Palestinian Rival

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel hoped that the war in Gaza would not only cripple Hamas, but eventually strengthen its secular rival, the Palestinian Authority, and even allow it to claw its way back into Gaza.
But with each day, the authority, its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, and its leading party, Fatah, seem increasingly beleaguered and marginalized, even in the Palestinian cities of the West Bank, which they control. Protesters accuse Mr. Abbas of not doing enough to stop the carnage in Gaza -- indeed, his own police officers have used clubs and tear gas against those same protesters.
The more bombs in Gaza, the more Hamas's support seems to be growing at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, already considered corrupt and distant from average Palestinians.
''The Palestinian Authority is one of the main losers in this war,'' said Ghassan Khatib, an independent Palestinian analyst in the West Bank city of Ramallah. ''How can it make gains in a war in which it is one of the casualties?'' 
Israel is proposing, with the tacit agreement of Egypt and the United States, to place the Palestinian Authority at the heart of an ambitious program to rebuild Gaza, administering reconstruction aid and securing Gaza's borders. But that plan is already drawing skepticism. Mr. Khatib, for example, called the idea of any Palestinian Authority role in postwar Gaza ''silly'' and ''naive.''
Perhaps more dispiriting to the ever fewer who believe that any overall settlement is possible now -- with peace negotiations suspended and Palestinians divided between Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank -- is that Israel itself does not really hold out high hopes for a larger postwar role for Fatah. Israel's proposals seem dutiful, an acknowledgment of a stalemate that not even so ferocious an assault on Hamas can undo.
''There are not too many realistic ideas around,'' conceded Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The reason: Most ideas, he said, largely rely ''on the good will of Hamas.'' That may be in short supply, because Hamas, deeply embedded in Gazan society both as a fighting force and a provider of social services, seems highly likely to survive in some form after this war.
Ever since Hamas began its one-party rule of Gaza, in the summer of 2007, Israel and the West have tried to turn Gazans against Hamas through an economic embargo and diplomatic isolation. While there is certainly anger at Hamas among Gazans, it pales beside the anger at Israel, the West and what some see as Fatah's collusion with those enemies.
Mr. Abbas and his loyalists have not entered Gaza since 2007, when they were ousted by Hamas, which took over the area after a brief but ruthless factional war. They are now hoping that the Egyptian cease-fire initiative will serve as a vehicle to regain a foothold there.
The Palestinian Authority hopes that a severely weakened Hamas would be forced by Egypt into a process of reconciliation with Fatah. That, in turn, would result in some kind of unified national leadership, with ''all Palestinians sharing responsibility for administrating the country,'' said Jamal Zakout, an adviser to the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayyad.
Talal Okal, a political analyst in Gaza and a member of the board of trustees of Al Azhar University, which is affiliated with Fatah, said Hamas wanted to preserve its own rule and would be likely to cooperate with Fatah only as a last resort.
Indeed, Hamas has shown only hostility to anyone perceived as cooperating with Israel. Yuval Diskin, chief of Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency, told the cabinet here on Sunday that Hamas had cold-bloodedly killed about 70 Fatah supporters in Gaza under the cover of the war.
Mr. Abbas also faces a constitutional crisis. Months ago, Hamas declared that it would no longer recognize him as president after his four-year term technically ended last Friday. Mr. Abbas has said he will call for new presidential and parliamentary elections, but that could be risky: Hamas won the last parliamentary vote in 2006.
Even if Israel succeeds in toppling Hamas, nobody here seems to believe that the Abbas-led authority would be in any position to fill the vacuum right now, especially because the authority would be perceived in Gaza as having ridden in on a proverbial Israeli tank.
Indeed, with their credibility on the line, Palestinian Authority officials are naturally cautious about being seen to want to benefit from the Israeli assault. ''Our first priority is to stop the bloodshed,'' Mr. Zakout said.
The 19 days of bombing, aimed at impeding Hamas's ability to threaten southern Israel with its rocket fire, have killed more than 1,000 Gazans, according to Palestinian health officials, and have turned the Gaza Parliament, government ministry offices and countless other buildings and homes to rubble. Foreign donors are expected to give money for extensive reconstruction.
Israeli officials would rather see the authority vested with the responsibility and the budget for the reconstruction bonanza than the Iranian-backed Hamas.
At the same time, they believe that Hamas will try to obstruct any such move, seeking to foster its own popularity and legitimacy by overseeing the rebuilding effort itself. The Palestinian Authority has had a reputation for corruption, though that has been redressed in part by the efforts of Mr. Fayyad.
And even if Hamas were forced to agree to a Palestinian Authority presence at the border, there are questions about how effective it would be.
Israel and Egypt have said they are willing to resume operation of their border crossings with Gaza on the basis of the American-brokered Agreement on Movement and Access of 2005, which called for Palestinian Authority security forces -- and, in the case of Rafah on the Egyptian border, European observers -- to be stationed on the Palestinian side.
''Clearly, we want the Palestinian Authority to be at the crossings,'' said an Israeli defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issues currently under discussion. ''The question is, will they really be in charge?''
Mr. Khatib, who was involved in the negotiations for the 2005 border crossing agreement, suggested that there could be other solutions for the crossings, like setting up an independent, technocratic Palestinian border control agency led by a figure acceptable to both Fatah and Hamas.
Grappling with the complexities, the Israeli defense official said: ''Hamas will not let the Palestinian Authority come out of this with an achievement. I don't know what to say. We're not there yet.''
Venezuela Breaks Off Ties
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela said Wednesday that it had broken off diplomatic relations with Israel to protest its military offensive in Gaza.
The decision by President Hugo Chavez's government came more than a week after it expelled the Israeli ambassador.
Bolivia also broke off relations with Israel.
Correction: January 17, 2009, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with a news analysis article about Israel's war on Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that controls Gaza, referred incorrectly to graffiti shown on walls in Ramallah, the West Bank headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, which is controlled by Fatah, the main Hamas rival. The walls bear graffiti for Islamic Jihad, a group that supports Hamas -- not for Fatah.

HEADLINE: Geithner's Skill May Trump Tax Issue

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If Timothy F. Geithner were a bank, he might well be considered ''too big to fail.''
 In better economic times, Mr. Geithner's confirmation to be President-elect Barack Obama's Treasury secretary might be in danger after the disclosure this week that he had paid more than $48,000 in delinquent taxes and interest. But with the economy so fragile, many senators are loath to rattle financial markets by rejecting someone with Mr. Geithner's qualifications and international respect. By late Wednesday, Republicans as well as Democrats were predicting he would survive the controversy and be confirmed next week.
 Mr. Geithner has broad experience in global economics, financial regulation, currency and monetary policy. And lately, as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he has been at the center of the government's efforts to manage the financial chaos, sharing some criticism for its mixed record but not blame.
 ''These are not the times to think in small political terms,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who just returned from Afghanistan and Pakistan with Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., and briefly met with reporters on Wednesday alongside Mr. Obama. ''I think he is the right guy.'' 
 Mr. Graham thereby validated what the president-elect had just said: That Mr. Geithner, by bipartisan agreement, is ''uniquely qualified.''
 ''Look, is this an embarrassment for him? Yes. He said so himself,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to Mr. Geithner's remarks in a private meeting with the Senate Finance Committee the day before. But Mr. Obama said Mr. Geithner had made a common mistake and corrected it.
 The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, early Wednesday postponed Mr. Geithner's confirmation hearing from Friday to the day after the inauguration. Senators said the delay was unrelated to the tax issue, but at least for a time it will leave Mr. Obama without a Treasury secretary.
 The panel's senior Republican, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, declined for a second day to take a position on Mr. Geithner's nomination. In an interview with Iowa reporters, Mr. Grassley reiterated his concern about having a Treasury secretary, with responsibility for the Internal Revenue Service, who had been delinquent on taxes. But he said Mr. Geithner had been ''very sincere'' in accounting for his violations.
 He added: ''I don't believe there's any doubt about his qualifications. For a partisan person like Obama, appointing a relative political independent as Geithner is, I think that that's a plus.''
 Mr. Geithner called other senators to discuss the controversy, if they wanted, as well as his views on the big issues that otherwise had been expected to dominate his confirmation hearing: an emerging $800 billion economic recovery blueprint, plans for the remaining half of a $700 billion financial bailout fund, and ideas for rewriting regulations for the nation's financial system to avoid another collapse.
 The controversy over his taxes, as it happens, goes to the one area where Mr. Geithner has the least experience, despite serving 13 years at the Treasury Department: domestic tax policy. 
 Mr. Geithner, 47, rose from a lower-level civil servant at the department at the end of Ronald Reagan's presidency to under secretary for international affairs under President Bill Clinton, then was a director of the International Monetary Fund before becoming president of the New York Fed in late 2003. 
 Mr. Obama chose Mr. Geithner on Nov. 24, despite knowing of the tax issue.
 ''Life's about choices'' is a favorite saying of Mr. Geithner's, according to associates. Lately he has said it so often that he gets laughs even from the professorial Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, breaking up the unfunny times that the two men -- with current Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- have had in past months making difficult choices about which institutions to bail out and which to let fail. 
 Mr. Obama's hard choice was between Mr. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who had been Mr. Geithner's mentor and boss at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, served as Mr. Clinton's final Treasury secretary and wanted another turn. In a first meeting with Mr. Obama three weeks before the election, Mr. Geithner, in characteristic self-effacement, told him, ''Larry would be great as Treasury secretary,'' according to someone familiar with the meeting.
 But Mr. Summers had drawbacks in the Obama camp's eyes. He had clear Clinton connections when the ''change'' campaign was trying to limit those ties. Mr. Summers also was known to have a sometimes difficult personality, and his troubled tenure as president of Harvard University had left some women's and minority groups bitter and posed potential confirmation problems. 
 On Oct. 17, at a New York hotel, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner met for an hour and talked about policy and personal matters, according to accounts of the session. Mr. Obama, who spent four childhood years with his mother in Indonesia, asked Mr. Geithner about his own early years in India and then Thailand as his father oversaw Asia development programs for the Ford Foundation.
 What neither man knew at the time, but the foundation has confirmed, is that Mr. Geithner's father, Peter F. Geithner, oversaw a program that Mr. Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham Soetoro, had worked on. The two may even have met in Jakarta. 
 Obama advisers say the candidate ''fell in love'' with Mr. Geithner, in the words of one, while a Geithner associate said Mr. Geithner reported being ''smitten'' with Mr. Obama. ''They both have that kind of quiet confidence in their demeanor,'' the associate said.
 When an Obama adviser asked Mr. Geithner if he wanted to be considered for the Treasury job, he said he had to first consult his family -- his wife, Carole Sonnenfeld Geithner, a grief counselor for poor New York children whom he had met as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and two teenagers, Elise, 17, and Benjamin, 14. The job would also pay less than half of the $411,200 he made last year at the Fed. The family acquiesced, and Mr. Geithner turned over reams of records -- including the years of tax returns. 
 When Mr. Obama announced the nomination, he also named Mr. Summers as director of the National Economic Council, to coordinate policy from the West Wing. Ever since, the biggest question among associates is how well the two men will get along, what with Mr. Geithner, the onetime underling, now ''the chief economic spokesman for my administration,'' in Mr. Obama's words, and Mr. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, enjoying proximity to the Oval Office.
 The morning of the announcement, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers had breakfast together in the Chicago Hilton. Since the Treasury years, they have continued to consult each other, friends say, and play tennis at economic gatherings. Mr. Geithner told others that he regretted that the weeks of media speculation had focused so much on Mr. Summers' reputed arrogance. He joked at his own expense that the news media's story line amounted to, ''Larry is arrogant and smart; Geithner's not so smart but he's very humble.'' 
 In truth, Mr. Geithner is known as exceptionally smart and unafraid to speak up -- traits that drew Mr. Summers's attention at the Treasury Department 16 years ago.
 ''I might worry if I didn't know it was Tim on the other end of the phone or across the street from Larry,'' said a former Treasury Department colleague of both men who did not want to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the confirmation process. ''Because I've seen them, I've seen them clash, I've seen them have real, real serious different perspectives on an issue, and I've never seen them damage that relationship. And you can't say that about many people.''

HEADLINE: Cabinet Choices Answer Questions From Senators Tom Vilsack

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa said that if he is confirmed as President-elect Barack Obama's agriculture secretary, he would aggressively pursue new fuel sources to produce ethanol, promote locally grown fruits and vegetables and look for other ways to increase farmers' incomes, in areas like wind power and organic farming. 
 But while Mr. Vilsack acknowledged the current struggles of the corn-based ethanol industry -- with Iowa at the center -- he stopped short of endorsing new federal initiatives to give it a boost.
 Mr. Vilsack also said any research promoting new types of biofuels needed to benefit more than just the Corn Belt. 
 If the members of the Senate agriculture committee were surprised or disappointed by Mr. Vilsack's answers, they did not show it. Mr. Vilsack sailed through the confirmation hearing with nary a word of criticism, and Chairman Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said he expected Mr. Vilsack to be confirmed unanimously Tuesday.
 If confirmed, Mr. Vilsack, who briefly ran for president in 2008, would inherit a huge bureaucracy that oversees not just farm programs but also nutrition initiatives like school lunch and food stamps, meat and poultry inspections and the forest service.
 His confirmation hearing comes as the farm economy is struggling after years of soaring prices fed by growing demand for exports and ethanol. And demand for federal nutrition programs is increasing as the recession deepens.
 A lawyer who represented farmers during the farm crisis in the 1980s, Mr. Vilsack promised to carry out the provisions of the 2008 Farm Bill, which includes billions in subsidies for some farmers.
 He also vowed to modernize food safety and promote more nutrition in diets. As such, he said he would ''work with those who seek programs and practices that lead to more nutritious food produced in a sustainable way.''
 The prospect of an Iowan running the Agriculture Department at the same time that Mr. Harkin leads the agriculture committee has elicited some concern that other parts of the country would be ignored. The Midwest and the South have vied for power in Congressional agriculture committees.
 Mr. Vilsack assured him and others that he would serve the entire nation, not just Iowa.
 A longtime supporter of renewable fuels, Mr. Vilsack said, ''I will work with you to expand opportunities for farmers, ranchers and rural communities to promote renewable energy technologies like biofuels, wind, solar and geothermal, and to deliver environmental benefits like clean air, clean water, and fish and wildlife habitat.''

HEADLINE: More Questions for Mr. Geithner

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama's team reacted predictably to the disclosure that Timothy Geithner, the nominee for Treasury secretary, failed to pay a chunk of his federal taxes over several recent years. The script gets played out, with slight variations, whenever a presidential nominee gets in that kind of trouble.
 On Tuesday, when Mr. Geithner's failures were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Obama transition office issued a statement calling his underpayment of taxes ''honest mistakes.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Obama himself said it was ''innocent.'' Those themes have been echoed by several of the senators who will conduct Mr. Geithner's confirmation hearing, which is now scheduled for next Wednesday. 
 As much as Mr. Obama and his team may wish it, however, the disclosures cannot be dismissed so easily, or papered over. The just-the-facts report of Mr. Geithner's tax transgressions, compiled and released by the Senate Finance Committee, paints a picture of noncompliance that is considerably more disturbing than his supporters are acknowledging. 
 Mr. Geithner must be questioned forcefully about these matters at the hearing next week, and his explanations must be credible. Even in the best of economic times, it would be hard to accept a Treasury secretary -- who, after all, is in charge of the Internal Revenue Service -- with a cavalier attitude toward paying his taxes. Today, in a time of economic peril, the nation cannot afford a Treasury secretary with a tainted ability to command respect and instill confidence.
 According to the report, when Mr. Geithner's tax returns for 2003 and 2004 were audited by the I.R.S. in 2006, the auditors found that he had failed to pay self-employment tax in those years. To make good, he paid the back taxes, plus interest -- $16,732. 
 Obama officials say Mr. Geithner, who worked for the International Monetary Fund, had made a common error among international employees in Washington. But as The Journal reported on Wednesday, failing to pay the self-employment tax is not necessarily common among sophisticated I.M.F employees. Rather, one of the reasons such noncompliance is widespread is that it includes household embassy workers and other lower- level contractors. And regardless, the Finance Committee found that Mr. Geithner had signed paperwork at the I.M.F. that acknowledged his self-employment tax obligation. 
 The story does not stop there. Mr. Geithner also failed to pay the self-employment tax in 2001 and 2002. Those returns, which the report says Mr. Geithner prepared himself, were not audited and so the I.R.S. did not order him to pay up -- which raises the question of why he did not voluntarily amend those returns and pay the taxes and interest at the time of the 2006 audit. Instead, he waited until after vetting by the Obama team late last year revealed the shortfall -- $19,176 in taxes and $6,794 in interest.
 A similar lapse occurred on another tax issue. On returns for 2001, 2004 and 2005, Mr. Geithner wrongly claimed expenses for sleep-away camps in calculating his dependent care tax credit. The accountant who prepared his 2006 return informed him that payments to overnight camps were not allowable expenses, but again, he did not file amended returns for the previous years at that time. The report does not break out the taxes and interest on that item alone, but along with other adjustments, Mr. Geithner owed an additional tax of $4,334 and interest of $1,232. 
 Many people find taxes baffling, but before his job at the I.M.F, Mr. Geithner was a senior official in the Treasury Department under President Clinton, and for the past five years he has been the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. With that professional profile, tax transgressions are tough to excuse.

 BODY:
The retailing of recorded music will take another step toward extinction in early April, when the Virgin Megastore in Times Square closes to make room for Forever 21, a popular chain that sells moderately priced clothing. 
 The closing, which was announced to the store's 200 employees this week, will leave the Virgin store on Union Square as the last Manhattan outpost of a large music chain. The future of that store has not been decided, Simon Wright, the chief executive of Virgin Entertainment Group, said on Wednesday. 
 Stores that sell prerecorded CDs and DVDs have been done in by the popularity of digitized music that can be downloaded from the Internet onto iPods and MP3 players. But Mr. Wright said that the Times Square store, which has about 60,000 square feet of selling space, is not simply a victim of technological progress.
 It has remained ''very, very profitable'' by shifting its merchandise toward apparel and electronics, including iPods, he said, adding that those two categories accounted for about 25 percent of sales during the holiday shopping season.
 ''Stores that rely completely on recorded music have a difficult future,'' he said, ''but we've been changing our business quite dramatically.''
 But the chain's owners, two big New York-based real estate development companies, saw greater potential in leasing the prime space to Forever 21. 
 The Virgin chain, once part of Sir Richard Branson's business empire, has been owned since 2007 by the Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust. It comprised 11 stores when it was acquired, but now will be down to just five, two of them in California. Virgin closed other stores late last year.
 The Times Square space, on the east side of Broadway near 46th Street, will be closed for at least a year before it reopens as Forever 21's largest location. It will be combined with some adjoining space to create a 90,000-square-foot store that will be triple the size of any of Forever 21's three current stores in Manhattan, said Lawrence Meyer, a senior vice president of Forever 21. Forever 21 is a Los Angeles-based chain that sells trendy clothing for young women and men. It competes with other moderately priced retailers like H & M and Gap stores. 
 ''This is a bigger format,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''It's going to be a fashion department store. It's going to offer a deeper assortment of women's apparel and men's apparel.''
 Mr. Meyer said the recession had not diluted his company's enthusiasm for making a big splash in an expensive area like Times Square. He declined to specify the rent Forever 21 will pay.
 ''We have been doing O.K. in this environment because we have always given great value to our customers,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''Our stores are exciting and we want to create an exciting environment in Times Square.''

HEADLINE: Where Sweatshops Are a Dream

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia 

 BODY:
 Before Barack Obama and his team act on their talk about ''labor standards,'' I'd like to offer them a tour of the vast garbage dump here in Phnom Penh. 
 This is a Dante-like vision of hell. It's a mountain of festering refuse, a half-hour hike across, emitting clouds of smoke from subterranean fires. 
 The miasma of toxic stink leaves you gasping, breezes batter you with filth, and even the rats look forlorn. Then the smoke parts and you come across a child ambling barefoot, searching for old plastic cups that recyclers will buy for five cents a pound. Many families actually live in shacks on this smoking garbage. 
 Mr. Obama and the Democrats who favor labor standards in trade agreements mean well, for they intend to fight back at oppressive sweatshops abroad. But while it shocks Americans to hear it, the central challenge in the poorest countries is not that sweatshops exploit too many people, but that they don't exploit enough.
 Talk to these families in the dump, and a job in a sweatshop is a cherished dream, an escalator out of poverty, the kind of gauzy if probably unrealistic ambition that parents everywhere often have for their children.
 ''I'd love to get a job in a factory,'' said Pim Srey Rath, a 19-year-old woman scavenging for plastic. ''At least that work is in the shade. Here is where it's hot.''
 Another woman, Vath Sam Oeun, hopes her 10-year-old boy, scavenging beside her, grows up to get a factory job, partly because she has seen other children run over by garbage trucks. Her boy has never been to a doctor or a dentist, and last bathed when he was 2, so a sweatshop job by comparison would be far more pleasant and less dangerous.
 I'm glad that many Americans are repulsed by the idea of importing products made by barely paid, barely legal workers in dangerous factories. Yet sweatshops are only a symptom of poverty, not a cause, and banning them closes off one route out of poverty. At a time of tremendous economic distress and protectionist pressures, there's a special danger that tighter labor standards will be used as an excuse to curb trade.
 When I defend sweatshops, people always ask me: But would you want to work in a sweatshop? No, of course not. But I would want even less to pull a rickshaw. In the hierarchy of jobs in poor countries, sweltering at a sewing machine isn't the bottom.
 My views on sweatshops are shaped by years living in East Asia, watching as living standards soared -- including those in my wife's ancestral village in southern China -- because of sweatshop jobs.
 Manufacturing is one sector that can provide millions of jobs. Yet sweatshops usually go not to the poorest nations but to better-off countries with more reliable electricity and ports.
 I often hear the argument: Labor standards can improve wages and working conditions, without greatly affecting the eventual retail cost of goods. That's true. But labor standards and ''living wages'' have a larger impact on production costs that companies are always trying to pare. The result is to push companies to operate more capital-intensive factories in better-off nations like Malaysia, rather than labor-intensive factories in poorer countries like Ghana or Cambodia.
 Cambodia has, in fact, pursued an interesting experiment by working with factories to establish decent labor standards and wages. It's a worthwhile idea, but one result of paying above-market wages is that those in charge of hiring often demand bribes -- sometimes a month's salary -- in exchange for a job. In addition, these standards add to production costs, so some factories have closed because of the global economic crisis and the difficulty of competing internationally.
 The best way to help people in the poorest countries isn't to campaign against sweatshops but to promote manufacturing there. One of the best things America could do for Africa would be to strengthen our program to encourage African imports, called AGOA, and nudge Europe to match it.
 Among people who work in development, many strongly believe (but few dare say very loudly) that one of the best hopes for the poorest countries would be to build their manufacturing industries. But global campaigns against sweatshops make that less likely.
 Look, I know that Americans have a hard time accepting that sweatshops can help people. But take it from 13-year-old Neuo Chanthou, who earns a bit less than $1 a day scavenging in the dump. She's wearing a ''Playboy'' shirt and hat that she found amid the filth, and she worries about her sister, who lost part of her hand when a garbage truck ran over her.
 ''It's dirty, hot and smelly here,'' she said wistfully. ''A factory is better.''

HEADLINE: Obama Officials Ask Senate G.O.P. to Back Release of Bailout Money

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Top Obama administration officials met for nearly an hour with Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday, hoping to persuade them to support the release of the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial bailout money. 
 But several lawmakers said they still wanted better assurances that the money would be used to improve the credit markets and would be more carefully supervised. 
 President Bush formally asked for release of the $350 billion on Monday at the request of President-elect Barack Obama. Congress can block the money if both chambers vote to do so. If that happens, Mr. Obama has said he would veto the disapproval resolution, allowing the money to flow. Both the president-elect and Congressional Democrats say they hope that will not become necessary. 
 The Senate could vote on a disapproval motion as early as Thursday. Obama transition officials and senior Congressional aides have expressed confidence that there will be enough votes to defeat the disapproval motion. 
 The House on Thursday is expected to vote to approve new legislation, drafted by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would impose tough new restrictions on how the $350 billion would be spent, including a requirement that at least $40 billion be used to prevent home foreclosures. The Obama team has indicated that it opposes any new legislation, and the Senate has shown little interest in a new bill. 
 But even as angry debate over Mr. Frank's bill began on the House floor, some lawmakers said that they expected the Senate would not follow the House but would soon act to release the $350 billion. 
 Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, has said that he will support the release of the money and that the bailout had prevented an economic catastrophe last fall. Mr. Obama has personally telephoned some senators, urging them to release the money; among them was Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, who said on Wednesday that she was leaning that way. 
 Lawmakers in both parties have expressed reluctance to release the money because of deep anger over the handling of the bailout program by the Bush administration. To address those concerns, Senate Republicans met for nearly an hour late Wednesday afternoon with Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, and Lawrence H. Summers, who will be the top economic adviser in the Obama White House. 
 After the meeting, the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the Bush administration's use of money from the bailout plan, formally called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, had reduced support for the effort among Republicans. Mr. McConnell said he could not predict how a vote would turn out. 
 ''Larry Summers and Rahm Emanuel knew they had a skeptical audience,'' he said. ''A lot of good questions were asked. I will not be able to answer the inevitable question that you are going to ask me about how many Republican votes will there be in opposition to a resolution of disapproval. I don't know.'' 
 Mr. McConnell suggested that Republicans were looking for clearer statements from Mr. Obama.
 ''We are looking for assurances about how this new tranche of TARP funding will be used,'' he said. ''They probably haven't said quite enough publicly yet for most Republicans; maybe they will say more before we vote.''

HEADLINE: Buyers for a Citigroup Fire Sale Have Probably Been Singed, Too

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
For Citigroup and its embattled leader, Vikram S. Pandit, the terrible ifs are accumulating. 
 Word that Mr. Pandit would try to salvage his troubled bank by cleaving it in two was greeted Wednesday with stunned disbelief on Wall Street. 
 Rather than calming skittish investors, the plan stoked fears that Citigroup -- and indeed the broader financial industry -- was entering a perilous new phase in the financial crisis. 
 Mr. Pandit wants to sell a range of unprofitable businesses and troublesome assets, including some with roots in subprime lending. But investors wonder whether other financial companies will have the will or the means to buy them. 
 Like Citigroup, other banks need more money to withstand yet another looming wave of red ink. Bank of America was negotiating on Wednesday for a second multibillion-dollar round of federal aid.
 The growing unease over the industry was evident in the stock market, where Citigroup led a sharp decline in financial shares that helped shave 248 points, or nearly 3 percent, off the Dow Jones industrial average. Shares in Citigroup sank $1.37, to $4.53, slipping below $5 for the first time since late November, when it was compelled to grab a second lifeline from the government.
 Now Citigroup is in a tightening bind. With the economy struggling, many lenders are bracing for a surge in losses stemming from credit cards and commercial real estate. Few banks are prepared to buy what Citigroup hopes to sell. 
 ''You can count on a few fingers who could be those buyers, and what they are willing to pay at a time like this,'' said Glenn Schorr, a banking analyst at UBS. ''It's really tough.''
 For Mr. Pandit, time is growing short. Despite two federal rescues, Citigroup is expected to report a fourth-quarter operating loss of at least $10 billion on Friday. More losses are likely to follow. 
 While Mr. Pandit has the public support of his board, some on Wall Street wonder how long he can hold on. If he fails to find buyers, the government ultimately might be forced to come to Citigroup's aid a third time, although Citigroup insiders say there are no plans to seek additional capital from Washington. 
 Still, regulators are pushing Citigroup to make changes. They are urging the company to replace its chairman and shake up its fractured board, which met on Wednesday afternoon to review earnings and discuss Mr. Pandit's plan for the first time. News of its contents seeped out before Mr. Pandit had a chance to walk the directors through the details, according to a person close to the situation.
 In a memo on Wednesday, Mr. Pandit assured employees that Citigroup would weather the storm. 
 ''The economic model of our business is sound and it positions the company for success over the long term,'' Mr. Pandit said in the memo. ''We are and will remain a bank.''
 He added that the clarity of the new strategy ''should address the psychology of the market.'' 
 Mr. Pandit is aiming to shrink Citigroup by a third to help stanch its losses and make the company easier to manage. On Tuesday, Citigroup announced that it would shift its prized Smith Barney brokerage into a joint venture with Morgan Stanley, a deal that ultimately could result in a sale. 
 But finding takers for the $600 billion worth of businesses that Citigroup hopes to shed may not be easy, particularly given the running turmoil in the financial industry. 
 For instance, Citigroup is looking to sell its private-label credit card operations at a time when many consumers, particularly those with weak credit, are struggling to pay their bills. The card business lends on behalf of retailers like Sears and Home Depot, often to people with low credit scores. 
 General Electric gave up trying to sell its $30 billion private-label credit card business in September after failing to find a buyer. Since then, the economy and consumer spending have deteriorated sharply, which makes Citigroup's task of finding a buyer even harder. 
 Other Citigroup businesses could also be tough to sell. CitiFinancial caters to lower-income borrowers, a market few banks are eager to court. And Primerica Financial Services, Citigroup's remaining insurance operation, has been on and off the auction block for two years, according to executives with knowledge of the situation. 
 And then there are the $306 billion of illiquid assets, most of which are backed by the government. Investors say it could take years for Citigroup to dispose of them. 
 Joshua S. Siegel, managing principal at StoneCastle Partners, an asset management firm specializing in bank investments, said there were few buyers for the assets that Citigroup would probably have to sell at rock-bottom prices. ''You would record billions and billions of additional losses if you were forced to sell,'' Mr. Siegel said. 
 Some analysts say they doubt Mr. Pandit can execute his plan without more help from the government in the form of direct investment or purchases of troubled assets. 
 Joshua R. Rosner, an analyst at Graham Fisher & Company, said it would be ''incredibly difficult or impossible'' for Citigroup to sell businesses at this time. The government, he said, may have little choice but to step in a third time.

HEADLINE: Magic and Realism

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
So the next new thing is ''smart power.'' The phrase was sprinkled through Senator Hillary Clinton's confirmation hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It means using all the levers of influence -- diplomatic, economic, military, legal, political and cultural -- to get what you want.
 I've nothing against smart power, a blend of soft and hard. It's better than dumb power, of which we've had a dose. 
 Dumb power estranges friends, privileges force, undermines United States credibility and proclaims war without end.
 But what I want from the Obama administration is something more than Harvard-to-the-Beltway smarts. I want magical realism.
 Seldom has so much hope confronted so much anxiety as in these five days before Barack Obama becomes the 44th president and the first African-American one.
 From the West Front of the Capitol, where he will be sworn in with Lincoln's Bible beneath his hand, Obama will face Abraham Lincoln, who saved the Union in a war over slavery, and the spot where Martin Luther King gave his ''I Have a Dream'' speech. A fuller expression of American possibility at a time of American penury is hard to imagine.
 Obama will then move into the White House, which slaves helped build, facing the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.
 Reconciliation and transcendence and a reaffirmation of the mythology of American possibility vie with debt, doubt and depression. If they are poised in equal measure, which will prevail?
 One thing seems certain: The meltdown is going to hang over at least the first 18 months of the Obama presidency. The Treasury is bare. Americans are deluged in debt. Confidence has been Madoffed.
 That's the realism. But this 47-year-old man of mixed race, whose very name -- O-Ba-Ma -- has the three-syllable universality of a child's lullaby, has always had something of the providential about him, a global figure who looks more like the guy at the local bodega than the guys on dollar bills. That's the magic.
 He needs this magic, which resonates in a voice with the solemn clarity of a bell. Smart power will not be enough. If it were, Americans would have elected Hillary Clinton president.
 But in their abiding good sense, Americans intuited the imperative to reach beyond smartness for some ineffable quality, capable of unifying and inspiring at a time of national and global division.
 Inevitably, the nation is looking back to 1932. ''We have nothing to fear but fear itself,'' Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in his first inaugural, with the economy devastated by the Depression. He also said: ''This nation asks for action and action now.''
 Action followed -- a torrent of legislation and speeches in the first 100 days designed to kick-start the country.
 Obama has been vowing a similar flurry, but has also been talking down expectations, saying things are going to get worse. That may be true, but he has to be careful. An excess of realism will undo him.
 Two of the greatest weapons he has are language, which he wields better than any recent president, and the bond he has established with the American people. Therein lies the magic. Like fireside-chatting F.D.R., he has to preserve this bond in a direct way or he will fail, because the facts are going to be hard.
 That task begins with his inaugural speech. After eight arid years under a leader, President George W. Bush, who could not find within himself a solitary phrase to touch the soul, Americans' thirst to be uplifted is great.
 Obama has to lay out a vision that goes beyond the war on terror and draws the partners of a re-imagined United States, less powerful but still indispensable, into a shared push for greater prosperity and security.
 When you're down, you need friends. Clinton was right to say, ''We must build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries.'' She might have added, especially in the Muslim world.
 A good starting point would be the realization that the very barrier-breaking technology that helped America to the zenith of its post-cold-war power has now democratized knowledge in ways the United States cannot control. The world view shaped in the Middle East by Al Jazeera is not amenable to Western logic. It has its own.
 Wealth has also migrated to an archipelago of new powers, including Brazil, Russia, China, India and the Gulf states.
 This scattering of power demands a new U.S. humility, but there is still no idea as compelling as the American embodied in Obama's rise. Only if he can harness the magic of that to new realism can he summon the energy to overcome America's crisis. Smart power alone cannot usher in the postponed promise of the 21st century.
 Gandhi, asked what he thought of Western civilization, replied, ''I think it would be a good idea.'' Obama could do worse than place on his new desk the words of another Indian-born man, a novelist of magical realist power, Salman Rushdie: ''This may be the curse of the human race. Not that we are so different from one another, but that we are so alike.''

HEADLINE: 'Open Here' for a Peek at Content and Promotion

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
ESQUIRE magazine is offering readers -- and advertisers -- a window into its front covers, literally and figuratively.
 The February issue of Esquire, on its way now to subscribers and to newsstands, has a window, or flap, in the middle of the cover, next to an invitation to ''Open here.'' Opening the window reveals quotations from articles inside the issue, adjacent to an advertisement for ''One Way Out,'' a new series on the Discovery Channel cable network.
 Those who leave the window unopened do not see the ad or the quotations. 
 The Discovery series is, appropriately enough, about an escape artist, Jonathan Goodwin, and his feats. The ad, showing Mr. Goodwin seemingly trapped inside the small space, was created for the cover window.
 Esquire charged Discovery Channel about $250,000 for the ad, which includes production costs as well as a regular ad page for ''One Way Out'' inside the issue. Esquire is considering another kind of unconventional cover, with a pull tab, for the June issue; it would be accompanied by advertising to be sold to BMW of North America.
 The cover ads are indicative of efforts by magazines and other traditional media to find additional ways to raise revenue during one of the most challenging economies in decades. The Publishers Information Bureau, which tracks the sales of ad pages for magazines, reported a decline of 11.7 percent last year compared with 2007 -- a steeper fall than the industry suffered from 2000 to 2001.
 ''As you watch what is going on in the media landscape, it is incumbent on us to provide innovation,'' said Kevin C. O'Malley, vice president and publisher of Esquire in New York, part of the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation.
 ''The single biggest question advertisers are asking is how to engage the reader,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''Something like this serves up that engagement factor.''
 Interestingly, neither Mr. O'Malley nor a member of his sales staff came up with the idea for the cover window. The concept was the brainchild of the editor in chief of Esquire, David Granger. 
 ''Everybody keeps talking about how print is an old medium,'' Mr. Granger said, pausing before continuing: ''It is an old medium, but it doesn't mean it's a wrung-out medium or a tired medium.''
 Seeking ways to encourage readers ''to interact with the magazine,'' Mr. Granger said, he has visited the Hearst manufacturing division and asked to be shown ''what the potential of print is.''
 ''At least half the people in manufacturing had never met an editor in chief before,'' he added, laughing.
 That was followed by visits to five or so companies that work with the manufacturing division, Mr. Granger said, like R. R. Donnelley, Quad/Graphics and Vertis Communications. The concept for the cover window, also called a trap door, is from Donnelley, and the design of the pull-tab cover is by Vertis.
 Including ads with those new types of covers was necessary, Mr. Granger said, because ''the reality of the world is that if I want to do things that are adventurous editorially, to pay for them we have to find partners to share costs.''
 For the cover window in the February issue, Discovery Channel, part of Discovery Communications, came aboard for several reasons. One is that the channel regularly advertises in Esquire. Another reason is timing; the first episode of ''One Way Out'' is scheduled for Jan. 26.
 And ''the fact we're the first to do it is intriguing,'' said John Ford, president and general manager at Discovery Channel in Silver Spring, Md., because ''we're always looking for outlets in media that give us great platforms to promote our programs.''
 ''In a year like this, with ad dollars so tight,'' he added, marketers are ''going to say, 'If I'm going to spend, I'm going to get more for it.' ''
 Mr. Ford and James Hitchcock, senior vice president for marketing and branding at Discovery Channel, said they would have turned down the opportunity to buy the cover window ad if they had deemed the idea too cute or coy.
 ''I think you can smell a gimmick a mile away,'' Mr. Hitchcock said. ''If the strategy is showing, we avoid it.''
 Similarly, at Esquire, Mr. O'Malley said, there was an effort to ''execute this the right way'' and insure ''the format doesn't cross any line'' and upset readers by blurring the distinction between editorial content and advertising.
 To that end, the ad on the left side of the opened cover window carries the Discovery Channel logo and the quotations on the right side appear under the Esquire logo.
 As for blurring the distinction between editors and publishers at Esquire, Mr. O'Malley described himself as fortunate to work with someone like Mr. Granger who is committed enough to the magazine to care about the business operations.
 When proposals are editorially driven, Mr. O'Malley said, ''there's a great opportunity to partner'' with him and others on the business side to bring in advertisers.
 To be sure, not every special issue makes for special results. For instance, the October issue of Esquire, which celebrated the magazine's 75th anniversary, carried 170 ad pages, the most for an October issue. But ad pages for Esquire for all of 2008 fell 14.2 percent from 2007, according to the publishers bureau. 
 But Esquire had company in its misery. Of the more than 230 magazines tracked by the publishers bureau that are still being published, the trade publication Folio reported on Tuesday, only 42 were able to sell more ad pages last year than they did the year before.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania: Public Consultation On Budget Gap

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia said the city faces a budget deficit of $1.04 billion over the next five years and $47 million in the current year because of sharp declines in business and real estate taxes and rising pension contributions because of falling stock markets in the recession. Mr. Nutter, calling the city's financial situation ''grave and worsening,'' also announced a citywide public consultation process to consider ways of closing the gap, and said all options including tax increases and layoffs were under discussion. The five-year deficit projection is in addition to a shortfall of about the same size identified in November. JON HURDLE

HEADLINE: Shares Gain Despite Big Banks' Slide

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Despite a rout in financial stocks, Wall Street fought back from early losses to close slightly higher on Thursday, even as economic reports sent up more distress flares about the widening recession.
 A day after stocks tumbled about 3 percent, markets dipped at the opening bell and fell sharply through the day, with the Dow briefly falling below 8,000 points, revisiting levels from late November's frenzied trading sessions. But shares rallied in the afternoon as bargain-hunters lifted every sector except financials into positive territory.
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down almost 200 points, finished with a gain of 12.35 points, or 0.15 percent, at 8,212.49. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended up 1.12 points, or 0.13 percent, at 843.74. The Nasdaq composite was 22.20 points, or 1.5 percent, higher at 1,511.84. 
 But mounting worries about some of America's largest financial institutions weighed broadly on financial shares.
 Bank of America tumbled $1.88, or 18.4 percent, to close at $8.32 on news that it would seek billions more in federal bailout aid. Citigroup, which is preparing to dismantle its financial supermarket model, fell 70 cents, or 15.5 percent, to $3.83 a share. Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs all finished lower.
 Even JPMorgan Chase, which reported a fourth-quarter profit of $702 million on Thursday, finished lower. Shares of JPMorgan, the first big bank to report its earnings, fell $1.57, or 6 percent, to $24.34, as the bank acknowledged the toll the financial turmoil had taken on its business.
 Stocks have fallen nearly 10 percent in recent days. Analysts said investors were growing more anxious about how deep the recession would cut and about corporate losses as earnings season gets under way.
 Volatility in the financial markets increased Thursday, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index ending above 50 points for the first time since mid-December. The index trades around 20 to 30 in normal times but shot above 80 in mid-November when the financial markets fell into a dead spin.
 New economic data released Thursday showcased the effects of the global economic slump: weekly first-time jobless claims rose 54,000 to 524,000, manufacturing conditions in New York State continued to deteriorate, and falling wholesale costs reflected the drop in demand for a range of goods. 
 ''They demonstrated an economy that's really bleeding in every possible way,'' said Haseeb Ahmed, a United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''I don't think there's any light yet.''
 Crude oil for February delivery fell $1.88 to settle at $35.40 a barrel in New York, the lowest point since Dec. 24, as a glut of short-term supplies continued to drag prices down. Oil prices had risen from lows near $30 a barrel on supply concerns sparked by war in Gaza and a production cut by the OPEC cartel, but they have fallen amid reports that crude storage spaces were filling up.
 ''The fundamentals for oil aren't good,'' said David Pursell, managing director at Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 113 18/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 2.21 percent, up from 2.20 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: As Demand Falls, So Do Wholesale Prices

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The price of wholesale goods in the United States dropped in December as the spreading recession continued to reduce the demand for a range of products.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Thursday that the producer price index fell 1.9 percent in December, its fifth consecutive monthly decline, after a 2.2 percent drop in November. The price of finished goods fell 0.9 percent for 2008, compared with a 6.7 percent increase in 2007. 
 Wholesale and consumer prices have slid back sharply in the downturn as oil prices collapsed, raising fears among some economists that the economy is nearing deflation, a cycle of declines in prices and wages.
 The government said that gas prices fell by 25.7 percent last month and liquefied petroleum gas fell 21.8 percent as overall energy prices dropped 9.3 percent. Lower energy costs cut prices for a range of products, including fertilizers, rubber and steel.
 Food prices posted the sharpest drop of the year in December, falling 1.5 percent from a month earlier, and energy costs fell 9.3 percent. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent last month. Core inflation was up 4.3 percent for the year.
 The cost of cars rose 1.2 percent in December.
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that first-time jobless claims rose 54,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 524,000, a sign of more turmoil for American workers. Unemployment has risen to 7.2 percent since the United States slipped into a recession in December 2007, and economists say it could crest at 9 percent or more.
 ''The experience of previous deep recessions suggests claims are nowhere near their peak, and we doubt that peak will be reached before the fall,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note.
 The four-week average, which smoothes out fluctuations, fell by 8,000, to 518,500, last week.

HEADLINE: An Investor With Madoff Faces Inquiry

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE; Zachery Kouwe and Alison Leigh Cowan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
J. Ezra Merkin, a New York financier, wrote his investors last month that he too was shocked by the news that Bernard L. Madoff's hedge fund was an elaborate Ponzi scheme. 
 But not everyone sees him as a victim. The New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, has issued subpoenas in an effort to determine whether Mr. Merkin had defrauded universities and charities when he invested their money with Mr. Madoff, a person with knowledge of the case said Thursday. 
 Mr. Cuomo's office is seeking information from Mr. Merkin, the three investment funds that he operated and 15 nonprofit institutions that gave him money to manage. Many of the institutions are now suing Mr. Merkin, claiming that they lost millions of dollars when he had invested money with Mr. Madoff without telling them. 
 The person with knowledge of the case said the investigation would examine whether Mr. Merkin had properly disclosed where the money was being invested. The institutions are being asked how they were affected by the Madoff scandal. The subpoenas were issued Wednesday night. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Merkin, Andrew J. Levander, said, ''We will fully cooperate with any investigation by the New York attorney general's office.'' 
 Mr. Merkin's three investment funds -- Ascot, Ariel and Gabriel -- invested either all or a portion of their assets with Mr. Madoff, leading to more than $2 billion in losses for Mr. Merkin's investors. And Mr. Merkin collected over $40 million a year in fees from them to support his lavish lifestyle. 
 ''I'm astonished,'' said Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher and real estate executive whose charitable trust lost $30 million through Mr. Merkin. ''Frankly, I was absolutely hoodwinked.'' 
 Today, say those who know him, Mr. Merkin is keeping a low profile. He still attends services at the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, where he is president. But he is rarely seen outside his office and home, both on Park Avenue. He has either resigned from -- or been asked to leave -- many of the boards on which he served. 
 New York University is suing Mr. Merkin over $24 million it lost. The university's chief investment officer rejected a suggestion last October by Mr. Merkin, who managed part of its endowment, that it invest in a Madoff fund. But, unknown to the university, Mr. Merkin had been investing its money with Mr. Madoff for at least eight years. 
 New York Law School has filed suit over a $3 million loss. Tufts University is facing a $20 million loss. Other victims include Yeshiva University, where Mr. Merkin was a trustee and headed the investment committee. Yeshiva lost $110 million of the money invested with him. 
 Marc Rich, the financier who was pardoned by President Bill Clinton, lost $10 million to $15 million. And Bard College, where Mr. Merkin sat on a board, estimates losses of $11 million. 
 They blame Mr. Merkin at least as much as Mr. Madoff.
 ''This has been a terrible shock,'' said Leon Botstein, president of Bard College. ''When I first read about Bernie Madoff, I thought, 'He's not part of our team.' Back then I had no idea that somehow we would be caught up in that.'' 
 Mr. Merkin was named to the board of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College on the recommendation of Leon Levy himself, a legendary Wall Street financier and philanthropist who died in 2003. When Yeshiva University expressed concerns over possible conflicts about investing with Mr. Merkin since he was a trustee, Ira M. Millstein, the respected corporate governance lawyer, blessed the relationship so long as it was disclosed. 
 And the offering prospectuses for Mr. Merkin's funds gave few clues. In nearly all cases, there was no mention of Mr. Madoff, just a diverse range of commonplace investments. 
 One mention of Mr. Madoff is in the Ascot fund prospectus, which was entirely invested with Mr. Madoff. But it does not cite Mr. Madoff as a money manager. Instead, he was listed as one of two brokers -- the other was Morgan Stanley -- that would clear Ascot trades. 
 Mr. Merkin's lineage provided him with a remarkable calling card. His father, Hermann Merkin, who fled Nazi Germany, made a fortune in the shipping business and became a major figure in New York's Jewish philanthropic elite. The elder Mr. Merkin was the founding president of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, a center of modern Orthodox Judaism, and gave millions to help build Yeshiva University and the Merkin Concert Hall near Lincoln Center. 
 Ezra Merkin's address is 740 Park Avenue, the celebrated cooperative building where Jacqueline Kennedy grew up and John D. Rockefeller once lived. More recently it has been home to financiers like Ronald O. Perelman, Saul P. Steinberg, Henry R. Kravis and Stephen A. Schwarzman. 
 His 18-room duplex contained one of the largest private collections of Mark Rothko's large abstract paintings, valued at over $150 million. 
 Mr. Merkin, a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, has been described as being brusque in public, but devoted to his family in private. 
 ''He was a member of the social elite of New York, so he was attractive to be on the board of a think tank,'' said Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, president of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard. ''There was certainly no concern that there was any negligence.'' 
 Another important connection for Mr. Merkin was Stephen A. Feinberg, head of Cerberus Capital Management, a private investment fund with big stakes in Chrysler and GMAC, the financing arm of General Motors. 
 Mr. Merkin became an investor in Cerberus and put money from Merkin funds into Cerberus and its portfolio companies. For instance, his Gabriel fund invested $79 million in Chrysler, $66 million in GMAC and $67 million in Cerberus partnerships, according to year-end statements. In 2006, Cerberus appointed Mr. Merkin as nonexecutive chairman of GMAC, a position Mr. Merkin recently resigned. 
 Mr. Merkin's financial empire was built in large part by his management fees: 1 percent to 1.5 percent of the $5 billion in assets under management. But because Mr. Merkin is a general partner in his funds, his assets are now at risk. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about J. Ezra Merkin, a New York financier under investigation in the Bernard Madoff fraud, misstated the losses of Bard College, whose money Mr. Merkin invested with Mr. Madoff. It lost $3 million of its $11 million investment, not the entire investment. The article also referred incorrectly to the role of the late Leon Levy in Mr. Merkin's appointment to the board of the Levy Economics Institute at Bard College. While Mr. Levy introduced Mr. Merkin to Bard officials, he did not recommend him for the board.

HEADLINE: Joking, but Also Jabbing, At Yankee Bond Hearing

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER and COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
No fists were thrown, so Day 2 of the chest-puffing, name-calling contest between a corporate-welfare-assailing state assemblyman and officials of the richest team in baseball never quite degenerated into the kind of circus that might have captured the spotlight on a day when other news was far more compelling.
 But at a noisy hearing of the city's Industrial Development Agency Thursday on the Yankees' request for more than $370 million in additional tax-exempt bonds to pay for its new Bronx ballpark -- or, more precisely, for cost overruns and goodies added since a 2006 bond issuance -- other critics at least got a chance to vent, while beneficiaries of the project and the Yankees' charity made sure to put in a good word for the boss. 
 ''An appalling use of public money,'' said Joan Byron of the Pratt Center for Community Development, an architect who advocates for the ''equitable distribution of environmental benefits and burdens'' across city neighborhoods, according to the center's Web site.
 Equity, though, is a subjective thing. Vinny Rivera, who said his group, Positive Workforce, lobbies for minority jobs in the construction industry and has placed about 70 people at the stadium, said he was on the Yankees' team because on game days the stadium is a beehive of business.
 ''Everybody makes money,'' he said. ''Everybody eats.''
 At a hearing he organized on Wednesday, the assemblyman, Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, the harshest and loudest critic of the Yankee Stadium deal, jokingly challenged Randy Levine, the team's president, and Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, to a ''civil, in-your-face fistfight.'' 
 On Thursday, as Mr. Brodsky, now on someone else's turf, approached a lectern, Mr. Pinsky goaded him good-naturedly: ''Would you like me to call my bodyguards, or are we going to refrain?''
 ''I'm thinking,'' Mr. Brodsky replied, to laughter.
 But the arguments were fiercer than the kibitzing suggested. 
 Mr. Brodsky accused city and Yankee officials of ''undue and illegal secrecy.'' Mr. Levine fulminated against Mr. Brodsky for more than twice his allotted three minutes, calling him a ''pathetic'' grandstander and likening his having subpoenaed Mr. Levine earlier this week to a ''Soviet-style'' tactic. Mr. Pinsky, meanwhile, dryly recited the Bloomberg administration's calculus for why the stadium project would remain ''significantly revenue-positive for the city.''
 It seemed unlikely that any minds were changed in several hours listening to the occasional hoots of construction workers in the back, the raw words of proponents like Mr. Rivera and the more polished ones of politicians like Deborah J. Glick, a Manhattan assemblywoman who did not attend but had someone read a letter in her absence (one that Mr. Levine said had errors).
 ''The I.D.A. has no choice but to tell the Yankees it does not have the money to contribute further to its field of high-end dreams,'' Ms. Glick's letter said.
 In fact, the Bloomberg administration, which controls the agency's board, has the votes, and approval of the bond issuance at its scheduled Friday meeting appeared inevitable.
 Mr. Brodsky seemed to concede as much in his remarks, telling the agency's board, ''You have simply failed to do the minimum necessary to make the decision tomorrow legal, appropriate and in the public interest.''

HEADLINE: A Respite From Seattle, a Ferry Ride Away

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
A green and white ferry, running at a soothing rumble, takes only about 35 minutes to cover the nine miles across glassy Puget Sound from the busy terminal on Seattle's waterfront to Bainbridge Island, Wash., which is much less hip, but much more tranquil.
 Boutiques, galleries and restaurants have gathered on Winslow Way, the main street through Winslow, the island's largest village. But there is also a Christian Science Reading Room, a bakery, a drugstore and two barbershops, both with striped poles.
 ''It reminded us of a quieter, less hurried way of life,'' said Carter Redish, an architect from San Clemente, Calif., who bought a 2,700-square-foot house on the southwest corner of the island for $649,000 in 2004.
 The charming amenities on the island, once a lumber center and then a playground for Seattle's wealthy, have turned Winslow and all of Bainbridge into a bedroom community. More than half of the island's 20,000 residents catch the ferry each morning to go to work in Seattle. 
 Even so, about 30 percent of the island's homes, real-estate agents estimate, are used only on weekends and holidays. Because the full-timers have established a thriving arts community, Bainbridge Island is a place to stay year-round, not just when it's warm.
 ''It's so close to the metro area, but it's so removed, so you feel like you can get away from it all in 30 minutes,'' said Lance Bear, an orthopedic surgeon from Warrensburg, Mo., who spends about six weeks a year with his wife, Linda Pai, and two children at their waterfront home on Bainbridge Island. Dr. Bear bought the shingled New England-style house in 2004 for $1.9 million.
 Covered by cedars and firs, with splashes of maples and alders, Bainbridge is a big island -- slightly bigger than Manhattan, in fact -- and there is a lot to see. The bicyclists are the first off the ferry. Soon, they are flying past parents pushing strollers and retirees walking dogs in downtown Winslow, even when it rains.
 ''When it rains, it doesn't stop people from doing stuff,'' said Jerry Mohr, a commercial real estate broker from Fresno, Calif., who stays at his weekend place on the island about once a month. ''When it's raining, people pull their umbrellas and galoshes out and go for it.''
 Not only is there a wide range of activities, there is also a wide range of places to live. Houses run the gamut from $350,000 cottages to $1 million custom-built houses in rural settings, to $6.2 million estates. ''It's not that everything here is $2 million,'' said Dennis Paige, an associate broker for Windermere Real Estate on the island.
 Years ago, Mr. Mohr was interested in buying a second home near Carmel, Calif., which is much closer to Fresno than Bainbridge Island. But he found that houses in Carmel were much higher priced, and many had no views of the water.
 So he and his wife, Kathy, bought a 4,200-square-foot house on Bainbridge Island in 2003 for $1.25 million and sold it about three years later for $1.75 million. They recently bought a five-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot custom house in the village of Port Madison for $1.9 million.
 ''We did not buy it for the appreciation level,'' Mr. Mohr said, ''let me tell you that.''
 What they did buy it for was its nearness to the water. They have a 27-foot motorized catamaran and love to take it out as much as they can, even in winter, piloting it through the nooks and crannies of Puget Sound.
 The Scene
 Dozens of boats are docked in Eagle Harbor, near Winslow, the island's hub. Winslow has a performing arts center and several good restaurants, including Four Swallows and Cafe Nola (try the sweet potato hash on the brunch menu for $12). 
 The big homes in Eagledale are the first thing a ferry passenger sees, but each village has a different feel. To the north is Port Madison, with summer houses that face the Seattle skyline. Rolling Bay is more rustic, with a feed store and a bakery. Sheep graze behind a house, and a sign points the way to a stand that sells fresh eggs.
 The new homes in Seabold and Manzanita face the Olympic Mountains and are graced by the late-afternoon sun. Grand Forest is at the center of the somewhat hilly island. There is a public golf course nearby, and a wide, undeveloped area to ride a bicycle or a horse. There is a skateboard park near, not surprisingly, the high school.
 With Seattle only about half an hour away, many second-home owners on Bainbridge like to take in a concert or a ballgame there. But the island has its own symphony and regular tours of artists' studios run by Bainbridge Arts and Crafts, a 60-year-old nonprofit organization. 
 Mr. Redish has a simpler pleasure, though: watching the ferry to Bremerton Island move stealthily from Seattle, its lights cutting through the fog. Every now and then, majestic Mount Rainier, to the south of Seattle, will peek through the clouds. ''It's really soothing and very pleasant,'' he said.
 Pros
 Because it's near Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, which is about a half-hour south of Seattle, it isn't hard to get to Bainbridge Island from other American cities, especially those on the West Coast. 
 Cons
 There is only one road from the mainland: the Agate Pass Bridge in Kitsap County, which enters the island from the northwest. There is no 24-hour ferry service to and from Seattle. The last ferry leaves Seattle at 1:35 a.m. on weekdays and at 2:10 a.m. on weekends.
 The Real Estate Market
 Mr. Paige said the values of houses appreciated by an average of 8 or 9 percent annually over a 20-year period -- ''a steady appreciation,'' he said -- until the economic downturn hit the Seattle area in late summer of 2007. Sales have been off by about 43 percent in 2008. According to figures compiled by the Northwest Multiple Listing Service, 188 houses were sold on Bainbridge Island in 2008, in contrast with 332 in 2007. Forty-four condominium units were sold last year, compared with 133 in 2007.
 The average sale price of a house in 2007 on Bainbridge Island was $820,569, a record. In 2008, the average sale price was $749,970. But the 2008 average was still more than twice the 1998 average of $342,195.
 ''It came here a little bit later and a little bit lighter, but it's definitely hit here, and it's affected all of us,'' said Barbara McKenzie, a real estate agent for 20 years who co-owns a Coldwell Banker agency on the island with her husband, Rod. ''We're weathering the storm.''
 Maureen Buckley, who owns Buckley & Buckley Real Estate with her husband, Ed, said prices have remained stable because Bainbridge Island is still considered desirable, particularly for second-home owners. A couple from Honolulu recently bought a second house on Bainbridge because of the change of seasons, they said.
 But people buy because they like having a cobbler around, and diagonal parking. ''People enjoy those things that haven't changed,'' Ms. Buckley said.

HEADLINE: A Way Out of Gaza?

 BODY:
We agree that Israel had to defend itself against Hamas's rocket attacks. But we fear the assault on Gaza has passed the point of diminishing returns. It is time for a cease-fire with Hamas and a return to the peace negotiations that are the only real hope for guaranteeing Israel's long-term security. 
 We are encouraged that a cease-fire finally seems to be gaining traction. Although not much detail is known, reports have focused on an Egyptian proposal for a phased-in truce, followed by a pullout of Israeli forces and the reopening of border crossings to ease the economic blockade of Gaza.
 The sudden diplomatic activity came as Israel unleashed its heaviest shelling of Gaza neighborhoods, including a hit on a United Nations compound where hundreds of Palestinians had taken shelter. 
 Israeli officials acknowledge that the 20-day offensive has not permanently crippled Hamas's military wing or ended its ability to launch rocket attacks. It is unlikely that Israel can achieve those aims militarily any time soon. The cost in human life and anti-Israeli fury would be enormous. Already more than 1,000 Palestinians have died in the densely populated Gaza Strip, where an always miserable life has become unbearable. Thirteen Israelis have died.
 We also fear that the war is further weakening the palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and his Fatah faction -- Hamas's sworn enemy. We know Mr. Abbas's limitations, but he believes in a two-state solution. If there is going to be a negotiated peace, he is the best hope. 
 As part of a cease-fire deal, Israel is right to demand a permanent halt to Hamas's rocket fire. Israel is also right not to rely on Hamas's promises. Hamas used the last cease-fire to restock its arsenal with weapons ferried in through tunnels dug under the Egypt-Gaza border. 
 The best protection would be to place monitors on the Egypt-Gaza border to stop the smuggling that is Hamas's lifeline. The Israelis also must be ready to ease their blockade of Gaza to allow more food and normal economic activity.
 The Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, is expected in Washington on Friday where she will sign a hastily arranged deal to accept United States equipment and technical assistance to help monitor the Israeli-Gaza border. 
 American and Israeli officials say that Israel would never accept a cease-fire without that help and both are eager to heap praise on Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for making it happen. But Washington could have provided that assistance years ago -- just as it should have been pressing harder on every aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
 President-elect Barack Obama says he will work for a peace deal from Day 1. We hope Israel picks a new leader in elections next month who is truly committed to a two-state solution. With the support of the new American president, he or she must make an early downpayment on peace by ending settlement construction, cooperating seriously with Mr. Abbas and improving the lives of all Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza.

HEADLINE: Glimpsing Some Signs Of Revival

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
Is monetary policy finally starting to work?
 You certainly cannot tell it by the economy, which seems to have gone into something resembling free fall in the final quarter of 2008.
 But there are limited signs that the credit markets in the United States are starting to function, at least for better-qualified borrowers.
 Consider the rate on traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. 
 For most of last year, it seemed to be moving in the opposite direction from what the Federal Reserve wanted. Just a year ago, on Martin Luther King's Birthday weekend, the Fed cut the Fed funds rate. By the end of October, it had repeated the process five times. 
 When the Fed started, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage was 5.3 percent. By the end of October, that rate was up to 6.4 percent.
 The story was the same for even high-quality corporate borrowers. The Moody's index of AA-rated corporate bond yields was about 5.8 percent a year ago. By the end of October, it was up to 6.4 percent.
 The Fed could ease all it wanted; the banks would not help.
 But something has changed. The mortgage rate is now around 5 percent, while the AA-bond rate has fallen to just under where it was a year ago.
 Those are still limited signs of a reviving credit market. There is no doubt that lending standards have tightened, and that some borrowers who could have gotten mortgage loans a year or two ago could not qualify now. Some may have perfectly good credit, but their homes are no longer worth what they owe. Others may fail to meet tougher income requirements, or discover that the cost of mortgage insurance has skyrocketed.
 Nevertheless, many homeowners are hopeful. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported this week that its refinancing index -- the volume of mortgage refinancing applications -- reached 7,410. At the end of October, it was at 1,075.
 It will be a few weeks, or maybe even months, before we find out how many of those mortgage loans are made. If few are, the claim that monetary policy is starting to work will have been premature, at best.
 But if those loans are made in quantity, it could provide a big economic boost to supplement the stimulus package being prepared by the new administration. 
 ''The grand deleveraging of consumers has to take place,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. 
 One way for that to happen is for people to simply stop buying anything they do not absolutely need. The retail sales figures for December make it look as if a lot of that is happening.
 ''Alternatively,'' Mr. Barbera said, ''households can reduce debt service without having to slash spending. They can do that if they can refinance, and use some of the tax cuts to lower debt payments.''
 It must be acknowledged that we risk running a two-tier recovery, in which the most creditworthy companies and consumers find loans cheap and the rest find them almost impossible to obtain.
 Rates on bonds for corporations with lesser credit than AA -- which is to say almost every company -- have come down but not as rapidly, and new junk bond issues are still hard to sell at any yield. Corporate bankruptcies are rising, and that is likely to continue as companies face the need to refinance debt coming due.
 Nor is the banking system yet healthy. The failure of the bank bailouts to stimulate more lending has been widely criticized, but that was not really the purpose of the bailouts. Instead, it was to recapitalize the industry and keep most of the banks alive. It turned out that some of them were in worse shape than anyone imagined.
 Apparently, two of the biggest banks in the country, Citigroup and Bank of America, are in that category. Under what appears to be federal pressure, Citi is shrinking, while Bank of America is in line for another bailout to save it from what now appears to be a bad decision to grow by acquiring Merrill Lynch.
 On Friday Citi will announce just how much red ink it found in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the week it unveiled a joint venture plan with Morgan Stanley for its brokerage business. (It will not, contrary to what jokesters immediately said, be known as Citi Morg.)
 That joint venture plan is a model of accounting maneuverability. Citi will get $2.7 billion in cash from Morgan Stanley, but report a pretax profit of almost $10 billion. It can do that by estimating the value of both brokerage businesses, and then using those values to calculate the ''profit.'' That will improve its capital position, on the books if not in reality.
 It's not the giants only that are scrambling to make their capital look better. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle revealed this week that it will not have adequate capital when it files its year-end numbers. Some of the mortgage-backed securities it owns are not worth anything close to what it paid for them. As a result, if it was forced to mark all its assets to market value, as much as half of its capital might vanish.
 You might think that evidence of such bad investing would lead to management's offering to resign, or at least sounding apologetic. Instead, Richard M. Riccobono, the bank's president, told me that ''these market prices are not realistic'' and should be ignored by regulators. He wants the capital rules to be changed as quickly as possible. It will be interesting to see how the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the newly created regulator, responds to that request.
 All that scrambling helps to explain why banks as a group seem reluctant to lend very much, particularly to risky borrowers. They still are trying to find out just how bad their old assets really are, not to mention how much worse they will become as the recession deepens.
 Imposing bailout rules to force banks to lend, and to limit dividends, as Congress is considering, may not be much help. It may be necessary, even if it sounds outrageous, for the government to take a lot of dubious assets off the banks' books, paying more than they are worth. Perhaps then the banks would have confidence in their remaining assets, and the rest of us could have confidence in the banks.
 Only then can we expect lending to really pick up, and it is hard to imagine this recession ending before that happens. ''History demonstrates conclusively that a modern economy cannot grow if its financial system is not operating effectively,'' Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in a speech in London this week.
 Mr. Bernanke made it clear that the measure of the Fed's success would be whether the high rates on risky loans come down to more reasonable levels. The recent rate declines on relatively safe loans is a tentative sign of progress, but there is still a long way to go before the credit markets are again operating adequately.

HEADLINE: Mom, Apple Pie and an Old Baseball Card

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For decades, the mothers of America have been vilified for the heinous act of throwing out their children's shoeboxes full of crumpled baseball cards. 
 Generations of vengeful offspring have whined that if their mothers had not indulged in mindless spring cleaning, the cards could have been turned into a Lamborghini or an A frame in Vail or an investment with that nice Madoff fellow. 
 It was all their mothers' fault. It always is, isn't it? 
 Now there is a phenomenon called Revenge of the Mothers. Good fortune has come fluttering Bernice Gallego's way, out of somebody else's discarded clutter.
 Bernice Gallego is not a baseball fan. She loves Pavarotti, for sure, but the only baseball name she knows is Willie Mays, from her mother's listening to the radio when the Giants arrived in San Francisco in 1958.
 Fact is, Gallego has never seen a baseball game -- majors, minors or Little League. (''My son is a computer person,'' she said.) But she thinks she could get interested in the sport, given the windfall that has fallen into her life. 
 Gallego and her husband, Al, frequent estate sales around Fresno, Calif., acquiring truckloads of antiques or just plain junk out of people's attics and cellars. They sort it out later at their shop, Collectique.
 Last summer, the Gallegos were going through their accumulation, posting items on eBay, when she spotted a rectangular card, somewhat mussed, with a photograph of 10 dashing young men in uniforms. 
 The lads could have been the Fighting A's of Oakland of the 1970s, who had mustaches and attitude, but the card definitely said Red Stocking B. B. Club of Cincinnati, and she knew it was a bit older than the 1970s. She put it up for auction at $10. 
 Al and Bernice Gallego did not get to be 80 and 72 without acquiring some smarts. When the kindly folks out there in Webland seemed a trifle eager to take the card off their hands, the Gallegos took the card off the market and went to discover just exactly what they had.
 Turns out, this is probably the oldest baseball card in history. The Cincinnati Red Stockings were merely the first professional baseball team on this continent, or probably any other. Bat and ball games had been played in many parts of the world, but baseball evolved in the northeastern United States in the 1830s and '40s. According to ''Playing for Keeps: A History of Early Baseball'' by Warren Goldstein, right after the Civil War, an attorney, Aaron B. Champion, assembled 10 amateurs in Cincinnati, gave them uniforms and paid them $800 or more a season, a respectable yearly wage for that time. 
 The 1869 Red Stockings were undefeated, winning an estimated 65 games, including league games and exhibitions, with one tie against the Troy Haymakers. 
 That year a card was distributed as an advertisement for Peck & Snyder, a New York manufacturer of both firefighting and sports equipment. 
 The Red Stockings had only one homegrown player, recruiting the others from back East, including Harry Wright, who had been born in England to a cricket player who immigrated to the United States. Wright helped recruit other players who lived in boarding houses, practiced regularly, wore red-trimmed uniforms and were expected to shun tobacco and alcohol and eat healthy diets -- just like our worthies of today. 
 Wright's best player was his kid brother, George Wright, who was paid the high salary of $1,400. The Red Stockings used the growing railroad system to barnstorm from coast to coast. In midseason they went to dinner at the White House, guests of President Ulysses S. Grant. 
 As Bernice Gallego is discovering, the tale of the Red Stockings has a thoroughly modern twist to it. In 1870, they won 27 more straight games but then lost to the Brooklyn Atlantics, which ended their mystique almost immediately. 
 Attendance dropped, the team could not make a profit, and the Wright brothers took their red stockings and moved to -- oh, but you guessed it -- Boston. The Peck & Snyder baseball cards went into the shoebox of oblivion. 
 The Gallegos have no idea where they got the card. They have been told by collectible experts that the card will be worth well into five figures, perhaps even $100,000, depending on the economy. Jay Leno's people and Martha Stewart's people have been requesting appearances. The auction will be scheduled for later this year, in Fresno. (The find was first reported by Mike Osegueda in The Fresno Bee.) 
 ''Antique dealers are born pack rats; we save rubber bands on door knobs,'' Bernice Gallego said on the phone, her voice husky, her tone worldly. This will not be the biggest jackpot of their career. In 1998, she said, she won $250,000 playing quarter slots at Tahoe. ''I paid off our mortgage and some other debts and bought some antiques and we put in a swimming pool, but we didn't stop working and I didn't buy a mink coat or anything like that,'' she said.
 Plus, it enabled them to make a few runs to Las Vegas, where, she said, ''I put some of it back.'' 
 The Red Stockings card, under lock and key, will not change their lives. It might encourage a trip to a ballpark. 
 ''I'm learning why people care so intensely,'' Gallego said. ''I can now understand why people collect baseball cards.''
 Collecting is understandable. Throwing cards out is not so understandable. At least one shoebox has ended up in a mother's hands. It seems only right.

HEADLINE: A Return to Kitsch Mountain

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
AS my girlfriend, Larissa, and I approached Gatlinburg, Tenn., this fall, I did my best to prepare her. She hadn't been to Gatlinburg before, but I had. I understood the town's complicated reputation both as a gateway to some of the most beautiful country in the United States -- the Great Smoky Mountains National Park -- and as a flamboyant capital of kitsch.
 We are, by choice, an urban couple, and this stop was a detour in a cross-country move from one big city to another: New York to Los Angeles. Mostly, we were sticking to the Interstates. But I wanted to see Gatlinburg again. 
 What I didn't know was that I could have used some preparing myself.
 A question formed in my mind as we drove into town, passing not only Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum, which I remembered, but also Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies, Ripley's Haunted Adventure, Ripley's Moving Theater, Ripley's Super Fun Zone, Ripley's Marvelous Mirror Maze and Candy Factory and Ripley's Davy Crockett Mini-Golf, which I did not.
 Could it be true? Was this place even farther over the top than it had been 16 years ago? 
 Family vacations were a simple affair while I was growing up, usually camping trips within a day's drive of our home in Indianapolis. We did Holland in Michigan, not Holland in the Netherlands. Tasting the Rockies meant sneaking a sip of my dad's Coors Light.
 Though I was 13 at the time and immersed in Metallica and skateboarding magazines, our camping trip to the Smokies stands out as my favorite, full of hiking, campfires and s'mores amid the dense deciduous forests of eastern Tennessee. And somewhere at the vague center of these memories were Gatlinburg and nearby Pigeon Forge, home of Dollywood. Separated by a winding five-mile road but unified in spirit, they embody all that is carnivalesque, yet comfortable, about an old roadside souvenir shop -- just supersized. 
 Now, as we cruised along the main drag in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge -- both decidedly more innocent versions of a strip than the one in Las Vegas, Larissa and I were wide eyed.
 I recalled pancake houses, T-shirt shacks, candy shops and ice cream parlors. Now the old mom-and-pops were competing with Bubba Gump Shrimp, Burger King, Pizza Hut, McDonald's, T.G.I. Friday's and many, many others of their ilk.
 Mini-golf and go-cart parks had exploded, each striving to outdo its literally dozens of competitors in outlandishness. Then there was the superstore dedicated entirely to ''As Seen on TV'' items; the Elvis Museum, which says it houses the ''world's largest private collection of Elvis memorabilia''; and the drive-through wedding chapel, with a sign outside asking, ''Why go anywhere else?'' 
 In Pigeon Forge, the Miracle Theater hosts a year-round musical extravaganza depicting Bible stories, complete with live animals (camel rides available after the show), sword-fighting angels and wire-harness acrobatics, a la David Lee Roth. We showed up as the last show was letting out, but the giant video screen outside, which ran a continuous loop of scenes from the performance, gave us the gist. 
 It turned out that by 8 or 9 p.m., it was way too late to find a dinner show. The next morning, we had the opposite problem. By the time we woke up and wandered into Gatlinburg, it was noon. All the pancake houses were closed, and I was desolate. I had been thinking about those pancakes since the night before. So we did a little more sightseeing on foot.
 Looking at Gatlinburg's strip with adult eyes, I wondered how much self-awareness was at work there. It would be easy for a city slicker to assume this place misses its own punch lines. In truth, I decided, it merely embraces that special brand of conscious kitsch that forms its own American kind of authenticity. With all its absurdities, Gatlinburg knows what it is and proclaims it loudly, from one flashing signboard to the next.
 Look right: a wax version of Tom Cruise, hanging from the ceiling. Look left: there's Anna Nicole Smith's 1993 Jaguar, in front of a museum called Hollywood Star Cars -- a copy of the title posted on the window for authenticity. Something of the opposite effect is achieved by the life-size cutout of Ms. Smith planted in the driver's seat.
 After we'd examined the spiked iron chastity belt, the two-headed goat and a piece of the Berlin Wall at Ripley's Believe It or Not, I struck up a conversation about Gatlinburg with D'Arcy Ottinger, an employee at Ripley's who has lived in and around town for about 30 years. ''Honestly, I'd love for it to be small and quaint,'' she said. But we both knew the wish was unrealistic. Economically, the Gatlinburg formula has worked, and tourism numbers have grown from year to year. ''We have so many more people,'' Ms. Ottinger said.
 And, I had to acknowledge, it sounded familiar. After all, I had just left New York, which has enshrined the same formula in Times Square, and I was on my way to Hollywood. 
 The right to become bigger and more ridiculous: Isn't that just the American way?
 There's a lot of talk out there about the ''real America.'' I figure the lure of the spectacle unites us all.

HEADLINE: Some Ask if Bailout Is Unconstitutional

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
While much of the debate over the $700 billion federal bailout plan has focused on whether the money is being spent wisely or well, concerns are growing among many conservatives about its constitutionality. 
 Some conservatives have argued that the law creating the program, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which Congress passed hastily in October, violates constitutional principles that limit the amount of power that lawmakers can delegate to the executive branch. 
 They also maintain that the enormous bailout plan has illegally grown beyond its original focus on the financial services industry to include a bailout of the auto industry and more. 
 Robert A. Levy, the chairman of the Cato Institute, a libertarian organization in Washington, said in an interview that the bailout program, which goes by the acronym TARP for Troubled Assets Relief Program, goes beyond the realm of delegation the courts should allow. Mr. Levy said that earlier cases had found such delegation was appropriate if Congress laid down ''an intelligible principle'' that provided clear guidance to an agency or a regulator. But that, he said, is precisely what is missing in the bailout. 
 ''There's no intelligible principle that I could discern,'' Mr. Levy said.
 Now the FreedomWorks Foundation, which was founded in 1984 and declares itself to be ''leading the fight for lower taxes, less government and more freedom,'' says it plans to file a lawsuit against the program.
 The group's chairman is Dick Armey, the former Republican House majority leader. A memorandum the group distributed to Congress on Thursday laid out its argument that ''when Congress delegates so much authority to the executive branch with so few rules to guide its discretion, Congress unconstitutionally transfers its lawmaking power to the executive.''
 The bailout's sheer size, the memorandum states, takes it beyond the realm of other Congressional delegations of authority that have been found constitutional. ''As far as we can tell, Congress has never delegated so much power to an executive agency with so little to constrain the agency's discretion,'' the memorandum concluded, calling the result ''a classic violation of the nondelegation principle.''
 The group has not said when it might file suit or whom the plaintiffs might be.
 ''We're still sort of dotting the i's and crossing the t's on that,'' FreedomWorks' vice president for research, Wayne T. Brough, said. 
 The possible legal challenge was first reported by Bloomberg News.
 Prof. Laurence H. Tribe, an expert on constitutional law at Harvard, said in an interview that such a challenge was unlikely to succeed because the doctrine of Congressional delegation, which flourished in the 1930s, was significantly weakened during the New Deal and never recovered.
 The bailout, Professor Tribe said, ''certainly tests the outer limits of Congressional delegation authority,'' and ''if the delegation doctrine were genuinely alive and well, TARP might be among its potential victims.'' 
 But, he said, recent cases in which the Supreme Court approved broad delegations of authority made it clear that it was unlikely to intervene on constitutional grounds. As an example Professor Tribe cited the authority conveyed to the federal Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act.
 Eric A. Posner, a professor of law at the University of Chicago law school, agreed. 
 ''Not even this court,'' with its bank of steadily conservative justices, is likely to revive the kinds of legal arguments of the 1930s, Professor Posner said. 
 ''I would be extremely surprised,'' he said, to see such an enormous legal shift, especially over a bill that focused on spending as opposed to broader issues.
 Dr. Brough of FreedomWorks acknowledged that more than 70 years of jurisprudence and the structure of the government from the New Deal onward might pose a difficult barrier for his group to surmount. However, he said: ''In our minds, this is probably the biggest intervention in the economy going back to then. It's worth revisiting.''
 He said that although the $700 billion was likely to have been spent before any challenge could make its way through the courts, the economy showed no signs of turning around, and there were more economic interventions on the way.
 When that happens, Dr. Brough said, ''it's important that you can point to something and say, 'Hey, guys, what you did last time was wrong.' '' 
 Jim Manley, the chief spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said he was unimpressed by the foundation's argument. 
 ''Taking economic advice from Dick Armey is akin to taking shooting lessons from Dick Cheney,'' Mr. Manley said. ''Neither are particularly helpful.''

 BODY:
COLON NEVARES--Jorge. June 4, 1935, to Janury 9, 2009. The family of ''Georgie'' Colon Nevares records with sorrow and desolation the sudden passing of our patriarch. His coronary attack in San Juan deprives us of his charm and companionship and deprives his 5,000 employees across Puerto Rico of what Governor Luis Fortuno calls his vision and wise counsel. 
He is deeply mourned by his wife of 50 years, Toni Gerena, his three daughters, Yaz (and Valentin) Hernandez of New York City, Yazmin (and Nito) Cortizo of Panama City, and Yovani Colon of San Juan; his son Jorge (and Marie) Colon Gerena of San Juan; and eight grandchildren. The definition of selfmade man, Georgie rose from credit manger at Hotel San Juan International to founder and CEO of a conglomerate of fast food Companies including the franchises of Wendys, Longhorn, Sizzlers, Applebee's plus a portfolio of real estate. In 1960, he founded Commonwealth Loan Corporation, a consumer finance company, which was sold in 1972 to First Pennsylvania Bank. He was president and CEO of Banco Economias and chairman of the company operating El Comandante Racetrack. For the past 25 years, he has been Chairman of the Board of Trustees of School of Medicine, Universidad Central del Caribe. Since 1994, he has served as Consul General of the Republic of Panama in Puerto Rico. A gregarious host, Georgie and Toni constantly opened their home to Puerto Rican singers and musicians. He was renowned for his hospitality, humanity, egalitarianism, talent for friendship and passion for history. In business, he was ambitious, competitive, and scrupulously fair. For his family, friends and employees, Jorge Colon Nevares will forever fill a place in the pantheon of la isla del encanto.

HEADLINE: Health Care You Can't Afford Not to Afford

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
With the recession in full swing, more and more Americans seem to be putting their health-care needs on the back burner as they struggle to handle monthly bills and day-to-day expenses. 
 About one in three Americans say their family has had problems paying medical bills in the past year, according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research group focused on health care. More alarming, almost half of those surveyed said someone in their family was postponing or cutting back on medical care they said they needed. 
 If you or your family are forced into this type of economic triage, you've got to do it wisely, says Dr. Ted Epperly, the president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. 
 The truth is, some health care can probably be safely put off until you're feeling more flush. If you're due for your annual physical, for instance, and you feel fine, you can wait a few months before forking over that hefty co-payment. Even children, once they are past vaccination age, can skip a check-up or two, as long as they are healthy and at a normal weight. 
 And while this suggestion is surely controversial, some experts say routine screenings like mammograms for women or PSA tests for men can also be postponed for a few months, as long as the person doesn't have any symptoms and no family history of health problems in these areas. ''The American Cancer Society wouldn't like me saying so,'' Dr. Epperly said, ''but you can stretch out those tests when you need to.''
 But the things you can safely skip make a far shorter list than the treatments most health care professionals consider mandatory -- no matter how cash-strapped you may be. The following three areas of health care are ones you simply can't afford to ignore, not only for your immediate well-being, but to avoid even more costly crisis care later. Fortunately, as you'll see below, there are ways to get help paying for the care you need. 
 1. Your Medicine More than a third of the people in the Kaiser survey said they were splitting pills, skipping doses of medicine or not filling prescriptions in the first place. ''If you're suffering from a chronic illness such as high blood pressure, diabetes or asthma, you already know how important taking your medicine is,'' Dr. Epperly said. ''You're on these medications for a reason, and going off without a physician's advice will almost always make you sicker.'' Even seemingly minor illnesses like strep throat or an ear infection can turn into an emergency room visit if left untreated. 
 What you can do: If you're having trouble affording your medicine, talk to your doctor immediately. He or she may be able to switch you to a less expensive alternative or a generic version of the drug you're now taking. ''Generics have the advantage of being much cheaper,'' said Dr. Sydney Wolfe, the director of health research for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. ''But they are also often safer than new, brand-name drugs because they have been in use long enough for potential side effects to be known.'' 
 Your doctor may also be able to help you enroll in a prescription drug aid program like the one sponsored by the Partnership for Prescription Assistance, a coalition of pharmaceutical companies and health-care advocates, says Cheryl Fish-Parcham, the deputy director of health policy at Families USA, another consumer advocacy group. 
 Another good source for help with finding affordable prescriptions (and all types of medical financial assistance) is MedlinePlus, a Web site backed by the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. 
 2. Your Symptoms Delaying care can work for fully healthy people. But the minute you have symptoms or start to feel something is wrong, that all changes, says Dr. Epperly. Skipping tests and treatments is no longer an option. Still, even if the doctor thinks you really do need an expensive diagnostic test, like a CT scan or M.R.I., there may be ways to get it done at reduced cost. 
 What you can do: Ask your doctor about free screening programs and low-cost clinics in your community that can provide an affordable test. In New York City, organizations like the Community Service Society offer resources for finding low-cost care. Also, if your test or treatment is related to a specific illness like Crohn's disease or diabetes, look up the Web site for the association or foundation that specializes in that illness, Ms. Fish-Parcham says. These organizations often provide resources for financial assistance to patients in need. 
 3. Your General Well-Being When you're feeling out of control financially, it's easy to let good habits and routines go out the window and resort to a vice or two. But this is not the time to smoke or drink more, Dr. Epperly advises. You could blow the budget and maybe cause real problems down the line. 
 What you can do: Keep eating a healthy diet, get plenty of exercise and get a good night's sleep. ''All three of these low-cost treatments have proven health benefits for you,'' Dr. Epperly said. And all that healthy living may help you relieve some of the stress you're feeling about money.

HEADLINE: A City Shaken, 'Not Broken'

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg conceded on Thursday in his annual State of the City speech that New York City is hurting from a global financial slump that could get ''plenty bad'' before it gets better. But if the city is shaken, the mayor said, ''it's not broken.'' He then offered to fix it. 
 It was an upbeat performance from a man who intends to run for another term and who radiated, at least outwardly, a level of confidence about the future that many of his constituents may not share. As politicians do, Mr. Bloomberg boasted about his successes, about how crime is down and tourism up. He also unveiled new programs to create jobs, to make the city a friendlier place for business and to maintain the quality of life that has been one of the hallmarks of his mayoralty. 
 His main pledge was to begin a program to add and retain 400,000 new jobs over the next six years, many of them ''green jobs'' retrofitting schools and other public buildings to save energy. He called, too, for new workspaces for artists, seed money for high-tech start-ups and emergency loans for small businesses.
 He would also expand his innovative 311 telephone information service. The new variant -- called P311 -- would give parents greater access to information about the schools and their students, as well as a much-needed place to register their views. 
 Much will depend on help from Washington and, especially, the governor and State Legislature in Albany. Federal stimulus money could provide the financing to build the No. 7 subway line and at least five new libraries. The state will decide the fate of his proposals to simplify business taxes and reduce them for freelancers. 
 Mr. Bloomberg promised to keep crime down and not ''cede an inch'' to squeegee people or vandals. He said he would ask for more security cameras, more enforcement and stronger penalties to deal with these and other ''quality-of-life criminals.'' These proposals, too, are going to require Albany's approval, as will an important proposal requiring background checks for employees of gun dealers and the use of new technology to help trace guns. 
 The mayor, who helped steer the city through the economic crisis after Sept. 11, 2001, now has the equally daunting task of holding the city steady during a national recession. The question this election year is whether Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent, can convince Democrats in Albany to adopt any good idea that has his name on it.

HEADLINE: Gentle Questioning for U.N. Nominee

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Susan E. Rice, the former senior Clinton State Department official for Africa, seemed assured of being confirmed as the next American ambassador to the United Nations after her Senate hearing on Thursday. Senators subjected her to fairly gentle questions, focused as much on foreign policy issues as on the concern that the United States does not get its money's worth from the organization. 
 In her opening statement before the foreign relations committee, Ms. Rice, who was the senior foreign policy advisor to the Obama campaign, said she would work on four priority issues with the overall goal of reinvigorating American leadership at the United Nations -- the most frequent terms she used seemed to be ''renew'' and ''robust diplomacy.'' 
 The priorities she identified are improving the capacity of the United Nations to undertake peacekeeping operations; providing leadership in addressing climate change; preventing both the spread and the use of nuclear weapons; and focusing on alleviating the suffering of the world's poorest.
 Asked repeatedly about what the Obama administration would do about the Islamic Republic of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, she said it would pursue a combination of incentives and pressure to block that, although she declined to be more specific. Citing President-elect Barack Obama, she said the United States had to ''combine tough, direct, robust diplomacy with increased sanctions and pressure to try to elicit a change of course from the Iranian regime.''
 Ms. Rice answered a host of questions about the effectiveness of the United Nations by pointing out that it was far more economical for the United States to rely on U.N. peacekeeping operations than for Washington to go it alone. For every dollar that the United States spent on such endeavors when it worked on its own, she said, it usually cost the United Nations 12 cents. 
 ''That is a pretty good deal,'' said Ms. Rice, 44, whose husband, two young children and parents were seated behind her. The United States pays 27 percent of the roughly $7 billion annual budget for peacekeeping, which includes around 90,000 soldiers in 16 different missions. It also pays 22 percent of the overall budget, the largest single contribution. 
 Ms. Rice said the costs of no action or unilateral action in many crises was too high, so the answer was to make peacekeeping more effective. The previous administration intervened periodically she said, but had not pursued it in a sustained or collective fashion. ''This is not a challenge for the United States alone,'' she said.
 Ms. Rice called it ''patently unacceptable'' that the United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur had only just reached half its strength, more than a year after it was formed, largely by underequipped units from the African Union. 
 The prospective ambassador has been quoted extensively saying that she would never allow a situation like the genocide in Rwanda to occur again, so she was asked several times how she would confront the government in Sudan over the killing in Darfur as well as other crises in Africa. Ms. Rice said she thought the United States could muster more support from countries like China and Russia on Sudan or Zimbabwe or other issues by emphasizing through quiet diplomacy where the interests of great powers converge with those of the region.
 ''It is not uncommon to hear quite moving speeches in the halls of the Security Council,'' she said, but that was to often followed by a ''deficit of determination'' to hold dictators like Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe to account for their actions. 
 The hearings ranged widely, touching on virtually every trouble spot in the world including the Congo, Somalia, Burma and North Korea. Given the fact that the Middle East is again up in flames, it was striking that no senators raised the question of the fighting in Gaza until some two hours into the nearly three-hour hearing. When two finally did, it was in the context of what to do to stop Hamas firing rockets into Israel -- none mentioned the heavy civilian toll among the Palestinian population. 
 It was Ms. Rice herself who brought up the humanitarian crisis, noting that the incoming Obama administration was greatly concerned about ''the suffering of innocents'' and on a broader scale determined to forge ahead with a two-state solution.
 ''There needs to be a durable cease-fire, but a durable cease-fire has to entail the halt to Hamas rockets against Israel and the Israeli people,'' she said, adding that including effective measures to control weapons smuggling into Gaza and an effective means to control the border. Once the fighting ended, she said, ''We need to mount a swift and robust effort to attend to the dire humanitarian needs inside Gaza.''
 Many senators, especially from the Republican side, expressed concern that the United Nations was shutting down an independent unit that had conducted corruption investigations over the past two years in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal. Ms. Rice expressed her support for continued efforts to reform the organization and root out corruption, but said the effort should be transferred to an internal auditor.

HEADLINE: Nationalization Hinted in Rescues

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Last fall, as Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials rode to the rescue of one financial institution after another, they took great pains to avoid doing anything that smacked of nationalizing banks.
They may no longer have that luxury. With two of the nation's largest banks buckling under yet another round of huge losses, the incoming administration of Barack Obama and the Federal Reserve are suddenly dealing with banks that are ''too big to fail'' and yet unable to function as the sinking economy erodes their capital.
Particularly in the case of Citigroup, the losses have become so large that they make it almost mathematically impossible for the government to inject enough capital without taking a majority stake or at least squeezing out existing shareholders.
And the new ground rules laid down by Mr. Obama's top economic advisers for the second half of the $700 billion bailout fund, as explained in a letter submitted to Congress on Thursday, call for the government to play an increasing role in the major activities of the banks, from the dividends they pay to shareholders to the amount they can pay executives. 
''We are down a path that this country has not seen since Andrew Jackson shut down the Second National Bank of the United States,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''We are going to go back to a time when the government controlled the banking system.''
The approximately $120 billion aid package on Thursday for Bank of America -- including injections of capital and absorbed losses -- as well as a $300 billion package in November for Citigroup both represented displays of financial gymnastics aimed at providing capital without appearing to take commanding equity stakes.
Treasury and Fed officials accomplished that trick by structuring the deals like insurance programs for big bundles of the banks' most toxic assets.
Instead of investing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars in exchange for preferred shares in the banks, which has been the Treasury Department's approach so far with its capital infusions, the government essentially liberated the banks from some of their most threatening assets.
The trouble with the new approach, analysts say, is that it is likely to conceal the amount of risk that taxpayers are taking on. If the government-guaranteed securities turn out to be worthless, the cost of the insurance would be much higher than if the Treasury Department had simply bailed out the banks with cash in the first place.
Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, said the approach also covers up the underlying reality that the government is already essentially the majority shareholder in Citigroup.
''There's nobody else out there to invest in them,'' Mr. Whalen said. ''We already own them.''
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, outlined the elements of what could become the Obama administration's new approach to bank rescues in a speech on Monday.
Speaking to the London School of Economics, but addressing American audiences as much as European ones, Mr. Bernanke warned that the federal government had no choice but to put more money into banks and other financial institutions if it had any hope of reviving the paralyzed credit markets.
Known officially as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, the rescue program has infuriated lawmakers in both parties, who complain that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has doled out money to banks without demanding accountability in return. Mr. Obama and his top economic advisers convinced enough lawmakers that shoring up the banks was essential to preventing a broader financial collapse, and offered written assurances that they would address the lawmakers' biggest complaints.
But Mr. Bernanke proposed an array of alternative approaches to dealing with the banks in the months ahead, and all of those options reflected a fundamental shift from the original assumptions of the Bush administration.
Mr. Paulson had insisted that the government would be investing only in healthy banks, some of which might take over sicker rivals. The Treasury would invest taxpayer dollars in exchange for preferred shares, which would pay a regular dividend and come with warrants that would allow the government to profit from increases in company stock prices.
By contrast, Mr. Bernanke proposed various ways to fence off the troubled assets, from nonperforming loans to mortgage-backed securities that investors had stopped buying at almost any price.
Mr. Bernanke's options included guarantees for bank assets, which was at the heart of the rescue packages for Bank of America and Citigroup. Citigroup received its rescue package in November, but it is expected to report additional losses on Friday that could top $10 billion.
In both of those deals, the federal government set up a complicated arrangement that would limit the banks' losses on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of their worst assets.
Citigroup's deal in November covered $300 billion in assets. Citigroup agreed to absorb the first $29 billion in losses. The Treasury agreed to take a second round of losses up to $5 billion, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to take a third round of losses of up to $10 billion. The Federal Reserve then agreed to lend Citigroup money at low interest rates for the value of the remaining assets.
As a second option, Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have proposed putting a bank's impaired assets into a separate new ''bad bank.'' The effect would be much the same as providing a federal guarantee: the bank would be able to free itself from the need to set aside reserves for extra losses.
Both the idea of a government ''wrap'' and a government-backed ''bad bank'' have the virtue of protecting the bank's common stockholders from being wiped out by the government.
By contrast, the Bush administration's original approach to recapitalizing banks -- injecting capital in exchange for preferred shares with warrants to convert to common stock -- had the effect of squeezing out the common shares. That was because any losses would have to first wipe out common stockholders before the bank could stop paying dividends on preferred shares.
''One of the problems with TARP has been a result of the government not wanting to own the banks,'' said Fred Cannon, chief equity strategist at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''If you get losses, there is less common stock. What we are hopefully moving toward, to the extent that the government guarantees some of the assets, is a structure that protects common shareholders and allows the company to go out and raise common shares through the market.''
But a growing number of analysts warned that the approach may be too clever, because it gives policy makers too many ways to conceal true problems at banks and true risks to taxpayers.
''What we have is a weird, shadow nationalization,'' said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting firm in Washington. ''The government does not want to and should not want to own banks. But if they get forced into that situation, they should resolve that situation. Here, what you have is a huge diversified financial services industry with recognized losses and looming losses in every aspect of its operations. There's nothing straightforward about it.''

'DEAR MR. PRESIDENT'
 You're never too young to have a political opinion.
 Just ask the Children's Museum of Manhattan, which recently initiated an unscientific study of the subject. In weekend workshops that began last Saturday, the museum has invited visitors to honor the presidential inauguration by writing to Barack Obama. The theme? Their hopes and concerns for the new administration.
 ''We designed it for kids 6 and above, but we don't have an age limit,'' said Andrew S. Ackerman, the museum's executive director. Some small citizens have contributed drawings or messages transcribed by Mom. One 4-year-old exhibited youthful altruism: ''I want chocolate for all the kids in the world.'' 
 The project, ''Dear Mr. President: NYC Children Write Letters About Their Future,'' is more than an exercise in civics. Some messages will be put in a document and sent to Mr. Obama. ''One of our educators, Jamie Kim, came up with the idea of a mural in the shape of an American flag,'' Mr. Ackerman said. The staff has attached selected letters to the flag, above, and there are so many -- more than 500 as of press time -- that the museum is starting a second mural. (Until the end of the month, children can also e-mail their messages to kidshopes@cmom.org) In addition to exhibiting the mural in the museum and on its Web site, ''we're trying to find a way to send it down to Washington for one of the inaugural parties,'' Mr. Ackerman said.
 Mr. Obama may want to take heed. One girl who described herself as ''a United States citizen'' asked him to help all longstanding immigrant residents without green cards. Another worried about the environment: ''Help save the polar bears and the plants.'' And Mr. Ackerman was struck by how many children referred to the poor economy, with requests for jobs for their parents and the plea ''Please get us out of this depression.''
 One girl offered indisputably sage advice. ''Mr. President,'' she wrote, ''take it one step at a time.''

HEADLINE: A Somber Bush Says Farewell to the Nation

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush said goodbye to the American people on Thursday night, declaring in his final address to the nation that while he had had some setbacks during his turbulent eight years in office, ''I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right.''
 The 13-minute address, delivered from the East Room of the White House before an audience of 200, including 50 invited guests and members of Mr. Bush's cabinet, was a somber end to an administration that, by Mr. Bush's own account, did not always go according to plan. 
 ''Like all who have held this office before me, I have experienced setbacks,'' Mr. Bush said, in a steady, even cadence. ''There are things I would do differently if given the chance. Yet I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind.''
 The speech will be Mr. Bush's last appearance in public until Tuesday, when he turns the Oval Office over to his successor, Barack Obama. Mr. Obama may not have seen it; at precisely 8 p.m., when Mr. Bush began speaking, he departed Blair House, the presidential guest house opposite the White House where he and his family are staying, for a restaurant a few blocks away.
 Mr. Bush leaves behind two unfinished wars and an economy in turmoil, and he warned in his speech of tough times ahead. The president who came to office vowing to be a ''uniter not a divider'' alluded to the deep partisan divisions that marked his eight years in office. But he said he hoped the American people would remember him as a man who stayed true to his principles.
 ''You may not agree with some tough decisions I have made,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I hope you can agree that I was willing to make tough decisions.''
 If Mr. Bush is emotional at the thought of leaving office, he did not show it, perhaps because he was surrounded by people who admire him and with whom he feels comfortable. Some of his predecessors delivered their farewell addresses from the Oval Office. But his counselor, Ed Gillespie, said Mr. Bush ''wanted to be with people'' for his final moment in the spotlight.
 Along with his wife, Laura, Vice President Dick Cheney and other top members of his administration, the East Room was filled with ordinary Americans whose lives have touched Mr. Bush's -- people like Arlene Howard, who gave the president her son's police badge after he was killed in the World Trade Center attacks, and Judea Pearl, the father of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was killed by terrorists in Pakistan.
 Describing himself as ''filled with gratitude,'' Mr. Bush touched briefly on a handful of policy matters that he regards as achievements: his No Child Left Behind education measure, legislation giving Medicare beneficiaries access to prescription drugs and his campaign to combat AIDS around the world. But his main theme was the moment that defined his presidency, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 ''As the years passed,'' Mr. Bush said, ''most Americans were able to return to life much as it had been before 9/11. But I never did. Every morning, I received a briefing on the threats to our nation. And I vowed to do everything in my power to keep us safe.''
 He went on to recount some of the decisions that flowed out of that vow: the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the creation of ''new tools to monitor terrorists'' movements -- tools that civil liberties advocates argue are unconstitutional. He did not mention his authorization of harsh interrogation techniques, another decision that has been among the most controversial and divisive of his presidency.
 ''There is legitimate debate about many of these decisions,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But there can be little debate about the results. America has gone more than seven years without another terrorist attack on our soil.''
 In giving the speech, Mr. Bush carried on a tradition of farewell addresses that dates to George Washington and continued, most recently, with Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. (Mr. Bush's father, the first President Bush, did not give a farewell address.) Mr. Reagan's address, especially, was deeply personal, laden with wistful references and reflections of America as a ''shining city on a hill,'' the phrase coined by John Winthrop, a colonial-era governor of Massachusetts. 
 But unlike Mr. Reagan, who left office with his popularity ratings high, Mr. Bush leaves as one of the most unpopular presidents in modern times. Perhaps reflecting that, he kept his talk relatively short and to the point, with few rhetorical flourishes. 
 Instead, the president spoke somberly of the challenges that the nation faces in the years to come, as he warned Americans to resist the temptation to look inward and not to abandon his signature foreign initiative, the so-called freedom agenda, intended to promote democracy around the world.
 ''If America does not lead the cause of freedom, that cause will not be led,'' Mr. Bush said, adding: ''I have often spoken to you about good and evil. This has made some uncomfortable. But good and evil are present in this world, and between the two there can be no compromise.''
 Mr. Bush will leave Friday for Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. He will spend the weekend there with his family and a handful of aides, including Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state; Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff; and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser. 
 Shortly before Mr. Bush spoke Thursday, the White House published his schedule for Tuesday, Mr. Obama's Inauguration Day. In the peculiarly stilted language of White House scheduling documents, it captured perfectly Mr. Bush's transition from President Bush to Citizen Bush, as follows:
 11:30 a.m. THE PRESIDENT and Mrs. Bush participate in the swearing-in ceremony for the 44th president of the United States of America. 
 1:25 p.m. THE FORMER PRESIDENT makes remarks at departure ceremony, Andrews Air Force Base -- Hangar 6.

EARLY RELEASE OF RUSSIAN RAISES TENSIONS IN CHECHNYA
A former Russian tank commander who was imprisoned for killing a Chechen woman was released early for good behavior. As he walked free, exasperation and animosity flared in Chechnya. Human rights advocates and Chechen officials, two sides that rarely inhabit the same side of an issue, spoke out against the early release with a unified voice. Page A6
ACTIVISTS SPEAK OF TORTURE
As activists came forward to provide harrowing tales of torture they say they were subjected to by agents of President Robert Mugabe's government, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai demanded that all those imprisoned on trumped up charges be released. Mr. Tsvangirai said it must happen before he would consider joining with Mr. Mugabe in a power-sharing deal for which another round of talks is scheduled next week. Page A6

It's been more than a month since an Iraqi television journalist expressed his disapproval with President Bush by throwing his shoes at him. The journalist was promptly detained and has been allowed only two visitors since. Few people know where he is, he is not allowed telephone calls, and he has claimed he has been tortured. Page A6

A legal advocate who signed up for a permit from the Chinese government to protest during the Beijing Olympics, and was subsequently arrested, has been sentenced to three years in prison, his lawyer said.

COURT AFFIRMS WIRETAPPING
Without Warrants
In a rare public ruling, a secret federal appeals court has said telecommunications companies must cooperate with the government to intercept international calls and e-mail messages of American citizens suspected of being terrorists. The ruling did not address whether President Bush was within his powers in ordering domestic warrantless wiretapping without Congressional approval. Page A13
ILL PELICANS FLOOD ANIMAL HOSPITALS
More than 400 brown pelicans have been found dead or dying in California since late December.

METHANE CONFIRMED ON MARS
What explanation can there be when methane gas erupts from the surface of Mars? Since some kind of interplanetary juvenile prank is out of the question, bacteria is a likely explanation. The eruption occurred in 2003 and researchers have learned that it made for 19,000 metric tons of methane. It was the first definitive proof of methane on Mars. Page A14

SURPRISES NO LONGER FOR MARIST
The star guard of the Marist college basketball team hears it from friends and hears it from locals. They want the Final Four. They've saddled themselves with that expectation by delivering some major accomplishments and landing themselves a spot in the N.C.A.A. tournament in four of the last five seasons. Page B13

THE BIOPIC OF BIGGIE SMALLS:
The Man, the Myth, the Notorious
''Notorious'' is a lively melodrama wholeheartedly devoted to burnishing the myth of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper. But hip-hop artfully blurs the line between raw testimony and fantastical exaggeration, so disentangling fact from myth is not always easy, A. O. Scott writes. PAGE C1
ALL ALONE IN A CROWDED HOME
Sam Mendes's seriously comic production of Chekhov's last play, ''The Cherry Orchard,'' about a motley mix of aristocrats in a country home, is now showing at the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. But the cast, which includes Sinead Cusack and Ethan Hawke, lacks the feeling of characters trapped in the solitary confinement of their own thoughts yet itching to connect, Ben Brantley writes.

THE LIVES OF A DISPARATE HOUSEWIFE
In Showtime's ''United States of Tara,'' Toni Collette plays a woman with dissociative identity disorder, mainstreaming that unthinkable way of life into PTA meetings and suburban cul-de-sacs. The show's comic conceit is that Tara's loved ones humor her personalities, from a sex-crazed teenage girl to a gun-loving redneck, as old friends, Alessandra Stanley writes. PAGE C1
HOW WE GOT TO SESAME STREET
The evolution of ''Sesame Street'' should make for a good read. But Michael Davis's new book ''Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street'' turns out not to be so complete, providing little analysis of the show's social and cultural impact, Michiko Kakutani writes. PAGE C1

Surfing in a snowstorm may sound like a direct route toward certain death.

A WAY OUT OF GAZA?
We agree that Israel had to defend itself against Hamas's rocket attacks. But we fear the assault on Gaza has passed the point of diminishing returns.

A CITY SHAKEN, 'NOT BROKEN'

HEADLINE: With Nod to History, Mayor Says City Will Recover

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Michael Barbaro and Ken Belson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a dramatic presentation Thursday that included a Ric Burns-narrated video and a marching band, invoked Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Sept. 11 attacks as he called for New Yorkers to endure the current economic crisis and ''come out stronger together.''
 In his annual State of the City address, Mr. Bloomberg described New York as ''shaken'' but ''not broken,'' and he put forward a nine-point plan to preserve and create 400,000 jobs, which he said he could accomplish without new government spending. 
 In that spirit, he also proposed several measures he said would make government more efficient and make life easier for residents, including a pilot program to allow taxis and livery drivers to take multiple fares from airports, train stations and other locations. 
 Mr. Bloomberg adopted a steely tone in promising to bolster the city's efforts against quality-of-life violators, like squeegee men and turnstile jumpers, saying that the city would ask the state to strengthen penalties against the crimes. 
 He also appealed to the State Legislature in Albany to pass several initiatives dear to his heart, like reauthorizing mayoral control over the city's schools. He also proposed a new initiative he called P311, for Parent 311, under which parents would be able to call the City Hall help line, 311, to get information about their children's schools.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a Democrat turned Republican turned independent, took the occasion of the one-hour speech to public officials and labor and business leaders at Brooklyn College to pat himself on the back repeatedly, detailing what he said were some accomplishments over his seven years in office. 
 Crime? That's down by almost 30 percent, he said. High school graduation rates? Up by 22 percent. And ambulance response times? The fastest on record.
 ''Those achievements have touched New Yorkers in all five boroughs and made our city a national leader in nearly every area of public policy,'' he said. ''But now, I think we all know, we are being tested again. I don't know how bad the recession will be, but we know it will be bad enough. Plenty bad. There's no question that the temporary state of our city is shaken. But I'm here to tell you today it's not broken.''
 The speech could have easily been mistaken, at times, for a campaign speech. Perhaps that was not a coincidence, since it was Mr. Bloomberg's last State of the City address before he asks voters to grant him a third term.
 To bolster the city's resolve but also pave the way for some of his austerity measures, Mr. Bloomberg invoked Roosevelt and the Depression, as well as the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970s. The video, which cost $10,000 to produce, featured New Yorkers testifying to the perseverance of the city and its people.
 Years from now, the speech may well be remembered more for its timing than its contents. Less than an hour after Mr. Bloomberg's address, a US Airways plane crashed into the Hudson River. 
 As might be expected during an election year, reaction to Mr. Bloomberg's speech was often shaped by political interests. Among those who praised the mayor was Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, a close ally. ''What we need in the city of New York right now is efforts by city government that can tangibly make people's lives better every day -- deal with their small, medium and large-size problems,'' she said. ''In a time like this, you really want to do micro and macro, because that's how things play out.''
 On the other hand, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., a Democrat who, like Mr. Bloomberg, is running for mayor, said: ''I thought this was more of a campaign speech than it was a full, 'here's the state of the city.' '' 
 Another potential opponent of Mr. Bloomberg, Representative Anthony D. Weiner, did not attend the speech, because he was in Washington. John Collins, a spokesman for the congressman, said, ''Representative Weiner is focused on the huge stimulus bill where he fought for and won $1 billion for more cops on the street,'' and added: ''Representative Weiner will take a careful look at the mayor's plan. Representative Weiner has said right now is not the time for politics but for work.''
 Others offered a mixed assessment. Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said that Mr. Bloomberg offered some promising ideas, but that she was skeptical about his pledge to create 400,000 jobs. ''That's hard to do,'' she said. ''I'd like to see the details.''
 Among other ideas, the mayor said he wanted to spend $900 million over nine years to improve energy efficiency at city agencies, hospitals, cultural institutions and schools, steps that he hoped would create 1,000 ''green'' jobs. 
 He threw his weight behind a number of sometimes contentious projects, including the extension of the No. 7 subway line, the development of the Willets Point industrial area near Shea Stadium, the expansion of the Howland Hook shipping facility on Staten Island and the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn, and the modernization of the Hunts Point produce terminal in the Bronx.
 Among several ideas that would have to be approved by legislators in Albany was the mayor's proposal to eliminate or reduce the Unincorporated Business Tax. People subject to the tax of up to 4 percent of gross revenues also have to pay personal taxes.
 The mayor said the tax would discourage New Yorkers who recently lost their jobs from starting to do freelance work or starting their own business. Getting rid of the tax would save each of them up to $3,400, he said.
 ''Let's give their bottom lines a boost when they need it most,'' the mayor said.
 The Freelancers Union applauded the mayor's proposal.
 ''The city needs to do everything it can to keep people working,'' said Sara Horowitz, the executive director of the group, which has 65,000 members in New York. ''This is a work force that is growing, and as more people get laid off, you want to make it easier for them to keep their jobs.''
 Mr. Bloomberg also promised an initiative to get more New Yorkers involved in public service, saying his plan was similar to what President-elect Barack Obama has urged. 
 And as is often the case, Mr. Bloomberg tried to cast himself as an independent and nontraditional politician.
 ''We will get New York City through these hard times with the same approach that has always worked for us,'' the mayor said. ''Independent leadership based on facts and pragmatism -- not politics and ideology. Innovative thinking that embraces new solutions to old problems -- and an insistence on accountability, always.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Nominee Offers Plan for Tighter Regulation

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Mary L. Schapiro, who has been selected by President-elect Barack Obama to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, outlined an ambitious agenda on Thursday that included tighter regulation of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. 
 She proposed greater federal oversight of insurance companies, which are now largely under the purview of the states, and of credit default swaps, the unregulated financial instruments that many say contributed to the market crisis. 
 Ms. Schapiro signaled that she was considering the reversal of major decisions under the Bush administration that have made it harder for the staff to bring enforcement cases. 
 She expressed reservations about the timetable recently approved by the commission to move American corporations toward adopting international accounting standards. And she promised to quickly re-examine whether the commission should restore a market regulation known as the uptick rule, which makes it harder for investors to make bets on declining stock prices.
 Ms. Schapiro's heavy reliance on regulation marked a sharply different tone from her time as a Wall Street regulator, particularly in recent years, when she has said in speeches that she would work closely with industry to reduce what she had criticized as overly burdensome regulation. 
 It remains to be seen how quickly she will be able to fulfill her agenda. While the current crisis provides political opportunities to push for change, many of her proposals were similar to those made years ago by a former S.E.C. chairman, William H. Donaldson, that were successfully challenged by major corporate and Wall Street interests and by other Republican commissioners. 
 Appearing at her confirmation hearing before a Senate banking committee that warmly embraced her selection, Ms. Schapiro had no difficulty rebuffing the tepid criticism raised by some senators that she had been a ''safe choice'' and that her career record as a regulator indicated she had not taken on many significant or large cases. Cognizant of the political dynamics that have taken hold of a capital grappling with a global financial crisis, Ms. Schapiro vowed to move swiftly to reinvigorate a deeply demoralized enforcement program and overhaul the regulatory apparatus.
 ''There are many reasons for this crisis -- and one of them is that our regulatory system has not kept pace with the markets and the needs of investors,'' Ms. Schapiro testified. ''It is precisely during times like this that we need an S.E.C. that is the investor's advocate -- that has the staff, the will and the resources necessary to move with great urgency to bring transparency and accountability to all corners of the marketplace, to vigorously prosecute those who have broken the law and cheated investors, and to modernize our country's regulatory system to match the realities of today's global, interdependent markets.''
 Ms. Schapiro is the top official at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which oversees Wall Street regulation on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finra was created from the merger two years ago of the regulatory arms of the New York Stock Exchange and NASD, which she had led after leaving government in 1996. 
 She dismissed concerns that both Finra and NASD had failed to detect the Ponzi scheme linked to Bernard Madoff Securities, saying that neither agency ever received any tips and that any enforcement shortcomings were a reflection of the ''stovepipe approach'' to the oversight of Wall Street.
 She also rejected concerns that Finra had often fined small companies for minor violations rather than taking on larger companies and bigger problems.
 ''I have never been afraid to go after people who I feel violated the public trust,'' she said. ''There are absolutely no sacred cows.''
 She said she was committed to overhauling the enforcement program and would reconsider procedures adopted during the Bush administration that make it more difficult for the enforcement staff to bring cases or levy large fines. She also said that she would create a more coordinated process to handle tips and whistle-blowers and that she would revive a risk assessment office proposed by Mr. Donaldson to study the markets for future risks.
 Even as they criticized current regulators for failing to detect many of the problems of Wall Street, Democrats and Republicans on the committee rushed to support Ms. Schapiro's nomination.
 ''You're extremely well qualified for this job,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the committee. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, said that she ''would bring solid experience to the table during a time of economic and regulatory uncertainty.''
 In response to questions, Ms. Schapiro indicated that she would be facing many of the same issues that had frustrated predecessors. She said she supported changing the regulations to require the registration of all hedge funds. That proposal, approved by a deeply divided commission under the leadership of Mr. Donaldson, was ultimately reversed by a federal appeals court and opposed by the Bush administration.
 In another area where corporate interests have successfully blocked changes in recent years, she said that she would reopen the debate over whether to make it easier for dissenting shareholders to propose and elect a slate of directors.
 And she said she was committed to quickly examining whether to restore the uptick rule, which was repealed by the commission in 2007. The rule prohibits short-sellers, who borrow stock and sell it in the hope of making a profit when it declines, from trading on shares when they are declining.

HEADLINE: Ex-Congressman Lazio Is Said to Be Exploring a Run for Governor

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Former Representative Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican who rose to prominence by challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton in her first Senate race, is exploring the possibility of running for governor next year.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Lazio, who retired from Congress in 2000, has had conversations with Republican elected officials, party leaders and fund-raisers to discuss the pros and cons of a possible candidacy, according to three people he has consulted about the race.
 The circle of advisers he has talked with includes Arthur Finkelstein, the architect of George E. Pataki's 1994 victory over Mario M. Cuomo in the race for governor. 
 At the moment, Mr. Lazio has the Republican field to himself, despite the fact that he has been out of politics for nearly a decade. Many Republicans said the dearth of potential candidates for governor underscores the party's weakness heading into the 2010 elections.
 In an interview, Mr. Lazio, an executive vice president at JPMorgan Chase & Company, acknowledged he has had conversations with people about running, but would not comment beyond that. ''It's an honor to be thought of as an attractive candidate,'' he said.
 One of the advisers he has consulted was more blunt. ''Rick is taking a real hard look at this,'' said the adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. ''He sees this as a real opportunity.''
 Until now, Representative Peter T. King, an eight-term incumbent from Long Island, had been the only prominent Republican who had signaled his interest in running for governor next year, though some supporters of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani are hoping he will enter the race.
 But Mr. King appears to have become far more interested in the Senate seat being vacated by Mrs. Clinton, who is nearing confirmation as the next secretary of state.
 The advisers who have spoken to Mr. Lazio offered a preview of the kind of campaign he might run: presenting him as a moderate Republican from the politically consequential suburbs of New York City who, because of his long hiatus as an elected official, could escape being tied to the record left by President Bush and his conservative allies in Congress.
 For example, Mr. Lazio supports abortion rights and opposes President Bush's efforts to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the Lazio advisers noted.
 While Mr. Lazio's supporters are keenly aware of the electoral challenges they face in a heavily Democratic state like New York, they can envision situations in which Mr. Lazio could prevail -- if, for instance, Gov. David A. Paterson emerges severely damaged from his effort to make steep budget cuts to close the state's projected $15 billion deficit.
 Indeed, Mr. Lazio and his advisers believe there are lessons to be drawn from the governor's race in the mid-'90s, when polls showed that Mr. Pataki won on the depth of the public's dissatisfaction with Mr. Cuomo rather than on strong support for Mr. Pataki, a Republican, according to those he has consulted.
 Mr. Paterson is already drawing fire from some traditional Democratic groups, including labor unions, over the deep cuts in state spending that he is seeking.
 ''I think Paterson is very vulnerable,'' said William L. DeProspo, the Orange County Republican chairman, who called Mr. Lazio a few weeks ago and urged him to run for governor.
 Mr. Paterson will not have Republicans to blame for any failures in Albany because Democrats enjoy one-party dominance there for the first time in decades, another adviser said.
 ''There's a real use to having a villain,'' the adviser said. ''But Paterson will have nobody to point the finger at but himself and his own party.'' 
 Though Mr. Lazio was soundly defeated by Mrs. Clinton in 2000, the former congressman did demonstrate some political strengths that could prove useful in a contest for governor.
 Mr. Lazio entered the Senate race relatively late in the game, in May, just a few months before Election Day. And yet he managed to raise more than $39 million, even as he traveled the state to make himself known to New Yorkers outside his Congressional district in Suffolk County.
 Still, Mr. Lazio's advisers acknowledged that Mr. Paterson does not carry the personal and political baggage that Mrs. Clinton had in 2000. That means that Mr. Lazio cannot count on the anti-Clinton sentiment that helped him raise large amounts of money from national conservatives who were more interested in defeating her than in electing him.
 And given the Wall Street collapse and dismal economy, voters may be wary of Mr. Lazio, who has spent years working in the financial sector and as a onetime lobbyist for JPMorgan Chase.
 In addition, Mr. Lazio remained active in politics since retiring from Congress. He helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts. Now he is discussing his own possible run with Romney fund-raisers, people close to him say.
 The Lazio camp is keeping an eye on Mr. Giuliani, who has sent mixed signals through surrogates about whether he intends to run for governor.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Options for Washington's Hungry Visitors

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
THERE are many reasons to make a special trip to the nation's capital, even apart from the inauguration of Barack Obama: acres of museums, fine Federal architecture, grand sweeping parks and gardens, charming neighborhoods, neat music clubs and, of course, the chance to watch your government at work (or perhaps not). But, truth be told, restaurants are not exactly on top of the why-to-visit list.
 Yes, there are plenty of very good places to eat in Washington, thanks in no small part to a recent surge in casual spots turning out inventive food for lively crowds at reasonable prices. But as much as it has tried over the years -- and food here is infinitely better and more varied than was 10 years ago -- Washington has always struggled to develop its own galaxy of top-tier destination restaurants, the kind that Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco and New York all have. I'm reminded of this whenever friends or family members come to town and ask which restaurants they must try. 
 The city's restaurant scene has to a certain extent been distorted by expense accounts, which have enabled a number of high-profile restaurants to charge too much money for forgettable food. Beyond that, even the best of restaurants can be frustratingly inconsistent from night to night, and service can be jarring. (At a visit the other night to one of the city's really good new restaurants, the Source, a waiter plopped the amuse-bouche on the table after we received our appetizer. Oops.) 
 And since Washington is not a late city, or at least hasn't been in the Bush era, some places have an annoying habit of turning down the heat at 10 p.m. (no joke; you can set your watch by it), intended, I am sure, to hurry the remaining patrons to head for home. 
 All that said, there are plenty of spots to find a good -- even a very, very good -- meal. And many of them haven't soared into the $40-an-entree orbit, which is much appreciated these days. Here is a list of some of the places worth a try when you are in town. Reservations, where they are taken (at a lot of places, they aren't), are recommended, particularly in a week when so many people are coming to town. Hours given are for dinner and may vary during inauguration week; prices are for dinner for two with two glasses of wine, exclusive of tip and tax. 
 POSTO This brash Italian brasserie in the Logan Circle neighborhood has been packed most every night since it opened late last year, testimony to low prices, high-quality food and its crackling energy. Start with a pizza Margherita baked in the wood-burning stove that anchors the dining room. The kitchen presses pork into service to produce a stand-out riff on what otherwise would be vitello tonnato (translucent slices of veal coated with a creamy tuna-and-capers sauce). The tagliatelli with pheasant ragout, rich and pungent, or grilled salmon with black-eyed peas can round out your night. The high-ceiling room -- this was once an automobile part store -- is loud, and the tables are spaced just close enough together to allow table-hopping as the night goes on, just in case you forgot you were in Washington. No reservations, but the bar is big and inviting.
 1515 14th Street NW, (202) 332-8613; postodc.com. Monday through Thursday, 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5 to 11:30 p.m.; Sunday, 5 to 10 p.m. $75.
 CASHION'S EAT PLACE This Adams-Morgan restaurant recently changed hands; a new chef has brought renewed verve to the kitchen. One of the more welcoming dining rooms in the city, Cashion's leans back into a curving and open room with warm lighting, setting the stage for Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. Try the sturgeon wrapped in bacon or Muscovy duck with juniper if it's offered. The soups are particularly good, with always-fresh ingredients and often surprising combinations. The rabbit meatloaf is daring comfort food.
 1819 Columbia Road NW, (202) 797-1819; cashionseatplace.com. Tuesday and Sunday, 5:30 to 10 p.m.; Wednesday through Saturday, 5:30 to 11 p.m.; closed Monday. $95.
 AL CROSTINO If you're looking for a lavishly appointed power dining room with big sprays of flowers and elegant framed wall-hangings, go elsewhere. This tiny two-level restaurant is nestled in a hole-in-the-wall storefront in the middle of one of the city's up-and-coming neighborhoods. And it is serving some of the most appealing Italian food in the city, delivered by charming, chatty waiters. I prefer eating upstairs, away from the television set ( another annoying tic of Washington restaurants), but each floor offers its own idiosyncratic appeal. Try the linguine with shrimp and cherry tomatoes, an arresting contrast of tastes and textures, or a typical special, veal chop with a sweet sauce of figs, or prosciutto however the restaurant serves it, or -- well, I've never had a bad dish here. Menu prices are more than affordable; the specials tend to creep up in cost, so ask before you order.
 1324 U Street NW, (202) 797-0523; alcrostino.com. Monday through Sunday, 5 to 10 p.m. $70.
 MARVIN This handsome, lively and loud Belgian-meets-Southern-cooking restaurant has been discovered, so it may be a tough ticket, and don't go for a quiet romantic evening. Go for the hearty, artery-blocking food -- shrimp and grits; fried chicken with waffles and syrup -- and, of course, for the mussels. The hamburger may be the best in town, and it's easy to get out without spending a lot of money. 
 2007 14th Street NW, (202) 797-7171; marvindc.com. Monday through Thursday, 5:30 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5:30 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Sunday, 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. $75.
 CAFE MILANO If you want to witness Washington political power nightlife, Cafe Milano is your stop. This Georgetown institution has always attracted a jostling bipartisan crowd of Democratic and Republican powerbrokers, sprinkled -- incongruously -- with a representation of the city's international contingent. The prices can be heart-stopping (think $14 salads), but the food is reliably good, if not particularly boundary-shattering, from the roasted branzino to the splayed and grilled veal chop with arugula. The hosts might be brusque if they don't know you (or the vice president is there), but it's still worth the show, especially if someone else is picking up the check.

 THE SOURCEWolfgang Puck's contribution to Washington is tucked into a corner of the Newseum, the latest museum entry in the Penn Quarter. The upstairs dining room is sleek and muted, dominated by a glass-ensheathed wine cellar on one wall that displays the restaurant's collection. Try to grab a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows along Pennsylvania Avenue, giving you some great views of the city. The aforementioned amuse-bouche lapse aside, the food here -- the stir-fried lamb in lettuce cups, the scallop and shrimp siu mai dumplings, the lacquered Chinese duckling -- reminded me again of why I have loved Mr. Puck's food since I first walked into Spago in Beverly Hills 20 years ago. That said, Mr. Puck might have missed the memo on the recession: A lobster special the night we were there was $56, as our waiter told us only upon questioning.

 DINO If you want to venture beyond downtown, this is an easy place to get to, on the Red Line in Cleveland Park. It has one of the best Italian wine lists in the city; let the convivial (and pleasantly politics-obsessed) owner, Dean Gold, guide you. The food is hearty and inventive. A recent menu included a panna cotta infused with summer orange and yellow heirloom tomatoes and linguini richly sauced with ground sausage and clams. It's well priced but also has great wine deals on Sunday and Monday nights: one-third off of bottles that are more than $50.

 CITRONELLE This Georgetown spot is the grande dame of Washington restaurants, a production of Michel Richard, who is arguably the best chef in the city (and one of the best in the country). Go if you want a splurge; you will not be disappointed in the elegant and refined cuisine. That said, the service has repeatedly proved not up to the culinary standards of the restaurant, and this is one of those dining rooms that fall into the eating-in-a-museum category.

 VINOTECA, CORK One of the more pleasant developments in the Washington dining scene is the explosion of wine bars, places where you can sample interesting new vintages served with often better-than-decent food. Cork and Vinoteca are two of the better ones. Cork has slightly better food, and there's probably no better place in the city to have a selection of charcuterie or avocado on grilled bread with a three-glass flight of wine from Alsace. And don't go to Vinoteca without trying their sliders, beef or lamb. 
 Vinoteca, 1940 11th Street NW, (202) 322-9463; vinotecadc.com. Tuesday to Thursday, 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m.; Friday and Saturday, 4:30 p.m. to 3 a.m.; Sunday, 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Closed Monday, except during inauguration week; special hours for Friday through Tuesday, 4:30 p.m. to 4 a.m. $70.

 RESTAURANT EVE It can be challenging to venture to Old Town in Alexandria, Va., but it's worth it to taste Cathal Armstrong's cooking. Eat in the Bistro. (There's also a tasting room with lavish, and expensive, tasting menus if you're up for that.) The menu changes based on available ingredients -- it was white truffles the night we were in, fortuitously -- and the daily whims of Mr. Armstrong and his garden. 
 110 South Pitt Street, Alexandria, Va., (703) 706-0450, restauranteve.com. Bistro hours, Monday through Saturday, 5:30 to 10 p.m.; closed Sunday. $150.
 PALENA CAFE This may be the best deal in Washington, though you are going to have to work to enjoy it. No reservations here (as opposed to the formal and renowned restaurant in the back); it's a first-come, first-served scrimmage for a sprinkling of tables in the front or the seats around the bar. The reward: fabulous roast chicken (which they pop in the oven when you order it, so prepare for a wait), an even more fabulous cheeseburger, and Palena fries -- potatoes, onion, lemon -- along with stray items from the more elaborate menu being served in the back.
 3529 Connecticut Avenue NW, (202) 537-9250; palenarestaurant.com. Tuesday through Saturday: 5:30 to 10 p.m. $55.

HEADLINE: Susan E. Rice

BYLINE: By NEIL MACFARQUHAR

 BODY:
Susan E. Rice, the former senior Clinton State Department official for Africa, seemed assured of being confirmed as the next American ambassador to the United Nations after her Senate hearing on Thursday. 
 Ms. Rice, 44, was subjected to fairly gentle questions, focused as much on foreign policy issues as on the concern that the United States does not get its money's worth from the United Nations. 
 In her opening statement to the Foreign Relations Committee, Ms. Rice, who was the senior foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama's presidential campaign, identified four priorities with the overall goal of reinvigorating American leadership at the United Nations. 
 The priorities, she said, are improving the capacity of the United Nations to undertake peacekeeping operations; providing leadership in addressing climate change; preventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons; and easing the suffering of the world's poorest.
 Asked repeatedly about what the Obama administration would do about Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons, she declined to be specific. Citing President-elect Obama, she said the United States had to ''combine tough, direct, robust diplomacy with increased sanctions and pressure to try to elicit a change of course from the Iranian regime.''
 Ms. Rice answered a host of questions about the effectiveness of the United Nations by pointing out that it was far more economical for the United States to rely on United Nations peacekeeping operations than for Washington to go it alone. For every dollar that the United States spent on such endeavors when it worked on its own, she said, it usually cost the United Nations 12 cents. 
 Given that the Middle East is again in flames, it was striking that no senators raised the question of the fighting in Gaza until some two hours into the nearly three-hour hearing. When two finally did, it was in the context of what to do to stop Hamas from firing rockets into Israel; neither mentioned the heavy civilian toll among the Palestinians. 
 Ms. Rice brought up the humanitarian crisis, noting that the incoming administration was greatly concerned about ''the suffering of innocents'' and determined to forge ahead with a two-state solution.
 ''There needs to be a durable cease-fire,'' she said, ''but a durable cease-fire has to entail the halt to Hamas rockets against Israel and the Israeli people.'' 
 The committee's chairman, John Kerry of Massachusetts, said that the vote on Ms. Rice's confirmation would come on Wednesday or Thursday next week, and that the full Senate would probably act immediately after that.

HEADLINE: Signs of Trouble Emerge In Transition's Last Days

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER; Neil A. Lewis contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The smooth ride to the inauguration has turned bumpier in its final days for President-elect Barack Obama as he struggles to complete his cabinet, push problematic nominations through the Senate and balance competing demands in his economic package.
 Mr. Obama has increasingly taken command in Washington even before being sworn in and won an important legislative victory on Thursday, releasing more bailout money. But a transition that has moved forward with precision and decisiveness has also begun encountering signs of trouble that could foreshadow the challenges awaiting him once he moves into the White House next week. 
 The failure of Mr. Obama's pick for Treasury secretary to pay all of his taxes has pushed off his confirmation so that a stand-in will temporarily lead the department after Mr. Obama's swearing-in, even as renewed turmoil buffets the financial sector. Aides said Mr. Obama would likewise take office without settling on a commerce secretary to replace his first choice, who dropped out. And the man Mr. Obama once declared should not fill his Senate seat was nonetheless sworn in on Thursday.
 Most of Mr. Obama's cabinet choices are heading toward easy confirmation, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose nomination for secretary of state was endorsed 16 to 1 by a Senate committee on Thursday. But his designated attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., was grilled over his record by another Senate panel. Over all, it appeared that Mr. Obama might not have as many cabinet secretaries in place by Inauguration Day as President Bush did.
 On policy, the broad consensus Mr. Obama has forged in favor of a huge stimulus program to revive the economy could be tested as Democrats push for more spending and less tax cuts while Republicans push for the opposite. Hoping to rally public support behind his approach, Mr. Obama plans to fly to Ohio on Friday to hold a town-hall-style meeting on the economy.
 ''The tension that we're starting to see with them trying to get the stimulus through is part of the natural push-pull of the process,'' said Candida P. Wolff, a former White House legislative affairs director for Mr. Bush. ''A new administration is having to learn to deal with it.''
 The Obama team brushed off the road bumps, noting the president-elect's strong poll numbers and success in persuading lawmakers to release the second half of the $700 billion financial bailout fund. ''We're sitting at 71 percent job approval in the midst of the worst economic crisis,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff. ''That's one measure of performance, not Washington talk.''
 As for confirmation holdups for Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury nominee, and Tom Daschle, tapped for secretary of health and human services, Mr. Emanuel called that the normal ''nicks and cuts'' of the transition process. ''I'm not going to deny that there's Tim and also Tom's stuff,'' he said. ''But when you take the wide-lens view of everything and weigh the runs versus errors, where does the scorecard come out?''
 By most measures, the scorecard is still heavily weighted in Mr. Obama's favor. Even Republicans say he has had a successful transition and appears likely to get all of his nominees confirmed eventually. The troubles that have arisen stand out in part because everything has gone so well for him for so long.
 But lately, the plan has sometimes gone awry. Mr. Obama spoke out against seating Roland W. Burris as his successor in the Senate because of the corruption accusations against Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, who appointed Mr. Burris. But the Senate Democrats reversed gear and seated him on Thursday anyway.
 Mr. Obama's nominee for the Commerce Department, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, pulled out amid a federal investigation into state contracting, and aides said they did not expect Mr. Obama to name a replacement until after Tuesday's inauguration. Similarly, Mr. Obama's first choice for director of the Central Intelligence Agency withdrew before being nominated, and the delay in picking Leon E. Panetta for the C.I.A. and Adm. Dennis C. Blair for director of national intelligence means neither will be confirmed in time for the inauguration. 
 The disclosure that Mr. Geithner paid $48,000 in delinquent taxes and interest, some only when he was about to be nominated, has slowed down that confirmation. Several Republicans have said they still support him, so he is still likely to be confirmed, but his hearing will not be held until the day after the inauguration, leaving the Treasury at least briefly in the hands of a caretaker. Obama aides said that would be Treasury Under Secretary Stuart Levey, a Bush appointee who was asked to stay on.
 While the president-elect and his aides have publicly fallen in line behind Mr. Geithner, privately a few Obama officials have started to express concern. Mr. Geithner's selection to collect the nation's taxes after failing to pay his own has become fodder for late-night comics. ''This needs to get done,'' one nervous Obama transition official said.
 Other nominees have been delayed as well. Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama's choice as transportation secretary, was supposed to have his hearing this week, but it was postponed because he did not turn information over to federal law enforcement officials until recently, leaving the F.B.I. scrambling to complete a background check, a transition official said. The check should be finished this week, the official said.
 The Senate Finance Committee has likewise not set a date for Mr. Daschle's hearing while aides review a wide range of financial documents, and a senior Republican committee official said the process would extend beyond the inauguration. ''We feel perfectly fine about the process and expect him to be confirmed,'' said a senior aide to Mr. Daschle, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the confirmation process.
 That means that Senate Democrats, who once hoped to beat Mr. Bush's record of having seven of his cabinet nominees confirmed by Inauguration Day, are no longer confident they can match that. Mrs. Clinton looks certain to be approved by then and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is being held over and does not require a new Senate vote. Janet Napolitano will probably be confirmed as secretary of homeland security by then, Senate aides said. But it was less certain how many others would be.

Dubious Moves
 Can't Sink Chief 
 By rights, Kenneth D. Lewis should lose his job as chief executive of Bank of America for tapping the government for a second round of financial support. His frenzied deal-making in recent years left the bank low on capital and destroyed $140 billion of shareholder value. Shareholders may certainly feel aggrieved that the architect of that strategy is still in the corner office. They may be hoping that the government demands his head in return for handing over more federal aid. They may be disappointed.
 Sure, Mr. Lewis can argue that he built a buffer of some $15 billion against future losses into last year's deal for the beleaguered mortgage lender Countrywide. And the ailing Merrill Lynch looked likely to follow Lehman Brothers into the abyss if he hadn't agreed to buy it in September. 
 Despite the carnage in the markets, though, Mr. Lewis offered a whopping 40 percent premium for Merrill's ''thundering herd'' of brokers. Perhaps he was emboldened by earlier deals in far calmer markets that seemed to work out. 
 But he hasn't stopped buying. Mr. Lewis has spent some $80 billion on acquisitions since the height of the bull market in 2006. He lavished $24 billion of increasingly precious cash on two of them in 2007 and increased his bank's outstanding shares by 60 percent to buy the rest.
 That's a much worse track record than rivals JPMorgan and Wells Fargo &#151; both have spent less, issued fewer shares and lost far less value since the start of 2006. Throw in Bank of America's own bragging that its 25 percent share of the United States credit and debit card markets gives it market intelligence before most of its rivals, and its decision to start removing some $20 billion of hedges against a market downturn in 2005, and Mr. Lewis's fate ought to be assured.
 The problem is that the Federal Reserve and Treasury might have egged Mr. Lewis on to act as a savior last year, especially with the Merrill deal -- although it's unlikely they would have insisted on such a fat premium. But if they did encourage Bank of America to take one for the team, it'll be much harder for them to demand his head now in return for throwing the bank a lifeline. 
 Bad Timing 
 HSBC doesn't need to raise huge amounts of capital, even if Morgan Stanley is insisting otherwise in an unfortunately timed note it released this week. But in a climate where you can never have too much capital, an injection of equity wouldn't hurt the bank. The snag is that HSBC may now have to struggle to correct an impression that it is desperate. 
 The lender avoided the need for a government bailout, unlike most of its peers. Its equity Tier 1 capital, a common measure of financial strength, is around 7.3 percent, more or less in line with rivals. But analysts at Morgan Stanley reckon the real figure is just 5.8 percent and have prescribed a $20 billion equity top-up, as well as a halving of HSBC's dividend. That has knocked over 14 percent off the bank's shares this week. 
 The case that the bank must rush to raise such an amount of capital is weak. Of the figures Morgan Stanley is bandying about, $11 billion is slated to pad out HSBC's holding company, which has been used as a piggy bank to recapitalize its subdivisions. That qualifies as ''nice-to-have,'' but not imperative. The same goes for a $6 billion injection of capital that Morgan Stanley says HSBC should put into its Hong Kong business.
 But Morgan Stanley is right that HSBC's capital ratio isn't all it seems. The bank benefits from some accounting treatments unavailable to rivals in other jurisdictions. Take assets marked ''available for sale.'' Under British rules, HSBC's Tier 1 capital isn't affected by write-downs in their value. Under German or Spanish rules, it would be. Morgan Stanley estimates that gives HSBC a $10 billion advantage over many other banks.
 The timing of the debate couldn't be worse for HSBC. Morgan Stanley's note emerged two days before the end of a British ban on short-selling financial stocks. As of Friday, those who think HSBC faces a capital shortage can vote with their feet. That may dash any hopes the bank had of waiting until its results in March, and raising capital from a position of share-price strength.

HEADLINE: Spirit of Bipartisanship Spreads to Consultants

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Could this be the start of the long-promised Barack Obama era of bipartisan peace, love and understanding?
 Well, perhaps not. But as Mr. Obama prepares to take office, there is one area of the political industry where partisan lines seem to be falling, and bipartisanship has become the rage: political consultants who are giving advice to corporations, nonprofits and advocacy groups trying to navigate a new Washington.
 Republican and Democratic firms are linking arms, creating unlikely marriages in a world that was once, for the most part, politically segregated. 
 This week alone, Steve Schmidt, the chief strategist for Senator John McCain's presidential campaign, and Chris Lehane, a former adviser to Al Gore and Bill Clinton, announced plans to create a consulting firm in California, while Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic strategist, joined forces with Alex Castellanos, who was the media adviser for Mitt Romney.
 The press secretary for Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign has also hooked up with the former chief of staff to the Senate Republican conference, while Mr. Romney's communications director joined what had once been the all-Democratic Glover Park Group.
 For Republicans, it is now a matter of trying to cling to influence at a time when the party is on the outs. For Democrats, creating firms with a bipartisan hue could be a way of currying favor with a president-elect who spent much of the year talking about ending partisan bickering in Washington -- and who on Tuesday night made a point of demonstrating that by having dinner with a group of conservative columnists at the home of George F. Will before gathering with liberal columnists the following day.
 By their nature, political consultants pride themselves on being able to track shifts in public mood and demand, and they suggested that in this era -- with a new president trying to manage an alarming economic crisis -- there just does not appear to be much appetite for the kind of red-and-blue attacks that have been their stock in trade.
 ''When I first started doing consulting, one of the things that really stood out in terms of people I met, the message I kept getting was people were not looking for partisanship,'' said Phil Singer, who was Mrs. Clinton's press secretary and recently joined up with Ron Bonjean, a Republican spokesman and strategist who has served on Capitol Hill and in the Bush administration. 
 ''When it comes to advising businesses and nonprofits and other organizations,'' Mr. Singer said, ''they don't want to be perceived as being immersed in the political fray, in the back and forth.'' 
 In nonelection years -- the ''off season'' for political consultants -- Democratic and Republican strategists have worked together on corporate accounts before, but the amount of teaming up now is striking, even to some of Washington's oldest hands. 
 ''I think we're seeing the end of the World War I, trench-warfare mentality,'' Mr. Castellanos said.
 He said the economic crisis, and the incoming administration's intention to build bipartisan support for more government, had made the kind of partisan approach that consultants once offered much less attractive to clients.
 ''Nothing unites the people of Earth like a threat from Mars,'' Mr. Castellanos said. 
 Mr. McMahon, who came to Washington as a member of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's staff and grew to become a hard-hitting political advertising specialist, said he was optimistic about a new era of cooperation.
 ''If we want to make our case as broadly appealing both to the public and to the policy makers who are going to ultimately decide what happens in America, isn't it better if you can have the left and the right coming together and working together and trying to reach some consensus in the middle?'' he said.
 The linking of Mr. Lehane and Mr. Schmidt in California is an alliance of consultants known for pressing some of the toughest kind of politics. Mr. Lehane said theirs was a specialized mission where bipartisanship was particularly valuable: working on voter initiatives and referendums.
 Mr. McMahon said he saw his partnership with Mr. Castellanos as a smart business move given how unpredictable political life is in Washington -- it seems a fair bet that Republicans will be back in power one day -- and one that is also in keeping with the example the new administration is trying to set.
 ''It happens to be that Democrats are in charge now, but that wasn't always the case and that won't always be the case,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''What you saw with the success of the Obama campaign from the beginning to the end was a desire on the part of voters to do politics and governing in a different way.''

HEADLINE: Intel Looks To Invest Despite A Drop-Off

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Despite watching its profits virtually vanish in the fourth quarter, Intel, the world's largest chip maker, remains committed to spending billions of dollars on new manufacturing facilities and attacking rivals in new markets.
 The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported a 90 percent drop in net income on Thursday, to $234 million, or 4 cents a share, for the fourth quarter. In the same period of 2007, it earned $2.3 billion, or 38 cents a share. Intel said the most recent quarter's results, which were in line with Wall Street's expectations, included a billion-dollar reduction in the carrying value of the company's investments in Clearwire. 
 Intel also reported a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue, to $8.2 billion.
 ''Intel has weathered difficult times in the past, and we know what needs to be done to drive our success moving forward,'' Paul S. Otellini, chief executive at Intel, said in a statement. 
 Intel's sales plunge -- among the worst in its history -- portends bad news for computer makers like Hewlett-Packard and Dell.
 Nevertheless, Intel says it intends to keep financing the development of cutting-edge chip-making facilities, saying capital spending will remain steady in 2009. In 2008, the company spent $5.2 billion on capital equipment. 
 ''I think it is an incredible advantage to be able to make these investments in this environment,'' said Stacy J. Smith, chief financial officer at Intel, in an interview. ''If others slow down, that just benefits us.''
 Auguste P. Richard, a chip analyst with Piper Jaffray, said Intel had ratcheted down the production of processors at its current chip manufacturing plants, known as fabs, but was continuing to spend money on building plants. 
 ''Intel is not going to let up on that, and no one else can keep up,'' Mr. Richard said. ''Intel's competitive advantage is their manufacturing and not design, and that's how they maintain profits and market share.''
 Intel has laid the groundwork for a fresh assault on the mobile device market with the Atom processor, which today goes into inexpensive laptops known as netbooks and which will eventually sit inside smartphones. In addition, Intel wants to play a larger role in the consumer electronics market, with chips for televisions and other gadgets, and to enter the high-end graphics processor market.
 Those forays put Intel up against competitors like Samsung and Texas Instruments. Intel is betting that it can gain an edge on these companies by shifting to a more advanced chip manufacturing process this year, which will allow it to make cheaper, less power-hungry products. 
 The plants to build those new products will consume the majority of Intel's capital spending in 2009. ''We are going to get there as fast as we possibly can,'' Mr. Smith said.
 The new facilities should also help Intel compete with more traditional rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. Both of those companies have forecast sharp declines in fourth-quarter revenue and are in the midst of restructuring their operations. A.M.D. has created a company to handle its chip-making needs so that it can focus on the design of products. Meanwhile, Nvidia recently laid off 6.5 percent of its work force and is trying to finance new products in the mobile and server markets. 
 It could be tough for the companies to navigate their transitions and keep up with Intel. 
 ''In this economy, it's difficult to run a company that is well positioned, let alone one with structural challenges,'' said Ross Seymore, a chip analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, in relation to A.M.D. ''I don't envy their position.''
 According to analysts following the PC industry, Intel and its peers are trying to cope with a pullback in orders from their channel partners and retailers that sell computers. Many of these companies were hurt by the credit crisis and were forced to reduce their inventory and curtail future orders.
 ''There is nothing going on right now,'' Mr. Richard said. ''This is as dark and deep as it goes, with companies not buying or selling anything.''
 Gartner, a technology research firm, said the global PC market grew last quarter at its slowest rate in six years, just 1.1 percent, in part because of a sharp drop-off in sales to customers in the United States. 
 Intel's results reflect the depth of the slump. In the last 25 years, Intel has faced a year-over-year revenue drop of this magnitude in the fourth quarter only twice -- during the dot-com bust in 2001 and in 1985. 
 To deal with waning demand, Intel will pull back on capacity at its existing factories and try to keep cutting costs elsewhere in the business. Citing economic uncertainty, Intel declined to provide a first-quarter revenue forecast, although it warned that gross profit margins would decline significantly. 
 Shares of Intel were up more than 1 percent during Thursday's trading, ending at $13.29.

HEADLINE: Bank of America to Receive $20 Billion More

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH, LOUISE STORY and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Kenneth D. Lewis gambled on bold acquisitions to build Bank of America into the nation's largest bank.
 But the need for fresh government support to grapple with the newly revealed losses at Merrill Lynch, the brokerage firm he snapped up in a rapid-fire arrangement at the height of the financial crisis in September, raises questions about whether the bank has gone a deal too far. 
 Two weeks after closing its purchase of Merrill Lynch at the urging of federal regulators, the government cemented a deal at midnight Thursday to supply Bank of America with a fresh $20 billion capital injection and absorb as much as $98.2 billion in losses on toxic assets, according to people involved in the transaction. 
 The bank had been pressing the government for help after it was surprised to learn that Merrill would be taking a fourth-quarter write-down of $15 billion to $20 billion, according to two people who have been briefed on the situation, in addition to Bank of America's rising consumer loan losses. 
 The second lifeline brings the government's total stake in Bank of America to $45 billion and makes it the bank's largest shareholder, with a stake of about 6 percent. 
 The program is modeled after a larger one engineered to stabilize Citigroup as its stock price plummeted in late November, but it appears to have had limited success. Under the terms, Bank of America will be responsible for the first $10 billion in losses on a pool of $118 billion in illiquid assets, including residential and commercial real estate and corporate loans, and that will remain on its balance sheet. 
 The Treasury Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will take on the next $10 billion in losses. The Fed will absorb 90 percent of any additional losses, with Bank of America responsible for the rest. 
 In exchange for the new support, Bank of America will give the government an additional $4 billion stake in preferred stock. It has also agreed to cut its quarterly dividend to a penny, from 32 cents, accept a loan-modification program and put more stringent restrictions on executive pay. 
 The F.D.I.C. announced separately that it would soon propose to extend its guarantee on supporting new consumer lending to 10 years, from 3 years.
 ''The U.S. government will continue to use all of our resources to preserve the strength of our banking institutions and promote the process of repair and recovery and to manage risks,'' regulators said.
 With losses mounting in the financial industry, other banks may eventually feel compelled to turn to the government for assistance, and the program could to used for other big banks. Taxpayers could end up guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of banks' toxic assets. 
 ''The financial services sector still needs more equity,'' said Frederick Cannon, the managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''TARP was announced in mid-September and most of the initial decisions were based on the state of the economy then. The economy has gotten a heck of a lot worse.'' 
 Government officials said that they did not have new money to allocate for this assistance, so they used funds that was already allocated from the $350 billion bailout fund for other banks or for future stabilization programs. The officials said that even though Citigroup's stock had tumbled since November, that bank's stock price might not be the best indicator of whether the program was working. 
 Bank of America's troubles are only adding to the worries. Its shares have fallen about 78 percent, far more sharply than those of banking rivals like J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo. Mr. Lewis had earned a reputation for taking big bets that helped transform NationsBank, a small lender, into a consumer powerhouse with bicoastal branches -- and was often accused of overpaying. It snapped up Bank of America and took on its name, then followed with flashy deals for FleetBoston Financial in 2003 and then the credit card giant MBNA in 2006. That was followed by US Trust and LaSalle Bank of Chicago a year later. 
 Last year, Mr. Lewis's bank also bought Countrywide Financial Corporation, the troubled mortgage giant that has come to symbolize many of the excesses of the subprime mortgage era. That made Bank of America the biggest player in every major financial service but wealth advice. 
 Even before the most recent deal with Merrill closed, troubles began to surface. At the time, shareholders liked the strategic fit of adding Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest brokerage firm, to the nation's biggest bank. Still, they worried that Mr. Lewis had paid a hefty premium -- or underestimated Merrill's losses -- in the merger stitched together over the mid-September weekend that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. 
 When the deal was announced, Mr. Lewis said that he had considered buying Merrill months earlier but was not comfortable with its mortgage exposure. John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said he had cleaned up much of his company's problems. ''We have been consistently cleaning up the balance sheet, repairing the damage that was done over the last few years,'' Mr. Thain said.
 Mr. Lewis praised Mr. Thain for decreasing risks at the firm and said that Merrill's capital levels were in good shape.
 As it turned out, more problems were lurking. In December, when executives at Merrill began tallying losses on its mortgage investments, they were found to exceed previous estimates. The write-downs will total between $15 billion and $20 billion, possibly its largest ever, according to two people who have been briefed on the situation, and include mortgage assets, commercial real estate and other credit investments.
 When it notified Bank of America of such gaping write-downs, the bank became fearful it would not have the capital to cover them. The revelations, which came just weeks before the merger was expected to close, prompted Bank of America to ask the government for additional help. 
 Shortly before Christmas, Bank of America told regulators that it might walk away from Merrill because of mounting losses at the brokerage. But the regulators, concerned Merrill might founder, urged Mr. Lewis to press ahead. Given the severity of the situation, government officials said they needed to take immediate action to avert a systemic risk. The officials agreed to another capital infusion and said they would guarantee assets belonging to both companies.
 Still, the Merrill deal has not been easy for Mr. Lewis to digest. Clashes from combining the two strong cultures of each firm have complicated the merger. Merrill Lynch's 16,000 brokers prided themselves on their loyalty to ''Mother Merrill.'' Analysts say Bank of America's managers are groomed like cogs in a giant money-making machine.
 Several members of Merrill's senior management team have left in recent weeks, including its president and brokerage chief. Scores of advisers at Merrill are disgruntled about small retention packages. And Bank of America has begun slashing Merrill employees, particularly at its investment bank. Mr. Lewis flew to New York this week to placate some bankers who were concerned about his approach, according to a person briefed on the meeting.
 ''He made a bet. He bought the retail broker operation, and in a normal environment that's a gold mine,'' said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The challenge that Bank of America has is, can they keep their hands off of the retail brokerage operation, because their history in terms of acquisitions isn't really perfect.''

HEADLINE: Senate Releases Second Portion of Bailout Fund

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama's economic agenda advanced rapidly in Congress on Thursday as the Senate voted to release the second half of the financial industry bailout fund and House Democrats unveiled an $825 billion fiscal recovery plan aimed at putting millions of unemployed Americans back to work. 
 The Senate action, by a vote of 52 to 42, spares Mr. Obama a messy legislative fight just as he takes office and gives him a $350 billion war chest to further stabilize the financial sector. The vote came amid renewed distress in the banking industry, including further deterioration of Citigroup and a pitch for more government aid by the Bank of America. 
 Mr. Obama had personally lobbied reluctant senators to release the money. His top economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, made three visits to the Capitol and sent two letters to reassure lawmakers that the program would be better managed. 
 In the most recent letter, delivered shortly before the vote, Mr. Summers promised to use $50 billion to $100 billion for ''a sweeping effort to address the foreclosure crisis.'' He promised tough oversight and clear tracking of how the money is used, and new restrictions on executive pay at firms that receive help. 
 The vote was an early test for Mr. Obama, in which 6 Republicans joined 46 Democrats to release the money and keep the new administration's agenda on track. 
 After personal entreaties from Mr. Obama, all but one of the seven Democratic freshmen senators voted to release the money, including Senators Mark Udall of Colorado and Tom Udall of New Mexico, who as House members twice voted against the original bailout bill. 
 In a statement, the president-elect applauded the outcome. 
 ''I know this wasn't an easy vote because of the frustration so many of us share about how the first half of this plan was implemented,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now my pledge is to change the way this plan is implemented and keep faith with the American taxpayer.'' 
 Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff who huddled with Republicans on Wednesday to make the case for the money, saw the outcome as the first major win for the new administration.
 ''Obviously we would have preferred something else,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''But this was the first play of the game, and we threw an 80-yard pass.''
 The House may still vote on the bailout money, but the point is moot because the law requires action by both chambers to block the funds. Instead, House Democrats said they could focus on their aggressive timetable for the $825 billion stimulus measure. 
 That package, developed in partnership with Mr. Obama, includes huge increases in spending on education, aid to states for Medicaid costs, temporary increases in jobless benefits and a vast array of public works projects to create jobs. 
 The stimulus plan is the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's early agenda and seeks to make good on some of his signature campaign promises, including an income tax cut for most Americans earning less than $200,000 a year. 
 Under the plan, individuals would receive up to $500 and families up to $1,000. The money would be delivered through paychecks as a reduction in Social Security withholdings, and is intended to bolster consumer spending by giving a small lift to household pocketbooks. 
 Some of the other major components of the plan include $87 billion for a temporary increase in aid to states for Medicaid costs; $79 billion in aid to local school districts and public colleges to prevent cutbacks; $90 billion in infrastructure spending, and $54 billion to encourage energy production from renewable sources. 
 The Senate is developing its own version of the stimulus bill, and intense haggling is expected over the next few weeks. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, has said the bill must pass by mid-February or she will cancel the Presidents' Day recess. 
 The House version, introduced by the Appropriations Committee chairman, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, contains the broad parameters expected in the final product: roughly $550 billion in spending and $275 billion in tax cuts over two years. The House is expected to vote on the bill the week of Jan 26. 
 Mr. Obey, at a news conference, said that without the recovery plan, Americans would face a dire recession and unemployment of 12 percent. He said that even such a huge stimulus might not be enough to stabilize the economy.
 ''You have to look at this bill as not a salvation for the economy by any means,'' he said, sitting at his desk in the Capitol with a window behind him overlooking the Washington Monument. ''It is simply the largest effort by any legislative body on the planet to try to take government action to prevent economic catastrophe, and even that may be insufficient.'' 
 Mr. Obama is expected to travel to hard-hit Ohio on Friday to trumpet aspects of the plan, particularly the renewable energy provisions and the aid for struggling Americans, including a further extension of jobless benefits, new health insurance subsidies for the unemployed and an increase in food stamps. 
 Although Mr. Obama promised to collaborate with Republicans and consider all ideas, the draft proposal put forward emphasized mostly Democratic principles of helping middle-class workers with tax relief and helping the unemployed pay health care costs. 
 Republican leaders quickly criticized the plan. 
 ''This is the first time Republicans and the American people have seen any specifics on the proposal Congressional Democrats intend to pass, and what we're seeing is disappointing,'' the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said in a statement. ''The plan released this morning by Congressional Democrats was developed with no Republican input and appears to be grounded in the flawed notion that we can simply borrow and spend our way back to prosperity.''
 Mr. Boehner and other Republicans are planning to push for deeper and more permanent tax cuts that they say will do a better job of encouraging economic growth.
 Among lawmakers in both parties, there has been substantial outrage on Capitol Hill over the Bush administration's management of the bailout program. Some senators said the new worries over Citigroup and Bank of America had influenced their vote. 
 Many Republicans said they were angered that the administration had used the rescue money to help General Motors and Chrysler, and they demanded assurances from the Obama administration that it would not similarly aid individual industries.
 In urging senators to release the money, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, gave an impassioned speech, focused on Mr. Obama. ''We must give our new president every tool to try to fix this economy,'' Mr. Reid said. 
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who voted against releasing the money, said he appreciated Mr. Obama's assurances that the bailout program would be used to stabilize the financial system. But Mr. McConnell said, ''the incoming administration also indicated it would use the money in ways I cannot support.''
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who supported the original bailout, voted against releasing the money. 
 Mr. Obama, in a meeting with the editorial board of The Washington Post, said that he would convene a ''fiscal responsibility summit'' in February to focus on solving long-term problems with the economy, including the rising costs of Social Security and Medicare. 
 At his news conference, Mr. Obey said that the bill would create a board to oversee how the stimulus money was being spent and that money allocated under the recovery bill would be tracked on a new Web site.

HEADLINE: Priority No. 1: Close Guantanamo

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Obama's Closing of Guantanamo May Take a Year'' (front page, Jan. 13):
 It is essential for the future of the United States that one of the first acts of President-elect Barack Obama after his inauguration be the repudiation of the shameful and immoral policies of secret and indefinite detention beyond the reach of civilized recourse to legal protections. 
 These protections are not only fundamental to the founding of the United States, but are also proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Conventions. 
 Guantanamo is symbolic of the reprehensible detention policies of the Bush administration, so a symbolic executive order to close it is appropriate. But it must not stop there. To close Guantanamo but expand the American prison at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan or similar detention facilities would be a cynical sham and not ''change we can believe in.''
 Robert Rankin Austin, Tex., Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The problem with the prison at Guantanamo Bay is not the location (other than being a continuing affront to Cuba), but the indefinite delay of prosecution in violation of established principles of law. 
 Scattering prisoners in other countries will not resolve the problem. 
 If we are a society of laws, bring the prisoners to the United States for trial in our federal court system, establish a short time period for the decision to be made whether to prosecute, and return those not prosecuted to their countries.
 Tom Miller Hanoi, Vietnam, Jan. 13, 2009
 The writer is general counsel of Global Exchange, a human rights organization.
 To the Editor:
 Like many who voted for President-elect Barack Obama, I have been alternately amused and astounded at reports of his failures even before he has been sworn in. The report that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay may take up to a year may be yet another story of a projected failure even before the man becomes president. 
 That said, if closing Guantanamo does take a year, I will be dismayed. It is not as if the Pentagon leadership will, on Jan. 21, be shocked to learn of Mr. Obama's decision to close the prison. Surely contingency plans have been drafted for such an eventuality. 
 The article observes that decisions must be made on where and how to relocate selected detainees outside the United States and how to try others in the United States. This may be true, but it is imperative that these prisoners be relocated to civil or military facilities in the United States. 
 After Jan. 20, there will be no reason to employ the sort of extralegal (illegal) methods represented by the very existence of Guantanamo Bay.
 At the same time, Mr. Obama should also provide verifiable assurances that all secret American-run or American-supported prisons worldwide have been closed.
 Matt Meyer Marlborough, N.H., Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President-elect Barack Obama is learning that national security is a far more complex and difficult issue than many are willing to acknowledge. 
 It's one thing to demand a ''justice recovery package,'' as does Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. It's another to prevent detainees at Guantanamo from endangering American citizens and soldiers, and yet another to prevent a terrorist attack. 
 Closing Gitmo, while significant, is just one of several issues that Mr. Obama must address as he assumes the heavy burden of keeping our country safe.
 Andrea Economos Scarsdale, N.Y., Jan. 13, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President-elect Barack Obama's incoming administration should promptly close Guantanamo and stop the continuing injustice of incarcerating men in violation of our rule of law.
 More than 240 prisoners remain at Guantanamo Bay. Last month Vice President Dick Cheney said that ''what we have left is the hard core.'' That is simply not true. 
 There are still scores of innocent men languishing at Guantanamo. Only a handful of the prisoners have been charged with anything. Many have been cleared for release. All of these men deserve the fair and ''prompt'' habeas corpus hearings the Supreme Court promised them last June 12. 
 My colleagues and I have represented 19 men at Guantanamo. Thirteen were released -- all after spending more than four years under exceedingly harsh conditions. None of our remaining six clients belong there. 
 There is no reason that closing Guantanamo should take six months to a year. Mr. Obama's administration should take immediate steps to prosecute the few men who deserve to be prosecuted, and to release the prisoners who never should have been there for one day -- let alone for seven years now.

HEADLINE: Sharp Trade Contraction Knows No Borders

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
WORLD trade, a booming source of growth for most of the last five years, is suddenly shriveling, with exports declining in almost every country as the world endures a recession. 
 The decline in trade, which began last summer, accelerated after mid-September, when Lehman Brothers failed. In the aftermath, credit became harder to obtain for importers and confidence waned among would-be buyers of many products.
 The fact that exports are down in almost every country shows both the international nature of the recession and the fact that it has been impossible for any country to export its way out of trouble. Nonetheless, there may be protectionist efforts in a number of countries this year, aimed at improving each country's trade position at the expense of others.
 China, the largest exporter in the world, reported this week that its December exports of $105.7 billion were down 3 percent from the same month in 2007, after a 2 percent decline in November. Before that, China's official export figures showed double-digit percentage gains in every month since March 2002.
 The United States, the second-largest exporter, said its November exports of $98.1 billion were down 4 percent compared with a year earlier. Germany, the third-leading exporter, reported its exports were off 21 percent, to $96.1 billion.
 For the United States, that was the first year-over-year drop in exports since 2003. For Germany, it was the largest year-over-year decline since 1993.
 The figures are all in dollars and are seasonally adjusted. They are not adjusted for inflation, and some of the decline for some countries reflects lower prices for many commodities, including oil, rather than decreasing quantities of exports.
 None of the eight major exporters shown in the accompanying graphic, however, have a significant proportion of their exports in oil. The declines in exports reflect a sudden weakening of orders.
 We were able to obtain November trade figures for 43 countries. That does not include the entire world, because some countries do not report trade in dollars and others, among them Italy, Spain and Russia, have not yet reported November figures. Figures for most of the major oil exporters were not available.
 Of those 43, only three reported higher exports in November than a year earlier. They were Australia, Brazil and Lithuania. The only one of those to have reported December numbers, Brazil, showed a decline that month.
 Over all, the total reported exports from those 43 countries peaked in July, at $1.03 trillion. By November, the figure was down 26 percent, to $766 billion. Since the figures are seasonally adjusted, the monthly figures should be comparable.
 Some of the worst-hit exporters have heavy exposure to industries that are suffering. Taiwan, whose December exports were down 42 percent, has built a strong business in computer components. Germany is a major exporter of both cars and machine tools; those tools are no longer in demand as factory construction activity ebbs. South Korea, whose December exports were down 17 percent compared with a year earlier, also has been a substantial exporter of cars and technology products.

HEADLINE: Global Music Sales Fell 7% in '08 as CDs Lost Favor

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Music sales worldwide fell by about 7 percent last year as another sizable jump in digital sales failed to make up for a deepening decline in the compact disc market, according to John Kennedy, chief executive of the industry's main international trade group.
 Revenue from music sold over the Internet, via mobile phones and in other digital forms, rose by 25 percent last year, to $3.7 billion, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry said in a report set for publication Friday. Digital sales accounted for 20 percent of the industry's revenue, up from 15 percent a year earlier. 
 But a nosedive in sales of CDs in the United States, aggravated by the economic downturn and widespread piracy, took its toll in the fourth quarter of the year, when the industry typically posts its strongest sales. Meanwhile, growth in downloads from online music stores like Apple's iTunes has slowed. 
 That is hastening the music industry's push to develop new business models for digital music, some of which emulate the way consumers prefer to acquire music -- that is, free of charge. Many of these services are being pioneered in Europe, where music companies have found it particularly hard to persuade music pirates to kick the habit.
 ''We continue to reinvent how we do business,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''The variety of models gives everybody something that works for them. And that works for us.''
 Major record labels have joined with Nokia, the maker of cellphones, to provide free, unlimited music downloads in Britain. The company has said that it plans to introduce the service in other markets this year. Several European broadband providers, including TDC in Denmark, are offering customers unlimited listening to millions of songs.
 ''The industry has shifted to Plan B,'' said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''The record companies have realized that the only way they can fight free is with free itself.''
 The major music companies -- Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and EMI -- are also looking to monetize music in other new ways, including a licensing deal with the social network MySpace that generates revenue from advertising. The music companies are also earning hundreds of millions of dollars by licensing their music for YouTube, Google's online video site.
 The industry has become more willing to experiment as growth in digital sales of individual tracks has slowed. The biggest online music seller, iTunes, sold roughly the same number of tracks globally in the second half of last year as it did in the first half; in previous years it had experienced a big second-half jump.
 Apple recently revamped iTunes by allowing variable pricing of songs, a long-standing request from the music companies. In return, the music companies agreed to sell the songs without protection against copying.
 With physical sales of CDs falling 20 percent last year in the United States, according to the market research firm Nielsen, Apple became the biggest music retailer in the United States. Over all, 39 percent of United States music sales last year were digital, according to the industry federation, and the United States accounted for 50 percent of the global digital market.
 ''So far, digital music has had a hard time moving beyond the big iPod markets'' of the United States and, to a lesser extent, Britain, said Dan Cryan, an analyst at Screen Digest, a research firm. ''The industry needs every alternative model they can get.''
 In one sign of nascent international diversification in the digital business, two of the 10 top digital tracks of 2008 were Japanese. ''Sobaniirune,'' by Thelma Aoyama, and ''Kiseki,'' by GReeeeN, sold nearly 15 million digital copies, primarily for mobile phones, the dominant form of digital music player in Japan.
 Some markets that lagged behind the United States in digital growth accelerated last year. Digital sales rose 45 percent in Britain and 49 percent in France, for example, according to the federation.
 Both of those countries have moved to crack down on piracy. Under a French plan that is working its way through Parliament, the Internet connections of persistent illegal downloaders would be cut off. In Britain, leading Internet providers have agreed to send warning letters to pirates.
 Still, the federation estimates that 95 percent of the music downloaded globally is pirated, a percentage that was unchanged from a year earlier.
 ''We certainly don't claim that we have won any major battles, much less the war,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''People have to be forced to buy rather than take it free. This isn't going to happen of their own accord.''

HEADLINE: Outsourced Chores Come Back Home

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL; Caitlin Kelly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A few months ago, as her family's income fell, Laura French Spada, a real estate agent in Glen Rock, N.J., began dyeing her hair at home and washing the family cars herself. Her husband, Mark, started learning how to do electrical repairs.
Susan Todoroff, a personal trainer in Ann Arbor, Mich., has begun brewing espressos at home and cutting her hair and cleaning her house herself. And Tamar A. Zaidenweber, a health care market researcher in Astoria, Queens, is spending more time walking her dog instead of taking it to day care each week.
All of these consumers could praise themselves for their newfound frugality in the midst of an economic downturn. But every step they take toward self-reliance -- each shrub they prune themselves, each cupcake they bake from scratch -- hurts the people and small businesses that have long provided these services professionally.
These small, service-oriented businesses are run in storefronts on urban streets and in suburban strip malls, or sometimes just out of pickup trucks. Responsible for roughly 18 million jobs nationwide, according to 2006 Census Bureau data, these companies have long been seen as engines of America's economic growth. Yet after years of explosive expansion, many beauty salons, dry cleaners, landscapers, dog walkers, nanny services and restaurants experienced slower sales growth or even decline in the final months of 2008. 
Their services are suddenly, and painfully, being perceived as nonessential.
The question now for these businesses is whether demand will stabilize or, eventually, drop enough to force them to close. And the answer may depend on whether consumers' new penchant for self-service is temporary or permanent.
After all, as incomes rose and gender roles changed over the last 50 years, families have become accustomed to outsourcing more and more of their household chores. No longer was it just the very rich who had ''servants,'' said Jan de Vries, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley.
''Household members, particularly women, have been working more in the market,'' said Mr. de Vries. ''They have had less time and higher money income, and they have been spending a lot of that money income on services they once provided themselves.''
Still, he said, even before the recession, some families had already cited moral reasons for reverting to domestic self-sufficiency, to those good old days when families grew their own food and burped their own babies.
''Families have been creating a discussion over the past decade about value-driven concerns that are now being reinforced by forces in the economy,'' he said. As a result of this confluence of moral and financial incentives, ''The way households function 20 years from now will probably be sort of surprising to us.''
Indeed, after decades of spendthrift subcontracting, many consumers now say they view such specialist services as indulgences rather than necessities.
''A lot of the way we'd been living was all an illusion, a fantasy,'' said Ms. Spada, who has also been cooking more and bathing the family dog instead of going to the groomer. ''We've been asking ourselves: Can we replicate some of those specialized services, which normally we would outsource, ourselves?''
Even as Americans cut back on restaurant dining, pet care services, professional hair and nail services, house cleaners and landscapers, companies producing some of the do-it-yourself products are seeing higher sales.
According to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm in Chicago, sales of products used in home manicures, home cooking and home medical treatments, among others, have experienced healthy growth in the last year. Dollar sales of cold-allergy-sinus tablets, for example, increased 17.2 percent in 2008. Meanwhile, according to Sageworks, a company that tracks sales at privately held businesses, revenue at physicians' offices fell by 0.06 percent.
''They're reducing doctor visits, and trying to treat themselves at home,'' says Thom Blischok, president of global innovation and consulting at Information Resources.
Big-box stores that sell these products have been capitalizing on the return to a self-service mentality. Target, for example, recently began its ''New Day'' marketing campaign, which glorifies the family-friendly, do-it-yourself alternatives to activities households used to outsource. Against upbeat lyrics about how things are ''getting better every single day,'' the ads show dismal economic headlines, followed by scenes of a father buzzing the hair of his smiling sons (''the new barber shop'') and a child eagerly eyeing his mother's cookie-filled oven (''the new bakery'').
At the same time, the service providers have been hurting.
''From the moment that the stock market collapsed and the TARP was being talked about, in September, it was like someone turned the switch off for nanny demand,'' said Steve Lampert, the president of eNannySource.com, making a reference to the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Family subscriptions to eNannySource.com, a national nanny placement company based in West Hills, Calif., are down to 150,000, about a third of the site's peak in 2007, he said.
James Erath, owner of Puppy Love & Kitty Kat in Manhattan, said, ''Business is definitely down, about 25 or 50 percent down.'' He has been offering steep discounts on grooming to attract customers who might bathe their pets at home.
Similarly, Rhonda Coop-Piraino, a hair stylist in Dallas, said about 10 percent of her clients had started coloring their hair at home to save money. Many of these clients, she said, return to her salon for color correction when their home kits disappoint.
''They do come in sometimes with some pretty orange hair,'' she said. ''I have a hard time charging the same amount I once charged for color correction, though. I have clients who have been with me for so many years, and it's hard for me to charge them $200 in this economy.''
Like Ms. Coop-Piraino's clients, some consumers say that doing things for themselves has not been as easy as they thought.
After letting their maid go last October, Chris DeCarlo said he and his partner, Chris Toland, realized they had a lot to learn about keeping their Manhattan apartment tidy. Their biggest challenge has been laundry.
''No mishaps yet,'' said Mr. DeCarlo, a Web site designer, ''but my partner is proud to report that somebody in our laundry room who was watching him struggle felt the need to intervene and show him the proper way to fold a fitted sheet.''
And there are some services that consumers now have trouble duplicating themselves because of technological advances.
When it comes to cars, for example, consumers might be able to refresh their memories about how to change a car's oil -- and some mechanics report a rise in such self-service. Faisal Akram, the owner of service stations in Irvington, Tarrytown and Cortlandt Manor, all in New York, said that for the first time in recent memory customers were bringing in waste oil from home.
But beyond oil changes, there is little most car owners can do themselves because automobiles have become so sophisticated.
Aaron Clements, the owner of C & C Automotive and host of a car-repair radio show in Augusta, Ga., said that in recent months twice as many customers had been calling and asking for advice on how to service their cars themselves. But usually, once they learn what equipment, training and effort would be necessary for self-service, he said, they opt to take the car to a shop.
''Two cars ago, I was able to rebuild the entire engine,'' said Vicki Robin, the co-author of ''Your Money or Your Life,'' a book praising the financial virtues of self-service. ''But back then a car was a car. Now a car is a computer with wheels.''
As their former nannies, stylists, landscapers, dry cleaners and maids languish, consumers report mixed feelings. They say they sometimes feel guilty about the ripple effects their penny-pinching is having on the livelihoods of others, but at the same time they feel unexpectedly empowered by their rediscovered self-reliance.
Many say that even when their financial worries abate, they will probably remain self-service converts.
''After doing it yourself, it's like, 'Why was I ever spending $200 to pay someone else to do it for me?' '' said Ms. Zaidenweber, who recently dyed her hair for the first time from an $8 home coloring kit. ''It was kind of fun, even if it didn't turn out exactly as I expected, and even it took a couple tries to get it done right.''

HEADLINE: The Popular Newsweekly Becomes a Lonely Category

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
And then there was one.
Not long ago, three truly mass-market newsmagazines came out every week to tell Americans about world and national events, and it was a hugely lucrative business. Media empires were built on the idea.
But with readers and ads melting away, and more media outlets available to get the same information faster, U.S. News & World Report took itself out of that competition in 2008, and Newsweek may be poised to step back from it this year, leaving Time as the one playing something closest to the traditional newsweekly game, and making money at it.
But in fact, the entire category, Time included, has already transformed itself. The business of telling people what happened in the last week is just about gone, in favor of telling them how to think about the news -- much like a rising competitor, The Economist -- and the magazines resemble one another less, each having chosen a distinct direction.
People have asked for a generation whether newsweeklies would survive -- but that is a more pressing question than ever, as the recession pummels the magazine industry. Magazine advertising pages fell 11.7 percent in 2008, and the categories that newsmagazines relied on most heavily -- cars, pharmaceuticals and financial services -- posted much steeper declines. Industry analysts predict that 2009 will be worse. 
But for now, the answer may be that newsweeklies are already gone, having evolved into something else.
''We're not in the business of telling people the news,'' said Richard Stengel, managing editor of Time, a product of Time Warner's Time Inc. division. ''News has become a commodity. They already know the news.''
Among the big three, only Time seems content where it is. While U.S. News and Newsweek struggle financially, Time generated a profit of near $50 million in 2008, in part by sharply cutting costs, according to Time Inc. executives who are privy to the finances but who asked to remain anonymous to discuss data that was not made public.
Time and Newsweek each had about a third fewer ad pages in 2008 than they did in 2004, but Time sold more pages, and at higher prices, according to media buyers. As part of a much larger chain, it has advantages over its competitors in combining ad sales efforts and back-office costs with other magazines.
Unable to compete with the immediacy of television, cable and then the Internet, newsmagazines have been moving for decades in the direction of analysis, commentary and news-related feature articles. That trend has accelerated in recent years, driven by financial pressures. The magazines' editorial staffs are about half as big as they were in the 1990s, and they have shuttered many of the bureaus they once had around the world.
They still produce some deep, original reporting. But these days, they are more likely to offer a comprehensive survey of a subject to present an argument or offer a prescription -- like Newsweek's recent cover article on why President-elect Barack Obama may come to embrace Vice President Dick Cheney's view of executive power, or Time's on how a trillion-dollar stimulus package should be spent.
''Time and Newsweek have definitely become more about views,'' said Victor Navasky, a journalism professor at Columbia University, and a former publisher and editor of The Nation. And as a strategy, he said, ''I think that makes sense.''
''I don't see the audience going down, so the question is how much of it will continue to be on paper versus online,'' he added. ''And no one can say yet.''
Newsweek, owned by The Washington Post Company, is planning a major overhaul this year. It has not made its new vision public, but executives have said it will strive to be a ''thought leader,'' competing more with The Economist than with Time -- in other words, a big stride in the direction it was already headed. The strategy includes a major reduction in circulation and operating costs and a focus on an elite audience to attract advertisers.
''I think a weekly magazine is a standing dinner date, or the fourth person in your bridge game,'' said Jon Meacham, editor of Newsweek. ''Sometimes they're the most delightful person in the world, sometimes they get drunk and throw up on you. But enough times in a year, when something happens, that's the first place you want to go to hear what they have to say.''
To that end, Newsweek has bet heavily on the writing of name-brand journalists, familiar presences on television as well as in print, like Fareed Zakaria, Mr. Meacham and Christopher Hitchens.
Time has done some of the same, with writers like Joe Klein and Michael Kinsley, but it has not staked its identity on those stars to the same extent. (The Economist represents the opposite extreme; its writers' names do not appear with their articles.) Playing catch-up on TV exposure, Mr. Stengel said Time was talking with another Time Warner property, CNN, about creating a Time program.
Newsweek has tried harder to be controversial; its cover article in December, ''The Religious Case for Gay Marriage,'' generated hundreds of thousands of e-mail messages, and leading bloggers weighed in on it for several days.
But it can be tough to stand out in the crowded field of magazines offering opinion, analysis and well-known writers. As a weekly, Newsweek can be more topical than monthlies like The Atlantic, but it remains to be seen if the new strategy will work.
Each issue of Time still includes several pages in the front of the magazine with an overview of the week's events. Newsweek and The Economist offer much less of that.
''That kind of being all things to all people is culturally tough for Time and Newsweek to get away from, because that is what they were,'' said Steven Kotok, general manager of The Week, another kind of newsweekly. ''Personally, I think they're improving their products with the directions they're going.''
Last year, U.S. News, the perennial third-place competitor owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, became as much about consumer advice and ranking products and services as about news. It went from publishing weekly to biweekly, and then announced that it would become a monthly and lowered its rate base -- the circulation promised to advertisers -- to 1.5 million, from 2 million.
It does not disclose financial information, but executives at other magazine companies say U.S. News loses money.
Newsweek also loses money, the Post Company has acknowledged, though it has not said how much. Through the first nine months of last year, the company's magazine division -- Newsweek and a group of smaller properties -- reported an operating loss of $27 million on $176 million in revenue.
Two British-owned upstarts have cut into the audience for the domestic newsmagazines. The Economist has United States circulation approaching 800,000, a number that has roughly doubled in seven years. Its ad pages actually rose last year, and it charges premium prices to both readers and advertisers.
The Week, which began publishing in this country in 2003 and has circulation over 500,000, has taken a radically different approach. It has an editorial staff of just 15, and almost all of its content consists of greatly condensed versions of news and opinion pieces that have appeared in other publications -- material it does not pay for.
At Time and Newsweek, the traditional competition for circulation has essentially ended. Newsweek dropped its rate base to 2.6 million, from 3.1 million a year ago, and people briefed on its plans said it was likely to go below 2 million by next year. Time lowered its rate base two years ago, to 3.25 million, from 4 million, and is standing pat at that level.
The newsweeklies have cut back sharply on spending for advertising and telemarketing to chase new readers -- customers they were able to win over only by charging steadily less for subscriptions.
Still, Time's leaders insisted that despite the trends around them, the current circulation was sustainable.
''The future of a mass, general-interest newsmagazine is still a very good proposition,'' Mr. Stengel said. But, he added, there may not be room for more than one.

HEADLINE: In Search of One Bold Stroke to Save the Banks

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, it's deja vu all over again. 
 Wasn't it just four months ago that the government was racing to save the American International Group, forcing the sale of weak banks and writing huge checks to stabilize the teetering banking system? The worst was over -- or so we were given to believe.
 It sure hasn't worked out that way. In November, not long after it was handed $25 billion in new capital, Citigroup was back for more -- another $20 billion in bailout money and a government backstop of more than $300 billion in potential losses. This week, alas, it's Bank of America's turn. It came crawling back because of the huge write-down of its shiny new toy, Merrill Lynch. It got another $20 billion and a backstop against losses of $118 billion in troubled assets. There are rumors that Wells Fargo might also need more capital. 
 When is it going to end? Because of declining asset values, the original bailout money has largely disappeared. ''It's like putting money in a pothole that keeps getting bigger,'' said Daniel Alpert, the managing partner at Westwood Capital. And it's not over yet. Goldman Sachs says the world banking system has absorbed about $1 trillion in losses -- but there is likely to be another $1.1 trillion yet to go.
 The response has got to stop being so haphazard. Think about it: Citigroup is slimming down. Bank of America is bulking up. The government is essentially backing both approaches. It makes no sense. 
 I started wondering if there is a better approach -- something that doesn't feel like plugging holes in a leaky dike. Perhaps this new idea being discussed in Washington of creating a government bank to buy up toxic assets might do the trick. It turns out I'm not the only one who's been asking this question lately. 
 ''I don't want to have to do any more of these one-offs,'' said Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in an interview on Friday. ''Nobody does.'' She was referring to the Bank of America deal, which had been completed just days before. But she could just as well have been talking about the Bush administration's entire approach to the financial crisis.
 Think back to last September. After the A.I.G. rescue -- which of course followed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac takeovers, the Merrill Lynch sale to Bank of America and the disastrous Lehman bankruptcy -- Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. concluded that they needed to find a systemic approach to fixing the huge problems in the banking system. They came up with the $700 billion bailout bill.
 Do you remember the original idea for the TARP money? The government was going to use funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to buy up bad assets from banks and other institutions, thus taking them off the balance sheets and keeping them from dragging down the institutions. But by the time TARP became law, two things had become clear. The first was that nobody in Washington -- or on Wall Street, for that matter -- had a clear idea of how to value the toxic assets the government was proposing to buy. And second, the banking system had deteriorated so badly that most of that first $350 billion had to be shoveled into the banking system as recapitalizations. In addition, Ms. Bair and others forced the sale of insolvent institutions like Washington Mutual and Wachovia to healthier banks. 
 That initial recapitalization was necessary. Without that government-financed capital, many more banks would have been insolvent, or would have been hoarding capital, fearing future asset write-downs. But the underlying problem has never gone away. The toxic assets are still on the books. Banks still don't really know what they are worth, so they continue to be written down in piecemeal fashion. And now, with the recession getting worse by the day, other assets, like commercial real estate and credit card loans, are going south as well. ''It's a rolling problem that gets worse as conditions worsen,'' the banking consultant Bert Ely said.
 (A quick reminder for readers who wonder why the banks shouldn't be allowed to go bankrupt, like any other company that made the kinds of mistakes banks made. The answer is that the banking system is the engine of the economy; if banks stop functioning, economic activity will grind to a halt. Indeed, at least some of the pain we are going through now is the result of the banking system's not functioning properly.)
 The key point here is that any systemic solution has to deal with the bad assets, once and for all. They need to be properly valued and they need to be isolated. ''How do you know how big the hole is on the balance sheet of Citi until you have a decent valuation?'' asks the Princeton economist Alan Blinder. That is the primary reason the banking system can't attract private capital and has to rely on the government -- no prospective investor has any idea how deep the hole is. That will only start to become clear when these assets are either written down to zero (unlikely) or start trading again.
 The second point is that the next round of recapitalization -- and it now appears the next $350 billion of TARP money is going to be used primarily for that purpose -- needs to encompass the entire banking system, and needs to be truly enormous. Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., and a well-known blogger on banking issues, says he believes that it will take $1 trillion to really do the trick -- money, presumably, the government will get back once the banking system is healthy again, and private capital comes in to replace the government's capital. 
 ''It's not rocket science,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''When you do a recap, you need overkill. But then, you also have to take the bad assets off the books.'' In the recent deals it cut with Citi and Bank of America, the government tried to ''ring-fence'' bad assets -- that's its phrase, not mine -- by agreeing to absorb losses on securities that have been identified as toxic. But that is still a piecemeal, one-bank-at-a-time approach.
 Mr. Blinder, a former Fed governor, told me that he thought the government should be thinking about the entire problem differently: ''It should go market to market instead of institution to institution.'' He pointed to actions by the Federal Reserve as a possible model: it has revived the commercial paper market by creating a commercial paper funding facility -- and has done the same with several other important debt markets. In effect, it is guaranteeing the smooth functioning of those markets. And that approach has worked.
 As it turns out, Ms. Bair -- who, thankfully, will remain the head of the F.D.I.C. in the new administration -- has been thinking along the same lines. She, Mr. Bernanke and Treasury officials have begun talking about a new kind of bank, one that would be created and capitalized by the federal government, and whose sole purpose would be to buy up bad assets. Instead of ring-fencing bad assets one bank at a time, it would warehouse them in one place, much the same way the Resolution Trust Corporation did for real estate assets during the savings and loan crisis. 
 Would the sale of these assets cause further write-downs? Of course. That is why you would need to throw more capital into the banks as part of a systemic solution. But at least you would finally know how deep the hole is. ''You would have to mark the assets at the price they were selling for,'' Ms. Bair told me. ''I think that is an advantage.'' At long last, there would be some certainty. Private capital won't return to the banking system until that happens.
 ''The only rub in the ointment is back to the original problem: How do you determine the market price?'' said Josh Rosner, a managing director of the research firm Graham Fisher. We avoided dealing with the issue in September; this time, we need to face it squarely. Senator Charles E. Schumer also worries about the total cost. ''I'm hearing $1 trillion,'' he told me. ''That seems low.'' But, he added, ''if they can adequately answer that question, the idea has a lot of appeal, both on Capitol Hill and, I think, in the financial markets.''
 In past financial crises, it has often been the bold and brilliant stroke that has restored confidence and revived the financial system. During the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, the government actually created a new currency. During the Latin American crisis of the late 1980s, the United States government created so-called Brady bonds, which cleverly allowed banks to get their Latin American debt off their balance sheets by turning it into tradable instruments. 
 And here we are again, in need of bold action and strategic thinking and the restoration of confidence. Inauguration Day can't come a moment too soon.

 CORRECTION:
The Talking Business column on Jan. 17, about continuing federal efforts to stabilize the financial system, referred incorrectly to the financial status of Washington Mutual Bank at the time of its sale to JPMorgan Chase. The bank was put into receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in September after a bank run raised questions about its ability to remain solvent, and was subsequently sold. At the time of its seizure and sale, however, it was adequately capitalized by Office of Thrift Supervision standards -- it was not insolvent. (The error was repeated in the Talking Business column in Business Day on Jan. 24.)

HEADLINE: But Is Madoff Not So Good for the Jews? Discuss Among Yourselves

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
Among some Orthodox Jews, one response to a member of the faith who egregiously violates their religion's fundamental values and beliefs is to rend clothes and treat the transgressor as if he were dead -- sitting shiva, or mourning, for him.
 For the more secular there is a different response: convene a panel discussion.
 Thursday night at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in Manhattan, it was Option 2: the Ivy League professors Simon Schama and Michael Walzer and the Wall Street powerbrokers Mort Zuckerman, Michael Steinhardt and William Ackman gathered to discuss ''Madoff: A Jewish Reckoning.'' 
 Or, as the program asked, ''Where did this man come from?'' 
 Seventeen-degree weather, airport-style security and a mandatory coat-check queue longer than the Rockettes chorus line did not deter an overflow crowd from attending an effort to shed light on Bernard L. Madoff, the man said to have bilked scores of Jewish friends and philanthropies out of billions of dollars. 
 Mr. Zuckerman, the chairman of Boston Properties, saw $30 million of his charitable contributions evaporate in a Madoff enterprise. He started off the evening by declaring that he objected to the discussion's premise: that somehow Jews should have to account for ''a sociopath.'' 
 Kenneth Lay of the Enron Corporation was not referred to as a ''prominent Protestant energy fraudster,'' he noted, nor is Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois referred to as a ''prominent Serbian-American politician.''
 Then why are you here, an audience member asked.
 ''I am here to disagree with the essence of the theme, 'A Jewish Reckoning,' '' he said. ''I do not accept this at all as a Jewish thing.''
 While a public event, the gathering retained the feel of a family affair: lots of hugs, good-natured joshing and sharp, unexplained comments that implied subterranean tensions.
 ''YIVO doesn't have a dime invested with Madoff,'' said Martin Peretz, the panel's moderator, who is the editor in chief of The New Republic and the chairman of YIVO's board of overseers.
 Mr. Ackman, chief executive of the Pershing Square Management hedge fund, responded, ''YIVO doesn't have a dime.''
 Speakers told Jewish jokes and offered Talmudic wisdom; impatient audience members shouted out comments and questions; and after one panelist -- Mr. Zuckerman -- left early, everyone else talked about him. 
 (In fairness, everyone, including the speakers who disagreed with Mr. Zuckerman, seemed sorry he was not there to respond.) 
 One major point of contention was how much anti-Semitic venom the Madoff affair would revive, particularly at a time when world opinion is so negatively focused on Israel. Mr. Zuckerman argued that no one since Julius Rosenberg, executed for espionage in 1953, had ''so damaged the image and self-respect of Jews.'' 
 Mr. Steinhardt, a noted philanthropist, was decidedly more optimistic. American Jews have ''tremendous insecurity,'' he said; perhaps surviving this debacle, he suggested, might ''finally allow us to be secure in this place.''
 The one good that may come out of this, Mr. Steinhardt continued, is that it might prompt Jews to re-evaluate their charitable giving in these leaner times. Naming names, he called a handful of Jewish agencies ''lousy, miserable, corrupt organizations''; he said contributors were ''just plain stupid,'' for giving them money. ''They spend $150 million for about 18 anti-Semitic incidents per year,'' he said.
 Mr. Schama, a history professor at Columbia, urged a vigorous offensive against any bias, but also questioned whether American Jews were overly sensitive. Was everyone assuming a tidal wave of anti-Semitic poison, he asked, ''or do we know that the recruiting centers in Montana have been exceptionally busy this past month?''
 As for moral issues, Mr. Walzer, of Princeton, said, ''I'm a moral philosopher, but I don't think morality is all that important in the way we think about Wall Street and the economy.'' The drive to make money is at the root of the business world, he noted: ''We have to assume human behavior is what it is, and that's what you need government for.''
 It was Mr. Ackman who made the most unexpected comments. Aside from Mr. Madoff, who has said that he ran a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court, the other people who stand accused are ''innocent till proven guilty,'' Mr. Ackman reminded the audience.
 In 2002 Mr. Ackman himself was briefly investigated by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, after Mr. Ackman brought attention to questionable accounting by MBIA, a holding company. He was ultimately cleared, but during that period, Mr. Ackman said, his lawyers would not permit him to defend himself publicly. Mr. Ackman also referred to his friend J. Ezra Merkin, who is being investigated after investing his clients' millions with Mr. Madoff. One of those clients was Mr. Zuckerman, who during his remarks had referred to Mr. Merkin as one of Mr. Madoff's ''enablers,'' and ''not much better'' than the ''sociopath'' himself. 
 Mr. Ackman said that Mr. Madoff had seemed to check out on all fronts, and that Mr. Merkin's funds had all been audited by top-flight accounting firms. Mr. Zuckerman probably didn't bother to look at the prospectus or statements, Mr. Ackman said, perhaps relegating the paperwork to a secretary. Mr. Merkin might have made a terrible mistake, but he was not dishonest, Mr. Ackman maintained. Mr. Steinhardt seconded the notion.
 Those comments particularly roused the crowd, which apparently included some Madoff investors, prompting Mr. Peretz to declare: ''Ezra Merkin is a side story. Let's not continue to discuss him.'' 
 Questions directed toward the bankers continued. ''I want a Jewish question,'' Mr. Peretz demanded, ''for the professors.''
 Someone asked about the investment strategies of Jewish charities. That question was Jewish, but it wasn't for the professors, Mr. Peretz scolded. 
 Finally Mr. Peretz asked one of his own: was there anything about Jews' participation in the money culture today -- perhaps, say, excessive expenditures like a bar mitzvah held at Madison Square Garden -- that deserved more thoughtful review. 
 An outraged man in the balcony interrupted, saying that for hundreds of years, conspicuous consumption had been used as an excuse to criticize Jews. The issue returned when a young woman said that she and her under-30 friends weren't worried about anti-Semitic flare-ups but did share a vague sense of shame. 
 Mr. Walzer, a self-described social democrat, said that the shame arose from a Jewish sense of responsibility for one another, and a commitment to speak out against wrongdoing.
 As for ''wanton extravagance,'' perhaps the medieval idea of sumptuary laws aimed at curbing conspicuous consumption make sense, he said: ''I would pay attention to those feelings and let them grow.''

HEADLINE: Portfolio in Ruins, It's Time to Pay for Summer Camp

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND. 
E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT'S hard to think about this in the dead of winter, but now is the time for those of us with children to plan for, yes, summer camp.
 Many camps, at least here in the hypercompetitive New York area, start filling up over the next month.
 For families with full-time working parents, camp can be a necessity. Even for parents who can stay at home, the thought of an unscheduled child hanging around the house for more than two months is frightening.
 But with the economy uncertain, camps say they are hearing from a number of parents who are wondering if they will be able to afford the tuition. Depending on the type of camp and where you live, tuition can range from a few hundred dollars a week for a day camp to about $1,500 a week for a residential camp.
 I will pause for a moment now, for the obligatory bemoaning of days gone by, when children just played on the street, rode bicycles to nearby water holes to swim with their friends and weren't seen by their parents until they arrived home, happy and sweaty, at sundown. 
 But truth be told, I did go to a day camp growing up in Los Angeles. So while my summers were probably a little more unstructured than my sons', it was not all loosey goosey. 
 And let's face it: This is a different world. I lament my children's excessive use of electronics as much as the next mother (and yes, we set limits). But if we had had Xbox, computers and 24-hour cartoon and sports networks back then, we would have been just as captivated by them as our children are.
 In fact, my friend Andraya, who remembers making up wacky games with her brothers and sisters during the hot Indiana summers while her parents worked, also remembers spending many days in front of the television -- and this was in the 1970s, when her family had only three channels.
 ''I watched game shows and got hooked on my mom's soaps and I vividly remember watching the noon farm report,'' she said. ''And did I turn out badly because of it? I don't think so.'' 
 So wishing for the summers of the past, whether real or mythologized, is as useless as wondering why the letter carrier doesn't use that cute pony express anymore.
 The reality is that many families rely on summer camps to take care of, teach and entertain their offspring in the summer months. The American Camp Association estimates that about 10 million children attend camp annually, whether for a week or two or all summer long.
 But an informal poll of my friends found that many were thinking about ways to bring down the cost.
 One friend, who asked not to be named because she didn't want to expose her family's finances, said she and her husband had lost their financial cushion of stocks with the Wall Street collapse. So while her husband still has a job, and she is at home, they are being much more careful.
 Her oldest boy, who is 11, will go to the sleep-away camp he has gone to for the last four years, which runs about $8,000 for seven weeks.
 If things were as financially stable as before, she would have started her 7-year-old on a residential program. Not anymore.
 ''Now I'm looking for day camps based on price,'' she said. ''Summer is definitely a concern.''
 Another friend, Sara, said that her camp fees ran around $20,000 for her three children, who do a variety of programs, from studying in Europe to local day camps.
 ''I would like not to send my kids, but I have no idea what I would do with them otherwise,'' she told me in an e-mail message. ''And frankly, it would be too hard a pill for them to swallow, but it was definitely being considered. With three kids, camp is a major, major expense.''
 Now I know you people in other parts of the country are laughing up your sleeves at us nutty New Yorkers again -- paying that much for summer camps? 
 And certainly, there are families here and across the country whose children's summers consist of going to the local pool, community center or public library. Our town also offers a reasonably priced camp -- $430 for six weeks of camp from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. -- which my sons attended for a number of years.
 But some parents remember their own camp experience, particularly sleep-away camp, as one of the great highlights of their childhood, and would do anything to avoid taking that away from their own children.
 Shelley Weiner, who with his wife, Arleen, has run Camp Winadu in Pittsfield, Mass., since 1974, said one woman told him she was selling her wedding ring so her boys could attend the residential camp this summer.
 At a minimum of $9,500 for seven weeks (which is all Winadu offers), that's a hefty commitment. And it's one that some parents are hesitant to make this summer.
 ''I've never seen anything like this,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''People are wiped out or overextended. They're afraid to spend the money.''
 The American Camp Association advises parents to inquire whether their camp participates in government income-eligible subsidy programs and check with the Internal Revenue Service to see if their camp expenses might be considered dependent care services and paid with pretax dollars. For more suggestions, go to www.campparents.org/affording--camp.php. 
 ''Seventy-five percent of our camps offer some financial help, in the form of financial aid, scholarships or payment plans,'' said Peg Smith, chief executive of the association. ''Parents shouldn't make the assumption that they can't afford camp.''
 Ron Axelrad, president of the board of Berkshire Hills Emanuel Camps, a nonprofit that serves both children and senior citizens, said some national Jewish organizations were stepping in to offer partial scholarships to first- and second-year campers who are 7 to 10 years old.
 ''We're also sending out letters to parents of returning campers to see if they're going to have needs,'' Mr. Axelrad said.
 More fundamentally, however, parents may have to rethink what is an essential and what is a luxury in these times, said Prof. William J. Doherty, a professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota.
 ''In an economic downturn, we have to decide what is enrichment versus what is a necessity,'' he said. And if you do have to scale back or cut out camp completely, you need to be able to tell your child that straight out.
 ''If they're old enough to go to camp, they're old enough to understand about money,'' Professor Doherty said. ''Tell them there is not as much money around, or we need to be more careful with our money. We're looking to do some fun things, but some things are going to be different.''
 Don't apologize, he said, or promise to make it up next year or ask for their forgiveness. Camp, he said, is a luxury, ''not a core need.''
 It's time to be creative. Some parents, like two of my friends, are joining together to create a camp co-op for their young daughters. Professor Doherty spoke of one mother who asked her children to make a list of 100 things to do when bored. A friend added the caveat that none could involve mom driving anyone.
 ''Structure a series of family meetings on this, to discuss what you can do in the summer,'' Professor Doherty suggested. ''Come up with 30 things, and everybody gets a certain number of vetoes.''
 Of course, there is one other way to get them up and out of the house -- give them some chores to do.

HEADLINE: Drawing Inspiration From the Optimism of Youth

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, the gray sky was no matter to Nia Harris, 18, who was contentedly hanging around in her bedroom, singing backup to Beyonce's ''Single Ladies,'' while her mother, Leslie Sterling, 48, organized books in an adjacent room. ''The Courage to Heal'' was stacked near ''Healing and the Mind,'' which sat by ''Mind Over Mood.''
Ms. Harris and Ms. Sterling share subtle bone structure, shy smiles and close quarters in a basement apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. They do not share Ms. Sterling's tendency toward depression. 
''She would catch me crying,'' Ms. Sterling said about a dark period in 2001, when her daughter was 11. ''Or she'd hear me at night and come into my room and tell me everything was going to be all right.''
''It made me sad to see her crying, but I'm the type of person that's optimistic,'' Ms. Harris said. ''Even then, I saw nothing but good things.''
It became trickier for her to see nothing but good things in 2003, when her mother received a diagnosis of breast cancer. But as she watched her mother get two lumpectomies, weeks of chemotherapy, a double mastectomy and weeks of radiation, Ms. Harris, then 13, remained unflappable, Ms. Sterling said.
The daughter was again the more composed of the two when, in June 2007, her mother was laid off from her job as an administrative assistant at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where she had worked for 12 years. Facing the prospect of months without income, Ms. Sterling had a tough time forgiving herself for having spent so much of her $52,400 salary.
''We had been living la vida loca,'' Ms. Sterling said. ''We traveled, Nia went to sleepaway camp and dance camp, we saw Men to Boys -- -- ''
''Boyz II Men,'' Ms. Harris cut in.
''Sorry, we saw Boyz II Men, we saw Beyonce,'' Ms. Sterling said.
Ms. Harris suggested that her mother focus on the consolations: a generous severance package and a not-insignificant accumulation of savings.
In June 2008, Ms. Harris briefly had to take her own advice when she received a thin envelope from Marymount Manhattan College, her first-choice school. She read the rejection letter, and then calmly folded it back up.
''That's O.K.,'' she told herself as she went through two days' worth of mail. ''I'll just reapply. Eventually, they will accept me.''
Then she came to the last envelope in the stack, another from Marymount, with a more recent postmark. Moments later, Ms. Sterling entered her daughter's bedroom.
''I found her sitting on the floor, holding her head in her hands, crying,'' Ms. Sterling said. ''She had been accepted after all.''
June was also when Ms. Sterling's severance and savings ran out. Left with only $111 in weekly child support payments, Ms. Sterling was unable to pay her $875 in rent that month, or the following two months. She borrowed from friends and family to pay rent in September and in October. In November, when $405 in weekly unemployment benefits came through, she was able to begin paying rent herself.
To help Ms. Sterling pay off her three months' back rent, the Community Service Society of New York, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, drew $875 from the fund and $825 from a program of its own. It then referred Ms. Sterling to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, another of the agencies, which provided her with an additional $875 from the fund.
Ms. Harris, meanwhile, took out student loans to cover the $22,000 in tuition at Marymount, where she is a freshman. She continues to live at home.
The walls of her room are adorned with a map of the New York subway, another of the world, and, above a full-length mirror, a sheet of lined notebook paper on which she had scribbled these goals for the next four years:
''Scholarship and full aid.'' ''Work at garden.'' ''Join clubs/meet people.'' ''Become R.A.'' ''Study abroad.'' ''Move into apartment.'' ''Be bilingual.'' ''All A's for all years.'' ''Internship leading to full-time job!''
Ms. Sterling, passing through her daughter's room on her way to the living room, paused near the mirror to take in the four-year plan. She hoped her path to a full-time job would be more direct than her daughter's.
''I hope she'll stay a little while longer,'' Ms. Sterling said finally. ''I want her to rub off on me.''

HEADLINE: Looking to the Future by Taking a Chance on a Work With a Sorry Past

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
New York City Opera's concert performance of Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall came the day after the news broke that this beleaguered company had finally lined up a new general manager and artistic director: George Steel. This is the only encouraging announcement to come from the nearly moribund City Opera since the board parted ways in November with its designated general manager, Gerard Mortier, who left the company rudderless in the middle of a financial crisis. 
 So at Carnegie Hall you might have expected there to be some celebratory announcement from the stage, or even the introduction of Mr. Steel, who was in town to meet with City Opera staffers on Thursday but does not start officially until next month. Instead George Manahan, the company's music director, simply came onstage and began the performance, as if the concert had been all in a day's work for City Opera. 
 Actually, this ''Antony and Cleopatra'' is the company's only presentation of a complete opera this season. Exiled from its home at Lincoln Center, the David H. Koch Theater, which is undergoing extensive renovations, the company opted to punt for a season and start fresh in the fall. It now falls to Mr. Steel to carry out that plan. 
 As the director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University for 11 years, Mr. Steel proved himself an intelligent and youthful impresario with no shortage of ideas about luring new audiences to classical music. Of course, other than for his few recent months running the Dallas Opera Company, which he is leaving abruptly to take over City Opera, he has no experience as an opera administrator. He can count on the good will of opera lovers in New York as he undertakes this essential salvage operation. 
 Meanwhile, the performance of ''Antony and Cleopatra'' on Thursday was a reminder of what City Opera is capable of. It has been hard for Barber's work, which inaugurated the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center in 1966, to escape its reputation as a dismal failure. Later productions of the score, which Barber revised extensively in 1970, have not really shifted the negative consensus.
 What a difference it makes to hear the piece performed by an opera conductor who palpably believes in it; skilled orchestra players and choristers itching for something to do; and a strong cast headed by two exciting artists: the soprano Lauren Flanigan as Cleopatra, and the baritone Teddy Tahu Rhodes as Antony. The fervent and sensitive performance that Mr. Manahan presided over made the best case for this opera that I have encountered. 
 When the Met approached Barber with a commission, he must have felt straitjacketed by the circumstances of the august occasion. The Met wanted something grand to show off its new house, a contemporary work, yes, but with spectacle and lyrical sweep in the manner of, say, ''Aida.'' 
 While Barber's Neo-Romantic musical language effectively tapped into the psychological undercurrents of his earlier opera, ''Vanessa,'' a gothic generational drama, that same language seems inflated, too swashbuckling, when applied to the epic and intricate historical tale of ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' adapted from the Shakespeare play. 
 Barber's score is rich with restless chromatic harmony, arching melodic outpourings, lush orchestration, percussive flourishes to evoke the conquering Romans, and reedy, harmonically astringent writing to conjure up Egyptian exotica. Yet these very qualities sometimes swamp the central love story with film-scorish excess. 
 By the 1960s, Barber was a conservative voice at a time that Berio, Ligeti, Messiaen and other modernists were ascendant. ''Antony and Cleopatra'' almost obsequiously adheres to the time-tested conventions of opera, with set-piece arias and choral ensembles of assembled voices who explain what is going on. Still, in recent decades plenty of safely conventional, Neo-Romantic new operas have been produced that showed nothing like the intelligence and ingenuity of this Barber work. 
 Everyone in Thursday's performance exuded conviction in the piece. Though Ms. Flanigan's singing had rough edges, she brought intensity, myriad colorings and earthy richness to Cleopatra's long-spun lyrical lines, written to order for the luminous soprano voice of Leontyne Price. 
 Mr. Rhodes made a husky-voiced, grave yet hopelessly smitten Antony. The bass-baritone David Pittsinger brought robust sound and dignity to the role of Enobarbus, Antony's steadfast fellow warrior. The tenor Simon O'Neill had bright, clear sound and authority as Caesar. 
 In the 1970 version used here, with Franco Zeffirelli's original libretto (adapted from Shakespeare) revised extensively by Gian Carlo Menotti, the cut-down opera lasts just over two hours. It is hard to imagine that the original work has almost another hour of music. But in trimming it, Barber left some dangling strands in the plot and the score.
 With this performance City Opera continues its tradition of championing overlooked works. All that is needed now is for Mr. Steel to get the company back onstage. Even a limited comeback season would be a triumph.

REAL ESTATE PARTY
 With Somber Tone
 Bone-chilling temperatures, news of a plane crash and endless worries about the economy didn't stop members of New York City's real estate world from donning their tuxedos for one of their favorite annual events. 
 They headed to the New York Hilton on Thursday for the 113th annual Real Estate Board of New York banquet -- also known as the Liar's Ball, for how its guests exaggerate about how much they have sold, bought or rented lately. 
 The gathering is one of the few constants in a city of uncertainty: Guests pay roughly $950 per ticket for the same meal of mixed greens, filet mignon with roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables.
 But guests never eat. They stand over their tables, slap each others' backs, shake hands and shout over the speakers about their deals.
 This year, however, was so restrained that it bordered on gloomy. The number of guests had shrunk so much that the balcony floor was half empty. They sat down and, for the first time in recent history, ate their dinners. They even humbly admitted that business might not be all that great.
 ''People are a little less boastful than they have been in the past,'' said Tom Bow, director of leasing for the Durst Organization.
 Scott Latham, a Cushman & Wakefield executive vice president involved with selling much of Manhattan's skyline, said he noticed another trend.
 ''What you see are many more high-powered people here,'' he said with a chuckle, ''because they have nothing else to do.'' CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY 
 2 OLD WOOLF PLAYS
 Unite, and Debut
 Teaching at Columbia University about 15 years ago, Julie Crosby ''tripped over'' a little book -- one with the text of ''Freshwater,'' Virginia Woolf's only play that is not a dramatic piece within a novel.
 The book included the two versions of the play, written 12 years apart in the 1920s and '30s. ''I got fascinated looking at them and thinking about how different the two scripts were,'' said Ms. Crosby, above.
 As the producing artistic director of the Women's Project, a New York group that concentrates on plays by women, she did more than just read the two scripts. She stitched them together and arranged to give ''Freshwater'' its first full-scale staging. It opens on Jan. 25 at the Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street.
 The play, a comedy, dates to 1923, which Ms. Crosby notes was the year of a royal wedding in England, an earthquake in Japan and some Roaring Twenties financial exuberance.
 Woolf put the script aside, Ms. Crosby said, returning to it in 1935, the year of a major royal anniversary in England, economic turmoil and -- in this country, anyway -- devastating dust storms. That version was performed once, for laughs, with Woolf's friends and family, Ms. Crosby said.
 She said the earlier script was stronger on characters, while the later one was stronger on plot and dramatic structure. It is just a coincidence that the production is opening in another year of economic turmoil, she said, making no predictions about royals, earthquakes or dust storms.

HEADLINE: Preparing Your Budget for Disaster

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
What are the first moves you would make if your income were to disappear? And if that has already happened, how are you handling it? Write to rlieber@nytimes.com or post a comment at nytimes.com/yourmoney.

 BODY:
Those of us prone to financial daydreaming spend a lot of time on the lotto fantasy. We create elaborate Excel spreadsheets in our head sorting what we would buy, whom we would help and when we'd retire. 
 But few people spend enough time imagining the nightmare case. As Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard University bankruptcy expert, and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, note in their book, ''The Two Income Trap,'' disaster is the defining theme in the financial lives of millions of Americans. 
 So forget about the jackpot for a moment and consider its opposite. The authors suggest conducting a financial fire drill, in which you plot out how you'd face down the worst-case situations. They're not the only ones recommending such an exercise. The drill has become a component of Kevin McKinley's financial planning process at his firm, McKinley Money in Eau Claire, Wis.
 Given the rapidly rising unemployment rate, the fear of a sudden loss of income is probably affecting more people right now than any other money worry, eclipsing less likely calamities like a natural disaster or the long illness of a close relative. 
 So what follows is guidance for conducting your own financial fire drill. Mr. McKinley has a number of eyebrow-raising suggestions. They include borrowing before using up savings, using any accumulated assets to pay the loans back as slowly as possible. Most people in financial trouble would be inclined to turn to their emergency funds first, before taking on new debt. But the financial fire drill is planning for extreme circumstances, which means that most of the advice below is not intended for everyday use. 
 For a gut check, I also turned to Kathy Santos. In September, I quoted her in a column about reducing exposure to personal risk, in areas from insurance to job security. Ms. Santos, a 53-year-old Web designer who lives in Pepperell, Mass., spoke about diversifying her income through freelance projects and work as an emergency medical technician. The following month, she lost her full-time job and had to consider her own financial disaster plan. 
 START WITH SPENDING An obvious first step in the fire drill is to contemplate how you'd cut back spending if all or part of your household income disappeared. And scaling back before the worst happens makes intuitive sense, though many people can't bring themselves to downgrade their style of living unless they absolutely have to. 
 The pain of a collapse in income, however, would be much less if you had already excised some of the extras that turned up in the drill. ''It's a leveraged advantage to cut spending,'' Mr. McKinley said. ''Not only do you live on less, but you accumulate more to serve as a safety net. And then you need less to support your monthly lifestyle once you lose your job.''
 The list of budgetary line items to consider should be familiar enough by now -- eating out, vacations, household utilities and the like. But Mr. McKinley tends to focus on automobiles, an area that doesn't come up as often. 
 ''People who have their heads on straight about money typically have little or no car payments,'' he said. ''They drive cars until they drop.'' 
 That seems like an odd thing to say for someone who lives in an area where people fear being broken down on the road in severe weather. Mr. McKinley, who drives a 2003 Honda Pilot with 80,000 miles on it, suggests flares, blankets and a backup cellphone for those who worry about car trouble.
 Ms. Santos and her husband do seem like guilty parties here, since they have three cars. Indeed, selling her husband's summer sports car was first on her fire drill list. ''It's one of those fun things he bought when we were both making $100,000,'' she said. 
 CONSIDER BORROWING NEXT Mr. McKinley's most radical notion is to use the drill to assess your borrowing capacity. You do that in anticipation of taking out loans before spending much savings. ''You borrow money when you can get it, then pay it back out of assets as slowly as possible,'' he said.
 The logic here is that available credit, whether it's a home equity line or credit cards, can disappear at any moment. It's vanishing, in fact, with increasing frequency for all sorts of people who are still employed. So if it's clear that your financial situation is dire, the theory goes, tap the credit while you can.
 For instance, if you have a $2,000 car repair, Mr. McKinley might suggest that you put that on a credit card rather than take the money out of savings. ''You can still pay that off more slowly and then, when you're back on your feet, pay the full balance,'' he said. ''Meanwhile, you still have the $2,000 in the bank, and a working vehicle.''
 Here's another bit of fancy footwork he'd suggest considering in your drill, keeping in mind once again that this is an only-if-necessary plan. If you have a working spouse, you could borrow twice as much money from the spouse's 401(k) as you think you'll need for living expenses. Pay it back slowly, as you would with the credit card. Then, if at some point your spouse is out of work, too, at least you have the money you need in addition to money left over to pay taxes and penalties you may be assessed if your spouse's employer demands immediate loan repayment and you can't comply. Once your spouse lost the job, you probably wouldn't be able to borrow against the 401(k) anymore. 
 These sorts of moves assume a couple of things. First, that you have savings in the first place with which to repay the loans. Second, that you'll find a new job soon that will allow you to pay back the debt quickly. 
 If either one of these things isn't true, then borrowing from your family can be a decent first move. 
 EMPTY THE ASSETS If you turn to your savings, Mr. McKinley suggests adjusting your asset allocation so that your investments are much more conservative. After all, you don't want your mutual funds plummeting while you are also out of work.
 Mr. McKinley, by his own admission, tends to work with what he calls middle-class millionaires. These are unflashy working people who have salted away enough over the years that they can pick and choose among strategies when trying to survive a long interruption in income. 
 When I asked Ms. Santos about how her own financial fire drill accounted for her assets, she chuckled. ''The only time I ever owned stock is when a company gave it to me,'' she said. 
 For those fortunate enough to have some savings, Mr. McKinley notes that a Roth I.R.A. is a good account to tap, because you can generally withdraw your initial contributions (though not your earnings) before retirement without taxes and penalties. He suggests breaking into college savings accounts, too, if necessary, even if there are taxes and penalties. After all, borrowing to send a child to school is reasonably easy for people with decent credit. 
 The biggest asset in most households, however, is a home. If yours is worth less than what you owe on the mortgage, your options might be limited if your income were to disappear. Ms. Santos and her husband have some equity in their home, and their fire drill led them to the conclusion that they might need to sell or rent their house and move someplace cheaper.
 WHO SHOULD DRILL Driving old cars, running up credit cards, letting someone else live in your home -- imagining it all is so disconcerting that the anxiety it produces hardly seemsworth it. Is it?
 ''The fire drill allows you to take control, to say, 'I've figured this out already' and not just be trembling at the computer terminal,'' Mr. McKinley said.
 ''The trouble is, people don't think about the fact that their financial situation can change really quickly,'' Ms. Santos added.
 Then again, it can swing quickly in a better direction, too. Just as Ms. Santos was down to her last day of severance pay and leftover vacation days, she got word that the Massachusetts Audubon Society wanted to hire her full time. 
 So she avoided the worst-case situation of zero income and won't be needing the plan that emerged from her fire drill. Not yet, at least.

HEADLINE: Singing (and a Few Other Things) for Their Supper

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Manufacturing serendipity is a tricky business, as the makers of any number of whimsical, failed television series can tell you. Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie managed it better than most in the first 12-episode season of ''Flight of the Conchords'' on HBO last year. Season 2 begins on Sunday (the first episode is already available at hbo.com), and the off-kilter charm is still there, though some strain is beginning to show. 
 This fish-out-of-water sitcom about a pair of guileless New Zealand musicians bumbling through life in New York has a formula and sticks to it: stretches of surrealist, deadpan comedy, so minimal as to be barely there, alternate with comparatively elaborate, Michel Gondry-style fantastical musical numbers. 
 The ''Seinfeld''-like plots are spun from air: Bret buys a mug for $2.79 and plunges the duo into such dire economic straits that Jemaine takes up prostitution, complete with a ''Midnight Cowboy'' hotel room parody. (''I have a few rules. One, no laughing, especially during, O.K.? Put's me off.'') During a performance in a library, Bret ad-libs insults to some prominent rappers, then forms his own gang -- which includes the middle-aged Asian proprietors of the Internet cafe downstairs -- in case Snoop Dogg or Missy Elliott comes looking for him.
 The jokes that hang from these slender frames are still sneaky-funny, though perhaps a slightly higher percentage fall flat. When an agent tells the duo his e-mail address, Bret asks, '' 'Underscore' is your middle name?'' 
 When they finish their first real paying job and are asked for their green cards, this exchange ensues:
 Jemaine: ''Green cards?''
 Executive: ''You do have a green card, right?'' 
 Jemaine: ''Is it just a bit of card?'' 
 Bret: ''It's just a greenish card?'' 
 Well, you have to be there. And as always, the New Zealand accents make everything funnier. 
 The real issue this season will be the quality of the songs. The first season used up all of the pair's existing material, and the new songs in the first three shows are uneven. A ''West Side Story'' parody in the gang episode is simply tedious. 
 The pair still manage at least one inspired number per episode, though. The highlight of the season premiere is the non sequitur song that ends it, explaining why rain is suddenly falling: ''There are angels doing it in the clouds ...''
 Mr. Clement and Mr. McKenzie pull off a neat trick in their show: they play a pair of clueless losers set loose in New York while simultaneously communicating the fact that in real life they're hipster studs. 
 You have to wonder whether anyone outside of downtown Manhattan; Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and certain neighborhoods of Los Angeles cares, but since this is HBO, that's the audience that will keep ''Flight of the Conchords'' on the air.

HEADLINE: City Approves $370.9 Million To Complete Yankee Stadium

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
New York City's Industrial Development Agency approved $370.9 million in primarily tax-exempt bonds on Friday to finish construction of Yankee Stadium with all the upgrades the team had sought, from better security to a new scoreboard to replace one that did not meet its needs. 
 The agency's board voted 11 to 1, with one abstention, for the Yankees' bond issue, which was debated, sometimes ferociously, at a State Assembly hearing on Wednesday and a public hearing held by the agency on Thursday. The Mets' request for $82.3 million in tax-exempt bonds to complete Citi Field was approved unanimously with little debate.
 The sole vote against the Yankees' bond issue came from the representative for the city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr. On Tuesday, Mr. Thompson faulted Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the development agency for what he said was ''financial incompetence'' in their negotiations with the Yankees. He said that they had failed to properly monitor costs to the city like parkland to replace the acreage where the new stadium is built and the demolition of the old Yankee Stadium.
 ''We know it's not a fair deal,'' said John Graham, the deputy comptroller, who is Mr. Thompson's representative. Mr. Graham said that the vote should be postponed to renegotiate the terms of the bond issue to force the Yankees to pay more in infrastructure costs.
 Randy Levine, the Yankees' president, said that without the additional tax-exempt financing (the development agency issued $942.5 million in 2006), completing the stadium ''would be difficult and challenging, but not impossible.'' He did not give details of what would not be finished, or built, if the Yankees did not get the financing.
 He said that requests from the police and other emergency services to upgrade security, and from broadcasters to enclose the press box, raised the construction estimate; so did lawsuits that delayed construction and the discovery that the scoreboard and sound system the team ordered did not ''measure up.''
 ''We changed things,'' Mr. Levine said. ''We had add-ons. We don't have cost overruns.''
 Mr. Levine said the team could not envision two years ago that it would need nearly $400 million more in bonds when it received approval for the first bond issue, which allowed the team to ask for $100 million in completion bonds. 
 But he said that since the team was using payments in lieu of taxes, or Pilots, to build the stadium, it was willing to bear any extra costs. With the additional bonds, the Yankees' Pilots will be between $70 million and $76 million annually.
 The Yankees will deduct those costs, plus about $30 million in stadium maintenance, from the revenue it is required to share with other major league teams.
 Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said the Yankees had agreed to pay $2 billion if they leave during the term of their lease of at least 40 years, and to pay $30 million over those years to defray the city's costs.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose Just 0.1 Percent in '08

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Consumer prices advanced at their slowest pace in 50 years in 2008, raising concerns about deflation as the weakening economy suppressed demand for cars, clothing, electronics and a host of goods and services, the government reported on Friday.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in December, its third consecutive monthly decline, after sliding 1.7 percent in November. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, was unchanged.
 For all of 2008, consumer prices grew just 0.1 percent while the core rate rose 1.8 percent, the Labor Department reported. 
 Friday's numbers raised more worries about deflation, a destructive loop in which falling prices slow economic growth, leading to lower wages, lost jobs and more stagnation.
 Prices that both consumers and businesses pay have been ebbing as the price of oil plummeted from its peak in July and the widening recession sapped global demand for goods and services, curbing the price of everything from automobiles to X-ray equipment.
 Most of December's declines in consumer prices came from lower energy prices, which fell 8.3 percent from November. Prices at the gas pump fell 17.2 percent for the month and were down 43 percent for the year, just six months after Americans were paying record prices of $4.11 for a gallon of gas.
 Falling gas prices are one of the few silver linings of a crippling economic downturn, which has pushed the unemployment rate to 7.2 percent and shaken the foundations of the financial system. For all the other negative effects of the recession, the plunge in gasoline prices has given strapped Americans the equivalent of a $200 billion tax cut, according to some economists. 
 ''All in all it's better than the alternative,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. ''If energy prices hadn't come down and you had all this bad stuff with the economy, it would be piling on. But here it's a net positive.''
 In December, the costs of food, drinks and housing were flat compared with those a month earlier. Clothing costs fell 0.9 percent and recreation costs were 0.2 percent lower. On Thursday, the government reported that wholesale prices of finished goods declined 0.9 percent in 2008 after a 6.2 increase in 2007. In December alone, the price of gasoline and home heating oil fell by one-fourth from a month earlier, while food prices were 1.5 percent lower, their biggest decline of the year.
 Economists have warned that prices will probably be flat or continue falling in 2009 as the recession drags on and lower energy costs work their way through the ladder of production. 
 ''We could potentially be flirting with deflation in 2009,'' said Haseeb Ahmed, United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, before the consumer-price data were released. ''I think it's a real possibility.''
 The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent, and it has indicated that it is now prepared to deploy its balance sheet and essentially print money to try to jump-start the slumping economy.
 Also on Friday, the Fed reported that industrial production fell 2 percent in December from a month earlier, and was 7.8 percent lower than December 2007, when the recession began. Production of construction supplies fell by 14 percent from last year as developers canceled major projects and stopped building homes, and manufacturing tumbled 9.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Studies Bases as Alternative to Guantanamo; G.O.P. Lawmakers Object

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

 BODY:
Pentagon officials have inspected several military bases in the United States that could potentially replace the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, if President-elect Barack Obama fulfills his pledge to close the camp there. The sites visited included Fort Leavenworth, Kan., and Camp Pendleton, Calif., military sources said.
The visits were part of a formal review of military bases and prisons initiated several weeks ago in response to public statements by Mr. Obama. The study, which military officials described as preliminary, has already drawn criticism from Republican legislators who oppose the closing of the Guantanamo Bay center and fear that the relocation of terrorism suspects to their districts could attract terrorist violence. 
''The department is examining any number of options and what it would take to implement such a decision if it were made,'' said Cynthia Smith, a spokeswoman for Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. Mr. Gates has also said the Guantanamo center should be closed.
A Pentagon official with knowledge of the review, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said the military was also considering federal prisons but would not say whether any Bureau of Prisons facilities had been physically inspected. The Justice Department was not involved in any such review of prisons, a spokesman, Dean Boyd, said, but he noted that agency officials were having discussions with the Obama transition team about national security matters, including the future of the Guantanamo center.
The transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to the United States would be complicated, opening new legal avenues to the detainees. Before being rebuffed by judicial rulings, the Bush administration had argued that the detainees should not have access to American civilian courts because they were being held on foreign soil. The inmates would probably have more options to challenge their detention if they were held in the United States.
Nearly 250 inmates remain at Guantanamo, and it is likely that they would be sent to a variety of places if the detention center was closed. Some might return to their home countries, others might be granted asylum by other nations if rejected by their homelands, and still others would remain in detention in American facilities. Mr. Obama said recently that working out the details of closing the Guantanamo camp could take a year.
The possibility that Guantanamo inmates would have more legal rights if they were brought to the United States has led several Republican lawmakers to oppose the review. Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, said in an interview that he expressed his reservations on Thursday in conversations with Mr. Gates and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen.
''There's a legal problem because Leavenworth is a military disciplinary barracks,'' Mr. Brownback said, ''and under our laws, you can't mix military and foreign detainees together.'' Fort Leavenworth is home to the military's only maximum-security prison.
''The place isn't set up for it,'' Mr. Brownback continued. ''Leavenworth doesn't have an exterior fence. It's a small facility.'' Mr Brownback pointed out that a train runs through the 8.8 square mile property and that it could be easily breached by someone bringing in a bomb.
The military is looking at overall security and personnel assigned to each site. ''The willingness of the surrounding community, just like in other military base issues, looms large in decisions made in the way that land and facilities are utilized,'' a Pentagon official said.
Mr. Brownback recently invited the president-elect to visit Fort Leavenworth so he could make his case that it was unsuitable for holding international terrorism suspects. Mr. Obama has not gone.
Representative Brian P. Bilbray, a Republican from San Diego, voiced similar concerns about Camp Pendleton, a Marine base nearby. He said it was a bad idea to take such high-profile inmates to one of the most populated places in the United States. He also said he opposed granting the inmates more legal protections.
''They shouldn't be brought onto U.S. soil because then they're going to take advantage of the fact that we're an open society,'' Mr. Bilbray said. ''Once you move them onto U.S. soil, it opens up a Pandora's box of appeals-obstruction alternatives that they do not have while they're not on U.S. soil.''
Representative Duncan Hunter Jr., another San Diego Republican and a veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said relocating Guantanamo detainees to Camp Pendleton would be a diversion from its main mission of fighting two wars.
''I don't think Guantanamo should be closed at all or that those detainees should be on any operational military bases,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''I think it's an insult to military personnel serving in Afghanistan and Iraq.''
Community reaction has been muted, in part because of the scarcity of public details about the review. The most outspoken local critics of the facilities study are in Leavenworth, where the city and county councils have issued formal statements opposing any move of detainees there.
''We're concerned about the security of our residents,'' said Scott Miller, the city manager of Leavenworth. Mr. Miller said he was concerned that the prisoners could affect the local economy if business owners moved because they feared the city could be the target of terrorist retribution.
''We do have a prison here,'' he said, ''but these are individuals who are possibly a little more dangerous than our prisoners.''
Correction: January 22, 2009, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the Pentagon's search for military bases in the United States that could replace the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, misstated the size of Fort Leavenworth, Kan., one base under consideration. It is 8.8 square miles -- not eight miles by eight miles, or 64 square miles.

HEADLINE: But Who Will Drive Them?

 BODY:
The cornucopia of hybrid and electric vehicles showcased at the North American International Auto Show this week suggests that the nation's automakers -- domestic and transplanted -- have finally acknowledged the need to deliver the fuel-efficient cars and trucks for a future of expensive gas and increasing environmental pressures. 
 But a big obstacle remains to the greening of American drivers: the price tag. With gas prices likely to remain low as consumers grapple with recession, drivers are going to need extra motivation to swap their gas gluttons for the novel, environmentally friendly cars and trucks. If the incoming Obama administration is serious about its commitment to boost the fuel efficiency of the American fleet, it must put in place a mix of policies, beyond tightening fuel-economy standards for carmakers, to steer drivers to the new cars. 
 The price of Ford's new hybrid Fusion sedan, estimated to travel a whopping 41 miles per gallon in the city, is expected to start at more than $27,000. The Volt, General Motors's high-profile plug-in car, could cost as much as $40,000. There are cheaper paths to environmental virtue: The Toyota Prius starts at only $22,000. And Honda's Insight hybrid -- to go on sale later this year -- is expected to cost less. 
 Still, with gas below $2 a gallon and recession-ravaged consumers hanging tight to their wallets, even the cheaper hybrids have to compete with cars that run on boring old internal combustion engines. The Prius was the flavor of the month when gas prices soared to $4. But in December, Prius sales plummeted 45 percent compared with the same month a year earlier -- more than the 36 percent drop in all car sales.
 Do the math. At $1.66 a gallon, the average gas price assumed in the government's 2009 energy guide, a hybrid Toyota Camry would only save the average driver about $250 a year in gas, compared with the regular Camry. But the hybrid costs $7,000 more. 
 A hefty gas tax would, of course, produce a strong incentive for drivers to switch to more fuel-efficient cars. But confronting a staggering economy, the Obama administration would be right to look for other options in the immediate future. The modest tax rebates offered to jump-start sales of hybrids and plug-ins starting in 2005 already have been phased out for the more popular models made by Honda and Toyota -- and are slated to disappear entirely at the end of next year. 
 These rebates could be extended and increased. Ideally, they would be available to buyers of any car that achieved big improvements in energy efficiency, not just hi-tech vehicles. Another, more aggressive option floated last year by Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton, would be for the government to buy up the most polluting and gas-hogging clunkers from American drivers and scrap them. That is an idea that has been tested in several states. 
 These ideas would fit neatly into an economic stimulus strategy, the Obama administration's effort to save Detroit's carmakers and its stated environmental objectives. Just hoping that American drivers will buy the fuel-efficient cars that the government wants Detroit to make is likely to achieve little.

HEADLINE: House Democrats Release Details of Their Tax Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and JEFF ZELENY; David M. Herszenhorn reported from Washington, and Jeff Zeleny from Bedford Heights, Ohio. Stephen Labaton contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats on Friday presented the details of $275 billion in tax cuts in their proposed economic recovery package, including a middle-class tax cut that was one of President-elect Barack Obama's signature campaign promises, new tax breaks for college tuition and first-time homebuyers, and an array of tax incentives to encourage renewable energy production. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, provided the details of the tax provisions on the same day that Mr. Obama traveled to Bedford Heights, Ohio, to discuss the $825 billion stimulus plan at a factory that makes parts for wind turbines. 
 Even as Mr. Obama gave factory workers an ominous warning about the economy, saying ''things will get worse before they get better,'' members of his staff in Washington scrambled to respond to the continuing financial deterioration of several large banks and began to draw up new rescue plans. 
 On Thursday, the Senate voted to release the second half of the Treasury's $700 billion financial system bailout fund, and it was clear that the money would be needed right away to stabilize the increasingly fragile banking sector. 
 Obama aides said that one proposal under consideration was a version of an earlier failed government effort to buy the troubled assets from large institutions. Another would encourage some troubled banks to segregate their bad assets into a so-called bad bank that could ultimately be spun-off. 
 Both efforts are directed at helping the banks cleanse their books of their worst assets. Officials said they did not expect that a firm plan would be put in place until the Senate took action on Mr. Obama's nomination of Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary. 
 Mr. Geithner is almost certain to be asked about the potential bank rescue plans at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. 
 With his inauguration just four days away, Mr. Obama's visit to the Cardinal Fastener and Specialty Company, in a Cleveland suburb, was the first of several trips he plans to make to promote the economic recovery plan. 
 It provided one last campaign-style appearance, returning him to the familiar trappings of an Ohio factory, like so many that he visited during his two-year bid for the White House. 
 ''The way I see it, the first job of my administration is to put people back to work and get our economy working again,'' Mr. Obama said in an 11-minute speech on a chilly factory floor, where nuts and bolts are made for wind turbines. 
 He selected the location to renew his call to double the production of renewable energy over the next three years, which is one element of his plan to save and create jobs.
 ''If we don't act now, because of the economic downturn, half of the wind projects planned for 2009 could wind up being abandoned,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Think about all the businesses that wouldn't come to be, all the jobs that wouldn't be created, all the clean energy that we wouldn't produce.''
 The tax package unveiled by Mr. Rangel at the Capitol includes billions in incentives for renewable energy production, including solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, small irrigation, hydropower, landfill gas and waste-to-energy. 
 The bill would authorize $2.4 billion in bonds to help finance state and local energy conservation programs to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases, and would extend tax credits for making energy-efficient improvements to existing homes.
 But the tax provision likely to be of most interest is the two-year middle-class tax cut, which will provide up to $500 to individuals and up to $1,000 for couples earning less than $200,000 a year, the overwhelming majority of Americans. 
 That provision is likely to be the subject of intense debate on Capitol Hill. Republicans have criticized the plan, and some economists say there may be simpler ways to provide more permanent tax relief. 
 Under the House plan, taxpayers would be able to choose to get the money in their paychecks, as a temporary reduction in Social Security withholdings, or to claim it on their annual tax forms that are due in April. The tax package also includes a new credit of up to $2,500 for college tuition and related expenses, with certain income eligibility limits, and it included an enhanced $7,500 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, essentially providing down payment assistance, also with certain eligibility limits. 
 Congress first approved a $7,500 tax credit for homebuyers last year, which amounted to an interest-free loan, to be repaid over 15 years, for house purchases made between April 9, 2008, and July 1, 2009. Under the new law, the loans would not have to be repaid for homes bought after Jan. 1, 2009. 
 The stimulus package also contains an array of tax breaks for businesses, including a provision that would allow companies to speed the depreciation of capital investments, allowing 50 percent of those expenditures to be written off immediately. In addition, it has a provision that allows businesses to apply current losses to prior profitable years, as far back as 2003, providing potentially generous credits against past tax bills. 
 During his visit to Ohio, Mr. Obama emphasized the need for a bold recovery plan. 
 ''The need for this action has never been more urgent,'' he said, adding, ''With each passing day, families here in Ohio and across America are watching their bills pile up and their savings disappear and economists from across the spectrum tell us that if nothing is done, and we continue on our current path, this recession could linger for years.''

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Disapproval Of Bush Unwavering

BYLINE: By MEGAN THEE-BRENAN

 BODY:
President Bush prepares to leave office with no evidence that public opinion toward him is softening during his final days in power, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 When asked about Mr. Bush's performance over the last eight years, 22 percent of respondents said they approved. That matched Mr. Bush's job-approval rating for much of last fall, the lowest of his presidency. In the current poll, 73 percent disapproved of his performance over the course of his two terms.
 Disapproval cut across party lines, with Democrats, independents and even 34 percent of Republicans critical of Mr. Bush's performance. 
 In contrast, Mr. Bush's most recent predecessors left office with approval ratings ranging from 68 percent, for both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, to 44 percent, for Jimmy Carter. Mr. Bush's father left with 54 percent.
 When asked to assess Mr. Bush's presidency more precisely, just 17 percent of those surveyed rated it very good or good, while 83 percent said it had been average or poor. Fifty-nine percent of Americans regarded Mr. Clinton's presidency as very good or good when he left office, and 40 percent viewed the presidency of the elder Mr. Bush the same way.
 The public's assessment of the president's handling of both the economy and the war in Iraq was markedly negative. Seventy-seven percent disapproved of Mr. Bush's management of the economy, and 71 percent faulted his handling of the war.
 In surveys that began with Gallup polling in the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mr. Bush has the distinction of being the president with both the highest and lowest approval ratings. The highest, 90 percent, was recorded shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The campaign against terrorism is one area in which he continues to win a measure of support from the public, with 47 percent approving of his handling of the issue and 48 percent disapproving. Republicans were particularly supportive of him on the subject of terrorism: 87 percent approved of his administration's actions to fight it.
 Still, not only do Americans disapprove of the overall job Mr. Bush has done, but record numbers also have an unfavorable opinion of him personally. Six in 10 of those surveyed said they viewed him negatively, while about one-quarter viewed him favorably.
 Americans' historically negative assessment of the administration is not limited to the president. Vice President Dick Cheney's favorability rating in the new poll is 13 percent, the lowest of his time in office.
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted from Sunday through Thursday with 1,112 adults, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Complete results and methodology are at nytimes.com/polls.

HEADLINE: Citigroup's Big Loss and Breakup Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup, under mounting pressure from regulators to rethink its financial supermarket model and shrink itself, capped a devastating 2008 with an $8.29 billion fourth-quarter loss on Friday. 
 With nearly every part of the company suffering, Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, is preparing to divide the banking company into two parts, Citicorp and Citi Holdings, to focus its executives' attention on its stronger remaining businesses while winding down its money-losing operations.
 ''We believe there is a lot of value in having them focused,'' Mr. Pandit said. ''We are not in a rush to sell businesses.'' 
 Even so, Mr. Pandit has agreed to split off Smith Barney, its valuable retail brokerage arm, into a joint venture with Morgan Stanley to raise capital to offset the fourth quarter's huge losses.
 Citigroup's loss, which amounts to $1.72 a share, compares with a loss of $9.8 billion, or $1.99 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had estimated on average that Citigroup would break even on a per-share basis, according to a survey by Bloomberg News. 
 The company has reported a loss for five consecutive quarters, and Friday's announcement of a staggering $25.2 billion in write-offs and losses in both its consumer and investment bank brought its total charges to $90 billion.
 Citigroup shares have dropped by almost half in the last week. They were down again on Friday, closing down 33 cents, or 8.6 percent, at $3.50. 
 For the full year, Citigroup reported a net loss of $18.72 billion. With unemployment rising and evidence of a global slump, the bank is bracing for another dismal year.
 Gary L. Crittenden, Citigroup's chief financial officer, said the bank would probably have to set aside money to cover losses all year. He said that mortgage losses were approaching the peak levels of the recession in the early 1990s and that credit card losses had already surpassed them. 
 Still, Mr. Pandit said he believed that Citigroup's big consumer business was ''bending the curve on losses'' and that the overall company would emerge from the current environment stronger and smarter.
 Mr. Pandit held a noontime meeting at Citigroup's Park Avenue headquarters in Manhattan to discuss the strategy and bolster the spirits of employees. 
 Reports emerged early this week that Citigroup was accelerating moves to dismantle parts of its troubled financial empire. But some Wall Street analysts and investors questioned whether the plan, which included the announcement on Tuesday that it would split off Smith Barney, would go far enough to address Citigroup's immediate troubles. 
 On Friday, Citigroup also issued a statement from its lead director, Richard D. Parsons, signaling that several of its directors would soon leave. Mr. Parsons is widely expected to become Citigroup's next chairman.
 Citigroup will legally remain intact for now. But by segmenting Citigroup into Citicorp and Citi Holdings, run by separate managers, Mr. Pandit may be setting the stage for a spinoff of Citigroup's stronger operations or an eventual merger. Meanwhile, reporting the two sets of businesses separately should burnish its quarterly results by making it easier for investors to focus on its healthier operations. 
 Citigroup posted $5.6 billion in revenue, down 13 percent from the comparable quarter a year earlier, which the company said was a reflection of the ''difficult economic environment and weak capital markets.''

 TEA BUBBLE BURSTS,
 Emptying Pockets in China
 In southwest China, a type of tea known as Pu'er became the darling of the nation's nouveaux riches over the last decade, as they embraced a distinctly Chinese way to display their wealth and invest their savings. But the collapse of the tea market has turned thousands of farmers and dealers into paupers and provided the nation with a pungent lesson about greed and the perils of the speculative bubble.

 BALTIC RIOTS SPREAD TO LITHUANIA
 Riots broke out once again in the Baltic states, this time in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, where a group of 7,000 gathered to protest planned economic austerity measures. A smaller group began throwing eggs and stones through the windows of government buildings until the police moved in, using tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. PAGE A6 
 A BIN LADEN SON IN PAKISTAN
 A son of Osama bin Laden who spent years under Iranian house arrest has left Iran and is now probably operating inside Pakistan, a senior American intelligence official said. 
 The son, Saad bin Laden, is one of a number of senior operatives of Al Qaeda detained inside Iran in recent years. American officials have long puzzled over the exact circumstances of their captivity, but they believe that Iran was holding the militants in part as a deterrent against a Qaeda attack on Iranian soil.

 CAMPAIGNING IRAQI CLERIC KILLED
 A cleric who is a member of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's political party, and was a candidate in the provincial elections, was killed by gunmen on Friday as he drove away from a campaign event in a province south of Baghdad. The candidate, Haitham Kadhim al-Husaini, was attacked as Iraq's Islamist parties, including the movement of the anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, stepped up campaigning for the Jan. 31 elections during Friday Prayer.

 BUSH'S DISMAL POLL NUMBERS

 A LAWYER'S LATEST HIGH-WIRE ACT
 Gregory B. Craig has been in politics for 40 years, once serving as an adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy and later defending Bill Clinton from impeachment. Now the in-house counsel for President-elect Barack Obama, he finds himself in the middle of the most contentious debates facing the new administration, such as how to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and whether C.I.A.. interrogators suspected of torture should be prosecuted.

 EX-F.B.I. CHIEF SUPPORTS NOMINEE
 In the confirmation hearing for Eric H. Holder Jr., President-elect Barack Obama's selection for attorney general, Louis J. Freeh, the former director of the F.B.I., said that Mr. Holder was drawn into a ''corrupt act'' when he became involved in the pardon of a fugitive businessman by Bill Clinton. But Mr. Freeh said Mr. Holder had learned from his ''terrible mistakes'' and deserved to be confirmed. PAGE A12
 PIVOTING FROM HIS OUTSIDER STANCE
 During the campaign, President-elect Barack Obama ran as a Washington outsider, and his campaign boasted that they did not hobnob at cocktail parties with the city's well-connected citizens. But with their tenure in the White House set to begin, he and his team are shifting gears and schmoozing with the town's media elite. PAGE A13
 PENTAGON'S PUBLIC RELATIONS EFFORT
 The office of the Defense Department's inspector general said that it found no wrongdoing in a Pentagon public relations program that made use of retired officers who worked as military analysts for television and radio networks. At least 45 members of Congress had called for inquiries into the program, with some asserting that it might have constituted an illegal campaign of propaganda directed at the American public.

HEADLINE: Imagining The Inaugural

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Right now you may be asking yourself: How am I going to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration? 
 You may, of course, have something else on your mind entirely. Like what the chances are that the next time you get on a plane, geese could fly into both engines. Or what the heck geese are doing in New York in the middle of winter when their relatives who worked hard and played by the rules had all gone south months ago.
 Or you may just be wondering how that rescue in the Hudson River would have gone if it had been led off by the Department of Homeland Security rather than New York Waterway's director of ferry operations. 
 I can't help you, people. Today I am on inauguration duty. 
 While there is some debate about the best inaugural address in history, it's pretty clear that the worst was the one delivered by William Henry Harrison, who went thwacking through a tangled thicket of classical allusions for an hour and 45 minutes. (Harrison's editor, Daniel Webster, claimed it could have been worse, and that he had killed off ''seventeen Roman proconsuls, as dead as smelts.'') The weather was terrible; Harrison came down with a cold, then pneumonia and was dead within a month.
 Given current beaten-down expectations, our normal approach to Tuesday's address would be to wander around muttering ''well as long as it's better than William Henry Harrison's...'' But Barack Obama is a celebrated speaker, and our hopes are unusually high. So where are you going to be when it all happens? The options are many, including:
 1. Go to Washington with the rest of the world.
 For the nonelite, seeing the inauguration in Washington involves standing on the Mall, shivering and staring at a JumboTron in the company of many, many, many brand-new new acquaintances. Not everyone thinks this is the perfect way to experience history. Obama himself has been delicately hinting that we all might want to consider staying home, mentioning ''long lines, a tough time getting around and most of all a lot of walking on what could be a very cold winter day.'' 
 Still, if you go, then you can always say you did. ''Actually having been there does give you some street cred, so to speak,'' said Jeremy Brooke Straughn, a sociologist at Purdue University, who has done research on generational memory. His own experiences go back to Jimmy Carter, whose inauguration he attended when he was 10. ''All I can remember is it was extremely far away and I was very cold,'' he said. This is not the kind of story that is going to leave them spellbound at your next dinner party.
 But I totally sympathize. The first inauguration I went to was Bill Clinton's in 1993 and the only thing I can remember is watching Barney the purple dinosaur vamp down Pennsylvania Avenue during the parade.
 2. Join other Obama supporters for an inauguration party.
 To find the nearest one, you can check my.barackobama.com. Or just close your eyes, click your heels and say ''President Barack Obama'' four times. This will trigger chips implanted in the heads of former campaign volunteers and someone will call you soon with an invitation to a Change Is Coming house meeting and a special offer on an Inaugural Seal fleece jacket.
 3. ''Total Recall.''
 Watch the inauguration on television and hope that as time passes, you'll come to believe that you were actually there. Memory experts say that this sort of thing happens all the time, and the number of Americans who think they were at Woodstock, or watched the Red Sox win the World Series or marched on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr. is far, far greater than the number of actual attendees.
 ''I almost feel like I was there for the 'I Have a Dream' speech, given how many times I've seen it on TV,'' said John Mueller of Ohio State University. ''And the number of people who saw that plane floating in the Hudson is probably already a lot higher than is possible.'' 
 Virtual attendance: a great way to experience history without leaving the comfort of your own home. (By the way, I work in an office near the Hudson River and am already beginning to remember watching the rescue even though our view was completely blocked by several big buildings. And there may have been a moment after the inauguration in 1993 when Barney and I went clubbing.)
 All this is good news for people who did not vote for Obama but now yearn to have a part in the inaugural events. If you go to Washington, you will be welcomed by happy Obamites wearing name tags and fleece jackets. Even if you don't, you may gradually begin to remember that when you went to the polls, you pulled the Democratic lever. And if the new president does well and manages to resurrect the economy, by 2011 you will clearly recall doing door-to-door canvassing last September in a Yes We Can T-shirt.

HEADLINE: How About a Stimulus For Financial Advice?

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
IN evaluating the causes of the financial crisis, don't forget the countless fundamental mistakes made by millions of people who were caught up in the excitement of the real estate bubble, taking on debt they could ill afford.
 Many errors in personal finance can be prevented. But first, people need to understand what they ought to do. The government's various bailout plans need to take this into account -- by starting a major program to subsidize personal financial advice for everyone. 
 A number of government agencies already have begun small-scale financial literacy programs. For example, the Treasury announced the creation of an Office of Financial Education in 2002, and President Bush started an Advisory Council on Financial Literacy a year ago. These initiatives are involved in outreach to schools with suggested curriculums, and online financial tips. But a much more ambitious effort is needed.
 The government programs that are already under way are akin to distributing computer manuals. But when something goes wrong with a computer, most people need to talk to a real person who can zero in on the problem. They need an expert to guide them through the repair process, in a way that conveys patience and confidence that the problem can be solved. The same is certainly true for issues of personal finance.
 The significance of this was clear at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association this month in San Francisco, where several new research papers showed the seriousness of consumer financial errors and the exploitation of them by sophisticated financial service providers.
 A paper by Kris Gerardi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Lorenz Goette of the University of Geneva and Stephan Meier of Columbia University asked a battery of simple financial literacy questions of recent homebuyers. Many of the respondents could not correctly answer even simple questions, like this one: What will a $300 item cost after it goes on a ''50 percent off'' sale? (The answer is $150.) They found that people who scored poorly on the financial literacy test also tended to make serious investment mistakes, like borrowing too much, and failing to collect information and shop for a mortgage.
 A paper by Liran Einav and Jonathan Levin, both of Stanford, reporting on work with William Adams of Citigroup, shows how sophisticated automobile lenders can be in their loan technology. They use complicated statistical models not only to approve people for credit, but also to fine-tune the down payment and even to suggest what kind of car individuals can buy. This suggests to me that many borrowers can't match the expertise of lenders.
 And another paper, by Paige Marta Skiba of Vanderbilt University and Jeremy Tobacman of the University of Pennsylvania, showed that payday loans -- advanced to people who run out of cash before their next paycheck -- exploit people's overoptimism and typically succeed in charging annual rates of interest that may amount to more than 7,000 percent.
 One wishes that all this financial cleverness could be focused a bit more on improving the customers' welfare!
 The theory of capitalism, going back to Adam Smith over 200 years ago, sees an alignment of interest between consumers and businesses. Only those companies that produce what consumers really need will succeed. Those that do not will be beaten in the marketplace as consumers shop elsewhere. This puts pressure on providers to innovate and to better satisfy consumer needs.
 This theory assumes, however, that consumers are rational in their choices, and to a large extent they are. But in some areas, notably personal finance, it is important to recognize that a good share of Americans have difficulty figuring things out.
 Most people get financial advice only from sales representatives of one sort or another: real estate agents, mortgage brokers, sellers of financial products. Some of these providers could use their sophistication to exploit people's tendency to behave irrationally, and to manipulate the judgment errors that consumers typically make. And competitive pressures tend to make providers promote products that exploit those errors to the hilt, unless, of course, we offer consumers real financial advice. 
 Such advice is tax deductible, so it is already subsidized indirectly. But most lower-income people do not itemize deductions on their tax returns, so they don't receive this benefit. In addition, their income tax rates are lower, so the deduction's benefits can be even less -- sometimes zero if they pay no taxes. That's why it makes sense to subsidize the advice enough that lower-income people will really buy it, much as we do with health care in Medicaid and Medicare. In this case, it means reimbursing qualified private financial advisers for most or, sometimes, all their fees. 
 SUBSIDIZED financial advisers should be licensed by self-regulatory organizations that verify their qualifications. Licensing will be imperfect, and some incompetent advisers will end up with subsidies. Still, the net effect of getting professional advice to the public is surely positive. 
 To qualify for a subsidy, the advisers would have to sign a statement promising loyalty to their clients and agreeing to accept only the subsidized hourly fee, and never any commissions or kickbacks. The subsidies might come to $75 an hour, at a very rough estimate, and if 50 million Americans averaged four hours of consultations, the eventual cost might be $15 billion a year -- a substantial expenditure, but a worthwhile one.
 If personal financial advisers had been subsidized years ago with the best incentives, they still might not have stopped their clients' bubble thinking during the boom. Many advisers probably thought that housing investments were a good bet. But it's still likely that advisers who built long-term relationships with their clients, and who pledged to look after their welfare, would have been a helpful influence, suggesting caution to those who were getting over their heads in debt, and warning that adjustable-rate mortgages could be reset upward, just as the fine print said. For these reasons, financial advisers probably would have reduced the severity of the housing bubble.
 Professional financial advice is now generally accessible only by the relatively wealthy. Changing this would be an important corrective step. Giving the general public access to trained advisers would be a boon for the nation in this time of doubt and distrust.

Kimber Cavendish, a physical therapist who works with breast cancer patients, and Vicki Faust, a tax accountant, fall into that second category. Together, they spent just over $1 million to open Kimber Modern, a five-room hotel in Austin, Tex.
''We travel a lot, and we're always looking for unique, interesting, modern places,'' said Ms. Cavendish, 49. Kimber Modern, she says, offers a chance to apply what she and her partner have learned in 16 years of traveling together.
Since it opened in October, the hotel has operated at about 30 percent occupancy, according to Ms. Cavendish; they are hoping to hit 50 percent, which would give them a 12 percent return on their investment. ''We've done a lot of spreadsheets,'' she said. 
Rooms rates are $250 to $320 a night, which Ms. Cavendish concedes is a lot during the economic downturn. ''We opened at the worst possible time,'' she said.
Indeed, the lodging industry faces significant challenges, as both individuals and companies trim travel expenditures. According to Smith Travel Research in Nashville, hotel occupancy in the United States averaged 51.9 percent in November 2008 -- the first full month that Kimber Modern was open. That was down steeply from 58.1 percent the year before. And average room rates were also down, to $101.82 from $104.47, as hotels struggled to outflank their rivals.
Kimber Modern's main competitors include the 189-room Driskill Hotel in downtown Austin, which offers such amenities as 24-hour room service, and the low-rise Hotel San Jose, where standard rooms are under $200 a night.
But Ms. Cavendish is optimistic, given the advantages of her hotel, which include extras like 500-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets. Recently, Limbo Films of Portland, Ore., rented all five rooms while shooting a commercial in the area; the company used the common area as a production office.
''It was an absolutely perfect place to stay,'' said Gary Nolton, a director at Limbo Films. He sent a photograph showing his team working on laptops in the sunny courtyard.
A selling point is that the hotel is in the South Congress neighborhood, which Ms. Cavendish calls ''the cool part of Austin.'' Though the area is full of stores and restaurants, Kimber Modern occupies a residential lot.
Technically, the business is a bed-and-breakfast. Austin, like many cities around the country, permits bed-and-breakfasts in residential neighborhoods, provided that certain conditions are met.
But Kimber Modern differs from most other bed-and-breakfasts. While nearly all of them are in converted houses, Kimber Modern was built from the ground up. The women hired Burton Baldridge, a lawyer-turned-architect who moved from New York to Austin in 2002, to design the kind of crisp, Modernist structure they sought.
The site, though, posed many problems. Just over half an acre, it was oddly shaped and steeply sloped. Much of the land couldn't be built on or even paved because of environmental regulations, and yet the business was required to have at least five parking spaces.
In addition to those constraints, the lot faces the back of a row of stores and restaurants. As a result, Mr. Baldridge made the building inward-looking. The exterior, of concrete panels, is ''very imposing and intense,'' Ms. Cavendish said. By contrast, the large, triangular courtyard in the center of the hotel is bright and cheerful.
Ms. Cavendish and Ms. Faust, who is 50, have owned the building site since 1996, when they bought it and the house next door. When they sold the house a few years later, they kept the vacant lot.
Mr. Baldridge said the design and construction of Kimber Modern cost about $1.1 million. While it was going up, Ms. Cavendish bought everything that went into the building, from Philippe Starck bathroom fixtures to Eames desk chairs to a commercial coffee system from Franke, a German manufacturer. Her expenditures, she said, totaled about $200,000.
She was determined to create a stress-free guest experience, using technology. ''When you make a reservation, you enter your birthday, and that becomes your key code.'' Guests can park their cars, let themselves into the building through a glass door, then move from the common space to the central courtyard to their rooms. Each is identified by the color of its door.
Breakfast isn't the communal affair usually associated with bed-and-breakfasts. There's a glass-fronted refrigerator, containing a variety of breakfast selections -- including mini-quiches that require four minutes in the microwave. ''You can have breakfast whenever you want,'' Ms. Cavendish said.
She said she was determined to make the rooms dead quiet. She spent $44,000 for a Mitsubishi heating system that is virtually noiseless, she said. (A regular system, she said, would have cost $18,000.) And the building was constructed to keep sounds from traveling between rooms. The walls contain two rows of studs that are staggered, and they are covered in Quiet Rock, a sound-insulating drywall that Mr. Baldridge said costs about 10 times as much as ordinary drywall.
In the end, the project went about $300,000 over budget, Ms. Cavendish said. The women, who had hoped to own the property debt-free, now have a $300,000 mortgage.
But Ms. Cavendish said she didn't regret the overruns, because ''the value is in the building, and it shows.''
''We wanted every detail to be perfect,'' she added. ''I'm not sure if it was absolutely necessary, but none of us would compromise on quality.''
Ms. Faust keeps an eye on the hotel -- and runs her accounting business -- from her office in an Airstream trailer, which was hoisted up to the roof of the building and set down there amid artificial turf. (The business is called the Tax Trailer.)
In her own office, Ms. Cavendish devotes a good deal of her time to making sure that Kimber Modern will appear on the computer screen of anyone searching for a room in Austin. That has required her to educate herself about Internet reservation services, which follow different models. (Some are free to the hotel, some ask monthly fees and some take a commission on each booking.)
Potential customers also follow different models. Many, she said, try to get rooms for less than the advertised price. ''People will say anything,'' she said, including claiming to represent celebrities. But mostly, they say they love how the place looks but can't afford the rates.
Though she tries to hold the line on prices, she said, she often acquiesces. ''I'm a pushover,'' she said. ''I want to make a profit, but I also want to share this great place with great people.''

HEADLINE: For the Maid, a $1.55 Million Room

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE bull market for Manhattan real estate is alive and well, at least for that unusual and hard-to-find accommodation, the lowly maid's room.
Property records show that a 448-square-foot staff studio, or maid's room, facing an inner courtyard at 15 Central Park West sold for $1.55 million in December. That is close to the average price paid for a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan in the fourth quarter of last year, according to figures compiled by Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
The sales contract was signed in mid-November, as automakers were seeking a federal bailout and economists were worrying that consumer spending had all but come to a halt.
By then the most expensive listings at 15 Central Park West, the limestone-clad towers designed by Robert A. M. Stern at West 62nd Street, had been pulled from the market, including an $80 million listing for a four-bedroom apartment, at more than $15,000 per square foot.
But the slowdown in spending did not include what the wealthy residents of 15 Central Park West apparently consider essentials, like plainly finished studios with tiny kitchenettes, suitable for a maid, a butler or an occasional guest. The price of the studio, one of 27 staff rooms in the complex, works out to $3,460 a square foot.
Property records show that the seller was Guy A. Metcalfe, a Morgan Stanley managing director, who flipped the property soon after closing on it. Mr. Metcalfe paid $880,000 for the studio on Oct. 23, the same day he bought a five-bedroom corner apartment on the second floor with a 75-foot-wide frontage facing Central Park.
The buyer was identified in city records as Alexander Mikhailov, who bought a three-bedroom apartment on the 34th floor last January for $7.85 million. In outbidding his neighbors, Mr. Mikhailov paid more for the staff studio per square foot than he did for his apartment, which has huge windows with views of Central Park to the East and the Hudson River to the West.
Mr. Metcalfe and his wife, Lisa, apparently had a change of heart after buying their apartment in October. Two weeks after paying $9.35 million, they put it back on the market for $16.5 million; they have since cut the price twice. Now the asking price is $12.5 million, or $3,270 per square foot, less than they received, per square foot, for the maid's room.

HEADLINE: At Newer Hotels, Luxury Goes on Sale

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
TO get the best hotel bargains right now, book at the newest place on the block. Opening in a tough economic environment, new hotels are slashing significantly discounted introductory rates even further and extending the deals long after officially opening their doors.
For travelers who can take advantage of the bargains, the discounts are an opportunity to stay at upscale, amenity-laden properties for what they normally might pay for a more moderate hotel without the latest perks. 
On Maui, the Honua Kai Resort & Spa, scheduled to open Jan. 28, is offering rooms from $195 -- 50 percent off published rates. Near Miami, the Blue, a 240-room resort that opened in September, has extended its opening price of $189 a night through April, down from listed rates of $360. And the Nines, a new Starwood Luxury Collection property in Portland, Ore., is offering rooms for an attention-getting $99 a night for 99 days through mid-April.
''Ninety-nine dollars is not seen today,'' said Fred Kleisner, general manager of the Nines. ''To me, it's the Nines saying, 'Hey, we're brand-new. Come on and check us out.' ''
On a recent business trip to New York City, Marie Alexander from California,the chief executive of a software company., stayed at the Thompson LES, a new boutique hotel on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The listed rates for the rooms, with Sferra bed linens, slate bathrooms with rain showerheads and Kiehl's toiletries, begin at $375 a night. Ms. Alexander paid $149 -- a deal she found on Quikbook.com, which is offering bargains at a range of new hotels in major cities.
''It's just always so nice and clean when it's brand new,'' said Ms. Alexander, who tries to stay in recently opened hotels whenever she can. ''And new employees, while they might be learning what to do, are just so enthusiastic.''
At the Thompson LES, she said, employees remembered her on a subsequent stay.
Hotels typically offer significant discounts during so-called soft openings -- the period before the property officially opens to the public when construction may still be under way -- only to double those rates soon afterward. But now that they face the added challenge of breaking into new markets during a recession, travelers can expect the deals to last well after the official opening.
The Nines, for example, officially opened in Oregon, in October with a starting rate of $245 a night -- more than double the current $99 special. In Boston, the new Inn at St. Botolph, a sister property to the upscale XV Beacon hotel, is offering rooms for $129, better than 30 percent off the $189 starting rate.
The GEM Hotel and Wyndham Garden Hotel, both of which opened in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in November, offered introductory rates starting at $189 at that time. Now, their rates start at $159 and $169.
New hotels face not only the recession, but also a glut of rooms built in the last few years when times were better. In Phoenix, for example, where 36 hotels opened in the 12 months ending in November 2008, there are nearly 6,000 new rooms flooding the market. That has contributed to a drop in hotel occupancy levels of about 10 percent, in that same period, according to Smith Travel Research.
New York City had the most openings for the 12 months ending in November, with 54 new hotels adding 7,982 rooms to the mix. In the Miami area, 20 hotels, with 4,155 rooms, opened. Chicago, Houston, and San Antonio each had 39 hotels open.
To compete, hotels opening later this year are offering some of the lowest rates, like $99 for a room at the Ace Hotel, north of Madison Square in Manhattan, which is taking reservations for arrivals after March 1.
But be careful when booking properties that have yet to open their doors. The Smyth Tribeca, a new property from Thompson Hotels, which also owns and manages the 60 Thompson in SoHo and the Thompson LES, was pushed back to later in January after reservations had already been taken.
An editor at HotelChatter, a site devoted to all things lodging, reported making a reservation for the night of Jan. 11 ''at the killer rate of $119'' through Quikbook.com before the opening was pushed back. When the opening date was delayed, Quikbook transferred the booking to Thompson LES, but the editor declined. Instead, she made a new booking at the Smyth for Jan. 18, after the hotel was rescheduled to open. But again the hotel delayed the opening.
Even if they open on time, new hotels have their drawbacks. Employees tend to be green and still learning the ropes, Internet outages can occur as the hotel works out the kinks of a new network, and the place may simply not be finished. But an amazing deal may be enough to offset any inconveniences.
And there are side benefits. In December at Grand Velas, a luxurious all-suites resort that recently opened near Playa del Carmen, Mexico, staff members outnumbered guests by at least five to one, a little girl had the humongous infinity pool entirely to herself, and several employees occupied their time by playing volleyball on the beach with a family that needed extra players.
More recently, a front-desk clerk giving tours of the Standard New York, a snazzy new hotel from Andre Balazs, said the hotel had been delivering free continental breakfast to guest rooms during the preview period (with rates from $195) since the hotel is still under construction.
SO how do you find these new hotels? Cities where demand hasn't been keeping pace with new properties, like Las Vegas or, in Florida, Tampa, St. Petersburg and Jacksonville, are a good bet. Hotelchatter.com does a good job of keeping abreast of hotel openings, and Hotelnewsresource.com has a ''new openings'' section.
Plugging key buzzwords into a search engine like Google can also do the trick. Use terms that are likely to be in the hotels' marketing, like ''flat-screen TV'' along with the word ''hotel'' and the name of your destination.
About a year ago, I found the Anise Hotel in Hanoi this way, an affordable, modern hotel that was relatively new and in a great location -- just steps from the old quarter. My rate: $130 a night, including taxes and breakfast.

HEADLINE: The Maestro and the Money

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
THE recession has brought its woes to the inhabitants of Lincoln Center.
 The New York City Opera lost its designated general director, Gerard Mortier, because of a large cut in his promised budget. The Metropolitan Opera is scaling back some productions for next season. The New York Philharmonic is predicting a budget shortfall of up to $3 million this season. 
 But at least so far, and despite the frequency with which current economic troubles have been compared to the crises of the 1930s, the woes of the city's signature musical institutions are nothing compared with the situation during the Depression, when the very existence of New York's orchestras and opera houses was in question. 
 A dip into the archives of the venerable New York Philharmonic, which traces its history to 1842, shows something near panic seeping through the onionskin carbons of board minutes and browning newspaper clips from 75 years ago. The board grappled with crushing deficits that threatened the orchestra's existence, despite the presence of its titan of a music director, Arturo Toscanini.
 In the middle of the 1933-34 season, at the depths of the Depression, the Philharmonic-Symphony Society, as the orchestra was officially known, reported a $150,000 deficit on expenses of $686,000 -- the equivalent of a $13 million gap on the current Philharmonic's budget, $60 million.
 In December 1933, the board reported a ''marked loss of income'' from ticket sales and a hit from higher taxes. Since the 1931-32 season, the endowment fund and contributions used to make up deficits ''had largely ceased to be productive,'' according to minutes. With the orchestra's ability to borrow tapped out, its survival hung in the balance.
 The managers extracted two rounds of pay cuts from the musicians, and by 1935 they were earning $90 a week. (These days, ironclad labor contracts make salary cuts inconceivable, although the orchestra's management could take a hard line on future raises.) 
 The Depression-era board also diverted $15,000 of a $30,000 bequest from the musicians' pension fund to the endowment, another no-no today. In addition, the board sought radio sponsorship from Pepsodent, the toothpaste giant, for the orchestra, ''provided its dignity is not sacrificed,'' according to board minutes. (Today, the orchestra's sponsor is Credit Suisse.) 
 The board further began a nationwide campaign to raise $500,000 in emergency funds, appealing even for small change. The archives contain a small folding card with slots for dimes, going up to $2.
 Mayor La Guardia, Eleanor Roosevelt and Nicholas Butler, the president of Columbia University, all made radio appeals for contributions. People who sent money in the name of Toscanini received autographed thank-yous from him. By the campaign's end on April 30, 1934, the papers reported that $501,659 had been raised, although, by the start of the next season, half that money was gone, applied to covering old deficits to avoid heavy interest payments on bank loans.
 The orchestra back then also considered reducing conductor salaries. Toscanini was earning an astronomical $110,000 in 1931-32, or about $1,833 a concert -- 20 times what a rank-and-file orchestra player earned in a week. 
 The juxtaposition of that salary and the public appeal for funds was not lost on some commentators.
 ''The cancer causing the Society's financial plight is not the expense of the orchestra but the ridiculous expense of having Toscanini with it,'' Walter Anderson wrote in the March 1934 issue of Musical Advance magazine.
 Perhaps most intriguingly, the Philharmonic board in 1934 devised detailed plans to merge with the Metropolitan Opera, with an eye to saving money for both troubled institutions. One proposal called for 14 weeks of opera, 14 weeks of concerts and two weeks of rehearsals. The suggested merger even took into account savings from combined postage and stationery. The Philharmonic would have played for the operas and given its concerts at the Metropolitan Opera house, abandoning Carnegie Hall -- then its home -- and saving on rent.
 THE proposal drew howls of protest from musicians of the orchestras, subscribers and contributors to the nationwide appeal. The death knell was sounded by Toscanini, whose opinion was relayed from Milan in a cable by Bruno Zirato, the Philharmonic's assistant manager. Playing at the Met Opera house would lower the orchestra's standard, Toscanini said, and the public would not be satisfied by the fewer opera performances.
 ''He believes that the merger would not help either organization artistically,'' Mr. Zirato said. And so the Met and New York Philharmonic remain on their own today -- grappling independently with their money woes.

HEADLINE: Horatio Alger Relocates to a Mumbai Slum

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: VERLA, India 

 BODY:
-- It isn't about cows or cobras, a wedding or outsourcing; it isn't about gurus or Gandhi. ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' in fact, may be the first world-traveling film about India in a generation to discard the old, smudged lenses for seeing this country.
 Its novelty has given it a dream run in American movie theaters, and last week it was chosen best dramatic picture at the 66th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles. It now is given a good shot at the Academy Awards next month.
 But the film's freshness lies not just in how the West sees India. It lies, too, in how Indians see themselves. It portrays a changing India, with great realism, as something India long resisted being: a land of self-makers, where a scruffy son of the slums can, solely of his own effort, hoist himself up, flout his origins, break with fate. 
 And that may explain the movie's strange hold over Americans. It channels to them their own Gatsbyesque fantasy of self-invention, and yet places it far enough away as to imply that it is now really someone else's fantasy. Indeed, after the havoc wreaked on ordinary self-reliant Americans by the impenetrable workings of the markets, after the go-it-alone trading of Bernard L. Madoff, after even President Bush enlisted the government to rescue private markets with a huge bailout, the mythology of the self-reliant self is under siege in America to a degree not seen in a very long time. 
 The film, which will finally open in India on Friday (this reporter obtained a digital copy of it), follows Jamal Malik, who rises from Mumbai's shantytowns to compete on the Indian version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' His life begins in a familiar, eternal India: the India of layers of humiliation, of the swirling crowd that drowns the self.
 The director, Danny Boyle, shows us the many clamps on Indian selves. The arbitrary power of the police officer toward the citizen and the gangster toward the slum dweller. The schools where teachers throw books at students and lessons consist of choral echoing of the teacher's words. The slum where cooking and child-rearing and defecation are semi-public activities, and where it would be hard to develop the mental independence to question an arranged marriage or abuse by the better-born.
 In Jamal's environs, you don't happen to the world; the world happens to you.
 But our hero has his own, larger vision of life. It is, at first, a vision compelled: he and his brother are orphaned and must survive. But in time Jamal parlays that pain into a knack for succeeding, becoming a train vendor, then a tour guide to the gullible in Agra, then a tea wallah in a Mumbai office.
 In India, clan is everything. But Jamal needs no one. He has no parents; his brother betrays him; even the game-show host, feigning goodwill, deceives. In India, hierarchy rules. But Jamal treats the mighty no differently from the meek, does not cower even before the police. He is that rare, but increasingly less rare, Indian creature: a man all his own.
 The old restraints were formidable: family, caste, religious fatalism, Byzantine bureaucracy. The many forces conspiring to keep uppity selves in check. Even today, India is no free-for-all. But the new pull is centrifugal, toward the lonely periphery and away from the buzzing center, toward a life of one's making, in a city not one's own, in a vocation not inherited.
 It is the unmarried women working nights in Delhi's call centers. The brothers leaving brothers to start their own firms. The divorces sprouting where acquiescence ruled. The spreading belief that destiny can, with scars and ardor, be bent.
 ''Why does everyone love this program?'' Jamal, seeing the ''Millionaire'' show on TV, asks a friend one day.
 ''It's a chance to escape, isn't it?'' she replies. ''Walk into another life.''
 Oceans away, the United States was founded with the promise of such escape. Its early settlers were fleeing restraints much like those in old India. They drove the natives away, then built a nation premised on space and self-making: a frontier land where families had their own acres, own gun, own conscience. That, at least, was the mythology.
 But it has been a long time; and now, even as the myth of self-making spreads to India, a pause for second thoughts may have started in America.
 It was partly the crash of 2008, in which supposed masters of the universe, unsupervised, tanked the economy, then sheepishly asked to be bailed out. It was partly a dawning sense that policies that promoted the entrepreneur could forget communities and contexts. It was partly the fraying of American families, the ''joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation,'' as the late writer David Foster Wallace put it.
 And so as Indians sever their attachments, Americans reweave theirs.
 Harvard Business School now teaches courses like ''Entrepreneurship in Education Reform'' to satisfy students who want to mix private and public gain. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have argued that they owe their success to a conducive society, and have resolved to give their wealth away.
 Scientists, too, are pushing the self-made from their pedestal, arguing that success is social: that certain cultures breed success, that genes influence skills, that there are favorable times to be born. ''Personal explanations of success don't work,'' Malcolm Gladwell writes in ''Outliers,'' his new book on the research. In a magazine interview, he derided ''empty models that say, you know, you can be whatever you want to be. Well, actually, you can't be whatever you want to be. The world decides what you can and can't be.''
 The social is back in politics, too. When Alexis de Tocqueville visited America in the 1830s, he famously noted its civic enthusiasm. That penchant flagged in recent decades; Americans were said to be ''bowling alone.'' But there is now a neo-Tocquevillean flowering online, of Wikipedia editors, Twitterers and bloggers, an unpaid army stirred by that ancient impulse to blow in larger currents. 
 And the recent election was won by a candidate who is self-made but did not position himself that way; he spoke instead of roots and linkages. Now, he claims a mandate for the largest program of collective government action in decades.
 It is roots and linkages that many Indians now seek to shed, and many Americans now seek to reclaim. And that may be the silent allure of ''Slumdog Millionaire.'' It is a tribute to the irrepressible self, filmed in a society now realizing it has given the self too little, watched in a society now realizing it has given the self too much.

 ''I'm a positive person, and this is a positive thing to be doing,'' said Mr. Hylton, 28, a network technology specialist who lives at 66 Main Street, Yonkers's first geothermally heated and cooled apartment building. The system will pay for itself in energy savings over 10 years, said Ken Dearden, the developer of 66 Main.
 The new Ossining Public Library and the almost completed Mount Kisco Public Library also use geothermal heating and cooling systems. They are part of a green building trend -- one that uses energy-efficient materials and technologies and minimizes disruption to the environment -- that has accelerated in Westchester over the past two years. 
 The economic slowdown accentuates this shift in construction practices, said Steven Winter, an energy and construction consultant in Norwalk, Conn.
 ''Commercial and speculative projects have fallen off, but school buildings, affordable housing, government buildings and health facilities are least affected, and these tend to be green projects,'' Mr. Winter said. He was chairman of the United States Green Building Council in 2000 when it released its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, known as LEED, which is a nationally recognized third-party certification process for the construction of green buildings.
 More than three dozen new building projects in Westchester have sought or completed LEED certification, according to the Green Building Council, which is based in Washington.
 Building green in the county does not always mean building to LEED certification standards. Some local governments, like New Rochelle's and the county Department of Public Works, have committed to green building in principle but are not going for LEED sign-off because of extra costs of hiring consultants and paying certification fees.
 ''We are requiring all of our staff and consultants to provide us with a listing of options for the different levels of certification, and then we are analyzing the costs,'' said Ralph L. Butler, commissioner of public works for the county, who has begun offering LEED certification training to county engineers but has not adopted LEED standards.
 Reese Berman, the supervisor of the Town of North Castle, has been working with a team of county leaders on climate-change issues for the past few years and now, as a member of the Westchester Municipal Officials Association executive committee, is working on green guidance for local governments.
 ''It's hard when development is slow for towns to make this kind of legislation,'' said Ms. Berman, whose town has had to shelve plans for a new highway garage with solar panels. ''Unless there are really big incentives from the state or federal government, we are not going to see the kind of green initiatives we were hoping to see.''
 Yonkers, which has the most at stake in the county with Struever Fidelco Cappelli's $1.6 billion redevelopment plan in the works, as well as other waterfront and downtown building proposals, has drafted the most aggressive green building standards in Westchester.
 ''We had heard that it was not going to be economically feasible,'' said Liam J. McLaughlin, the Republican minority leader on the City Council, who heads its Environmental Policy and Protection Committee. ''Then we talked to other developers and municipalities and found that the added expense is not that great.''
 Mr. Dearden, the developer of 66 Main, estimated that complying with LEED standards would have added up to 4 percent to his building costs.
 In a rare instance of unanimity, the Yonkers City Council is expected to pass a green building code this month that will require that most new construction, including the Struever Fidelco Cappelli project, comply with LEED standards, Mr. McLaughlin said.
 Mayor Phil Amicone has not endorsed the law yet but is likely to support some form of green building code, said David Simpson, his spokesman.
 ''Especially in Yonkers, where we have the Hudson River and the Saw Mill River,'' Mr. Simpson said, ''we have to do the best thing to protect these environmental assets, at the same time that we are developing the city.''

HEADLINE: Expanding a Culinary Empire Into the Suburbs

BYLINE: By ALICE GABRIEL

 BODY:
AFTER a lot of heavy breathing on the part of restaurant watchers, Tarry Lodge -- the first suburban venture for the empire-building restaurateurs Joseph Bastianich and Mario Batali -- is up and running in Port Chester. Mr. Bastianich and Mr. Batali, who own 15 restaurants together, have a promotional zeal (see mariobatali.com and bastianich.com) matched by really good instincts. With help from Nancy Selzer, Tarry Lodge's managing partner, and Andy Nusser, its chef, they have tailored a setting that's just right for their brand of sporty trattoria fare. (Mr. Nusser, who lives in Westchester County, was the first chef at Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich's Manhattan flagship, the three-star Babbo.)
 Since its debut in October, Tarry Lodge has generated huge interest; just try to get a reservation on a weekend. People are flocking there for the beautiful wood-scented pizzas (fired over cherry and oak), the unexpected pastas (chestnut tagliatelle with parsnips and pancetta) and the silky gelato sundae dotted with pungent sour cherries. Both bar scene and culinary operetta, it's the sort of production that Manhattanites take for granted but that Westchester and Fairfield County residents can get excited about. 
 The big corner building -- once a modest family-style Italian restaurant -- holds a warren of rooms on four levels. A pearl-white marble bar lines the saloonlike main room; the recessed mezzanine affords fine views of the commotion below. Removed from the main action are a narrow front dining room behind the cramped reception area; a small midlevel dining area reached by a flight of stairs; and even higher up, a full floor of tables that can be used for overflow and private parties. The place is eminently handsome, painted in cream and honey mustard, with wood floors the color of black licorice. 
 Packed tight on an icy weeknight in mid-January, Tarry Lodge would appear to be recession-proof. Prices are very fair; you could get lucky as a walk-in, sit at the bar with a quartino of pink pinot grigio ($14) and a pizza topped with glistening hog-jowl bacon, creamy mozzarella, black truffles and a runny sunny-side-up egg ($14), or a bowl of perfect Bolognese on thick ribbons of pappardelle ($15), and the world would look pretty good indeed. 
 The seasonal pan-Italian menu gives solace to a generation raised on lasagna and garlic bread but now conversant in fregola rossa, sformato and mascarpone. I visited on three occasions and never tired of perusing the possibilities. 
 Antipasti -- divided into verdura, pesce and carne -- were a study in modern rustic. Many of the offerings were stone cold, their flavors suppressed. Still, as things warmed up, I liked the nutty farro spiked with pomegranate seeds and brisk mint; the sturdy eggplant caponata with giant capers; succulent roasted sweet peppers the size of prune plums; and red and golden beets ''agrodolce,'' dressed with sugary vinegar. My guests and I ravished a plate of carne mista: elegant prosciutto San Daniele; the more robust domestic La Quercia prosciutto Americano; excellent salamis cured at Mr. Batali's family's salumeria, in Seattle; and smoky speck. I was willing to overlook an oily blend of leathery octopus and bland baby potatoes. 
 Other starters included a bright salad of lettuces with celery root, walnuts and Gorgonzola, and pristine tuna carpaccio ornamented with tiny pear tomatoes, black truffle and a tuft of frisee. Warm butternut squash sformato, with a hint of nutmeg, was a winter gem. 
 Pastas are required eating. Besides the tagliatelle and the pappardelle, I liked the playful fusilli, with its jumble of cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, beet greens and walnuts. Pumpkin lune dappled with sage and grated amaretti cookie were rich, rich, rich -- share them if you want to survive the meal. My only beef was with the spaghetti alla carbonara, which lacked the force of a deeply flavorful egg yolk that makes that dish special. 
 On two nights our second courses were very slow in coming -- probably because of the sheer number of plates the kitchen was trying to get out at peak hours. When it finally arrived, I enjoyed the butterflied guinea hen, with its bronze grill marks and pretty cluster of Treviso radicchio, whole parsley leaves, cured black olives and tart pomegranate seeds. A pungent salsa verde gave a welcome jolt of flavor to both the straightforward skirt steak and a surprisingly delicate bollito misto. Osso bucco alla Milanese was anchored by a hefty piece of shank with a deep pocket of marrow, but there was no escaping the spicy heat of the toasted fregola that came with it. Fluke francese with artichokes and capers was a concept in need of better execution; the snowy fish sloughed off its thick coating on simple contact with a fork. 
 Another minor complaint: On one visit, having reserved a table weeks ahead, we were marched up to the top floor, where two families with small children were the only other patrons. How do you say Siberia in Italian? When I asked politely if there might be an alternative (I'd seen vacant tables on the lower level), we were offered a table even closer to all the chirping. I gave up. 
 Service was otherwise professional, frank and generous -- the staff is the size of a small army -- and reservationists were saintly in their patience.
 Oenophiles will love the full-bodied Italian wine list, from Elena Walch's 2007 pinot grigio ($45) to Giacomo Conterno's 2001 Monfortino Riserva barolo ($600). We drank wines by the quartino. I liked Mr. Bastianich's own crisp, slightly honeyed 2007 Friulano ($12), with hints of Bartlett pear and apricot kernel; the copper-colored 2006 Scarbolo pinot grigio Ramato XL ($14); and for a solid red, the 2006 La Mozza Morellino di Scansano I Perazzi -- a sangiovese blend tasting of anise and cherries, from a winery owned by Mr. Bastianich, his mother, Lidia, and Mr. Batali. 
 Desserts are simple, in the Italian tradition. Best among them were the diminutive chocolate cake with pistachio gelato; the lemon almond cheesecake with lemon curd gelato; and the puckery grapefruit sorbet that came with an otherwise tough little panna cotta. Black Mission figs served with vin cotto cream were underripe -- why bother? Espresso with a handful of tiny biscotti was probably the best exit strategy.

 VERY GOOD
 THE SPACE Spare and beautiful, with great lighting and Old World touches of tile and brocade. The saloonlike main room is very lively and very noisy; peripheral dining areas are more subdued. 
 THE CROWDIntrepid (they got reservations, after all) and casually dressed. All ages represented. 
 THE BAR The imaginative Italian wine list has a fair number of bottles from $40 to $50. A short list of sweet wines is nicely tailored. 
 THE BILL Antipasti, $5 to $8. Salads, $8 to $10. Pizzas, $10 to $16. Pastas, $14 to $24. Entrees, $16 to $60.
 WHAT WE LIKED Farro with mint, beets agrodolce, fennel with blood oranges, sweet peppers al forno, eggplant caponata, carne mista, butternut sformato, tuna carpaccio, Gorgonzola and walnut salad; pizza with speck and tellegio, pizza with guanciale and egg, pappardelle Bolognese, fusilli, pumpkin lune, guinea hen with radicchio and oranges; chocolate cake, lemon almond cheesecake, Tarry Lodge sundae, biscotti.
 IF YOU GO Lunch: Monday to Friday, noon to 2:30 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 11 to 4 p.m. Dinner: Monday, 5 to 9 p.m.; Tuesday to Friday, 5 to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 4 to 11 p.m.; Sunday, 4 to 9 p.m. Reservations are highly recommended; a limited number of tables are available for walk-ins. Parkingcan be a challenge. A poorly marked private lot on Abendroth Avenue fills up; there is street parking in the neighborhood, but you might have to dodge trash bins and snow crud at this time of year.

HEADLINE: Vive le Wrestler

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
The French were right. 
 The French were right to warn us about Iraq. And now it seems that they may even have been right about Mickey Rourke. 
 When Mr. Rourke won a Golden Globe award for ''The Wrestler'' last Sunday, that comeback within a comeback movie was not merely a vindication for an aging, underemployed, sometimes mocked but mostly forgotten movie star.
 It was a needling reminder that the French, after so many years and after so much derision, never gave up on an actor who, in this country, became a living symbol of French contrariness -- a human Security Council veto, the Tinseltown embodiment of the force de frappe and fromage de tete. 
 We mocked the French for admiring Mickey Rourke the way we laughed at their serious assessment of Jerry Lewis as a comic genius. In both cases, the French despised us right back for disparaging artists who are avatars of what they consider to be the best of American popular culture. 
 They never saw Mr. Rourke as a wash-up; or rather, they quite liked that about him. The actor's unpopularity in his own land made the French admire him all the more. For decades, or at least since one of his bigger belly flops (''Wild Orchid,'' 1989), he was their Hollywood Dreyfus Affair -- an honorable man persecuted and falsely accused of failure, which here is almost as bad as treason. 
 Failure in America is a recipe for success in France, a nation that takes perverse pride in marching out of step with the leader of the free world. France, after all, elected its first American-style president -- Nicolas Sarkozy is a first-generation immigrant, a free-market capitalist with a sexy model/pop singer wife and no grandes ecoles diplomas -- just as America is readying to swear in its first French-style president. Barack Obama, after all, is an elegant, well-spoken technocrat who went to all the right schools, has a sophisticated, soignee first lady and is promoting more state control of the economy. 
 The French contrarian streak became clear many years ago when an editor at The New York Times Magazine asked me to find out why so many bad Mickey Rourke movies were playing all the time, all over Paris -- this in the early '90s, after ''Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.'' The editor couldn't understand why the French loved and took seriously an actor who despite early promise (''Diner,'' ''Rumble Fish'') and a youthful James Dean-like beauty, had become an asterisk, or worse, a plastic surgery punch line. 
 Once I started reporting, I found so much more to the French obsession with Mr. Rourke that the assignment found its way onto the cover: ''Can 50 Million Frenchmen Be Wrong?''
 Apparently, no. 
 ''The Wrestler,'' directed by Darren Aronofsky in a European new-realist style, will not open in French theaters until February, but it won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and French critics in particular raved about Mr. Rourke.
 ''More of a freak than ever, more impressive as well, he is the physical incarnation of the American landscape, its dreams, its violence, its loneliness and we only come to realize this every three years, each time he attempts a comeback,'' is how Philippe Azoury, of Liberation, put it in September. (Who here even knew Mr. Rourke has a new movie every three years?) 
 Mr. Azoury had still more to say. ''What he gives here, physically, in terms of wacko masochism (wrestling with broken glass, staple gun and barbed wire) as well as spattered sensitivity, is without equal.''
 Not that the French didn't get a few things wrong before they were right. In 1985, Les Cahiers du Cinema hailed Michael Cimino's ''Year of the Dragon'' as a masterpiece and raved about Mr. Rourke's performance most of all, noting approvingly that he alone stands out from the pack of ''steroid-fattened and lobotomized'' Hollywood leading men. 
 A few years later, Mr. Rourke fell into a self-destructive physical-improvement spiral that included bodybuilding and cosmetic surgery so dire that even now, in ''The Wrestler,'' his eyes stare pleadingly out of what looks like a mask of hardened lava and plumber's caulk. The Times critic A. O. Scott put it more kindly when he wrote that Mr. Rourke ''doesn't look like a movie star playing a battered wreck, but like the genuine article.''
 It should also be pointed out that his American comeback is not actually official. Foreign journalists -- members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association -- select Golden Globe winners, and while their picks sometimes presage the Oscars, sometimes they don't. (Pia Zadora won the 1982 Golden Globe for best new actress.)
 Still, the French can gloat over the fact that ''The Wrestler'' opened in American theaters (other Rourke films have been shown only overseas), is doing respectably at the box office and won the actor high praise from even the most discerning critics.
 And accordingly, it's not inconceivable that Mr. Rourke's comeback in Hollywood could invite a backlash across the ocean. There are already a few signs. After the film won at Venice and was picked up by an American distributor, it was featured at the Toronto International Film Festival in October. American critics who saw it there, including Mr. Scott, quite liked it. 
 And that's when some French critics began to find fault. ''We're happy for Mickey Rourke,'' Philippe Garnier of Liberation wrote from the New York Film Festival in October, in a pan that clashed with his colleague's earlier assessment. ''But this sentimental and badly made film is not even 'Rocky.' '' 
 If history is any guide, Mr. Garnier is absolutely right. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about France's affinity for the actor Mickey Rourke misstated the time frame during which his latest film, ''The Wrestler,'' was picked up by an American distributor. It was after the film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, not before. The article also misstated the month that the Toronto festival was held. It was September, not October.

HEADLINE: The Last Hello

BYLINE: By ELLEN KARSH

 BODY:
MAYBE it's my imagination or simply wishful thinking, but it seems to me that there are almost no busybodies in New York. That is one reason I moved to the city when I graduated from college, one reason I love living here and one reason I'll probably never leave.
 I grew up in New Orleans, a city where Jerome, the man who cut my hair all through junior and senior high school, used to whisper to the other clients in his shop (while pointing to the top of my head): ''She's an underachiever; her poor parents are heartbroken.'' Or ''Her brother is a troublemaker at school.'' Or ''Her father drives an Edsel.'' These strangers then turned to me and asked questions like ''Honey, why don't you study a little more, and what does your daddy have against Chevrolets?'' 
 It wasn't just Jerome. Whenever my friends and I were having burgers at the Frost Top or Camellia Grill after school, someone who knew my parents would appear out of nowhere to remind me that I was looking not-so-pleasingly plump and didn't I want to reconsider that double order of fries. Or as she phrased it, ''Ellen, sweetie, not that it's any of my business, but I know your mama would say the same thing if she were here.''
 Maybe if I had been the svelte-cheerleader-honor-roll type, I wouldn't have minded living in a city whose residents believed that it takes a village to shape up a chubby teenager with lousy grades. But the fact was, and not even my mother would have denied this, I was something of a mess during my teenage years. It's a situation I've been trying to overcome ever since, and living in New York, a place where people typically mind their own business, has been helpful. Or so I thought.
 Sure, I'm delighted that my neighbors don't have a clue, or give a hoot, about my weight fluctuations in high school or my brother's behavior in sixth grade. I'm delighted to be an anonymous New Yorker living in a Manhattan high-rise, my home for more than 30 years. 
 Except for the occasional bubbly tenant who tries to make the big city just a little more like Altoona, or New Orleans, by organizing potluck suppers in the lobby, most of my neighbors say nothing more than ''Have a good evening'' or ''Brrr -- it's cold outside'' when we meet in the elevator. Sometimes we just read our mail, pet our dogs and say nothing at all.
 But lately I've been wrestling with an unexpected problem, one that has nothing to do with anyone trying to sneak a look at my dwindling stock portfolio or my bank statement. While I've successfully kept my neighbors at bay all these years, I have, in the process, become so attached to people who aren't my neighbors but who work in my neighborhood -- the ones who sell me my daily newspaper, fill my prescriptions and work in the restaurants and shops -- that I am nearly inconsolable when they move on. 
 One moment there was a bagel shop two doors away from my building, a place where I went practically every day for years and where Linda used to pack up my order and inquire about my poodle. The next morning it was replaced by a CVS Pharmacy. And Linda? Gone. 
 One day I walked over to the family-owned Italian restaurant on the next block only to discover that the restaurant had been boarded up and the family that had owned it was nowhere in sight. Here today, gone later today. 
 The Chinese takeout place that had delivered spicy chicken with garlic sauce to my apartment for about 25 years, a place where Allison, the friendliest person in the world, used to take telephone orders, recently closed without warning. 
 ''This number has been disconnected'' was the only explanation when I called. The fact that Allison used to surprise me with a quart of egg drop soup when I sounded as if I had a cold or an order of spareribs when I mentioned that my cousin was visiting did not mean there were going to be any long or even short goodbyes.
 Most of the time, I didn't even know the last names of the people who worked in my neighborhood. I certainly didn't know where they lived or if they were happy or nervous about business. We'd shoot the breeze day after day, and then one day they'd disappear without looking back, or at least without looking back at me.
 And now that my neighborhood is suddenly cluttered with ''For Rent'' and ''Lost Our Lease'' signs as so many stores are closing in the wake of the economic meltdown, I am realizing that these people probably didn't value our so-called friendships as much as I did. 
 IT'S not that I am quiet and morose; in fact, I'm a regular chatterbox. I talk to the druggist and cashiers and clerks about the weather and the Giants and the noise. I talk to waiters about the food. But I reveal only what I feel comfortable revealing, and they in turn respond only to what I tell them. It's as if they're saying: ''You want to talk about the heat and the noise, fine. But don't mistake our relationship for a friendship. And don't expect me to tell you that business stinks when I leave.'' 
 Now that so many of my favorite neighborhood people have disappeared, their shops taken over by strangers or swallowed up by new condominiums and office buildings, I regret having been such a cold fish. 
 As hard as I've tried to convince myself that I'm a really friendly New Yorker, I still act a lot like that 14-year-old overweight underachiever with the Edsel-driving father and the obnoxious little brother, the girl who slunk around New Orleans hoping nobody would remind her to shed a few pounds and start hitting the books. To my amazement, to my chagrin, I have succeeded.

HEADLINE: Cathedrals of the Iron Horse, Awesome Again

BYLINE: By SIMON WINCHESTER

 BODY:
WHEN railroad passengers from Europe reach London these days, and emerge from the tunnels blinking into the sunlight, they may be forgiven for thinking they have arrived not at a train station, but in the chancel of a vast Victorian cathedral. 
 It is a holy-looking place with a holy-sounding name: St. Pancras. After 50 years of neglect, decay and the threat of demolition only a decade ago, this north London terminal has become once more a consecration of the railway art, a place of soaring ceilings, intricate inlaid stonework, scores of gargoyles, acres of stained glass, fluted iron columns, corbels, crocketed finials -- all the components of ecclesiastic glory on splendid view, and yet for nothing more mundane than the arrival and departure of railway trains.
 More than a billion dollars was spent on the refurbishment, and a year on from its opening, few are the Britons, fewer still the Europeans, who complain. St. Pancras International Station's combination of imperturbable solidity, high church magnificence, much-loved statuary (including one of the poet, John Betjeman, who helped to save it) and the constant and very visible rush and rumble of its trains, has managed to bring flash and glamour and style back to the world of British railways. 
 Not for nothing was the terminal named for a patron saint of children: parents now bring hundreds of youngsters there each day to see and experience a monument to mechanized movement like few others in existence.
 When I was small it was always thus -- at least, it was in London, and I daresay it was in New York and Paris and Berlin, too. Great railway stations were destinations in and of themselves. Their scale was prodigious, their architecture iconic, the materials from which they were made -- marble, oak, granite, iron -- were suitably noble. 
 The ever-changing chatter of towns and countries up on the mechanical timetable boards were the stuff of high romance: trains were leaving for Kyle of Lochalsh, Vladivostok, Cochin, Albuquerque. The hidden loudspeakers squawked a kind of public poetry. 
 And the engines that one glimpsed -- ah! the engines! They steamed and snorted, they dripped oil and fire, they were made from iron and brass and had driving wheels taller than a man and 10 times heavier, and if they belonged to grand lines like the Great Western or the New York Central or the Bombay, Baroda & Central India, then they had green and red and gold liveries polished to a high gloss, and house-proud engineers with fistfuls of cotton waste forever wiping clean each drop of grease or speck of grime.
 But then, as we well know and mourn, the cars and the planes took over, the railways fell from favor, the hiss and chuff and roar of steam was replaced by the drone of oil and electric traction -- and scores of great city railway stations became mausoleums, in the way and out of use. 
 In America this was particularly so: think Denver, Cincinnati, the old Pennsylvania Station. And saddest of all, Oakland's great 16th Street Station, once a Beaux-Arts beauty, replaced by an inglorious shack.
 Some stations, however, were simply built too grand to be allowed to go, and as railroads are said now to be undergoing some kind of revival -- a revival that economists tell us may now actually last for a while -- so these stations, all around the world, are being rediscovered, retooled and reburnished. And travelers are seemingly taking new and great pleasure in the majesty of their making. 
 Grand Central Terminal, New York, is clearly the primus inter pares. New Yorkers (and pretenders, like me) bring visitors just to gaze up at the celestial vaulted ceiling or to look down at views that echo Kurt Hulton's famous photograph of its shafts of midday window-light, to see the swirls of scurrying people around the clock, to watch the meetings and the partings, the happy, the homesick and the homeless. 
 The station may be mainly for the suburbs these days -- for sure, the Harlem Line is hardly the Twentieth Century Limited -- but the structure is magnificent, has great bones. We are proud of Grand Central as we are proud of the Public Library or the Met. Not shamed, as we are by today's Penn Station and the midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal.
 Yet what is missing from Grand Central, and from many American stations, are the trains themselves. All too often in American city terminals, they lurk below ground, down narrow escalators, walled off and separate, like church and state. 
 But in cities where land was more liberally gifted to the railway companies -- mainly in Europe and Asia, for some reason -- immense glass-and-iron train sheds were constructed, and the people, passengers and visitors alike, commingled with the trains they sheltered. 
 St. Pancras, where there is no separation between church and state, is the prime example. But the same was true at Waterloo, at Paddington, at King's Cross, at the Gare du Nord. People were made welcome to come and stand by the locomotives and -- as children, certainly -- talk to the engineers. 
 They could wave farewells, could even walk and hold hands with loved ones as the trains eased outward. They could drop late-written letters into the slots of the overnight mail trains. 
 Nowhere is this more magnificently true than at the station that last November became a well-publicized victim of the currently febrile state of the world (with shootings, and 58 killed, and a heroic station announcer whose calm prevented even greater carnage), the gigantic memorial to High Victorian Indo-Saracenic grandeur that used to be called simply Bombay, Victoria Terminus, or VT. 
 A modestly paid city architect, F. W. Stevens, designed the station in 1888 for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway: it was planned at first for long-distance expresses to Calcutta and Delhi. Today, renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Station, Mumbai, it stands at the center of a spider's web of local commuter lines, and more than two million users pour through it every day. 
 Few of them pause to consider its architectural splendor. The United Nations has named it a World Heritage Site, however, and it is widely regarded as the greatest example of railway architecture, a Victorian temple to what remains, after all, a very Victorian mode of travel. Plus, as Bombay VT, it plays a starring role in the Oscar hopeful ''Slumdog Millionaire.''
 And there are others. I canvassed friends to nominate their favorites, stations that live on as memorials to the best way of surface traveling it is possible to imagine. 
 Two of the Paris stations, the charming Gare de l'Est and the venerable little Gare Lazare, should be on any list, said one; the Yaroslavsky Terminal in Moscow, offered another, since the Trans-Siberian Express leaves from beneath its fairy-tale roof; the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof is simply unforgettable, wrote a colleague in Germany; the chandeliers in Pyongyang's main station are magnificent, e-mailed an acquaintance in Beijing. And I remember liking the vastness of the train-shed in Leipzig, and even the melancholy desertion of Canfranc, a giant and now ruined transit station on the Franco-Spanish border. 
 And there is always Venice. You debark, walk the length of the rake to the ticket barrier and there -- so suddenly that you gasp -- is the canal, and there are bobbing vaporettos, and a gaggle of arguing gondoliers. In a hundred yards, the railway softens into memory: the screech of brakes on iron turns to the sound of footfalls on marble, to the creak of wooden doors, to the lapping of water.

HEADLINE: A Small Town's Recurring Role as a Rescue Beacon

DATELINE: WEEHAWKEN, N.J. 

 BODY:
 You can say it started with Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.
 Actually, it started earlier. There were at least 18 documented duels on the ledge of the Palisades between 1798 and 1845. Some involved other bigwigs, like DeWitt Clinton, a New York senator at the time of his duel, and Commodore Oliver H. Perry. But the most famous duel by far was the one on July 11, 1804, in which Burr, the nation's third vice president, mortally wounded Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury, giving Weehawken its most enduring moment in American history.
 ''That was our first emergency response situation, where they took Hamilton back across the river to the hospital,'' said Richard F. Turner, Weehawken's mayor since 1990. ''It's been going on ever since.'' 
 So on the one hand, there was a one-of-a-kind miracle when 155 passengers and crew members, about 140 of them evacuated on ferries to Weehawken, walked away from the floating wreckage of US Airways Flight 1549.
 On the other, there cannot be many towns of fewer than 15,000 souls that have been players in as many wrecks, disasters and rescues as Weehawken, which covers less than a square mile of land and is about three-quarters of a mile across the Hudson from Midtown Manhattan. But then, not many townships of 15,000 people include the Lincoln Tunnel, light rail stops and a major ferry terminal.
 There were the 700 people evacuated in December 1929 from a ferry that was rammed off 42nd Street while on its way to Weehawken. Then there was the Hoboken pier fire and explosion of inflammable paint ingredients in August 1944 that injured 400 people.
 More recently, tens of thousands of people were evacuated via New York Waterway ferries to Weehawken after 9/11 and during the blackout of 2003. There was also the crash of a helicopter on a sightseeing trip between Manhattan and Weehawken in 2007. And there have been many smaller instances in which the terminal became the prime evacuation destination.
 It's not as if any of this ever becomes routine. But experience and the recognition that the next disaster may be just around the corner does tend to focus the mind. 
 So on the day after the plane crash, people in Weehawken were huddling against the cold, trying to make sense of what had happened.
 They were also trying to get back to normal at Arthur's Landing restaurant, where about 25 passengers, many drenched and shivering, were taken after being evacuated. The restaurant turned up the heat full blast and the night's reservations were canceled. Evacuees were given chef's coats and checkered pants or were wrapped in tablecloths instead of blankets. The restaurant staff served them filet mignon sandwiches, pastrami sandwiches, French fries, soup, coffee, hot chocolate -- anything warm. One passenger ordered a whiskey on the rocks. Others were fed, warmed and comforted at the ferry terminal and a senior center.
 At the Weehawken terminal the day after, ferry service was back to normal, but New Jersey dignitaries like Gov. Jon S. Corzine and Senator Frank R. Lautenberg were on hand to congratulate the workers involved in the evacuation. Straight out of central casting was the 20-year-old ferry captain Brittany Catanzaro, less than two years out of Cliffside Park High School, whose ferry was the second to arrive at the plane.
 ''It looked like a little kid had picked up a plane and put it in a bathtub,'' she said. ''You couldn't believe it was floating there. I kept thinking it's going to sink, so I wanted to get there as quick as I could.''
 It didn't, and she did, playing her part in an episode in which, contrary to the customary script these days, everything somehow went right.
 The rescue of Flight 1549 did not need much context to be unforgettable. If the Bible were being written today, the crash surely would have qualified as a parable of divine intervention.
 But anyone looking for better times after a miserable year -- and with the crash coming on the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration -- might see the episode as a portent, or at least a revelatory break from a world of subprime everything.
 ''First of all, you had a movie script that no one would have believed,'' said John Woloshyn, the general manager of Arthur's Landing, ''and then you had such a quick response from people who just naturally went into save mode -- you see someone in distress, you don't think; you just go.
 ''It's not often you see something where everything works out so well,'' he added. ''And it's a combination as well with what's been going on with the economy, people feeling very apprehensive about a lot of things in their lives. And to have something like this happen, to see human beings performing at their best, it's really kind of rejuvenating.''
