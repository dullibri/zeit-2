HEADLINE: Greenspan's Authority Curtailed On Interest Rates, Officials Say

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Amid a debate at the Federal Reserve Board over whether lower interest rates are needed to help the nation out of recession, the central bank's policy-making body has curtailed the authority of its chairman, Alan Greenspan, to reduce rates on his own, high Government officials said over the weekend.
In his nearly four years as chairman, Mr. Greenspan has never before been so openly challenged by other members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee. Its members include Mr. Greenspan, the 4 other governors of the Federal Reserve Board and the 12 presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks. 
 While the Federal Reserve's directives are never very explicit, the reduced authority means, in effect, that Mr. Greenspan will have a harder time justifying interest rate cuts that he might want to make during the six-week intervals between meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. Should he want to cut rates, he will have to gather more evidence of a weakening economy than he has apparently needed in recent months.
 
A Question of Authority
 The dispute has taken the form of an argument over whether Mr. Greenspan, in reducing short-term interest rates sharply since early January, went beyond the authority granted to him by his colleagues. Supporters of Mr. Greenspan's actions invoke years of tradition to defend his right to act on his own.
But despite the talk about whether Mr. Greenspan exceeded his authority, seven of the Federal Reserve policy makers said in interviews that the heart of the debate is really over this question: Is the recession ending, or is the nation in for many more weeks of hard times? Put another way, the question is whether the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth and insure a recovery, or keep them where they are, confident that a recovery by late summer is a sure thing. Further stimulation might soon become inflationary, they say.
"Anytime people at the Fed become disgruntled with policy or uncertain about it, there is a tendency to focus on procedure," said Wayne D. Angell, a Federal Reserve governor.
High Government officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the focus on procedure prompted the policy makers, at their regular closed-session meeting on March 26, to alter a resolution that had been on the books since last summer. The resolution had put the policy makers on record as "tilted toward easing" interest rates and had given Mr. Greenspan the discretion to cut rates on his own between meetings, without first consulting with the others in a telephone conference call, if the unfolding economic data showed the economy to be very weak.
The Government officials said they did not know precisely what changes had been made, but they said Mr. Greenspan's earlier authorization to cut interest rates on his own had been diluted.
Mr. Greenspan had used that earlier power to reduce rates on three occasions since early January, most recently on March 8, the day the Labor Department announced that the nation's unemployment rate in February had risen by three-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.5 percent. A similar rise in March, announced on Friday, was not quickly followed by a rate reduction.
Lower interest rates tend to stimulate borrowing for consumption and investment, thus counteracting the recession. The Federal Reserve mainly controls the interest rates that banks pay to borrow money, which they then relend to the public for things like home mortgages and car loans. The Federal Reserve's recent rate reductions have allowed mortgage rates to decline, providing some stimulation to the moribund housing market.
The dispute over Mr. Greenspan's right to act on his own arose in February, when the policy makers began to disagree over what might happen to the economy next, the policy makers interviewed said. Until then, the open market committee had given its blessing to frequent reductions in interest rates, starting last fall, to counteract the recession.
The 17 members of the committee are now divided into two factions. Roughly half believe the recession has passed its nadir and a recovery is under way. They argue that the various reductions in short-term interest rates, totaling more than two percentage points since July, are sufficient. More reductions might encourage too much economic activity in the coming rebound, creating an inflation problem in the future, they say.
Reflecting the thinking of this group, Robert P. Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said: "There is some evidence out there that a rebound might be beginning. My guess is that it will not be a terribly strong one. But economists have underpredicted in the past the strength of rebounds from recessions."
Mr. Angell is also said to be a member of the group that foresees an early rebound, as are Robert T. Parry, Roger Guffey and W. Lee Hoskins, presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco, Kansas City and Cleveland, respectively.
 
Need for 'a Little Insurance'
 The other group is not sure the nadir has been passed. Some believe that further rate cuts might be in order as insurance that the economy will revive.
Mr. Greenspan is reported to be in this group, which also includes David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman; Edward W. Kelley Jr., a governor, and three or more regional bank presidents, among them Robert P. Forrestal of Atlanta, Silas Keehn of Chicago and Edward G. Boehne of Philadelphia.
"The forecast of an economic rebound in the second half of the year is a very reasonable one," Mr. Forrestal said. "But there are risks to that forecast, and I would prefer to have a little insurance to take into account the uncertainty. My preference would be to cut rates a bit more."
That apparently was also Mr. Greenspan's preference in early February, when he lowered a bank borrowing rate by half a percentage point and was challenged by the optimists among the policy makers. Previously he had pushed rates down only one-quarter of a percentage point at a time.
At the Feb. 8 meeting, some policy makers were annoyed that Mr. Greenspan had acted so decisively just a few days before they met, without waiting to consult them.
"The question of whether the delegation of authority to Mr. Greenspan was meant to be as much as a half a percentage point, or only a quarter of a percentage point, under our directive, is the major part of the issue," Mr. Guffey said. "The other part of the issue is the need to consult when some action is taken that appears to be unusual."
The discussion continued at the March 26 meeting, but in calmer tones, the policy makers said in interviews. Some described the meeting as a reconciliation, and Mr. Parry said, "More has been made out of this so-called tiff than is really the case."
The Fed directly controls two interest rates. One is the discount rate, what the Federal Reserve charges banks that borrow directly from it. The other, called the Federal funds rate, governs what banks charge on loans to each other. In the late 1980's, interbank borrowing became far and away the most important source of money, and that made the Federal funds rate the focus of Fed policy.
 
Predicament Continues
 In the past, when the two sources of money were more equal, the Federal Reserve's chairman could alter rates between meetings without consulting but would not on his own change the difference between the discount and Federal funds rate. Some policy makers invoked this old procedure as justification for Mr. Greenspan's action in early February, when he reduced the discount rate and the Federal funds rate by half a point, to 6 percent.
Despite the big reduction, the spread between the two rates did not change and Mr. Greenspan did not have to consult the other policy makers in a conference call, they argued. Still, Mr. Greenspan remains in a predicament. By law, he and the four other governors have the right to lower the discount rate. But they share with the regional bank presidents authority over the Federal funds rate. Between meetings, Mr. Greenspan has the power to change this rate, in accordance with the policy makers' directives.
Supporters of this view say that Mr. Greenspan should continue to exercise his delegated authority without having to consult by telephone with the other policy makers each time he acts. They say that if he gives in on this point, he might undermine the future right of the chairman to act without consultation, a precedent developed over decades. But others say the issue will evaporate once the policy makers come to agreement on what's ahead for the economy.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
How Politics, Not Voters, Molds Budget In New York

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 7

 BODY:
Schoolchildren, motorists and nursing-home patients. Library users, beachgoers and business executives. All these groups, indeed, virtually all of New York's 18 million residents, are affected by the state budget.
But budget negotiations are rarely conducted with them in mind. Instead, like a school play put on for parents, they are usually staged for a small group of interested, or more often, self-interested, parties. 
Even with New York facing money problems of historic proportions, it is still the internal dramatics of the State Legislature, more than the needs or desires of the voters, that are shaping budget negotiations. And if these negotiations seem deadlocked six days after a new budget was due, it is not because of political pressures from the outside. It is because each legislative leader is receiving enough support from his own members and from major lobbying groups to believe he does not yet have to alter his lines.
"Obviously, they're playing to their own constituencies," one former state official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Everybody's got a nice comfy spot."
 
'Storm and Fury Signifying Nothing'
 The major players in the budget talks -- the Governor, the Assembly Speaker and the Senate majority leader -- have real policy differences which, in turn, have substantive implications for state residents. And these differences are based on real clashes of interests, most clearly between New York City groups hoping to hang on to social services and suburbanites worried about tax increases or cuts in school aid.
But the longer the negotiations drag on, the more distant these real concerns seem to become and the more importance the daily exchange of press releases takes on.
"It becomes a self-contained universe," one Assembly staff member said. "It's a lot of storm and fury signifying nothing."
Beyond the State Capitol, however, the budget delay is exacting a real cost.
Because of the delay, the state will be unable to make $1.3 billion in payments to local school districts due the middle of the month. Many of these districts will have to borrow to tide them over, with interest they can ill afford at a time of state cuts.
New York City has already said that it will have to borrow $1 billion if state aid payments expected at the end of the month do not arrive. And uncertainty about how much state aid the city will eventually receive has prompted Mayor David N. Dinkins to seek to delay submitting his own budget, which is supposed to be presented on April 26.
"We view it as a significant problem," the city budget director, Philip R. Michael, said of the delay.
 
Like a Family Feud
 But the dismay of local officials has not yet reached a pitch that would impinge on the workings of the State Capitol. In almost daily press briefings, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has tried to manufacture a sense of urgency, but to no avail. Most lawmakers say that as long as the Governor continues to send up emergency bills to pay state workers -- something many states do not allow -- the stalemate could last for weeks.
Watching the Governor and the legislative leaders go at it, it appears that one has stumbled on to some long-running family feud in which no one can remember why he or she is angry anymore.
The heavy in this feud appears to be the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat.
Mr. Miller has broken openly with the Governor, a fellow Democrat, and over the Governor's strenuous objections, called for an income-tax increase of almost $1 billion. An informal supporter of higher gasoline taxes in the past, Mr. Miller has also rebuffed the Governor's call for a 10-cent-a-gallon increase this year.
 
Making Sense Politically
 Aides to Mr. Miller insist that he has assumed this stance simply because he believes it is the fairest solution. But the Speaker's actions make sense fully only in the context of internal politics.
Recently weakened by an indictment for mail fraud, Mr. Miller has come under strong pressure from the liberal wing of the Assembly, most notably the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus, to restore many of the social-service cuts proposed by the Governor. The Speaker's income-tax increase is intended to do this and to mollify his traditional liberal supporters.
For Mr. Miller's traditional New-York-City-based supporters, the proposed gas-tax increase, which falls heavily on upstate residents and suburbanites, makes sense. And yet he has said it is dead, largely, it seems, to gain advantage over the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino.
Throughout recent negotiations, Mr. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican, has maintained that he would prefer not to pass any tax increases at all, and that the state should reduce spending. At the same time, however, he has made it clear that he will not approve a budget that does not substantially increase aid to suburban school districts.
 
Maintaining Peace
 This inconsistent stance has allowed Mr. Marino to maintain peace within his own often fractious Republican conference, and to satisfy two powerful constituencies: business and suburban school districts.
"Politically, everyone is where he wants to be," the former state official said. "Mel is Mr. Liberal and Ralph is Mr. Frugality."
The Assembly Speaker's opposition to the gasoline tax has presented Mr. Marino with three equally uncomfortable options: He can resurrect the gasoline tax, an anathema to his own upstate and suburban constituents; he can offer some other tax, or he can offer spending cuts. All he has indicated is that he does not plan to openly embrace any of these options.
As the most visible politician in the state, it is Governor Cuomo who is suffering the largest political loss as the Legislature debates his controversial budget interminably. Yet Mr. Cuomo has been relatively inflexible, refusing even to discuss the possibiity of broad-based tax increases.
Aides to the Governor say that despite the obvious political costs of the delay, Mr. Cuomo is essentially comfortable with his position. Not only is it the right one for real economic reasons, they say, but also for political reasons. It shows the Governor is prepared to make unpopular decisions and stick with them.
"They're having a terrible time coming to grips with the new economic realities," the Governor's chief of staff, Gerald C. Crotty, said of the legislative leaders. "We've made the tough choices."

HEADLINE: Bush Pledges To Fight for Mexico Pact

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 7

 BODY:
President Bush promised today to fight organized labor "head on head" to win Congressional approval of a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
Speaking at a joint news conference with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Mr. Bush said "we're in for a battle," but he emphasized that his Administration was "committed totally" to the trade accord. 
 This was the first time since the end of the war with Iraq that Mr. Bush has used the Presidential pulpit to call attention to an economic matter, in recognition that the trade issue will be a focus of political attention during the next few weeks.
Negotiation of a trade pact with Mexico and resumption of international trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade depend on Mr. Bush's ability to retain what are called fast-track procedures.
Under those rules, Congress can only approve or disapprove trade agreements in full and cannot amend them. The existing fast-track authority will extend for another two years unless the Senate or House of Representatives votes by June 1 to block the continuation.
Most of the opposition to a Mexican trade agreement comes from labor unions. They fear that American companies will move to Mexico, where wages are lower and environmental regulations more lax, and that American workers will lose jobs as a result.
In Congress, Democratic lawmakers who accept the view of labor have joined forces with colleagues from farm and textile states who want to prevent the resumption of international trade talks. Those talks, if successful, would probably lead to more competition from abroad for American agriculture and textile interests.
On the fast-track question, President Bush has solid support from Republicans in Congress and is backed by several important Democrats, including Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Finance Committee. Still, he is unlikely to prevail without a struggle.
"Some elements in organized labor are fighting it," the President said today. "They are wrong. And I'm going to take them on head on head because I know that this is in the best interest of our country."
Mr. Salinas stopped here on his way to Ottawa for a state visit. He will also make brief stops in other American cities to promote the trade agreement.

HEADLINE: Corporate Chiefs See Need For U.S. Health-Care Action

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
A survey on health care, taken among chief executives of the nation's largest companies, has found that 91 percent of them say a fundamental change or complete rebuilding of the health-care system is needed.
The survey also found that 73 percent of the executives said the problems could not be solved by companies working on their own. A majority said Government intervention was necessary. 
 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which had the Gallup Organization conduct the survey, said in a report, "While there may not yet be consensus on these problems, business could be a determining factor in creating the political will to proceed."
While a large number of surveys on the topic have been done, this is the first to reach a large, representative sample of chief executives of the largest corporations in America. "It is precisely those business executives who are most likely to be influential in the debate over health-care reform," the foundation said.
The report said the two main issues were control of the cost of health care and access to the system for more people. Executives said Government intervention in both areas was needed, but they varied greatly on just what the Government might do.
They were wary of direct governmental control of the health-care industry. Three-quarters said the employer-based insurance structure should be kept, while 25 percent said it should be replaced. The most unpopular proposal was for the Government to control the number of specialists in medicine -- only 6 percent said the Government should take such action now, and 12 percent said it should be considered in the future.
The creation now of a universal, Government-run health-care system was suggested by 9 percent, while 24 percent said this option should be considered for the future. The idea was opposed by 66 percent.
For years, public health officials and consumer groups have advocated an overhaul of the way people get health care and how they pay for it. These critics say the system leaves 32 million people with no insurance and perhaps another 70 million with seriously inadequate coverage, while offering a lower quality of care than in many other industrial nations by several measures.
As a matter of politics, the shift among business executives is crucial.
"We need both business and labor if there is to be any chance to get national reform adopted," said Ron Pollack, executive director of the Families U.S.A. Foundation, a nonprofit Washington group specializing in issues of concern to the elderly poor. "Especially in a Republican Administration, there is simply no chance of getting anything adopted if we don't get the support of business."
Mr. Pollack said: "It is unclear whether any of the business groups will come forward with a proposal that will get any significant support. But they are discussing the issues, they are quite serious, and it is now clear to them that things cannot go on as they are now."
 
Companies' Steps Ineffective
 It has been known for some time that the cost of health care to business was becoming more painful, and that businesses were taking action on their own and in small groups to try to cut back costs.
"What you see is business waking up to the fact that there is a serious problem, and they are waking up now particularly because they tried individually to cut costs," said Edmund F. Haislmaier, a policy analyst on health for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy research organization in Washington. "But now they are moving toward the realization they can't do it themselves."
The United States' health-care system is the most expensive in the world, costing 40 percent more per capita than that of Canada, the country in second place, and as much as double the cost in other nations. Businesses have watched with growing apprehension as health-care spending devoured ever larger portions of their profits. In the 1960's, businesses spent on health care about 4 to 8 cents of each dollar of profits. Now, it is 25 to 50 cents for each dollar.
 
Behind in Life Expectancy
 Even though Americans pay the most, life expectancy in the United States ranks below that of 15 nations, and infant mortality is worse than in 22 other countries.
The effects of high costs have been felt strongly by business leaders. "When we feel the heat, we see the light," said Dr. Theodore Cooper, the chairman of the Upjohn Company.
Drastic increases in the cost of the health system have now convinced them that something must be done. After trying and failing to get a grip on medical care costs themselves, they have accepted the idea that change must be national, not piecemeal or local, according to the new survey and several others conducted in the last year or so.
No agreement has been reached among businesses on exactly what kind of shift is best, and large businesses appear more ready to act than small ones, but scores, even hundreds of business coalitions and commissions have been formed and are devising plans for national changes.
 
The Emerging Approaches
The emerging approaches fall into several general categories. One is called "play or pay," in which American businesses would be required to offer health coverage to their employees or pay a premium to a Federal or state pool so that all uncovered Americans could get insurance.
Another is called a "single payer" system, in which the Government pays all health-care costs, all Americans are covered, and the system is paid for through some kind of tax.
There is a conservative approach called the "tax reform" approach in which employees are given the money employers now pay to cover workers and are expected to buy their own insurance. This money to cover insurance would be taxed at a rate that would give breaks to those with lower incomes and to those not seeking full coverage with "all the extras."
 
Types of Regulation Supported
 The following types of Government regulation were supported by the executives:
*Sixty percent said the Government should act now to "make greater use of selective contracting to purchase services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs." Another 29 percent said this should be an option for the future.
*Fifty-one percent said the Government should act now to offer tax incentives that would encourage small businesses to provide health benefits. Twenty-nine percent said the Government should require all employers to provide health benefits, and another 24 percent said mandatory coverage should be an option for the future.
*Forty-seven percent said the Government should establish standards for all medical care, and another 27 percent wanted this option considered later.
*Forty percent said the Government should expand existing public programs to cover more of the uninsured, and an additional 39 percent wanted this option considered in the future.
*Thirty-three percent said the Government should create a single set of reimbursement rules for hospitals and doctors to be used by all private insurers as well as Government. Another 28 percent wanted this option for the future.
 
End of 'Leave It Alone' Attitude
 Lawrence Atkins, a Washington health policy consultant at the New York law firm Winthrop Stimson Putnam & Roberts, said: "Not long ago another option people listed was 'leave it alone -- don't do anything major.' That option is not on the list for most businesses anymore."
He continued: "Two years ago I could characterize the business position for you quickly: Don't increase the Government role, no matter what; nothing should be mandated for employers; cost control can best be done by us operating alone. If the market is open, people said, it will come up with the right solution."
Mr. Atkins said that attitude had changed. "At a minimum, people who look into it do see a crisis, and an important role for the Government, even though they don't want the Government to run the entire system," he added.

HEADLINE: In Freeze's Wake, Desperation for Citrus Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EXETER, Calif., April 5

 BODY:
Since they were youngsters, Jose and Delia Ayon toiled under the California sun to pick and pack the fruits and vegetables that fill American supermarkets. Now they cannot get enough food for their seven children, and they face losing the small house they built with their own hands.
The Ayons and thousands of other farm workers are part of a human calamity that is unfolding across the San Joaquin Valley in central California as a result of the freeze in December that destroyed the orange and lemon crops and put thousands out of work. 
 Eviction notices, foreclosures, desperation, shame and hunger are sweeping through communities like this, overwhelming relief workers.
"I have never seen anything like this before," said Lali Moheno, a community services aide who has spent 22 years working with migrant farm workers. "This is the first time I've wanted to quit work. We are physically worn out. None of us have ever experienced such a disaster."
Unlike earthquakes, floods and other disasters, the freeze has inflicted its devastation slowly. It is only now, as workers run out of savings and realize there will be little work for another year or more, that the enormity of their misfortune has begun to sink in.
Families, almost entirely Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, line up at a food bank here, one of 50 in Tulare County. They are so hungry that they can often be seen breaking open the weekly rations as they leave.
Leaders of FoodLink, the not-for-profit agency that supplies the banks, estimate that they provide only one-third of the food that is needed. They say infants lack adequate nourishment because mothers are using dried milk instead of formula, whose cost puts it out of their reach.
Particularly poignant is the plight of the thousands of Mexican families who, under terms of the amnesty granted under immigration law, are barred from applying for public assistance, including welfare and food stamps, for five years. Faced with hungry children, many have risked applying anyway, or have returned to Mexico.
 
Cooperation Had Been Rare
 The crisis has produced a level of cooperation between employers and workers that people on both sides say is without parallel in California agriculture in the last half-century. Within days of the freeze, an Agricultural Workers Freeze Relief Task Force was formed; it now includes 80 people representing 52 organizations and businesses in Tulare County. Owners of closed packing houses have solicited food donations throughout the state, and trucking companies have provided trucks to distribute it.
Help from the Federal Government has been slow, but now appears to be forthcoming. At the request of Gov. Pete Wilson, President Bush has declared a state of emergency in 33 counties, and officials here say that on Monday or Tuesday the President is expected to sign an order authorizing emergency housing aid for up to a year from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Housing has become the most critical issue as families are forced to double and triple up and landlords face foreclosure on loans.
Graphic reminders of the freeze, which hit from Dec. 21 to 25, are everywhere. Millions of navel and Valencia oranges lie rotting in the groves throughout Tulare, Fresno and Kern Counties, the center of the citrus industry. The loss to the growers was $500 million, and packers and shippers lost $500 million, said Curtis D. Lynn, Tulare County director for the University of California Cooperative Extension in Visalia.
Mr. Lynn estimates that the freeze killed 52 million cartons of navel oranges, 46 million cartons of Valencia oranges and 5 million cartons of lemons. He said there was extensive damage to other crops, including avocados, olives, pistachios, sugar beets and winter vegetables.
More than 15,000 pickers and packers were laid off almost immediately, and the ripple effect has been ruinous for groceries, restaurants, clothing stores and other businesses in Exeter and nearby towns, including Lindsay, Tulare and Visalia, the county seat.
Unemployment in Tulare Countywas 21.7 percent in February, compared with 12.3 percent a year ago.
That statistic includes Delia and Jose Ayon.
 
Watching Gains Disappear
 After years of deprivation, living in migrant camps and tiny, crammed apartments, the Ayons found a measure of dignity when they built their own house three years ago with help from a Government program for low-income people. Normally, this would be the busiest time of the year for Mr. Ayon, who used to earn about $300 a week plucking navel oranges from October until May, when the Valencias start.
But since Mr. Ayon was laid off in January, the family has relied on unemployment insurance and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, a Government program for low-income people. They are a month behind on paying the mortgage, $313 a month including taxes and insurance, and they talk of closing the house, pulling the children out of school and going to Oregon and Washington to pick cherries and apples this summer and fall.
"We don't want to lose this house," said Mrs. Ayon, as six of her seven children listened in their small living room. "Who will rent to seven kids? This place was like a palace for us."
Saving families like the Ayons from homelessness has become the top priority for United Way and other social-service agencies. "It has reached the breaking point," said Cathi Lamp, an economist and nutritionist at the cooperative extension and president of the FoodLink board. "Rent and utilities are the first priority; food is a close second. It's cheaper to keep them in their homes than to get back on their feet if they're homeless."
Carolyn Rose, executive director of Community Services and Employment Training, a private not-for-profit community action organization that operates in Tulare County, said that more than 2,700 families had requested help with housing and utility payments and that the agency could help only 200. She said landlords and lenders had been extraordinarily lenient but were close to exhausting their capacity.
In addition, utility companies have been quite generous, she said. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, for example, has set up a special $25,000 fund to forgive the bills of the unemployed.
As for food, Sandy Beals, executive director of FoodLink for Tulare County, said the agency was stretched to the limit. "The typical family comes in and says it has no food," she said. "They get a 35-pound food basket for a week. For a family of eight, that does not last long. Children are going to school hungry."
Worker advocates have been moved at the response to the workers' troubles by employers like Sunkist Growers, LoBue Brothers and Shropshire Trucking, and by the Farm Bureau Federation, which represents growers. Relations between the bureau, as a representative of the employers, and labor representing the workers have often been bitter in previous years.
There have been other sources of help.
The Farmers Home Administration is offering low-interest loans to family farmers. The Federal Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service has provided nearly half of the food supply to FoodLink, as well as school lunches in Tulare County. And the Federal Labor Department has provided disaster unemployment assistance to workers ineligible for state unemployment benefits.
In all this, one group remains in limbo -- the thousands of Mexican families who claimed amnesty after the 1987 immigration law was enacted. They jeopardize their status here if they apply for many public assistance programs to cope with the freeze.
Soledad and Herminio Cruz, from Oaxaca state in southeastern Mexico, for example, have lived in Exeter for eight years, picking fruit. They took amnesty and two years ago bought a small house behind a chain-link fence on the edge of town, where they live with their four children, ages 15 months to 10 years. Mrs. Cruz is pregnant with a fifth child.
Given their immigration status, the Cruzes hesitated to apply for food stamps. But with no savings and a family of crying mouths, they risked it. The family is trying to decide whether to sell the house and return to Mexico for now.
Little relief is in sight.
Given the damage to the citrus trees, 60 percent to 70 percent of the usual crop is expected to be harvested later this year and next. This means that unemployment and deprivation will be the norm here long after the sun has warmed the orange and lemon groves of central California.

HEADLINE: For 7th Avenue's Garment Industry, Nowhere to Go but Up

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
Designers worked late and ate deli. Stringbean-slim models hurried up and down in grimy freight elevators for last-minute fittings. Hems were pinned up and then let down again, as the garment center, New York's No. 1 manufacturing industry, cranked up and painted its face last week for another round of seasonal showings.
The fall fashion shows, which begin today and continue almost hourly throughout the week, come at a pivotal time for the industry, with some design companies hanging by their fingertips after a period of recession and international crisis. Executives say they are banking on lower prices, new styles and pent-up demand to lead the way for an industry recovery. 
 In fashion, where spring means it is time to think fall, hope also springs eternal. But behind the exhaust-smudged facades of Seventh Avenue, where impossibly pretty women slip in and out of incredibly expensive clothes, business has been bad. Fabulously bad.
 
Mainstay of Fashion Houses
 While the rest of the country sank into a recession, New York's garment industry seemed to go underwater. Industry executives said the fashion business was already in its own recession -- brought on by the stock-market crash and a wave of retail bankruptcies -- when the general recession hit the rest of the country.
Then the Persian Gulf war further chilled consumer demand, followed by more retail bankruptcies, including those of the Carter Hawley Hale stores in California and smaller clothing chains like Buffums in California, L. L. Berger in the Northeast and Mantaldo's in the Southeast. Small specialty stores like those are a mainstay of many fashion houses.
Some executives have been privately using the "D" word: depression.
Sales in stores that specialize in clothing were down nationally 3.3 percent in January, as against the same period last year, Census Bureau statistics show, and they declined 3 percent in February. In real terms, adjusting for inflation and price changes, the declines were 8.9 percent and 7.3 percent.
"Well before the recession women had already got out of the habit of shopping," Bill Blass said on Friday, as he put the finishing touches on his collection. "Even the very rich women I know got out of the habit."
But Mr. Blass said he had to put such thoughts out of mind for the moment, as he fitted a puffed silk skirt on Yasmeen Ghauri, a model.
 
Market Has Many Levels
 Assessments of New York's garment business tend to be somewhat impressionistic. There are many levels of the apparel market, from novelty T-shirts to designer collections, and it is difficult even to get a count, since many companies have multiple divisions operating in more than one country.
The American Association of Apparel Manufacturers, an industry group in Washington, estimates the total number of apparel makers in the United States at 10,000 to 12,000, with about 2,000 to 3,000 of them in New York. But the fashion houses whose styles determine what women will wear number a couple of dozen.
As a whole, the industry has clearly been hurting, especially in recent months. Unemployment in the industry -- the largest manufacturing employer in New York City -- was 12.3 percent in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost twice the overall national average.
"November and December were really grim," said Robert Duffy, the president of Perry Ellis Sportswear, as he wove his way among seamstresses stitching sequins onto dresses and workers installing a runway in the company's showroom for this evening's show. "January and February were terrible too. But in the last three weeks, sales have increased 50 percent. I'm confident."
While Perry Ellis plans a full-scale fashion show, with more than 100 styles, many smaller houses have curtailed their collections. Some of New York's rising stars, like Ronaldus Shamask, M. W. Moss, Badgley Mischka and Gordon Henderson, have canceled their fall shows. One of New York's brightest young designers, Patricia Clyne, has closed her doors.
The number of designers who show in the ballrooms of Fifth Avenue hotels, like the Plaza and the Pierre, is down by about half the usual, to three. The cost of mounting such shows is about $250,000 (one has to sell quite a few $2,000 dresses to net that much in profit).
But some industry executives have their periscopes up, looking for brightness on the horizon. For one thing, there were fewer American retailers at the fall fashion shows in Europe last month. But with so many retail buyers having stayed away from Milan, London and Paris, fashion houses here reason that the stores will have more money to order American clothes.
 
A Revolution in Pricing
 "It's an incredible opportunity for people who have their act together to make a killing," said Randolph Duke, a New York designer whose business doubled after a well-received spring collection. "With European prices high and buyers staying away from Europe, the money is going to be here."
There is also a not-so-quiet revolution in pricing going on. Many houses have introduced less-expensive lines with much fanfare in the last year, including Michael Kors and Anne Klein.
"Business is tough, but there seems to be a glimmer of hope," said Carolyne Roehm, who also plans to introduce a lower-priced collection. Even in their regular high-end collections, designers have held prices down by emphasizing less costly fabrics.
"I'm very conscious of prices now when I select the fabrics," said Calvin Klein, whose fall fashion show tomorrow will include a group of wool-and-Lycra pieces and another group in lamb's wool mixed with cashmere.
There has been wide apprehension in the industry that the retail climate has forced many marginal or undercapitalized companies out of business. There were 87 apparel-company business failures in New York City in 1990, up from 25 in 1989, according to statistics compiled by the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. But there were also 87 such failures in 1988 and 80 in 1984.
"For New York City in 1990, it's not an unusual figure," said Tiziana Mohorovic, a business analyst with Dun & Bradstreet. "There was a dramatic increase in bankruptcy over all in 1990, in every major industry."
Businesses may be closing their doors, but that's nothing new on Seventh Avenue.
"I take bankruptcies with a grain of salt," said Bud Konheim, the president of Nicole Miller, which is holding a show on Wednesday. "All my life guys have been filing for bankruptcy on Seventh Avenue. We had the best year of our lives in 1990, and we're 50 percent ahead of last year right now."
Mr. Konheim, who has been in business in the garment center since 1955, said he believed a sea change in fashion and disruptions in the market had caused a shake-up in the industry.
In the 1970's, he said, most Seventh Avenue companies were domestic manufacturers. Toward the end of the decade, entrepreneurs began to discover Hong Kong, where a garment bought in a New York deparment store could be copied in vast quantities at low cost.
The result was a tremendous increase in products and labels, which coincided with the fast national expansion of many retailers. But as the prices in Hong Kong and other Asian manufacturing centers went up -- and the United States retail chains began to experience problems -- the fashion business found itself overproduced and with too many stores.
Executives also said hard times in the fashion business should be viewed in the context of an overall historical trend -- the shrinking of Seventh Avenue -- rather than as a sudden precipitous decline. As Walter Mankoff, the associate director of research for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, noted, employment in the New York's apparel industry has been declining steadily for many years.
In fact, the city's manufacturing base was eroding even before the onslaught of inexpensive Asian imports in the 1970's and 80's, as the more casual styles of the 60's and 70's led to a departure of manufacturing jobs to regions like the South and California.
"This is about as bad as it has been," Mr. Mankoff said, referring to the plight of garment workers in the city.
One thing that will drive the business this fall, Mr. Klein said, is pent-up demand. "Women who work need clothes," he said. "I think people have held back because they felt it wasn't the moment to spend money. I think that's changing. I haven't felt this optimistic in years."

HEADLINE: New Assembly Hall Opening At the Brooklyn Museum

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
Never mind the cuts in staff, the reductions in visiting hours, the pared-to-the-bone economies that the city's financial plight has thrust on it. Tomorrow there'll be joy at the Brooklyn Museum.
Thanks to a team of top-flight architects, a pair of angels who came up with $3.5 million, New York City's capital budget and private donors, the museum will open a brand-new auditorium, the first completed public space in its drive to carry out an ambitious master plan whose eventual cost museum officials say is impossible to estimate. 
 "It expresses our confidence in the future of the museum and of Brooklyn," said the museum's director, Robert T. Buck, who pointed out that the new hall was the first formal gathering place in the Beaux-Arts building since its original auditorium was converted into the present Grand Lobby more than 50 years ago.
A jewel among small assembly spaces in the city, the new auditorium -- on the third floor of the museum -- was designed by Arata Isozaki and James Stewart Polshek. It is only the second example in New York City of work by Mr. Isozaki, the eminent Japanese architect who designed the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. In New York, he did the interior of the Palladium, a discotheque, in 1985.
"Our auditorium is the first new architecture worthy of the concepts of McKim, Mead & White, who designed the original museum in 1893," said Mr. Buck of the Isozaki-Polshek team.
The new hall is part of a three-stage renovation that has already provided new art storage space and is to result next year in three new floors of galleries in the old West Wing. The museum is strapped for operational funds; over the last year it has cut its visiting days to five a week from six, and has eliminated a number of staff positions, among them the curatorships of the print and costume departments. But so far, nearly $25 million of the $31 million needed for the renovation has been raised. Fourteen million dollars -- almost half of the $31 million total -- was allocated in the late 1980's from the city's capital budget, and the rest has come from individual donors and foundations. The auditorium was finished with a $3.5 million gift from Iris and B. Gerald Cantor, who have made previous donations to the Brooklyn and the Metropolitan museums. The auditorium will be named for the couple.
 
Undulations of Tranquillity
 "This is the first visible piece of a very grand master plan that could go over decades before being fully realized," said Mr. Polshek, "and so we felt it had to make some statement about optimism and the future, and it had to be very special in certain ways."
Although it is an intimate room, seating only 460 people, the auditorium gives an impression of grand space. Its most distinctive feature is a ceiling of white plaster composed of a series of rhythmic undulations -- technically described as intersecting hyperbolic paraboloids -- mathematically modeled by a computer. Mr. Isozaki has used the concept, which he said was intended to evoke tranquillity, in Japanese buildings. But the auditorium ceiling in Brooklyn is technically more complicated.
"For architects, it was just a doodle on a piece of paper," said Mr. Polshek. "But for acousticians it was a difficult mathematical exercise, and they bickered over it a good deal. The doubly warped surface could be compared with dozens of English horse saddles joined together, and sound bounces off it in ways that had to be calculated very carefully."
Even so, the auditorium will be used mainly for lectures, symposiums and film and video presentations, and thus does not have the rigorous acoustical requirements of a large performance space. The ceiling's sophisticated surface is complemented by such elegant design details as the series of lighting fixtures in stainless steel that project from the walls and carry out the ceiling's curve.
The walls and movable stage partitions are paneled in bleached oak, with the grain of each panel carefully matched to the next one, and outlined by stainless steel gridding. The stage's bow front is faced with stainless steel panels with a lustrous finish achieved by a process called shot-peening, normally used for jet engines and weaponry, in which the metal is blasted by small ceramic beads. The seats -- upholstered in mohair -- and the carpeting are a cool gray, intended to harmonize with the gunmetal color of the steel.
On the large stage, Joan Darragh, the vice president for architecture and planning at the museum, pointed with pride to the way the panels of the stage backdrop parted electronically to reveal a screen for films. The panels are controlled from what Ms. Darragh called a "state of the art" podium, a kind of command center veneered with silver bird's-eye maple from which light, sound and other effects can also be regulated. The new auditorium, which has one balcony, also has a projection room furnished with sophisticated equipment. The Cantor auditorium replaces the original 1,500-seat assembly hall, now the museum's ground-floor lobby. The change occurred in the mid-1930's, when the museum's grand exterior staircase, leading to a second-floor lobby, was removed in the interests of easier access.
Since then, the museum has made do with a temporary lecture hall carved out of a gallery known as the Renaissance Hall on the third floor. As part of the renovation phase, the hall has now been refitted to provide 10,000 square feet of high-technology storage for paintings, sculptures and costume items.
The success of the Isozaki-Polshek partnership, in which two renowned architects joined forces, is unusual in the field, Mr. Buck pointed out. The architects did not know each other well before each was invited to enter the museum's master plan competition in 1986. Since the competition required that a foreign architect join with a New York firm, Mr. Isozaki -- known for his museum work in Japan, and nearly finished with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles -- approached Mr. Polshek's firm, James Stewart Polshek & Partners.
It was a fitting match, since Mr. Polshek is known for restoration work on historic buildings, and was at that time completing the renovation of Carnegie Hall. The two entered and won the competition as a joint venture.
"The big question was, what do you do inside one of this country's most distinguished Beaux-Arts buildings?" Mr. Polshek said. "Do you use a pastiche of the Beaux-Arts style, or post-modern gimmickry? That's where we brought different strengths and attitudes to this project."
The auditorium will undergo its first public use on Saturday, with a daylong symposium, "Albert Bierstadt: Art and Enterprise," and the first in a seven-part film retrospective in the evening, "William Greaves: Chronicler of the African-American Experience."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL '91BASEBALL '91;
Let the Bats and Patriotism Ring to Celebrate a New Season

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
There is always an urgency for the dawning of the major league baseball season. Adults call in sick for work and sneak away to the ball park on opening day. Children buy fresh packs of baseball cards. Presidents throw out first balls.
Ever-expanding newspaper box scores are devoured and the optimistic talk about this player and that team, which dominated winter conversations and shortened cold nights, becomes real or idealistic in scenes on the diamonds before us. 
 When the first pitch of the season is thrown this afternoon in Detroit, in one of the eight games scheduled to be played, the urgency to sing the national anthem, join the seventh-inning stretch and revel in the charms of baseball may be more fervent than ever before.
 
The Time Is Right
 There is reason to stand and rejoice, what with the United States beaming over its victory in the Persian Gulf war and the economy apparently rounding into shape. Most of the memories of last year's lockout and the travails of Pete Rose and George Steinbrenner, which tarnished the season and made it ugly, have been purged.
What better time for baseball to come swinging back into our consciousness? And interest this season seems boundless.
The Mets expect to be sold out for today's opener with the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea Stadium and the Yankees could sell out their home opener next Monday with the Chicago White Sox.
 
Increased Ticket Sales
 Of the 26 major league teams, more than half have maintained or increased their season-ticket sales; there are about 50 hardcover baseball books being released this spring; USA Today introduced a weekly newspaper devoted strictly to baseball last Friday, and six cities are feverishly battling for the right to pay $95 million and become home for the two expansion teams that the National League adds in 1993.
Miami, one of those cities involved in the fight, drew 125,013 fans to two exhibition games at Joe Robbie Stadium last weekend. And the rarest baseball card in the world, a 1909 Honus Wagner, was recently purchased for $451,000. Interest? More like infatutaion.
A childlike quality has even been injected into the business of baseball cards. In honor of its 40th anniversary, Topps has inserted one of every card it has ever made in random packs. Never able to get that 1952 Mickey Mantle? Now is your chance to search for it again, a la Willie Wonka.
"People need to relax after the war and get back to basics," said Don Lepore, a baseball-card dealer from Jersey City. "They can buy a box of Cracker Jack, see what the prize is, have a few hot dogs and maybe a beer. It's relaxing. It's like going fishing."
 
Timeless and Magical
 "If you're a fan, you look forward to it an awful lot," said Richard Herrnstein, a psychologist at Harvard University. "It's an escape. Most people can't wait to get lost in a good ball game."
Although the umpires may be off the job and $5 million contracts are the latest craze -- even though homeless people who long for $5 sleep inside cardboard boxes within a sacrifice bunt of Yankee Stadium -- and Lenny Dykstra had some gambling problems and Rickey Henderson has an attitude problem, fans still love the players and the game.
How quickly they forget that a lockout spoiled spring training and delayed opening day by a week last year. The lockout ended, baseball resumed and fans returned. Just like they always do.
 
Increasing Excitment
 "It keeps you coming back for more," said Dr. Bobby Brown, the American League president. "You sit in comfort, you munch peanuts, you talk to friends. With the progression of time, you observe the excitement increase until that is what consumes you."
Opening day 1991 will be a celebration of patriotism, with virtually every team offering some sort of tribute to the troops; from flag ceremonies, to having members of the military throw out the first ball, to singing the national anthem the way Whitney Houston would.
President Bush will participate in the first ball ceremonies at Arlington Stadium in Texas tonight with Shane Wood, 13 years old. Even though he was born without hands, Shane plays soccer and football and will play baseball for the first time soon with the aid of a specially designed glove that looks like a lacrosse stick. The teen-ager may challenge Bush for the longest ovation. The President's son, George W., is the general partner of the team.
 
Thirst for the Game
 Herrnstein said he did not think American success in the war and the improving economy made the beginning of the season any more urgent. He reminisced to tougher times in World War II and said people thirsted for baseball amid the gloom then.
"If the economy had been getting worse and the war was still on, people would think the start of the baseball season would make them feel better," he said. "Don't you think so? When spring starts, ball fans are looking forward to baseball."
After he speculated that there is no greater interest in baseball this season than in other years, it took one simple question to turn Herrnstein from psychologist to fan. Asked if he was looking forward to opening day, he said: "I can hardly wait for it to start. The Red Sox look really good this year."

HEADLINE: Tough Solutions for Connecticut

 BODY:
From sea to shining sea, governors are grappling with steep budget problems, none steeper than Connecticut's. Faced with a deficit that's one-third of the whole budget, and still growing, Gov. Lowell Weicker has ordered that 2,600 state workers be laid off, and most state agencies shut down for two days a month. Mr. Weicker has always talked tough. Now he's acting, and none too soon.
Connecticut's problem isn't different from other states', just worse. Like many states -- and many businesses -- Connecticut was careless in the 1980's, riding the boom as if it would last forever. In the last five years, the state payroll has grown by 12 percent, salaries and benefits by 53 percent, and grants to towns by 81 percent. The state sank deeper into debt while recklessly neglecting to make sure there would be enough revenue when the good times ended. 
 The deficit for the remaining three months of fiscal 1990-91 and all of 1991-92 is now estimated at $2.6 billion. It grows with every new estimate, because tax collections are weak and outlays for Medicaid and welfare are rising. Other states have bigger deficits, but Connecticut's beats all in relation to its overall $7.5 billion budget. To close the gap, Mr. Weicker wants a single-rate tax on personal income of 6 percent, reductions in other taxes and spending cuts of $1.2 billion.
The idea of an income tax isn't popular, but it is better than any other revenue ideas that have surfaced so far. Milking more revenue from the sales tax is out of the question; at 8 percent, it's already the nation's highest. Indeed, Mr. Weicker proposes to cut it almost in half, and to cut the corporate profits tax, also the nation's highest, and eliminate the separate taxes on income from dividends, interest and capital gains.
The state's major business associations have swung behind the Weicker tax plan, and with good reason; it's good economics and it directly benefits business. But they also want firm controls on future spending growth -- a reasonable demand in light of the state's profligate past.
Whatever the outcome, legislation takes time. Meanwhile, Mr. Weicker must cope with a growing deficit. He asked the state unions for $400 million in concessions, largely by freezing wages, increasing employee contributions for health insurance and stretching out state payments to their pension fund -- all reasonable under the circumstances. Unable to get agreement, he initiated the new layoffs, adding to 900 he had already ordered.
The extra layoffs are not final; the unions can still negotiate concessions instead. But the Governor's message is commendably clear: it's time to settle.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate: Don't Overreact

 BODY:
Last week the Labor Department announced that the unemployment rate jumped to 6.8 percent in March, its highest level in more than four years. About 2 million Americans have lost their jobs since last summer, more than 700,000 since January.
Along with the bad news came a cascade of sour predictions that a quick end to the recession "is not in sight." That may be so, but the unemployment rate is about the last place to look. The rate is included in the Government's index of lagging indicators -- meaning that the unemployment rate keeps rising even after the recession is over. 
 As the economy begins to recover, companies typically raise production without adding to their payrolls. New hires take place only after employers are convinced the recovery will last.
Even though it gives unclear signals about the economy, the bad employment news will spark renewed calls for the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. But the Fed is caught in a tight bind. Unemployment is rising, which calls for stimulating the economy by printing more money; but inflation is nastily persistent, which rules against more money.
At this juncture, the best reaction is the least reaction. For more than a year, the Fed allowed the growth rate of the money supply to fall short of targeted levels; that failure is one reason for the recession. But of late the Fed has set money growth rates much higher.
For now, that's enough. Sound policy does not react to last week's job figures or this week's inflation numbers: such figures are an unreliable guide to the economy's needs. Maybe the Fed agrees: following the Labor Department's announcement, it did nothing special.

HEADLINE: How to Save Money in New York City

BYLINE: By Roger C. Altman and Donald D. Kummerfeld; Roger C. Altman was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter Administration. Donald D. Kummerfeld was First Deputy Mayor under Abraham D. Beame.

 BODY:
New Yorkers are bombarded with daily accounts of the city's purported collapse. City Hall is accused of incompetence. Business and labor are said to be fleeing or ripping off the city. The public and private cooperation that rescued the city in the 1970's is deemed history.
These apocalyptic views are highly exaggerated. Today's fiscal crisis, like the last one, creates opportunities for long overdue changes. City Hall has recognized this, and budget and management reforms are emerging. If Mayor David N. Dinkins steps up the pace, government can be downsized without eliminating essential services and driving away businesses with ruinous tax increases. 
 For three months, we have been co-chairmen of a team of labor, business and city leaders appointed by the Mayor whose mission is to help work out downsizing efficiently and humanely. This panel has prepared an initial three-part package of reforms, which the Mayor is evaluating.
The first proposal would improve health care for the poor while eventually saving huge Medicaid sums. New York now provides $2 billion in annual Medicaid reimbursements; this amount, nearly 10 percent of total city spending, represents the fastest growing part of the budget. This expensive care is inadequate. Too often, the only medical service is found in a municipal hospital's emergency room, where no one knows a patient's history. This results in duplicating earlier diagnoses, overprescribing drugs and no medical follow-up.
Managed care has been instituted by 27 states. Patients must choose from designated outpatient or acute-care facilities -- an approach that promotes a one-to-one doctor-patient relationship, with the prospect of better care. It saves big money: California's Medicaid expenditures per capita are half of New York State's.
A managed-care project in Brooklyn hospitals and clinics for up to 35,000 Medicaid patients has received state approval and is ready to begin. Some oppose any approach that requires the poor to use these centers, arguing that it limits their freedom of choice. Neither the poor nor the city can afford to accept this ideology. The project must proceed, we must learn from its results and then we must extend managed care as widely as possible. Conceivably, the state and city could each save $500 million annually after five years.
Second, the city's seven economic development agencies should be consolidated. Modest budgetary savings aside, eliminating duplication and defining the benefits each office provides will improve service to business. Perennial proposals for consolidation always fall victim to turf wars, but with severe budget cuts ahead attitudes are changing.
Third, the city payroll must be cut. The latest plan calls for many layoffs, almost 8,000 in education. But they are the most expensive way to reduce personnel. With unemployment insurance and other severance benefits, it costs $7,000 to lay off a teacher.
One downsizing technique is early-retirement incentives. The city must lay off two teachers to realize the savings yielded by one retirement. If the right retirement incentives were offered before the school year ends in June, perhaps half the projected layoffs could be avoided before school resumes. There is no free lunch: Only increased pension benefits will induce an abnormally high rate of retirement. But the plan's savings and costs are balanced over the long run.
Other panel reforms are in the development stage. It is too early to judge their feasibility, but they do illustrate a potential for savings.
The city could find the cash to fix decrepit, undermaintained bridges by placing tolls on at least six East River and Harlem River bridges that now charge nothing. The revenues would support proper maintenance of all 800 city bridges as well as repair and construction of streets and highways. While environmental and congestion issues are involved, an early look suggests they may be surmountable.
How about privatizing the Sanitation Department -- that is, creating a self-financed corporation or authority? Sanitation spending would be removed from the budget; households would pay a monthly garbage collection charge just as they do for other utilities. This revenue would permit the sanitation authority to finance desperately needed new solid-waste disposal facilities, a burden that the city may otherwise be unable to handle. We would all pay more for sanitation, but we're going to do so anyway through rising taxes.
All of these structural reforms involve excruciating choices. But Mayor Dinkins has been supportive of our panel to date, and we believe he is ready to make the decisions needed to carry out major changes.

HEADLINE: In Tennis, Child Prodigies Whet the Agents' Appetites

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
The next time an ambitious parent hangs a cute tennis mobile above a child's crib the way Andre Agassi's father once did, there could very well be an agent standing by to jiggle it with one hand and sign the prodigy to a business contract with the other.
In the tennis industry there is a veritable race to rob the cradle. 
 This winter, John Evert, an agent for the International Management Group as well as the younger brother of the tennis doyenne Chris Evert, flew across the country to Los Angeles on a mission after hearing of a 10-year-old who can be marketed as what her father describes as a ghetto Cinderella.
 
The Latest Prodigy
 Venus Williams, a fifth grader who practices on pockmarked public courts in Compton, Calif., with an unappealing assortment of ne'er-do-wells in the audience, wants to be an astronaut. But because she has already been appropriated as this nation's next great tennis prodigy, any career plans that do not involve becoming another of the sport's teen-age millionaires may be put on hold.
The appetite of the tennis business for newcomers grows more voracious every time a Michael Chang or Arantxa Sanchez Vicario or Pete Sampras or Monica Seles becomes a teen-age Grand Slam champion. Pure youth is in demand, as attested by the $10 million in franchise fees that 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati collected last year even without advancing beyond the semifinals of a Grand Slam event.
"The sporting goods companies are looking for the rarity, and being a minority athlete, Venus could have it made," said Nick Bollettieri, the entrepreneur whose intensive tennis training camps have gained worldwide attention for the young stars they produce, as well as a serious inquiry from the Williams family.
At least, that is what a platoon of tennis agents has communicated to Venus and, more directly, to her parents.
 
Too Young to Turn Pro?
 "And until you have experienced the sensation of having somebody sitting across the table from you and waving a check for a million dollars in your face if you'll just let them sign your kid to a contract, you can't really be judgmental about what some of these parents go through," Bollettieri said.
"I happen to think 10 or 12 is too young to turn professional, with one exception: if by doing that, an entire family that truly needs the money will benefit, I can understand it. But I'd still rather see them get the help they need in another way."
Richard and Oracene Williams's reedy little girl is indeed just 10. But the recruiting agents for tennis's triumvirate of marketeers, International Management Group, ProServ and Advantage International, as well as some of Bollettieri's European counterparts, have all already descended, carrying contracts instead of corsages, to court her favors.
 
Puzzled and Exhilarated
 "We've been offered millions of dollars, from homes to cars to anything you can name," said Richard Williams, who is both puzzled and exhilarated by the attention his daughter has received.
"I've talked to everybody, but I've signed with nobody," he maintained. "If we sign her to a professional contract when she's 10, what will she do between now and when she's 13, when she can actually play the professional circuit? I don't want her to peak at 12 and fall to pieces at 15. There's still a lot of ifs here. I've been broke all my life, and Venus doesn't want to be poor, but nobody in this house is going to push our daughter into anything."
Slade Mead, who scouts for Advantage, the smallest of the three prime agencies, advocates a truce among recruiters: drawing an age line on the signing of pre-teens. "It's gotten to the point where it almost seems pedophilic, to be sitting there telling a 12-year-old and his parents about the money you can make them," he said.
"I don't think we're vultures," said Patricio Apey of ProServ. Apey represents MaliVai Washington, who turned pro after his sophomore year at the University of Michigan when he was the top collegiate player in the country.
"When he was deciding whether to turn pro or go to school, with my ProServ hat on, I had to tell him to turn pro, but with my friend hat on, I had to tell him to try college, so what I ultimately did was stay out of it and he and his family made the decision," Apey said. "But there's a lot of parents, especially outside of North America, who aren't considering college as an option, who see tennis as a way for their kid to make a million dollars."
If this nation is mercenary, the rest of the world, say the agents, is even worse.
"In Europe you've got 12-year-olds shopping around for financial assistance," Mead said. "I'll have somebody's father turn to me and say, 'I.M.G. offered me X, what can you give me?' "
 
Never 'Too Young'
 Last year Mead traveled to France in a vain attempt to head off I.M.G. after learning that a 12 1/2-year-old Swedish prospect, Magnus Norman, was about to turn professional.
"I had spoken with his parents before, in Sweden, but at the time they seemed reluctant," he said. "I didn't want to sit in a snowbank outside their house pestering them, but obviously someone else did. These days there's no such thing as too young."
Where this recruiting trend will end is uncertain.
"The next thing you know we'll be running into each other in the maternity ward at the hospital outside the incubators," Apey said.
Venus Williams, who epitomizes this trend, hasn't yet played the Orange Bowl, Easter Bowl or Junior Wimbledon, but already in addition to her growing reputation as a potential commercial gold mine, she is an anathema to her peers on Southern California's junior tennis circuit, where she usually eliminates the other 10- and 12-year-olds by merciless 6-0, 6-0 margins.
She has hit with John McEnroe and Pete Sampras and didn't believe it when her father told her, "Mr. McEnroe took it easy on you."
 
Moving Up to the 16's
 "She told me she thought she should have beaten him," said Richard Williams, who considers himself "the quarterback" of his daughter's career and plans to move her this summer from the 10's, where she is ranked No. 1, to the 16's.
Venus is, according to her proud father, as wise off the court as on it, which is why he is considering having her skip junior high school altogether. Under that plan, Venus could be finished with high school and ready for the pro circuit, or college, by the time she's 14.
"It just so happens that Venus is a like a rose, and right now she's only budding," said Williams, whose daughter impressed Jimmy Evert, father and former coach of Chris, during a doubles exhibition in Florida.
"Tennis is one of my dreams, but I'm dreaming about getting a good education so I have something to back my life up besides becoming a professional," Venus said. "Tennis is fun right now and, yes, maybe I could see doing it as my job."
For now, Venus practices her tennis not in some plush tennis laboratory but on a court whose net is patched and preserved by chains, and she does her homework in a neighborhood where graffiti are spray-painted onto front doors, not drizzled prettily across the front of designer tennis shirts. But not for long.
"It can turn out to be a Cinderella story for Venus," said her father, who operates a security guard service in addition to his duties as Venus' primary coach. "I know she wants to be a role model for what a girl from this kind of background can achieve if she works hard enough. We put God first, then comes the family, her education, and her tennis. Who wouldn't want a million dollars?
"But I need a healthy daughter more than I need a million dollars. We want to handle this right. I don't want to see her standing on some street corner, broke, and with no education to save her, when she's 17, which is what you see happen to a lot of the black kids who don't make it."
 At 5 feet 4 inches, her limbs as lithe and spiky as the tiny braids that crown her head, Venus Williams has been described as a young Michael Jordan: a natural athlete who, although not bigger and brawnier than the competition, somehow manages to jump higher, hit harder, and cover the court with the agility of a bird in flight. As is the fashion, she takes the ball on the rise, pouncing forward from the baseline itself rather than waiting behind it. Her topspin forehand is her biggest weapon, and the shot is all the more effective because of the solid, steady two-handed backhand she has in reserve for those moments when she feels she can't risk a mistake on a winner. Already at 10, her strokes are technically sound, her court coverage impeccable.
Asked what her favorite part of the game was, Venus said, "Return of serve because you get to take control of the court from your opponent."
Zina Garrison, the top black player in the country, looked in on Venus last fall and pronounced her "the best 10-year-old I've ever seen."
Bollettieri, coach and mentor of Andre Agassi and countless other up-and-comers, agrees. He has Adidas and Donnay, two major manufacturers of sporting goods, ready and willing to outfit Venus for her climb to the top. At the moment, the companies would do it without compensation; in the future, the price would be her endorsement of their product.
"She's unbelievable, and her mentality, unbelievable, she's very bright," said Bollettieri, who invited the Williams family to visit his Bradenton headquarters with Venus and her sister Serena, who at 9 is also considered a prime prospect.
"But no matter how much potential she has, I would hesitate to say that 10 is the right time to turn pro," Bollettieri said. In any event, Venus cannot compete on the circuit until she is 13 -- unless the rules are modified for her as they were last year for Capriati.
John Evert, Capriati's agent at I.M.G., came away impressed from his junket to California, where Richard Williams squired him around town in the family's trusty but rusty van.
"She's as talented as any 10-year-old I ever saw, and I'd like to sign any young prospect who could turn out to be great," said Evert, who signed Capriati at 12 and Mary Joe Fernandez at 13. "I don't look at them and say I think they've been mismanaged, in terms of turning pro too early, but 10 is too early. Then again, that's really up to the parents."
 According to Evert, Capriati's decision to turn professional while still an eighth grader was based on lack of competition as well as economics.
"If the player has nothing more to gain at the junior level, do you make them continue to play at a level they've already dominated just for the sake of retaining the right to receive a college scholarship?" Evert said. "The deals Jennifer has made will pay for 10 college scholarships."
Capriati was the exemplar of what is fast becoming a rule around women's tennis: If you aren't signed and circuit-compatible by 15, you're considered over-the-hill.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
Hollywood's Man on the Hill Still Spinning a Web

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
Two months ago, word on the street was that Jack Valenti, a man many consider one of the best lobbyists in the capital, might be losing his magic.
It looked like the Hollywood movie studios, which Mr. Valenti represents, would be unable to keep their rights to reruns of television programs they produce, and thus would lose hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 But Mr. Valenti, the longtime head of the Motion Picture Association of America and former aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, is likely to have pulled one more trick out of his bag.
While the Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to give television networks rights in the lucrative rerun market, it is also expected to preserve important protections for the movie studios
And Mr. Valenti can spin a victory out of containing the losses as proof of his skills.
 
Civility Missing in Capital
 But the seriousness of the networks' challenge -- so deftly rebuffed a decade ago that his rivals still reel at the memory -- heralds a rougher era of lobbying, an era that Mr. Valenti laments as showing a shrinking of the "assumed civility" of his early days in the capital.
"We almost made a deal with the networks in April of last year, and I'm convinced that the sole reason that we didn't make that deal was that a couple of the networks believed that they could do better at the F.C.C. than they could at the negotiating table," said the silver-haired, dapper Mr. Valenti as he sat on the edge of a chair in his book-lined office. While the F.C.C. commissioners are "intelligent and thoughtful," he went on, they do not know the syndication business.
"It's a complex, complicated business," he said. "It's nooks and crannies that many people haven't explored. To the uninitiated the corridors are ill lit and you have to be kind of an old Indian scout who knows all the byways to know what the hell you're doing."
Mr. Valenti's opponents give him a grudging respect, often tinctured with amazement that, after 25 years, he is still weaving a web in Washington's power portals without getting brushed off.
 
'Teaching the Rest of Us'
 "He's neither Custer nor Sitting Bull in this battle," said Jay L. Kriegel, a senior vice president at CBS, in the tones of an actor forced to compliment a rival. "He'll still be teaching the rest of us years from now. He remains the master."
The 69-year-old Mr. Valenti presents himself as a diffident, old-fashioned gentleman who is only doing his helpful best for an industry he loves. Indeed, he tells a visitor that he is not a lobbyist, that he has lobbyists working for the Motion Picture Association, that, yes, he could have been a lobbyist, that he has had several offers to be a lobbyist and could make two or three times as much as the nearly $700,000 salary he does make. But, he said frankly, what has always motivated him is fun and working with creative people.
Mr. Valenti's conversation, like his arguments for maintaining the status quo on syndication rights, is erudite, spiked with references to Francis Bacon and underpinned with appeals to the sensible, the reasonable, the patriotic and the aesthetic. His opponents, he intimates, are his opposites, users of crass tactics, something, he implies, he is incapable of but willing to forget in others.
In a Texas accent scrubbed almost clean of drawl after two decades on the East Coast, he said: "We've fought hard -- and I have not been happy with the scorched-earth policy that they have been pursuing -- but I'm a great believer again, from my L.B.J. days, that you put that all behind you and try and find a solution that's in the public interest and fair to both sides."
One network lobbyist, who scoffed at Mr. Valenti's portrayal of himself as a gallant protecting American freedoms, suggested that the studios ought to erect a Valenti statue on Rodeo Drive. But it would have to be a statue that in recent months has taken some nicks.
Earlier this year, when his lobby tactics appeared in the news media, Mr. Valenti looked as heavy-handed as any novice. A serious gaffe occurred when he wanted the White House to disavow one sentence in President Bush's annual Economic Report that appeared to be sympathetic to the networks on syndication rights. He dispatched two lieutenants -- Craig Fuller, who was Mr. Bush's chief of staff when Mr. Bush was Vice President, and Kenneth L. Duberstein, Ronald Reagan's last chief of staff -- to talk to White House officials.
The offending sentence was reworked. A leak to The Los Angeles Times prompted the headline, "White House Backs Down on Syndication Rules."
Not surprisingly, the White House was upset. John H. Sununu, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, let it be known that the President had an "aversion to unnecessary Government interference with private markets."
 
Distance From Leak
 Mr. Valenti said he did not know how the news reached The Los Angeles Times, but he was quick to dissociate himself from it.
"As I told a high-ranking official in the White House, I said I worked in the White House for three years," he said. "I know how the White House works, I know how a President feels and how his aides feel. I will confess to a number of flaws, personal and professional, but I think the one thing you can't say about me is that I'm dumb.
"Obviously this was an ambush. But I understand that, that's the way this game is played so you go on to other things."
Perhaps, but the recent clashes are a far cry from Mr. Valenti's slick dismemberment of the repeal in 1983 of syndication rights that the networks had managed to obtain.
His weapon was Lew Wasserman, head of MCA and the very man who in 1966 had hired Mr. Valenti. Mr. Wasserman, it turned out, was an old friend and the former agent of President Reagan. The deregulation President overruled the deregulation.
 
Longing for Johnson Era
 Mr. Valenti seems wistful for an era when the game was more secure, and when power on Capitol Hill was concentrated in the hands of a few committee chairman, the era, in other words, of his mentor, Lyndon Johnson.
"Washington has changed a lot," he said. "There is more surliness and torment. I lament when I see somebody who as, Lyndon Johnson would say, 'cuts and runs.' I may be wrong, I may lose every now and then, on an issue I really believe in, but I don't believe my worst enemies would say that I lied and cheated or went back on my word."
What Mr. Valenti may also be lamenting is the erosion of his most potent argument: that the movie industry is a uniquely American enterprise. Four of the seven major studios are now owned by foreign companies. Increasingly, over the last several years, too, the movie industry itself has developed fragmented and competing interests -- Time Warner now owns cable and 20th Century Fox now owns a television network, putting it in the television camp on the syndication issue.
The opposition, too, has changed. It is full of hot-shot young lawyers and executives who are not afraid to cross lines in the sand or knock pebbles off shoulders.
"It's a far more competitive environment," said Lloyd Hand, a Valenti friend from the Johnson White House and a lawyer who finds himself on the opposite side of the fence, one of team that represents NBC. "That he is a focal point may be a saving grace to an industry, which is changing itself and not always sure what it wants done."
 
Enjoying the Fight
 The initial uncertainty over the syndication rights fueled rumors that Mr. Valenti might be forced to relinquish his post. But Mr. Valenti said those kinds of things do not bother him. Actually, he said, he has enjoyed the current dustup.
"I still have fun," he said. "I thoroughly enjoy a challenge and a fight. I think I'd be bored with serenity. The adrenelin runs and sometimes there's anxiety but that keeps your nerve edges taut."
Growing up in a poor neighborhood in Houston, Mr. Valenti said he always hoped for a career in public life. Portentously, he got his first job as a theater usher at age 15. He worked his way through the University of Houston and then went to work in advertising for the Humble Oil Company, and after service in World War II, got an M.B.A. from Harvard University. Back in Houston as an advertising man during the 1950's he wrote some speeches and became an unofficial adviser to Lyndon Johnson, then a Senator.
When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. Valenti was riding in the motorcade. Summoned by the newly sworn-in President, Mr. Valenti was "ordered" to Washington and the Johnson White House.
Mr. Valenti credits President Johnson with imparting the technique that has enabled him to seemingly tiptoe across 25 years as head of the Motion Picture Association.
"I never speculate, win or lose," he said. "Somebody says, 'You got the votes?' I don't know. All I know is that I'm doing everything that is humanly possible."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 13, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Association of America, misstated the White House response to a lobbying effort this year by representatives of Mr. Valenti, who was seeking to have the Administration change its annual Economic Report. Mr. Valenti had protested that the report favored his opponents, the television networks, in a dispute over the rights to sell television reruns. The White House response was to issue a public statement saying that the matter would be decided by the Federal Communications Commission. It did not change the report.

HEADLINE: CAREERS;
An Appraisal Of Top-Level Job Seekers

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
CANNY, BOWEN INC., a management recruiting firm based in New York, decided to survey high-level executives who had sent in their resumes. It took the step after receiving about a thousand resumes a week since the late fall.
The firm, which specializes in recruiting top executives, said the deluge was about three times the rate received a year earlier. 
 From its pool of unsolicited resumes, Canny, Bowen mailed questionnaires to a sample of 160 executives and received 100 replies. About 80 percent of the executives signed the questionnaires, though they were told they could remain anonymous,
For years management recruiters insisted that they had seldom filled jobs from among the ranks of unemployed executives or those who were about to lose their jobs. Now, with so much talent out of work, recruiters look upon unsolicited resumes more kindly.
Sometimes the names of those who submit unsolicited resumes are put into data banks, and the executives are occasionally offered as candidates to client companies.
Unfortunately, said David R. Peasback, Canny, Bowen's president, few of the job seekers who had sent unsolicited resumes could expect help from his firm.
The executives who responded to the survey had been working an average of 22 years since college or graduate school, indicating that they were in their mid-40's. Compensaton ranged from $150,000 to $350,000 a year.
About 30 percent said they had lost their jobs because of downsizing, 19 percent said they had disagreed with corporate strategy and 17 percent reported they were disgruntled because a new superior had been appointed over them. An additional 15 percent said their companies had been acquired, and 15 percent cited dissatisfaction over a change in responsibilities.
Mr. Peasback was surprised that few had said their compensation was unsatisfactory and that even fewer had objections to relocating.
Most of the job-seeking executives reported relatively generous severance packages: 31 percent reported severance of six or more months, while 44 percent indicated they had received or would receive a full year's pay or more.
At many companies severance typically runs about two weeks for each year on the payroll, but employment contracts, which some executives have, often include generous severance payments even for a short stint with a company.
"I don't think many respondents had employment contracts," Mr. Peasback said.
Despite the state of the economy, 41 percent of the job hunters said they had turned down offers, but about a third acknowledged that they had been rejected for what they had considered attractive openings.
The executives were asked what they would have changed in their careers. Some regretted that they had not done more networking -- building lists of acquaintances who could help them find a new job. Others wished they had earned an advanced degree.
Mr. Peasback was surprised that only a few of the executives had done much planning for career changes.
One respondent said: "I should have chosen my job based on people and the chemistry between them. I made the mistake of taking a position based upon analysis of the company's potential -- not people and management."
"Politics within a company," Mr. Peasback said, "can be deadly to an executive's career and always will be."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Saatchi Wins Back Britain's Conservatives

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
SAATCHI & SAATCHI'S flagship London office has won back the estimated $40 million account for Britain's Conservative Party.
The victory is particularly significant because Saatchi's innovative advertising not only helped put former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in power in 1979, but it also created a name for the agency, which was little known at the time. 
 One ad that caught much attention was a billboard showing a long line of unemployed workers under the headline "Labor doesn't work," referring to the Labor Party's inability to check runaway unemployment.
The agency's close relationship with Mrs. Thatcher is widely credited with making Saatchi important friends in the London financial community and helping it find the money for its rapid acquisition of agencies in the United States. Saatchi's main holdings in New York include Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising.
Saatchi had resigned the account in 1987, after the Conservative Party began consulting other agencies for advice about its campaign for the general election. At the time, agency executives in London said party officials were not happy with Saatchi's strategy.
Saatchi had also lost a crucial executive, Tim Bell, who had worked on the Conservatives' campaign from the start and had close ties to Mrs. Thatcher.
Since then, the party had consulted with various agencies for specific projects but had not had an agency of record, said David Marshall, a Conservative Party spokesman.
After Mrs. Thatcher stepped down in November and John Major became the Prime Minister, the party decided it again needed a full-time agency, Mr. Marshall said.
The Conservatives picked Saatchi because officials thought it was the kind of agency the party needed now, Mr. Marshall said. "We'll be facing a tough battle from the Labor Party in the next general election," he said.
The Government must hold an election no later than June 1992, but some Saatchi executives said the election could come as soon as this October.
Picking up the Conservatives' account gives Saatchi a much-needed lift. The London advertising industry has been mired in a severe slump for more than a year, and like most agencies there Saatchi has found big new accounts scarce.
In addition, some Saatchi executives said the victory was confirmation that the London office was back after a group of its top executives left last year to start their own agency.

HEADLINE: Terrorism Jolts a Prospering Chile

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, April 5

 BODY:
A new nervousness has gripped the business community in Chile this week over whether the recent spate of terrorist actions will upset the political stability of the country and threaten the Chilean economic miracle.
Chile has built the most successful economy in Latin America, and one of the vital underpinnings of that growth was the open economic environment created by the former military dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. In the year since the country's transition to a democratic Government the economy has continued to grow and foreign investment has continued to pour in. 
 But the killing on Monday of one of the country's most prominent senators, the fourth killing in the last six weeks, is raising questions about the ability of the country -- and the economy -- to stay on course.
 
Executives Fearful
 "Chile has a prosperous economy," the country's Treasury Minister, Alejandro Foxley, said this week, "but the point of vulnerability is terrorism and the problem of personal security."
Businessmen are loath to speak publicly about the problem, out of fear of offending the Government. But privately they express concerns that foreign investors will pull out of the country, to avoid attacks on themselves and their property. And foreign investment is a critical ingredient of the economy's growth.
Some say they believe that the Government of President Patricio Aylwin has finally decided to take harsh steps against terrorism, but that it will take time to see whether the battle against political violence has been won. "I think it's just too early to tell," said one American banker who insisted that neither his name nor his bank's be used. "We're rooting for Aylwin to come down strong on the terrorists."
The violence is one of the few clouds on Chile's economic horizon. While there had been some doubts about whether President Aylwin would continue the open market policies that had fostered the growth, the last 12 months have been reassuring to the business community.
It is not that President Aylwyn has left the Pinochet economy untouched. He cut the central bank free from the rest of the Government. He raised taxes on business to help pay for more social programs. He lifted the minimum wage, raising the cost of labor.
Although some of these adjustments tilt away from the Pinochet Government's fixation with free markets and to a new emphasis on social programs, so far the basic thrust of the open economy -- one with little regulation and equal treatment of foreign investors -- has been maintained. And most analysts say the economy continues to function well.
 
'A Very Interesting Time'
 "The private sector is almost starting to move into a boom phase now," said Eduardo Aninat, chief negotiator for Chile in its recent re-entry into the Euromarkets. "Business has a stability it has not seen in years. This is a very interesting time for this country."
The numbers reflect the continued strength in Chile's economy. Inflation over the last four months has averaged less than 6 percent. Economic growth is projected to be almost 5 percent this year. The savings rate is more than twice that of the United States. Foreign exchange reserves have doubled in the last 15 months. And the country's stock market has almost doubled since last fall.
Foreign investment, too, is booming again after a lull last year as businessmen waited to see what the Aylwin Government would do. Investment has been running at almost a $2 billion annual rate, close to a record.
 
Copper Developments
 The Phelps Dodge Corporation is planning a $300 million copper mine in the north. Australian, Spanish and Japanese backers have poured $1 billion into Chile's copper belt to create the world's third-largest copper mine, La Escondida, which just started operations. The Simpson Paper Company of San Francisco, together with one of Chile's largest forestry companies, is building a $400 million pulp and paper plant near Concepcion. Shell Oil also has a plant of similar size about to go into operation.
Though perhaps small by United States standards, these projects are large for a country of 15 million people that had a gross domestic product last year of $26.5 billion.
Though Chileans seem to enjoy the image of an orderly economy and the praise it brings, they cannot escape a complex mix of emotions. The economic progress has come at a high price. The human rights violations attributed to the Pinochet Government continue to haunt the country. Furthermore, an estimated five million Chileans -- one-third of the population -- still live in poverty conditions.
But at least for now, the central question of whether Mr. Aylwin would steer a different course has been answered.
"I'm sleeping much, much better than I did a year ago," said Andres Bianchi, president of the central bank.
From a business point of view, things are still going well, too. Foreign businessmen traveling in Latin America say they breathe a sigh of relief when they get to Chile.
 
'Less Corruption'
 "The costs are lower than in other Latin American countries," said one businessman, Don J. Harris. "There is less corruption, more respect for law, and all of this spills over into our software business." Mr. Harris, marketng director in Latin America for the Wordperfect Corporation, a computer software company based in Orem, Utah, said that in his two years in Chile he has had far fewer problems with pirating of software than in any other Latin country.
Jose Antonio Rivero, president of Iansa, a foreign-owned sugar company, added: "Frankly, in 10 years working here we haven't had one single occasion when we have had to pay a bribe to anybody. That is not the norm in Latin America. For business, the rules have been very defined and the Government has stuck to them."
Businessmen remark that the phones work in Chile. They can repatriate profits from an investment after the first business year and can take their capital out of the country after three years. And they say they find no discrimination against their companies by Government officials.
But bankers here warn of potential problems, too. The recent rise in political assassinations is one. Others include the economy's dependence on foreign capital and on oil imports, which leave it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and world oil prices.
"The worst thing for us is a big recession in the United States," said Mr. Aninat, the debt negotiator.
Still, business executives find much to praise here.
At the signing ceremony last month for Chile's $320 million Eurobond, bankers celebrated the financing, noting that it represented the voluntary purchase of Chilean debt by investors, rather than a repudiation of debt or a restructuring. They also pointed out that the issue was so popular that Chile had raised more than originally planned, and at interest rates well below what Mexico and Venezuela were paying at the same time.
"This transaction sets an important example for emerging democracies in Latin America, Europe and Asia," said Donald McCouch, executive vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, the lad bank in the Chile debt offering. "Countries with debt problems which apply sound economic policies do get well," said Mr. McCouch, who heads the bank's lending to developing countries.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises in Quiet Day; Inflation Reports Awaited

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher in quiet trading yesterday, as many currency traders stayed on the sidelines in anticipation of fresh news of the nation's inflation rate, due later this week.
The dollar ended at 1.6945 German marks, up from 1.6870 on Friday, and at 137.15 Japanese yen, up from 136.65 on Friday. 
 Trading was restrained, with dealers awaiting the Producer Price Index for March, to be released on Thursday, and the Consumer Price Index, due Friday.
Data showing moderate inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, rendering the dollar less attractive to investors compared with other major currencies.
"If the inflation numbers are high, the Fed won't ease; if inflation is under control, it will," said David Wilson at Girozentrale New York. "That's the conventional wisdom."
The mark rose against the yen in early trading amid rumors that a Southeast Asian central bank was buying marks for yen. But the yen recovered late in the afternoon, helped by a large speculative order to buy yen for marks, said John Krey, international economist for MCM Currencywatch.
Market sentiment remains bearish for the mark, which suffers from the political and economic problems created by German unification, traders said.
Germany's difficulties were highlighted by this weekend's visit of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to eastern Germany, where demonstrators hurled eggs at him. The political and economic turmoil in the Soviet Union also hampers the mark, traders said.
The yen was hurt by news that the head of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party had resigned to take responsibility for the party's defeat in Sunday's vote for Tokyo governor, dealers said.
Traders say much the dollar's direction depends on whether the Fed cuts interest rates again, a move that is likely to depend on the inflation data released this week.
Economists polled by Reuters anticipate that the March producer price data will be unchanged over all and up two-tenths of 1 percent excluding the volatile food and energy prices. Consumer prices are expected to rise by two-tenths of 1 percent over all and three-tenths of 1 percent minus food and energy.
Among other currencies, the British pound ended at $1.7635, down from $1.7670 on Friday.
The dollar ended at 1.4385 Swiss francs, up from 1.4225 on Friday, at 5.7215 French francs, up from 5.7060 on Friday, and at $1.1540 (Canadian), unchanged from Friday.

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON MEMO;
Trade Issues Enter Crucial Political Phase

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

 BODY:
At their meeting Thursday, President Bush warned Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu that Congressional concerns over Japanese trade practices could damage the relationship between the two countries. In Houston Sunday, Mr. Bush presumably told President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico that American lawmakers would require Mexico to adopt stronger environmental measures and perhaps take other steps before Congress would accede to a bilateral free-trade pact.
In part, this is an age-old dance: Lawmakers, prepared to accept a trade accord eventually, appease local interests by threatening to block the agreement. And Presidents, stepping in tune with the music, emphasize the Congressional threats when they try to win overall trade concessions from other countries. 
 But these days, beyond the familiar two-step is a genuine political tension between the President and Congress, and it will reach a critical point soon after Congress returns today from a two-week recess. One of the most important orders of business will be the request by Mr. Bush that Congress extend his authority to conduct trade negotiations without line-by-line Congressional review.
National leaders may disagree about the economic benefits of removing trade barriers, but few doubt that doing so leads to smoother diplomatic relations. President Bush, like every President since World War II, Republican and Democrat, has been a strong advocate of free trade.
Members of Congress tend to be parochial. If tariffs or import quotas help businesses and protect jobs in their states and districts, lawmakers generally support them, regardless of their international effect.
It is not coincidental, for example, that South Carolina's Senators -- Strom Thurmond, a Republican, and Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat -- men who could hardly be less alike in temperament, politics and ideology, are the leading Senate opponents of renewed international trade talks. If those talks are successful, textile imports would probably increase, hurting a major South Carolina industry.
Two big trade issues are on the table. The first is the resumption of international trade-liberalization talks, which broke down in December but seem ready to resume soon. The talks are held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The second is President Bush's desire to negotiate a free-trade pact with Mexico like the one President Ronald Reagan made with Canada.
The outcome of both issues turns on whether Congress extends the "fast track" procedures, which will automatically be extended for another two years unless the House or the Senate votes by June 1 to discontinue them. Under these rules, in effect since the 1970's, the President must consult with Congress before entering into a trade agreement, and Congress has the authority to approve or disapprove the eventual agreement, but Congress may not amend it.
An unusual Congressional coalition is trying to block extension of the rules:
*Democrats who are on shaky ground after the Persian Gulf war and want to look tough on a foreign-policy issue.
*Lawmakers from the Rust Belt who fear that a Mexican trade agreement would encourage manufacturing companies and jobs to move across the border.
*Those from farm and textile states who believe the GATT negotiations will reduce the protection American farmers and textile companies now have.
*Those (primarily from Florida and California) who want to avoid competition from Mexican fruit and vegetable growers.
 
'Point of Leverage'
 "Fast track is the only point of leverage that exists now, because the Administration needs it to proceed," Representative Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said in an interview. "So all of us who oppose one thing or another have joined forces."
Mr. Dorgan, who bows to few others in adhering to liberal principles, is worried about his home-state farmers. He is the principal sponsor of the House resolution to stop continuation of the fast-track rules.
One anomaly is that the issue has pitted liberal Democratic politicians against the majority of liberal Democratic economists, who consider the law of comparative advantage as fundamental. This precept holds that a nation should specialize in producing and exporting goods that it can make at a relatively lower cost and import goods for which it is a relatively high-cost producer.
"Protectionist measures usually rob from the many to give to the few and harm the efficiency of the world economy in the bargain," wrote Alan S. Blinder, a prominent economics professor at Princeton, in his 1987 book, "Hard Heads, Soft Hearts."
Increasingly, politicians are taking issue with liberal economic doctrine. "Academics are just out of touch with the everyday concerns of working families," a Democratic strategist said. "They are indifferent to who makes the laptop computer on which they compose their free-trade arguments."
Charles L. Schultze, a top economist in the Johnson and Carter Administrations who is now at the Brookings Institution, dismisses arguments like that with the observation that politicians invariably go out of their way not to inflict direct harm, even if the indirect harm they spread is much more severe.
In the last decade, a small number of prominent economists, many of whom have ties to organized labor, have developed the view that free trade may be an outdated notion. After all, they note, Japan has fared pretty well with one of the most restrictive trade policies in the world.
One of these economists, Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research center in Washington, says the law of comparative advantage only holds when there is full employment and thus a new job for anyone who loses one.
 
The Effect on Jobs
 "When you look at the history of people who have been knocked out of jobs by imports," Mr. Faux said in an interview, "they haven't climbed the ladder into better, more productive jobs. They've stayed out of work or moved down the ladder to worse jobs."
For their part, politicians tend to be swayed by constituents, not theories. Take Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Finance Committee. He has not been averse in his career to carrying the legislative water for important constituents, like oil and gas producers. Now he is a strong advocate of a Mexican free-trade pact. Why? Largely, his colleagues say, because the Texas border towns, among the poorest communities in the nation, would benefit from increased commerce.
Mr. Bentsen, whose committee handles trade matters, is expected to call for a vote in the next few weeks on a measure sponsored by Mr. Hollings that would block the fast-track procedures. But Mr. Bentsen's colleagues say he will do so at a time when the Hollings measure is sure of losing rather than allow Mr. Hollings to bring it to a vote at a time more favorable to him.
 
Gephardt's Role
 On the other side of Capitol Hill, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, is a leader in the fight for trade restrictions. Mr. Gephardt comes from St. Louis, which is threatened with the loss of manufacturing jobs to Mexico, where the average wage is one-seventh of that in the United States.
Over the years, Mr. Gephardt has metamorphosed from being a back-bench Congressman who rode the trade issue to prominence to being an unsuccessful Presidential candidate in 1988 who based his campaign on the trade issue to his current status as House majority leader with considerable influence over trade legislation. Many colleagues believe he is planning another run for the Presidency next year.
Given President Bush's popularity and the support he enjoys on the trade issue from House Republicans, opponents of the fast-track rules have an uphill fight. They almost certainly cannot win unless Mr. Gephardt takes a prominent role, and even then the odds are against them.
The prevailing view in the Capitol is that Mr. Gephardt will continue to speak out on trade, but that when push comes to shove he will probably back off and not support the Dorgan resolution.
"If Gephardt is going to do something to take on the President," said one Democrat who has talked to him about the matter, "he wants to win. He doesn't want to go head to head with Bush and lose."
Some lawmakers suggested that the Ways and Means Committee might bottle up the disapproval resolution so that it never reached a vote by the full House.
"They'd be complaining on the floor and thanking me in the cloakroom for not making them vote," said Representative Sam M. Gibbons, a Florida Democrat and a committed free-trader who heads the trade subcommittee.
"Down deep in their bellies," Mr. Gibbons said, "they know free trade is the right thing."

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
The New Drag On Auto Sales

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
MOST forecasts that the recession is about to end assume that consumers will soon buy cars in greater numbers -- a prerequisite for an upturn since the auto industry is such a major part of the economy. The problem with this assumption is that many would-be car buyers are failing to qualify for loans.
Car loans are as essential to car sales as mortgages are to home sales. The average selling price of new cars in the United States is now more than $16,000, far above what most Americans can pay out of their own pockets. So if car sales are to rise above their present weak levels, then the credit that was available on such easy terms in the 1980's must reappear. But lenders seem determined, for the time being, not to let that happen. 
 "A lot of people who might like to buy a car today already have too many debts, or their incomes have been reduced because of layoffs or less overtime or smaller bonuses," said Fritz Elmendorf, a vice president at the Consumer Bankers Association. "The banks aren't giving these people loans because the banks don't think they can afford loans any more."
The messengers of this bad news are frequently the nation's new-car dealers. Dealers often act as loan agents too, offering a customer financing that the dealer, in effect, obtains from a bank or savings and loan association or auto company finance arm, like Ford Credit or the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Such lenders provide more than 80 percent of all new-car loans -- and they have erected obstacles to the lending of their money.
Young, first-time car buyers, for example, can no longer purchase a car without a down payment, as they often could in the 1980's. Down payments for everyone, in fact, have risen to an average of 15 percent of a car's cost, from 10 percent nearly two years ago, according to Federal Reserve figures. The auto companies, in addition, are offering fewer low-interest loans as sales incentives. And they have divided loan applicants into four "risk" categories, to help them identify -- and discourage -- those who might default on car payments.
In place of the single interest rate that was available in the 1980's for most borrowers, four rates are now in place. The lowest rate is offered to car purchasers who own their homes, have held well-paying jobs for five years or more, have unblemished records of repaying debts and are not overburdened with other debt. Such buyers get a 10.5 percent rate at Ford Credit, or one percentage point below the national average today for car loans. The riskiest borrowers, those in the fourth category, must pay an interest rate of more than 15 percent at Ford Credit and up to 17 percent at General Motors Acceptance, if they get a loan at all.
"We are trying to price credit appropriately, so that more credit is available to the most creditworthy customers," said Randy Kniebes, Ford Credit's vice president for marketing.
A major goal, of course, is to reduce defaults, which have risen over the last 18 months. In pursuit of this goal, the banks and the car financing arms are trying to offer shorter car loans, many of which have grown to as long as 60 months, or five years. General Motors Acceptance, for example, offers a lower rate for a loan that runs 48 months instead of 60.
The shorter loan means higher monthly payments. The higher payments, in turn, bring the borrower more quickly to the moment when the resale value of his car is greater than the balance left on his loan. Once that moment is reached, car owners having difficulty making payments are no longer tempted to halt them and let the finance company repossess the car. They can sell the cars instead, pay off the loans and perhaps have some money left over.
"The auto finance companies have been burned by bad risks," said Ronald Glantz, an auto analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in San Francisco. "And it costs them $3,000 to repossess a car."
The banks and the auto finance companies have undoubtedly benefited from their stiffer lending standards. Mr. Glantz notes that earnings have risen at operations like Ford Credit and General Motors Acceptance. But while lenders strengthen their balance sheets, the value of outstanding car loans has fallen in nearly every month since March 1990, the Commerce Department reports.
The decline clearly reflects the reluctance of many Americans, even well-off ones, to purchase cars amid the uncertainties of a recession. But it also reflects the barriers that lenders have erected to poor credit risks. Those barriers raise this question: Can auto sales rise sufficiently to help revive the economy, if banks and finance companies are reluctant to make car loans readily available to people without a lot of change in their pockets?

HEADLINE: Late Program Buying Lifts Dow to 2,918.56

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks chugged along most of the day yesterday with little movement, but heavy program buying carried the Dow Jones industrial average sharply ahead in the final hour.
The Dow climbed 21.78, or nearly 1 percent, to 2,918.56, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 3.30, to 378.66. 
 The American Stock Exchange's market-value index, one measure of the smaller stocks, moved ahead slightly, while the Nasdaq composite, another measure of the smaller stocks, fell a bit.
With investors and traders perplexed over the lack of movement in interest rates -- despite signs of high unemployment and a weak economy -- trading slumped yesterday to 138.6 million shares. That was the quietest since Jan. 16, the day before the air war began against Iraq, when volume was 134.6 million.
Still the market's tone seemed optimistic. Big Board advances led declines, 9 to 6. While 6 stocks slipped to new lows, 92 climbed to new highs.
One big new high ws Time Warner. It jumped 6 1/4, to 118 1/2. Its Warner Brothers subsidiary announced on Friday that it had obtained American and Canadian distribution rights for three years to about two dozen films of Morgan Creek Productions. Morgan Creek's films include "Young Guns," "Dead Ringers" and "Enemies, a Love Story."
Traders came to work yesterday knowing that the chances of a reduction in interest rates by the Federal Reserve might not come until later in the week. Most traders are paying particular attention to the figures on producer prices, which are scheduled for Thursday, and the consumer prices data, scheduled for Friday, to see whether either will be inflationary.
If the numbers, as expected, are seen as not inflationary, the chances are strong that the Fed will move to lower rates fairly soon -- possibly even before the numbers are released because the Fed gets advance notice.
 
Programs Add 18 Points
 Except for a little bargain hunting at the opening bell, which lifted the Dow briefly, stocks moved rapidly into minus territory, moved up a bit and then came back down. For most of the day, the Dow zigzagged in a narrow range.
But Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said two waves of computer-driven buying lifted the Dow more than 20 points. One was a six-minute flurry starting at 3:34 P.M.; the other, lasting eight minutes, began at 3:48 P.M. Allowing for one selling wave, program activity lifted the Dow a total of almost 18 points for the day.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, attributed what little activity there was in part to reports on the producer and consumer prices. Dr. Sohn said he believed the inflation picture reflected in the figures "will look good," increasing the possibility that the Fed will cut rates.
He said the March figures will show a drop in energy prices and that apparel, car, tobacco and postage prices, all of which jumped in the last couple of months, were not expected to rise again.
 
Takeover Speculation
 Takeover talk helped stocks a little yesterday.
Baldwin Piano rose 2 1/4, to 13, after Business Week said Yamaha of Japan might be interested in it. Baldwin said it had not had any takeover talks and felt Yamaha was not interested.
Pet, a food company that was just spun off from Whitman, rose 1 1/4, to 17 1/8, a new high, after William Maguire of Merrill Lynch said he regarded it as a "good takeover target."
NCR rose3/4, to 97 1/2, after NCR told A.T.& T. it would recommend an offer of $110 a share, if a deal could be made quickly.
Dillard Department Stores rose 4 5/8, to 112 1/4, also reaching a new high of 112 3/8. Last week, Vendamerica of the Netherlands sold its 25 percent stake at $99 a share.
Among the technology stocks, I.B.M. rose 3/8, to 113; Hewlett-Packard 1 3/8, to 51 3/8; Microsoft 1 3/8, to 11 3/8; Automatic Data 1 7/8, to 66 7/8, and Conner Peripherals 1 3/8, to 25 1/8. Baldwin Piano and Organ

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
On Eve of Baker Visit, Israel Says It Will Free 1,000 Palestinians

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, April 8

 BODY:
The Israeli Defense Ministry said today that it would free more than 1,000 of the approximately 14,000 Palestinian prisoners held for actions connected with the uprising in the occupied territories. The announcement came a few hours before Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived for talks on Tuesday with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
A Defense Ministry statement described the prisoners as Palestinians not directly involved in violence, who had served most of their terms. An official said the action was timed for the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan and was not connected with the Baker visit. 
 "Just a coincidence," said Danny Naveh, the spokesman. "The measures have been under consideration for some time."
Nonetheless, the move fit into the theme being emphasized by Mr. Baker, who has been seeking confidence-building measures from Israelis and Arabs to coax peace efforts forward.
Mr. Naveh said the number of those to be released was higher than in the past, and he expressed hope that in easing conditions in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the atmosphere for political discussion would be improved.
As a further gesture, the Defense Ministry ordered tax reform in Gaza with the aim of freeing investment capital to improve economic life. The ministry said further measures, like the reopening of universities, might come next.
Israelis have awaited the Baker visit in an uneasy mood influenced by what they view as America's abandonment of Iraqi Kurds rebelling against the Government of President Saddam Hussein. The American response to the Kurdish revolt has prominently figured in remarks by Cabinet members.
 
Comments to Kurdish Jews
 Foreign Minister David Levy told the leader of the Kurdish Jewish population of about 100,000 in Israel, "What good is it to parachute food so they can die with their stomachs full?"
The Kurdish leader, Haviv Shimoni, asked Mr. Levy to plead with Mr. Baker for American assistance to the uprising. Mr. Shimoni charged that the United States spurred the rebellion only to stand by while the Iraqi Army massacred the Kurds.
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon urged the Government to impress Mr. Baker with Israel's urgent concern over "the murder of the Kurdish people now being perpetrated in Iraq, while hundreds of thousands of American and allied forces are stationed in the area of the gulf."
A senior official of the Shamir Government said, "It reminds us that we live in a very bad neighborhood and can count only on ourselves." As he spoke, a television set in his office, the sound turned down, projected Cable News Network images of the misery of Kurdish refugees.
Israel radio also said that Mr. Shamir, as well as Mr. Levy and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, would tell the Secretary of State that Israel would negotiate with a Palestinian delegation only if its members did not say they represented the Palestine Liberation Organization. As is customary in American dealings with this Government of strongly individualistic ministers, Mr. Baker will confer separately on Tuesday with each of the three.
 
Will See Some Palestinians
 Mr. Baker is also scheduled to meet at the American Consulate in Jewish West Jerusalem with a delegation of Palestinians. However, Arabs from the occupied territories will continue to be banned from Jerusalem at least until his departure for Egypt on Wednesday.
Israeli statistics in mid-March said there were 10,528 Palestinians jailed for actions stemming from the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Of those, 4,221 have been convicted, 988 are charged and awaiting trial, 3,992 are being held for investigation in anticipation of charges, and 1,327 are administrative detainees.
The release will not address demands by Shiite Muslim groups in Lebanon that Israel free Arab prisoners to expedite the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon. The South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, is believed to hold about 300 Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites.

HEADLINE: Homes for Middle Class Rise on Blighted Blocks

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Empty lots surround the two rundown apartment buildings on the north side of Jefferson Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. A block east, three large abandoned buildings tower over the elevated subway tracks that run above Broadway in Brooklyn.
But on the south side of Jefferson Avenue, amid this sad stereotype of big-city blight, carpenters are scurrying around a construction site. They are assembling 20 prefabricated town houses, each three stories tall with light blue vinyl siding and the wide sliding glass doors more often associated with developments on Long Island or in Westchester. 
 Sixty-six town houses are to be built on the city block between Jefferson Avenue and Hancock Street in the southeast corner of Bedford-Stuyvesant called Saratoga Square. The sponsors, which include several nonprofit community groups and the New York City Partnership, a citywide nonprofit organization created by business leaders, hope that someday their light-blue vision of middle-class housing may serve as a symbol of the neighborhood's renewal.
Such symbols are easy to spot these days. The partnership, which began its housing effort 10 years ago, has overseen the creation of more than 70 small developments, making it the city's most successful middle-income housing program.
 
3,350 New Houses and Apartments
 On Intervale Avenue in the Bronx, on Sharon Street in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn and on dozens of other blocks, clumps of 50 to 100 town houses and garden apartments, as well as low-rise condominium buildings, attest to the partnership's accomplishment.
Since 1984, 3,350 new houses and apartments have been built. Another 2,370 are now in construction, and almost 1,400 are in development.
The partnership works as an intermediary, linking banks, developers and nonprofit groups in development teams. Using city and state subsidies, these teams build and sell town houses and apartments. The banks, developers and buyers take the financial risks.
The effort depends on one overriding element: "the willingness of buyers to commit all their life savings to an area that has been written off as a slum for 20 years," said Kathryn Wylde, a senior vice president of the partnership.
 
Average Income of $37,000
 The majority of buyers live in the communities where the housing is built, Ms. Wylde said. About 80 percent are black, Hispanic or Asian, she said. Half are civil servants, including many teachers and transit and hospital workers. In most of the families, both parents work and the average household income is $37,000.
"This is really the city's emerging middle class," she said. "They represent the heart of the work force, the source of stability in neighborhoods and schools that are otherwise entirely ghettoized."
These are families with few choices for home ownership. Even with the slump in the region's housing market, they are priced out of most market-rate houses and apartments.
"There is no housing; there's no place to go," said Joseph E. Holley Sr., director of the Northeast Brooklyn Housing Development Corporation, a nonprofit group marketing the Jefferson Avenue town houses. More than 500 families have applied for the 66 houses, and the first 23 have been sold.
While the development, called Stuyvesant Mews, is more stylish than some partnership projects, it is similar in design. The town houses have two spacious floors for the owners and a large two-bedroom apartment on the third floor for a tenant.
The town houses sell for about $150,000. Buyers pay 5 percent down, or $7,500. They earn from $500 to $700 a month from the rental apartment, and their monthly bills for mortgage payments and taxes total about $1,200 to $1,500, Ms. Wylde said.
The program began in working-class areas like the north shore of Staten Island and Castle Hill in the Bronx. The houses are built on vacant city-owned land, with combined city and state subsidies of $25,000 for each house.
The program has expanded in recent years throughout the city, including the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick. Town houses and garden apartments are often built next to abandoned buildings being rebuilt under other city programs for the unemployed and working poor.
Asked whether such neighbors made sales more difficult, Ms. Wylde replied: "The truth? There is no market except for what the local people create." Perhaps because of that, she said the financial turbulence in the banking and real-estate industries has had little effect on the program.
 
Objections From Some Advocates
 Some advocates of housing for low-income New Yorkers have criticized the city and the partnership for using government money and land to create housing for the middle class. They believe such developments should include housing for the less affluent. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund has filed two lawsuits to challenge the city's awarding of several East Harlem sites to the partnership.
"There hasn't been a general objection to middle-income housing," said Arthur A. Baer, an associate counsel at the legal defense fund. The concern, he said, is that subsidized housing in poor neighborhoods that is sold only to middle-class families fosters gentrification and ultimately displaces poor people.
Ms. Wylde, along with the city's Housing Commissioner, Felice L. Michetti, and the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, said no one is displaced when houses are built on vacant land.
"Gentrification is not the issue, either," Mr. Ferrer said, "because invariably these are people who come from the same neighborhood. These are wage earners, people who are paying their bills. Without them, the city would be in deep deep trouble."

HEADLINE: Wallace Journal;
As Jobs Come Calling, The Now-Wary Unite

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WALLACE, La.

 BODY:
Along River Road, which meanders for miles through the remnants of plantation country, the black and white residents have shared little over the years but mutual distrust and a high cancer rate, which many believe is caused by the dozens of industrial plants that line the Mississippi River.
Now they are also sharing a bitter fight against powerful local political and business interests and a large industrial company from Taiwan, the Formosa Plastics Corporation, which wants to build a $700 million plant for processing wood pulp and manufacturing rayon in this mostly black community. 
 Industry was once welcomed to this region, no questions asked, and not even the most ardent opponent of the Formosa Plastics plant denies that the area and the state need jobs. But many people say this fight is another example of new thinking in Louisiana: a stiffening of public attitudes toward industry and the politicians who entice big companies.
"This is really the first time environmental, historic preservation and minority groups have gotten together to protest a plant," said William Fontenot, an environmental specialist with the State Attorney General's office.
Members of the racially diverse alliance fear not only the potential chemical discharges from the plant, but also disruption of the community and harm to the tranquil landscape and its historic houses.
"There is great trauma for the people here." said Wilfred M. Greene, a retired school principal who owns riverfront land in Wallace that his ancestors, plantation workers, bought in 1874.
Samuel Jackson, a 34-year-old former chemical plant worker who has been unemployed for more than a year, said: "We need jobs, that's a fact. But this is more than about jobs."
Mr. Jackson said he did not relish "l0 years of making $15 an hour and then dying of cancer or liver disease or whatever."
Ten miles upriver, Zeb Mayhew, an administrator and part owner of Oak Alley plantation, said the proposed plant "scares the hell out of me."
River Road, known to tourists for its antebellum plantation houses, is known to medical researchers and the public as Cancer Alley. But the industrial plants that are widely believed to be the cause of high cancer rates have skipped over a fertile, 30-mile-residential and farming strip that includes Wallace.
People say this strip is the last green zone in the 130 river miles between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. It is part of St. John the Baptist Parish, which straddles the Mississipi, and here on the west bank, tumble-down shanties share country lanes with cottages, churches and modern brick homes in a patchwork of sugar cane fields and historic houses.
The Formosa Plastics plan to build here has been avidly supported by Gov. Buddy Roemer and local politicians. The company has bought 1,740 acres in the Wallace area, including an old rice and sugar plantation called Whitney and its plantation house.
The Whitney land, once zoned agricultural and residential, was rezoned for industrial use at a stormy meeting of the Parish Council last year. Opponents of the new plant say they face a formidable political machine: parish officials whose business interests stand to gain from new industry.
A leading backer of the plant is Lester J. Millet Jr., the council president, a businessman. A descendent of planation owners, Mr. Millet was the parish tax assessor and sheriff in the 1970's. Among other interests, he owns a motel, a small shopping center and a construction company.
Mr. Millet (pronounced MEE-yat) declined to be interviewed, but he has been quoted as saying he favors the Taiwan project because "thousands of jobs will come behind." The company says the plant will create 700 jobs.
Joel McTopy, a council member who is health and safety representative for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, says he worries about the record of Formosa Plastics.
Last year the E.P.A. proposed a fine of $8.3 million against the company for violations of waste laws at a chemical plant in Texas. In a recent settlement, the company agreed to pay $3,375,000. Last year it also agreed to pay a $65,000 fine for air pollution in Baton Rouge, where it has a chemical plant.
The company has asked the Environmental Protection Agency for a permit to discharge 53 million gallons of waste water a day, mostly into the Mississippi. A spokesman said the company planned to use the most modern pollution-fighting equipment available.
Carl Baloney Sr. is familiar with mortality in the region, as co-owner of two St. John Parish funeral homes. "Eight out of 10 people we bury probably have cancer," Mr. Baloney said. "Most of the deaths are cancer related."
Last year Mr. Baloney was an outspoken opponent of the new plant, but he has been quiet lately. He said his brother, who operates the only ambulance service in the parish, is a contender for a new parish ambulance contract. "The seeds were planted somewhere and it has been passed around the parish that 'Carl is hurting his brother's chances of getting the ambulance contract,' " Mr. Baloney said.
Mr. Greene, the waterfront property owner, said Formosa Plastics has approached him about buying part of his land. On a walk through the neighborhood, a strip of modest houses beside the levee, he said some neighbors have sold to the company but he wants neither to sell nor live with Formosa Plastics. "I am 68 years old," he said. "For me to move out now, where would I go?"
Mr. Greene said that in the struggle over the plant something fundamental had changed. "Whatever happens, it will never be business as usual in St. John Parish again," he said. "Politicians here never once dreamed this plant would drum up this much opposition. They will never try this again."

HEADLINE: Detroit Strives to Reclaim Lost Generation of Buyers

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 8

 BODY:
When Sue Anderson passed her driver's exam 10 years ago, she inherited the family Mazda. After graduation from college, she bought her family's Saab. Last year, the 26-year-old graphic designer from Grand Rapids, Mich., bought her first new car. It was a 1990 Mitsubishi Eclipse.
"I never really considered buying an American car, which is not to say I wouldn't," said Ms. Anderson, who aspires to buy another Saab. "I guess buying a foreign car has been kind of ingrained in me."
 
Foreign Cars Favored
 Ms. Anderson is part of the auto industry's "lost generation." A new wave of young drivers are shopping for their first new cars and trucks, and their biases spell deep trouble for the American auto industry. In large part, they are the children of the drivers who first traded their Fords, Dodges and Chevrolets in the 1970's for Hondas, Toyotas and BMW's. As they were growing up, their family cars were typically foreign makes, and they knew mostly horror stories about Detroit's products. Shaped by their parents' tastes, these young adults rarely set foot in the Big Three's car dealerships. 
 In the last decade, the American auto industry has invested more than $100 billion to improve quality, develop new designs and make vehicles more appealing. The General Motors Corporation's $3 billion Saturn project is only the latest example. But just gaining the attention of what the industry calls "import committed" buyers is among the most intractable of Detroit's predicaments -- and among the most critical to reverse.
"If Detroit is not successful in getting these buyers back," warned Robert A. Lutz, president of the Chrysler Corporation, "market share will experience further, gradual erosion." Only last month, Lee A. Iacocca, chairman and chief executive of Chrysler, appealed to President Bush to suppress Japanese imports, warning that the weak No. 3 auto maker would be "gone" if Japanese auto makers continued to gain market share.
 
Change in Buying Habits
 The sea change in American car-buying attitudes came about even before foreign models were being offered in significant numbers. Demographers detected a radical change in buying habits around the time of the Vietnam War. Before the mid-1960's, children frequently embraced the brand of consumer products, including cars, that their parents used. Adults tended to be loyal to one brand, and their children followed suit.
But the phenomenon of "Chevy families" and "Ford families" faded when children of the baby boom after World War II reached car-buying age in the 1970's. "Baby boomers had more money and were better educated," said James Kornas, director of market assessment for G.M.'s Cadillac division. "They also were rejecting their parents' values."
One value they rejected was loyalty to their parents' brands. "They could recognize the value and utility of imports," Mr. Kornas said. "This was the original BMW and Honda Accord crowd."
As more drivers tried foreign models and liked their fuel efficiency, reliability and comfort, even for smaller models, they spread the word. Good word of mouth, automotive marketers say, is by far the best advertising. The baby boomers were not particularly loyal to individual import brands, only to the notion of avoiding domestic models. Even if they loved their Honda, they might be willing to try a Toyota next.
Many of the baby boomers' children -- today's car buyers -- have reverted to their parents' buying habits. Consider the Gribbin family's history of car ownership:
David J. Gribbin, 51 years old, of Bethesda, Md., traded his 1978 Mustang II after just one year for a Honda Accord when the Mustang's transmission burned out, and later motor oil dripped down a cable and leaked through the dashboard.
"I bought a second Honda Accord because I liked the first one," he said. Since his first Honda, Mr. Gribbin's wife, Lori, bought a Nissan Maxima, his daughter, Deborah, inherited Mrs. Gribbin's used Nissan, and their son, D. J., traded a Subaru for a Toyota Corolla.
"I watched my parents' experience when American cars hit rock bottom," said D. J. Gribbin, 27, who is a lobbyist in Washington. "It's one thing for a car to leak oil -- but through the dashboard? Foreign cars might be more expensive, but the upkeep is less."
 
Foreign-Made Flops
 Of course, there have have been foreign-made flops, too. Renault, the French auto maker, stumbled in the United States with its Dauphine in the early 1960's and has never had much success here. Mazda's first cars imported here had faulty rotary engines and other problems. Even some early Hondas had defects.
Detroit auto makers are trying to build vehicles that will erase the bitter memories of yesteryear's Pintos and Volares. The Ford Motor Company's Taurus and Chrysler's mini-vans exemplify models that have demonstrated vastly improved quality and have also been popular sellers because of innovative design.
But altering the perceptions of young buyers like Sue Anderson, who are not familiar with domestic models and never grew up with them, or the younger Mr. Gribbin, who has wanted little to do with American cars, is proving to be a daunting problem.
 
Market Share Dwindles
 "A lot of people would have trouble admitting to their peers that they bought an Oldsmobile even if they thought it was every bit as good as a Honda," said Chris Cedergren of J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive marketing company in Agoura Hills, Calif.
Over all, the Big Three's share of the United States car market has dwindled to 67 percent. That statistic, however, does not apply to all age groups equally. Generally, older drivers prefer domestic makes, while younger ones, especially in their 20's and 30's, prefer foreign makes.
According to a J. D. Power study, 86 percent of the cars bought by people 65 years of age and older are domestic brands while only 14 percent of the people in that age group buy foreign makes.
The shift is more dramatic in the 25-to-34 age group. There, 54 percent drive domestic models, while about 46 percent drive cars made by foreign manufacturers.
 
Same Old Reason
 Of course, many believe United States auto makers are failing to win back import buyers for precisely the reason they first lost them: Too few of the Big Three's models are competitive in performance, quality and style. Independent researchers still give the Japanese models generally higher ratings for quality, value and reliability.
"I don't think it's snobbism," said Martin Swig, a San Francisco dealer who sells imported and domestic brands. "Honda and Toyota haven't made many mistakes. Consumers are acting in a rational way."
Mr. Iacocca disagrees. He blames the nation's "inferiority complex" for causing consumers to choose Japanese models over Chryslers, Dodges and Plymouths, which Chrysler asserts are superior to Hondas and Toyotas.
"People think all Japanese products are good and all American products are bad," Mr. Iacocca declared last year in a televised advertisement. "Now that's got to stop."
From the earliest days of the Volkswagen Beetle, Detroit has struggled to understand why American consumers have flocked to smaller, lighter, fuel-efficient models imported by foreign auto makers. "The industry had the utter misapprehension that the people who bought these cars were second-rate buyers in education and income levels and didn't care about quality," said David E. Davis, editor of Automobile magazine.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Corvair, Ford's Falcon and Chrysler's Plymouth Valiant were low-quality vehicles aimed at Beetle buyers of the 1960's. The next generation of import fighters, the Chevy Vega, which had chronic engine defects; the Ford Pinto, which was criticized for its propensity to catch fire in rear-end collisions, and, in the mid-70's, the American Motors Pacer, an odd-shaped vehicle that used too much gas for a small car, were just more of Detroit's self-inflicted wounds,
In the 80's, Detroit tried leather-wrapped steering wheels, black molding to replace chrome strips and European-sounding names, but they did little to attract import buyers. Nor were buyers won over by the Cadillac Cimarron, a small, lower-priced luxury car that was essentially a dressed-up Chevrolet Cavalier.
The Big Three have also renamed several foreign models and sold them as their own with mixed success. Suzuki's Sprint, for example, also sells as Chevrolet's Geo Metro and has added some sales for G.M. Ford's attempt to start a Merkur franchise with two European-made models failed to attract many buyers.
Owners of foreign cars appear to be too savvy to be swayed by such tactics, said Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of the FCB/Leber Katz advertising agency and a former Chrysler vice president. "Instead," she said, "they have to hear from domestic owners, 'It's a wonderful car, I haven't had a lick of trouble.' And then it will be a long and hard battle before people change."
 
Joint Ventures Worked
 When Big Three auto makers have teamed up with Japanese partners to develop or build models, they have achieved some hits. Ms. Anderson's $12,000 Mitsubishi, for example, was designed in Japan but assembled at the Diamond-Star plant in Bloomington, Ill., a joint venture of Chrysler and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Her Mitsubishi Eclipse is virtually identical to Chrysler's Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser, produced on the same assembly line.
Of the 50 million to 60 million households that buy new cars and trucks every few years, a quarter already may be solidly committed to buying foreign brands, according to Charles Stannard of DMB&B in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., the advertising agency for Cadillac and Pontiac.
"The car makers have to try to go after the very young," he said. "By the time you get into your 40's, it's too late to win you back." He says he thinks that more daring styling might win the Big Three some converts, because the styling of current Japanese models is bland.
Data from the first few thousand sales of G.M.'s new Saturn model, a front-wheel-drive compact that costs $8,000 to $12,000, are coming in. The car is built in Spring Hill, Tenn., and went on sale in November in parts of the United States and will be sold nationwide in coming weeks. G.M. says that about half the people who have purchased Saturn models said their second choice was a foreign car.
"All things being equal, I would like to buy an American car," said the younger Mr. Gribbin. To accommodate his growing family he is considering trading his Toyota for a domestic mini-van. "It's better for our economy and our trade balance," he said. "But it's got to hold up." Power, J.D.

Big Round of Discount Fares Was a Success, Airlines Say

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, April 8

 BODY:
The big discount fares offered by most large airlines in the last four weeks attracted thousands of bookings by travelers who had sharply limited air travel in January and February because of worries about recession and terrorism related to the Persian Gulf war.
Executives at travel agencies and representatives for several airlines said that while the fare discounts, which expired today, were sold mostly to consumers planning spring and summer vacations, business travel also improved in March after a cease-fire was declared in the gulf. 
 "The sale did its job," said David Messing, a spokesman for Continental Airlines, in Houston. "Leisure travelers needed an incentive to start taking trips again. Now we have a situation where we have all the bookings that we would expect to have for this time of year. Two months ago, that was not the case."
David Paresky, the president and chief executive of Thomas Cook Travel, a national company with headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. said, "The airlines are still behind last year's load levels, but the gap is closing."
Some airlines said last week in their regular monthly reports that March air travel lagged behind the levels of last year, but not by as much as in January and February.
American Airlines, which began the round of fare discounts on March 13, said today that it had booked nearly four million passengers at the special discount fares by April 4, or more than 60 percent of all the reservations it accepted in the period.
A spokesman, Tim Smith, said that most trips were for vacations and that most were scheduled for this month and next. "At this stage, we are very encouraged by the early build in bookings based on these specials," he said, adding that the volume of calls to reservation lines had been heavy for the last week. Mr. Smith declined to say whether American anticipated a significant improvement in passenger loads this month from a year ago.
The discount fares purchased through today are valid for travel through Sept. 30, mainly for midweek travel at off-peak times and including a Saturday night stay. On the New York-to-Dallas route, for instance, American cut its lowest off-peak fare through May to $238 for a round-trip ticket, and $318 round trip from June through September, compared with $405 before the promotion.
The number of passengers and miles flown at American, the nation's largest airline, was down by 7.3 percent in March, compared with the same month a year ago, the airline said. But the March 1991 figure was up by 17.7 percent from February, and by 1.7 percent from January.
 
Fewer United Travelers
 United Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrer, said the number of passengers and miles traveled in March on all of its routes was down by 6.9 percent from the same period a year ago. But John C. Pope, the vice chairman, said, "We are encouraged by the recovery that we are currently seeing, particularly in our Pacific markets."
A spokesman at United's headquarters in Chicago, Joseph P. Hopkins, said its discount effort generated the second-highest daily volume of calls to the airline's reservations lines, on March 21. Of those calls, 39,000 were for international travel, United's highest one-day total for tickets abroad, he said.
At Delta Air Lines, the third-largest carrier, traveler interest in its discount fares increased in the last few weeks, followed by a "rush to meet the deadline," said Neil Monroe, a spokesman. Delta's count for passengers and miles flown rose by 4.4 percent in March, but the company attributed the increase mainly to the demise of one of its leading competitors, Eastern Airlines.
 
Analyst Sees Success
 Kevin C. Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company in New York, declared the discount fares a success. "They have stimulated consumers to dig into their pockets and start planning their summer vacations," he said. "The bookings may still be jejune, but they are headed in the right direction."
Mr. Murphy said several economists interpreted the response to the bargains as a hint of consumers' willingness to spend and that there were "some stirrings of an economic recovery out there."
Although the deeply discounted fares have ended, American said it would begin a new fare schedule that includes lower fares than existed before the March 13 promotion. The off-peak New York-to-Dallas fare is now $368 round trip for reservations made at least 21 days before the first part of a trip, the airline said.
The fare for a 14-day advance reservation is $438, and it is $538 for a seven-day reservation. Half of the seven-day fare will be refunded if the trip is canceled, American said, but no refunds would be made on the 14- and 21-day advance purchase tickets.
 
Longer Trips to Cost More
 Mr. Smith of American said the airline's revised schedule would make longer trips more expensive in most cases, except on such heavily traveled and competitive routes as New York to Los Angeles. The new fares would also provide greater discounts for tickets purchased at least 21 days before a flight's departure date than for those bought 14 days or seven days before the trip begins.
American anticipates that more than half of its tickets will be sold with the 21-day discounts, Mr. Smith said. These and other aspects of American's revised schedule were announced on March 13. The 21-day advance purchase fares were added then.

HEADLINE: Pact Reached On Brazil's Interest Debt

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Brazil and its commerical bankers announced an agreement yesterday for the country to retire $8 billion in unpaid interest.
The preliminary deal will open the way for the main round of the debt negotiations between Brazil and its bankers -- the restructuring of $50 billion in borrowings that help make Brazil the largest debtor in the third world. 
 These negotiations are expected to be difficult and will largely hinge on whether Brazil can keep its economic program on track. Brazil has yet to reach a final agreement with the International Monetary Fund on an economic program, which would provide the country with loans and also make money available to be used as enhancements for bankers to offer the country debt reduction.
 
'On the Road Back'
 If an agreement is reached, the talks would be the biggest success in the Bush Administration's efforts to reduce the debt burdens of third world nations. And it would leave Argentina as the last big debtor not to reach an agreement under the program known as the Brady plan, after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
The Brazilian agreement was announced in New York and came after six months of difficult negotiations. "This is a step on the road back for Brazil," said William Rhodes, senior-executive international at Citibank and the chairman of the 21-bank negotiating committee. "Over all it took a very long time," added Jorio Dauster, chief negotiator for Brazil.
Brazil halted its interest payments in July 1989. By the end of last year, the unpaid interest totaled about $8 billion. The Brazilians resumed some interest payments in the first quarter and have paid around $400 million this year.
Under the agreement, which is still subject to approval by the hundreds of banks with loans to Brazil, about 25 percent of the unpaid interest will be paid in cash -- about $900 million 10 days after the agreement is final and the rest in installments though the end of the year. The remainder of the interest will be converted to 10-year bonds with a blend of fixed and floating interest rates that banks can choose from. The bonds will not be issued until there is an agreement on the rewriting of the $50 billion in medium- and long-term debt.
 
Tough Economic Plan
 In an interview, Mr. Dauster said the key concern for Brazil in the next round of negotiations would be to minimize its payments for the next several years. The country's economy has not nearly recovered from the recession caused by the stringent economic measures the Government imposed just over a year ago to fight inflation and to open the country's market.
Because of this, Mr. Dauster said, the Brazilians are interested in turning some of the existing debt into very long-term bonds -- as much as 45 years -- to reduce the early payments. Other options for the banks include shorter-term bonds on which the face amount of the debt owed would be reduced in exchange. The Brazilians, he added, would not ask for a debt reduction on the longer-term bonds.
"We need to have this curve where debt repayments will be quite small in the first years," he said. "We want debt reduction, sure," he added, "but we are also talking about how to pay, and there are other ways."
In addition to the $50 billion Brazil owes the banks, it has another $61 billion of debt with foreign governments and international agencies.
As the talks dragged on, the Brazilians came under increasing pressure to come to an agreement on the unpaid interest.
A potential agreement on an economic program with the I.M.F. last year was delayed. And just recently, a $350 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank was also delayed. Officials of both the Bush Administration and the I.M.F. said they were becoming concerned that Brazil's not dealing quickly with the unpaid interest was setting a tone that could complicate debt negotiations with other countries.
Also, a recent change in I.M.F policy, which allows economic agreements to be reached and loans to be made while countries are still in arrears, was sharply criticized by bankers and was becoming an embarrassment to the I.M.F. as the Brazilian talks dragged on.
Among the debt agreements reached so far under the Brady plan are those with Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Morocco and Uruguay. Argentina, with arrears almost as large as Brazil's, hopes to begin negotiating by the end of the year. It also has to work out a new economic program with the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: A Minority Plan For City Council

 BODY:
In a preview of the possibilities and the passions that will be ignited in the quest for 51 new New York City Council districts, a private group yesterday offered a plan in which black, Asian-American and Hispanic residents represent the majority in 29 of the districts.
The Community Service Society of New York said its plan would provide for 13 predominantly black districts, 10 Hispanic, 2 in which Asians and other nonwhites dominate and 4 in which a combination of all minorities dominate. 
 "Today blacks, Asians and Latinos constitute nearly 60 percent of the population of New York City," said David R. Jones, the president of the society. "The rapidly growing population of people of color presumably should produce a similar shift in the racial and ethnic composition of the Council."
The 35-seat Council now has three Hispanic, six black and no Asian-American members.
The Council will expand to 51 seats later this year, in accordance with the new City Charter. The New York City Districting Commission is charged with creating the 51 districts, with a mandate to insure fair representation to minorities.

Since network television cameras and correspondents were not invited by the Pentagon to record the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989, tonight's edition of "Frontline" is the fullest opportunity so far for Americans to witness the brief but violent encounter. Using pictures taken by Air Force combat cameramen, "War and Peace in Panama," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, captures the few explosive hours that brought an end to the career of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The program begins in October 1989, with a failed anti-Noriega coup, which Washington had encouraged but did not assist. That embarrassment led to military planning for what would be known as Operation Just Cause. The campaign, devised under Gen. Colin L. Powell, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was a small-scale preview of Operation Desert Storm: a surprise attack by overwhelming force aimed at rapid victory. 
 The account of the fighting is compelling. Along with the pictures of tracer fire against dark skies, gutted buildings, house-to-house searches and bodies on the street come personal accounts from both sides.
A United States soldier relates: "There were two Panamanians that ambushed me. And they were about 10 feet away when they opened up with AK-47's on full automatic. And it felt like someone, like Mike Tyson had punched me in the chest as hard as he could."
A Panamanian civilian recalls: "There was an explosion. The light went out. All the windows shattered and the ceiling fan fell down. My wife thought the wall was going to fall on us. My oldest daughter said, 'Mom, let's pray,' but my wife couldn't say, 'Our Father.' "
Drawing on debriefings of General Noriega's bodyguards, the program reports that the Panamanian ruler spent the hours of the attack drinking heavily, taking comfort with a woman and counting on the intercession of witches to save him. A soldier who searched his office tells of finding alcohol, pornographic treats and little statues of frogs: "He loved frogs, or something."
Aspects of the attack are criticized ("Every service got a piece of the pie," says one observer) as is the failure to capture General Noriega, who turned himself in after a few days. But most of the criticism is directed at the consequences of the war.
Robert White, a former United States Ambassador to El Salvador and a frequent critic of Reagan and Bush Administration policies toward Central America, sets the tone. He calls Washington's estimate that only about 200 civilians were killed in the invasion "an absurdly low figure," adding that the estimates by some Panamanians of more than 2,000 deaths is "absurdly high." Whatever the figure, he wants Washington to pay compensation. Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama, calls on the United States to give more aid for reconstruction.
The post-Noriega Government is faulted for failing to deal with high unemployment; staffing the police force with former members of the Panamanian army; not cracking down on drug traffic; money laundering and other varieties of corruption, and restricting press freedom. If any enthusiastic supporters of the Government exist, they are not in evidence here.
This provocative hour ends with the suggestion that the military success in Panama gave President Bush confidence to use force against Iraq. It leaves open the question of whether the consequences of America's latest victory on the battlefield will prove as problematic as its previous one.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
Would Straw Have Hustled To Third?

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
ONE small base for Hubie Brooks, one giant base for Metkind.
One run doesn't make a season. But yesterday it made a 2-1 victory that delighted 50,800 parishioners at Shea Stadium in the Mets' opener. 
 The decisive run scored when Hubie Brooks, who has succeeded Darryl Strawberry as the cleanup hitter and right fielder, scored on a double steal. But the double steal developed after Brooks tagged up at second base and hustled to third on Howard Johnson's flyball to Dale Murphy, the Phillies right fielder.
"Murphy can still throw," Mike Cubbage, the Mets third-base coach, said later, "but it was just deep enough."
Just deep enough for Brooks to slide into third ahead of Murphy's good throw. And just thoughtful enough for any Mets fan to wonder: would the Mets' previous right fielder, Darryl Strawberry, have hurried to third so that he might have been able to score on another flyball with one out?
Maybe if Darryl felt like hustling. Maybe if Darryl were in the mood.
As the season progresses without Strawberry's big bat, the Mets will need all the runs they can manufacture. They can't wait for somebody to hit a three-run homer. They must put together runs with glue and paste and twine, as they did yesterday. One run in the first on consecutive doubles by Vince Coleman and Gregg Jefferies. Another in the fourth on Brooks's double, his hustle in going to third and Manager Bud Harrelson's sign for a double steal.
Those runs were all that Dwight Gooden, with ninth-inning relief from John Franco, needed while allowing only six hits and striking out seven.
Moments after Gooden strode to the mound for the first inning, the Doobie Brothers' rendition of "Signed, Sealed and Delivered" boomed out of the public-address amplifiers beyond the center-field fence. Signed for $15.45 million, sealed through the 1994 season and delivered as the Mets' opening-day starter for the fourth consecutive year and the sixth in his eight seasons. If it's opening day, it must be Dr. K starting.
Judging by the current baseball economy, not to be confused with the national economy, "Signed, Sealed and Delivered" might soon replace "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" as baseball's anthem.
With all their millions, many sports celebrities are resented now by fans, but Dwight Gooden seems to be more cherished than ever by the Shea Stadium parishioners. Hardly a voice was heard complaining about his new contract that, if his video royalities boom, would lift him above Roger Clemens as baseball's highest paid performer. At least until somebody else gets a bigger contract than both of them.
In the eyes of the Shea Stadium parishioners, Gooden can do no wrong. Maybe because he once did wrong: his 1987 drug problem.
Until then, Gooden had been almost too good to be true. But when he required rehab, it seemed to humanize him as a person. He knew he made a mistake. And he vowed not to make it again.
"He's genuine," said Dr. Alan Lans, who supervises the Mets employee-assistance program. "He took it and he grew with it."
Unlike Strawberry, who so often seemed to say the wrong thing, Gooden invariably says the right thing. Straw had been threatening for years to join the Los Angeles Dodgers in his hometown. And as a free agent, he did just that, with waves of "I Hate New York" comments in his wake. Gooden, in contrast, spoke about how New York had become his baseball home, how the fans had supported him.
"Even through my tough times, they had every right to get on me," he said, alluding to his drug rehab. "But they stuck with me."
He remembered the June night in 1987 when he hopped out of the dugout and walked to the mound for the first time that season.
"I didnt' know what to expect," he recalled. "But when I heard those cheers, it brought tears to my eyes. It pumped me up."
He's still pumped. When his big contract was announced, Al Harazin, the keeper of the keys to the Mets treasury, described him as "the heart and soul of our ballclub." As yet, nobody in the front office has spoken of Frank Viola that fondly. Viola, of course, is about to turn 31. Apparently the Mets are concerned about his age, as well as the bone spurs in his left elbow.
"You have to look down the road," the Mets' senior executive vice-president, Frank Cashen, said, "and judge who'll be more important to you then, Viola or some kid who's just coming along now."
But if the Mets were willing to offer Viola more than $13 million for three seasons, why won't they offer him another million or two to keep him? If the Mets only produce three doubles, Hubie Brooks's hustle and a double steal that produced their first theft of home since Danny Heep did it in 1985, they need all the pitching they can get. Now and down the road.

HEADLINE: Tap the Treasure in Rent Control

 BODY:
While New Yorkers ponder emergency measures to repair their city's deteriorating financial condition, a hoard of taxable value remains untapped under the welter of rent control regulations that keep the rents for many apartments unjustifiably low.
The potential to generate new income for the city increases the need to mitigate rent regulations that have destroyed older housing and discouraged new rental construction for half a century. 
 A civic group, the Citizens Budget Commission, recently produced yet another study showing that while rent control assists a small number of low-income families, its main beneficiaries have been families in above-average income brackets, which have received an unparalleled housing bargain at taxpayer expense.
According to the commission and Prof. Elizabeth Roistacher of Queens College, who conducted a survey for the commission, tenants in apartments renting for $750 a month or higher receive on the average a gift of $4,140 a year. That's how much more rent other people would be willing to pay for the same apartments in a free market.
The apartments under regulation in New York City are relatively cheap compared with apartments of similar quality in other cities without rent regulation. The cost of this hidden subsidy is borne partly by the owners of the buildings, who receive less rent than in a free market, and partly by the city, which collects less in taxes than if the apartments rented at market rates.
The tax charges on such buildings would, by Professor Roistacher's findings, be about $100 million a year higher if rents were allowed to rise to market levels and the assessed valuation of the buildings were adjusted accordingly.
There is an easy fix for this injustice. The Emergency Tenant Protection Act, the state's basic rent regulation statute, provides that when 5 percent of the apartments in any price class are vacant, the class must be decontrolled and de-regulated. Unfortunately, state and city governments, fearful of a backlash from tenants, refuse to press for an official study testing the vacancy rate at different price levels.
If a survey indicated that, as many people suspect, vacancies now exceed the limit, the law should be allowed to run its course, subject to existing leases.
With the city cutting vital services and flirting with new taxes that could stifle the economy, rent control can no longer be viewed as a politically benign way to do a favor for tenants at the expense of everyone else in New York. Ignoring the economics of such unjustified subsidies has become political treason to the city and particularly to those in its population who depend most on public services.

HEADLINE: Layoffs Line the Road to Recovery

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Last month's surge in unemployment made a lot of people wonder how the recession can wind down as long as workers are losing jobs. In fact, layoffs and unemployment typically keep climbing long after spending starts to revive.
 "What surprises people is that everything doesn't happen simultaneously," said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 No one can say for sure that a recovery will arrive between Memorial Day and Labor Day, as many economists expect. But the pattern of past recessions strongly suggests that the transition from economic contraction to expansion takes months and progresses in fits and starts. "Recessions are more predictable than expansions," noted Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
If the typical pattern persists, the economy will shed jobs right up until the recovery starts. What is more, unemployment will keep rising for several months after the recession ends. Not only will business bolster production, at first by extending overtime and raising productivity, but more people will flood into the labor market as the chances of quickly finding work start to improve.
"We could get another month of decline in payrolls of 200,000 or 250,000, as in March," said Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley economist who expects growth to resume this summer. "After that, you'd expect the declines to taper off to 100,000 to 150,000."
Here is how past recessions have ended: First, the forces that toppled the economy dissipate. The Federal Reserve provides stimulus with more money and lower interest rates. Investors and consumers turn more optimistic, and after a while, spending comes sporadically.
 
Orders Filled From Stockpiles
 Business does not rehire laid-off workers right away. Initially, companies fill orders with goods that piled up during the slump. Then the layoffs stop, usually signaling the end of the recession.
Consider the previous recession, which lasted from January 1981 through November 1982. The economy lost more than 300,000 jobs in July 1982 and roughly 200,000 jobs a month in each of the last four months of the recession. Payrolls even dipped a bit in December 1982, the first month of the recovery. Further, businesses started aggressively expanding their work forces only in March 1983, and unemployment topped out at 10.8 percent early that year.
In short, sales pick up months before companies start rehiring. Consumer spending starts to recover even though many people are still losing their jobs or are having trouble finding work. Increasingly confident consumers who have hung onto their jobs start spending, more than offseting the loss of buying power of workers being laid off.
How do economists expect this recession to end? "We've got some of the preconditions for a turnaround," Mr. Boskin said. The war is over, oil prices are down and inflation is falling. With the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy, the money supply is rapidly growing and both short- and long-term interest rates have fallen substantially from the levels of the fall. Investors have turned bullish, and consumers' spirits have revived.
"The process has already begun," said Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
 
Housing Rebounds First
 Housing is almost always the first segment of the economy to perk up. "The reason is that as mortgage rates come down, housing becomes more affordable for people who haven't lost their jobs," Mr. Steinberg said. Now, for example, houses are more affordable than they have been in 14 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. Besides, only about a million people buy a brand-new house in any given year, and recently many fewer have been buying. It thus takes only a small fraction of the 95 million American households to spark a rebound by buying new homes.
Sales of new and existing homes jumped in February, and surveys by the Mortgage Bankers Association and the National Association of Home Builders suggest that sales -- especially of the entry-level houses that first-time buyers purchase -- continued to head up in March.
A revival in home buying typically spills over to spending on everything from sinks to sofas, as buyers feather their new nests. At the same time, consumers who had postponed car purchases start showing up again at dealers' lots.
 
Recovery Takes Time
 "This will be consumer-led, not a business-led recovery," said David W. Mullins, the new vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. But it usually takes time for the economy to shift from recession to expansion, and there are setbacks.
"There's a dissonance between attitudes and spending right now," Mr. Mullins said. "It's a mirror image of last summer, when attitudes stank, but sales kept going for a couple of months after confidence collapsed."
While consumer confidence has rebounded strongly, car sales edged up only a bit in February and March. Beyond slightly higher factory orders for consumer goods, there is no sign yet of a broader revival of spending.
Such a revival would not necessarily spell instant relief from layoffs. For starters, business outlays for machinery and buildings usually turn down toward the end of a recession. Such outlays -- which amount to about a tenth of the gross national product, compared with two-thirds for consumer spending -- rose in the first months of the recession.
More important, "when consumer spending starts to stabilize," Mr. Roach said, "the classical pattern is for business to keep trimming production and cutting costs." That is because inventories typically pile up during the first leg of the downturn.
"Clearing shelves of excess stocks can take months," Mr. Roach added. Cars are a case in point. Although the annual selling rate is running slightly above six million, the Big Three and the Japanese auto makers with United States plants are holding production below a five million annual rate.
One reason for hope this time around is that business was a lot quicker to respond to the collapse in demand. Consumption fell sharply in the fall, and businesses immediately slashed inventories at an annual rate of $28 billion -- nearly a record.
"This is the promptest move in any recession since the 50's," Mr. Roach said. Contrast that to the 1973-75 recession, when business held onto workers and kept turning out goods nearly a year into the slump. Finally, the bottom fell out of the economy and unemployment soared to 9 percent. Despite the fact that inventories are thin by past standards, Mr. Roach expects businesses to do more trimming, since they are still a bit fatter than executives would like.
But at some point, business must step up production just to keep inventories from falling further. To be sure, there are risks that this process, which seems to have started already, could be short-circuited. One risk is that the credit drought will persist. "Our concern is that if the tightness continues, it would be a substantial moderating force," said Mr. Mullins of the Federal Reserve. "We are concerned about bankers being willing to lend to home builders and exporters."
A bigger threat is that consumers will become discouraged or run out of cash before business stops retrenching. "It's a race between consumers who want to spend and business that wants to cut costs," said David Kelly, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill. Nonetheless, he says he expects consumers to hang in there.

A chart in Business Day yesterday showed the beginnings and ends of some U.S. recessions incorrectly. This is a corrected version of the chart, with recessions shown as white bands. (Source: Merrill Lynch)
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about post-recession employment trends misstated the unemployment rate after the recession that ended in November 1982. Unemployment reached its peak of 10.8 percent in the last month of that recession, not early in 1983. It held there in December 1982 and then declined.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
SmithKline's Expiring Patents

BYLINE: By Steven Prokesch

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
SINCE last April, the prices of the British shares and American equity units of SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., the British drug company, have soared 73 percent and 80 percent, respectively.
Many analysts still recommend buying them, on expectations they could climb more. But a growing number are urging investors to be conservative in their purchases or to stop buying. They are uneasy about SmithKline's ability to come up with new drugs to take over from some of the company's main drugs on which patents have or soon will expire. Those are Tagamet, an anti-ulcer drug; Amoxil, an antibiotic, and Dyazide, an anti-hypertension medicine. 
 Analysts cite two main reasons for the rise in the stock and equity units, each of which equals five British shares. Investors poured money into drug companies because earnings were seen to be relatively immune to a recession. And SmithKline Beecham, the product of the mid-1989 merger between Britain's Beecham and America's SmithKline Beckman, has been winning over skeptical investors by carrying out many promises made at the time of the merger.
It has reduced its staff by 2,900 people, sold $1.2 billion worth of assets (mainly cosmetics and food businesses), and closed 48 factories, distribution operations and offices. Last year it increased its operating profit margin by 3.8 points, to 20.8 percent, and slashed net debt by 61 percent, to $1.31 billion. And its sales force of 6,000 has significantly raised the sales of drugs like Augmentin, an antibiotic that had revenues of $793 million in 1990.
Despite their rise, SmithKline's securities still look like a bargain to some. The 10 leading drug company stocks in the United States are trading at about 18.5 times their expected 1991 earnings. SmithKline shares have been trading on the London stock exchange at a multiple of about 16. The American depository receipts for the shares closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $70.625. Possibly because of confusion about the tax treatment of their dividends and because index funds no longer buy SmithKline, the equity units have been trading at a multiple of about 14.5 on the New York exchange, where they closed yesterday at $62.375.
London-based Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. thinks the merger benefits will flow into the mid-1990's. It strongly recommends buying SmithKline securities. But analysts at Goldman, Sachs & Company and Merrill Lynch & Company believe the merger benefits will keep earnings growing 15 to 20 percent annually for only another year or two. They are worried about after 1992.
"The future is easier to see for other companies with more identifiable blockbuster products in their pipeline like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Glaxo," said Paul Krikler of Goldman, Sachs. He recently changed his recommendation on SmithKline from "buy" to "attractive," the equivalent of a weak buy.
The patent on SmithKline's biggest-selling drug, Tagamet, begins to expire in Europe this year, in Japan in 1992 and in the United States in 1994. That will open it up to significant competition from generic versions of the anti-ulcer drug. It continues to face tough competition from Glaxo's Zantac, a similar drug that is the market leader, and from Losec, a new competitor sold by Astra and Merck. Tagamet sales were flat in 1990, at $1.21 billion.
"I'm worried about Tagamet coming off patent," said Eile Gibson of Merrill Lynch. "I don't think SmithKline has enough firepower in its product range for the longer term."
Amoxil's and Dyazide's patents have already expired. Amoxil's sales, which analysts estimate at about $450 million, have been slipping. But Dyzazide got a break last year, when two companies had to withdraw generic versions from the American market because they had submitted fraudulent data to the Food and Drug Administration. Dyazide sales rose by 28 percent last year, to about $300 million, said Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at the Brenner Securities Corporation in New York.
"Probably not this year but more likely next, Dyazide could begin to face significant competition from generics," Mr. Sweig said. SmithKline is trying to soften the blow by supplying a generic form to Rugby, a big generic-drug company.
One promising new SmithKline drug is Engerix-B, a genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine. Mr. Krikler of Goldman, Sachs says it had sales of about $160 million last year. Some analysts are also optimistic about Seroxat, a new treatment for depression and anxiety.
Analysts are less optimistic about other drugs that SmithKline is rolling out. These include: Eminase, for treating heart attacks; Relifex, an anti-inflammatory drug, and Granisetron, for countering nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy. Analysts question whether they will be demonstrably superior to those of competitors.

The Faxes Are Coming

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
"YOU can't shake hands with a fax," headlined the ad from Go-USA, a coalition of companies seeking to put the bloom back in the cheeks of the depressed travel business. "Nothing can replace . . . the special feeling that comes only from being there." But such considerations have not stopped Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., from imagining an America in which improved telecommunications replaced 10 to 20 percent of the miles now logged by commuters, shoppers and business travelers.
No one really knows whether millions of Americans could be persuaded to let their fingers do most of the walking. Nor has anyone figured who would ante up the $200 billion-plus to rewire the nation for working and shopping at home, or how the services would be regulated. 
 But the study, underwritten by a communications equipment manufacturer and a handful of regional phone companies, does make a striking case for "demand side" solutions to what have always been seen as "supply side" problems of road congestion and related pollution. At very least, argues Ashok Boghani, an engineer at Arthur D. Little and the principal author of the study, telecommunications deserves a place at the planning table with expensive, high-tech transportation projects.
Suppose super-fast microprocessors, flat-panel high-definition television screens and fiber-optic cable made it practical to shop and perform most white-collar jobs by wire. The researchers estimate that some six million workers would abandon commuting, while 13 million business trips would be replaced with teleconferences each year. Householders would make three billion fewer shopping excursions; truck and airplane delivery miles would fall by 600 million annually.
That, in turn, would cut pollutants by an estimated 1.8 million tons, reduce gasoline consumption by 3.5 billion gallons and free 3.1 billion hours of time otherwise spent on the road. Plug in some plausible numbers for the value of avoiding fuel use, pollution and time in traffic, and you get a total annual savings of $23 billion.
To put this figure in perspective, the researchers made comparable estimates of the potential savings from three supply-side remedies for traffic and pollution headaches. High-speed rail systems in a half-dozen urban corridors might save as much as $1.2 billion annually. Signaling and control technologies that shoehorned more vehicles into limited road space might save $2 billion to $4 billion. Cleaner substitutes for gasoline might cut pollution costs by $6 billion to $8 billion.
These estimated benefits do not mean a great deal, of course, unless they can be compared with costs. And here the researchers offer only back-of-the-envelope calculations. At $89 billion, construction of a high-speed rail network seems a pricey fix. The $35 billion for intelligent vehicles and highways seems more within reach, as does $86 billion for a mass conversion to methanol-burning cars.
A high-technology telecommunications network would be far, far more expensive: perhaps $200 billion for the fiber-optic data network to replace copper wires in most homes and businesses, the researchers say, plus another $100 billion or so for the hardware and software to make good use of it. But the ratio of capital costs to annual benefits would be in the same ball park as fixes based on smart vehicles or clean fuels. And in any case, the savings in time and pollution measured in the study probably represent only the tail of the high-capacity telecommunications dog.
If American homes are wired with fiber-optic cable anytime soon, many experts believe, the driving force will be video entertainment. Television in general (and high-definition television in particular) uses enormous amounts of data carrying capacity, which can be most efficiently delivered with a fiber-optic network. Most likely, then, services that reduced the demand for transportation would be able to piggy-back at little cost on a system primarily designed to supply everything from choose-your-own-ending soap operas to the interactive sex shows from Bangkok.
Regulating this yet to be designed techno-miracle would pose unique problems. Peter Pitsch, a former Federal Communications Commission staff member who is now a Washington consultant, wonders how data services would be priced. Would, for example, telephones that used just one-thousandth as much capacity as high-definition television be charged just one-thousandth as much?
But all this is beside the researchers' point. Big changes in telecommunications are coming, they suggest. And while transportation savings may represent a modest fraction of the benefit, communications is bound to be a plausible alternative to getting from here to there.

End of Slump Seen in Quarter

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9 (AP)

 BODY:
Seventy percent of the nation's top economists believe that the United States economy will pull out of the recession in the current quarter, according to a survey released today.
The survey, by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter in Sedona, Ariz., showed that the participants were more optimistic than those in a poll in January, when 66 percent forecast that the recession would end in this quarter. 
 Seventy-six percent now believe that the recession began last August or September, up from 61 percent in January. Just 7 percent said it began last October, down from 23 percent in the earlier poll.
Thirteen percent projected that the recession would extend into the third quarter, down from 26 percent in the January survey. The average length of previous postwar recessions was 11 months.
The consensus forecast also expects a contraction in the nation's gross national product of 1.7 percent at an annual rate, compared with the average shrinkage of 2.6 percent in previous postwar downturns.

HEADLINE: Missouri Tries to Revamp Public Schools

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
This fiscally conservative state, which ranks in the bottom quarter in spending on education, is debating an ambitious plan to fine-tune its public education system and increase spending $460 million a year.
At a public meeting in the State Capitol here on Wednesday, a special legislative committee will hear from corporate leaders, educators and taxpayers on a proposed $460 million public referendum that would increase the state sales tax, cigarette tax and corporate income tax, among other changes, to raise the state's level of education spending almost 25 percent. 
 The plan would also give the state commissioner of higher education and the State Board of Education new powers to plan and carry out major education changes.
Missouri spends $1.9 billion on public education. Per student, it ranks 38th in spending on elementary and secondary schools and 46th in spending on higher education.
 
Billed as a Survival Plan
 The education bill passed the Missouri Senate last month. If the Assembly approves it, the referendum would be placed on the general election ballot in November.
Since 1980, when Missouri residents won the right to vote on any large tax changes in a public referendum, four of five propositions put before voters have been approved.
But a coalition of businesses, led by the Missouri Chamber of Commerce, opposes the referendum proposal. "To just give more money and trust they will spend it wisely is not good enough for us," said Tony Reinhart, the legislative specialist for the chamber.
State officials who support the referendum, called the Economic Survival Act of 1991, have presented it as an economic strategy for Missouri's future, predicting that unless elementary and high school education is improved, and unless more college students are educated to perform basic research and to communicate in a global economy, the state could lose its competetive edge.
The referendum would increase spending at all levels of public education, including small increases for job training and development. The largest share of the package would be used to reorganize Missouri's 10 university campuses, 3 state colleges and 12 community college districts.
Charles J. McClain, Commissioner of the Missouri Coordinating Board for Higher Education, an advisory board for the state's colleges and universities, said the current system was so unbalanced that in 1989 it awarded more than 14,000 undergraduate degrees, but only 65 of them in foreign languages, 114 in mathematics and 209 in the physical sciences, areas he called essential to Missouri's economic survival.
The same year, Missouri's public institutions awarded 3,662 degrees in business, 2,293 in education and 1,173 in engineering, according to state reports.
Dr. McClain said such imbalances have been masked by the system's overall enrollment gains.
"For too long we've been interested in quantity over quality," he said. "This is a call for the refining of missions so that every instituion doesn't try to do everything for everyone."
If the referendum is approved by voters, the Coordinating Board will be given greater authority over colleges and univerities, which now enjoy an unusual degree of autonomy. Each institution would be encouraged to become a specialized center of learning, focusing on science, for example, or telecommunications, while forgoing a more general curriculum.
The institutions would be offered financial incentives from the referendum money to comply with many of the changes, including those that could mean a drop in student enrollment. Each institution could choose to reject the board's recommendations.
"If they don't want to play, fine," Dr. McClain said. "But then they don't get the money."

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Fall Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts fell for the period ended yesterday -- their sixth straight weekly drop -- with yield declines a little larger than the previous week.
In the New York market, were banks set yields slightly more aggressively than in most of the country, yields on certificates of deposit slipped further, with commercial banks leading the way. 
 Analysts at The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., noted that many in the banking industry expected this trend toward lower yields to end in the near future.
With yields on certificates down so low, some bank customers are scrambling to find higher yields elsewhere, while others wanting to keep their cash in federally insured banks are rolling over maturing C.D.'s into those with longer maturities, trying to improve their yields somewhat.
At the Treasury Department's weekly auction of short-term bills held on Monday, average discount rates dropped sharply from the previous auction. The auction's results often influence what many banks pay on their money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The yield on a three-month bill fell by 20 basis points, to 5.60 percent, the lowest since November 1987, while the yield on the six-month bill fell by 11 basis points, to 5.68 percent, the lowest since July 1987. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In its weekly survey of New York area banks, the publication noted that after weeks of larger yield declines at savings institutions, commercial banks have moved out in front.
The largest yield declines for the New York region this week were recorded at the Republic National Bank of New York, which cut the yield on its money market account by 35 basis points, to 5.65 percent; on its three-month certificate by 43 basis points, also to 5.65 percent, and on its six-month certificate by 59 basis points, to the same yield.
Commercial banks this week lowered the yields on their money market accounts by 5 basis points, to 5.50 percent, and on three-month certificates by 8 basis points, to 5.93 percent. The yield on the longer six-month ceritificate was cut by 10 basis points, to 6.07 percent.
At savings institutions, the average money market account yield was cut by 2 basis points, to 5.78 percent, while that on a three-month certificate was cut by 7 basis points, to 6.33 percent, and the yield on a six-month certificate by 6 basis points, to 6.55 percent.

Treasury Prices Decline Slightly

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in listless trading yesterday, as dealers sold some securities in advance of an auction today of $8.5 billion worth of new seven-year Treasury notes.
In addition, a clear signal from the Federal Reserve Board that it has not eased monetary policy did not seem to sit well with the debt market. 
 The Fed drained reserves from the banking system yesterday when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 5 13/16 percent, under the 6 percent rate that is regarded as the Fed's target.
 
'Things Are on Hold'
 "The Fed made it very clear that things are on hold for the time being," said Kristin Foster, an economist at Citicorp Investment Bank.
Still, a number of analysts continue to say the Fed will push down short-term rates soon.
"We still expect the Fed to ease the funds rate to 5 3/4 percent within the next two weeks," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
Aside from watching the Fed, traders said there was little to do. With significant inflation figures expected on Thursday and Friday, traders said there was little reason for clients to do business now.
Right now, "the signals are very mixed," said David R. Duerson, manager of government bond trading at Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles. "Customers are pretty fully invested, and the Street is confused about the market's long-term prospects."
 
30-Year Bond Yields 8.20%
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 96 3/8, down 14/32, to yield 8.20 percent, up from 8.15 percent late Monday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 6/32, down 3/8 point, to yield 8.01 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, down 3/32, to yield 6.93 percent.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the seven-year Treasury notes to be auctioned this afternoon were offered at a price to yield 7.91 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.59 percent, up a basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.67 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.85 percent.
A number of issues were offered in the tax-exempt municipal bond market yesterday, including the competitive sale of a two-part $155 million issue for the State of Ohio.
The largest part of the issue, $110 million worth of serial bonds, was won by a group led by Morgan Stanley & Company.
The issue, which is insured by the Ambac Indemnity Corporation, consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1992 to 2006. The securities maturing in 1992 were not reoffered to investors.
Yields on the bonds that were reoffered range from 5.30 percent on securities maturing in 1993 to a maximum of 6.70 percent on bonds maturing in 2005 and 2006.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds, traders said prices of most widely quoted issues declined by about 1/4 point.
Yesterday's drop of 45.54 points in the Dow Jones industrial average had little impact in the high-yield "junk bond" market. Junk bond prices are often affected by movements in stock prices, but market participants said most issues showed little change yesterday.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues dipped by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in light trading.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Steep Declines After German Rate Increase

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply on world currency markets yesterday as investors focused on interest rates.
Gold prices advanced. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $364.90 an ounce, up $3.10 from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $3.15, to a late bid of $363.80. 
 The dollar fell in European trading. Traders said the decline came after the German central bank notched up the interest rate on repurchase agreements to 8.6 percent.
Although the rate advanced only a tenth of a percentage point, there was concern that it signaled "the beginning of an initial tightening by the Germans," said Earl Johnson, a vice president with Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Traders fear that the Bundesbank might be planning more rate increases in the coming weeks. Higher foreign interest rates are generally bearish for the dollar since investors who want to capture those returns must buy foreign currencies to do so. In the process, they would sell dollars.
When trading shifted to domestic markets yesterday, dealers expressed the additional concern that the Federal Reserve might proceed with a rate cut of its own, further widening the differential between United States and foreign interest rates.
Market observers said the Fed is likely to take its cue from economic data to be released later this week, especially the producer price report and Consumer Price Index for March, due out Thursday and Friday, respectively.
"Interest rates are back at the forefront of today's market," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank in New York "That was the catalyst that got the selling rolling."
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 135.00 yen, down sharply from its previous close of 137.00. In New York, the dollar settled at 134.85 yen, down from 137.15 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7900, up from $1.7685 late Monday. In New York it cost $1.7945 to buy one pound, up from $1.7650 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.6655 German marks, down from 1.6926; 1.4080 Swiss francs, down from 1.4362; 5.6360 French francs, down from 5.7255; 1,236.50 Italian lire, down from 1,256.00, and 1.1525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1539.

HEADLINE: Republicans Court Foes To Oppose Weicker Tax

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 9

 BODY:
The Republican Party, the long-suffering minority in Connecticut's legislature, has joined a growing list of individuals and interest groups willing to follow Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in tossing tradition on the ash heap.
The tradition Republicans plan to toss, however, is not their opposition to a state income tax. Instead, they say they will reject orthodoxy by crossing the aisle to seek a pact with Democrats to kill Mr. Weicker's income-tax plan. 
 On the political stage transformed by Mr. Weicker's election as an independent and his sweeping tax and budget proposals, the Republicans are the latest group to declare themselves as active players who hope to influence the final result.
 
Controls on Spending
 Mr. Weicker earlier won support for his income tax from leading business groups, which like the Governor's plan to cut business taxes but are also seeking controls on state spending. Unions representing state employees are prepared to condition wage and benefit concessions on the passage of an income tax, which they see as the only way to assure stable finances in the future.
But the Republican initiative marks the beginning of what some politicians say will be the middle game in the state's attempt to resolve a budget shortfall that is now expected to reach $2.6 billion over the next 15 months.
The party's alternative budget, still sketchy in detail, is based around a rise in sales tax collections, deeper cuts in state spending and layoffs of more state employees than proposed by Mr. Weicker, but no income tax.
 
'A Defining Moment'
 If Republicans and Democrats join to pass such a plan, the General Assembly will have thwarted a governor and laid the groundwork for a bitter fight over a potential veto. If it fails, the aisle will still have been crossed.
"This is a defining moment for the legislature," said the State Senate's highest-ranking Democrat, John B. Larson of East Hartford, the chamber's president pro tempore.
The Republicans, who have 16 members in the 36-seat Senate, say they are united around their plan and need only three Democrats to pass an alternative there and 13 votes in the House of Representatives. Mr. Larson, while noncommittal, reaffirmed at least his philosophical opposition to an income tax after meeting with Republican leaders on Monday.
Some Democrats are even more to the point.
"God bless them," said Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford and a firm income-tax opponent, referring to the Republicans. But if the traditional roles inside the General Assembly are breaking down, so too are those outside the legislature as a whole new list of players in the budget process -- notably the state's big business organizations and labor unions -- have emerged to work their influence as Mr. Weicker's allies. More characters mean a far less predictable resolution than the numbers of votes in the legislature might indicate, people in both parties say.
For example, the unions representing state employees -- all firmly in support of an income tax because they say a dependable revenue stream would make their jobs more secure in the long run -- are now negotiating with the Weicker administration on a $400 million package of wage and benefit concessions.
 
'A Pivotal Role'
 Union leaders say that whatever givebacks are finally agreed on will be contingent on the survival of the income tax. If the Weicker plan goes down, they say, all bets are off. The Republican plan, or the bipartisan plan, as Republicans prefer to call it, is hinged on the same $400 million package being sought by Mr. Weicker. Union leaders say they are a tool, or perhaps a bludgeon, ready and willing to be used Mr. Weicker against the General Assembly if he so chooses.
"As Governor, he understands that he can go to the legislature and say, I have X millions from the unions, but the whole deal is jeopardized if there isn't something that provides stability for the unions in the future," said Jerome P. Brown, president of the 18,000-member District 1199 of the New England Health Care Employees Union. "We have a pivotal role."
The business groups, led by the 7,000-member Connecticut Business and Industry Association and the Insurance Association of Connecticut, representing the huge insurance companies based mostly in Hartford, have said they would use their influence on behalf of an income tax plan if it includes signficant cuts in business taxes and some method of controlling future growth in state spending.
 
Sales Tax Collections
 Any plan that does not meet those standards will be fully and vigorously opposed, the groups say. Where the Republican plan falls is still uncertain. It would lower corporate taxes as much as Mr. Weicker's, to 11.5 percent from 13.8 percent. But collections from the sales tax, about 40 percent of which is paid by businessess, would rise significantly.
The new proposal would lower the sales tax by at least one-half of 1 percent from the current 8 percent rate, Republicans said. But previously untaxed items would be added to bring in more revenue. No list was provided because most of the details remain to be worked out in negotiations with potential Democratic converts.
Some politicians say those negotiations will make the old predictable two-party world seem like simplicity itself.
"It used to be the Warsaw Pact vs. NATO, with two defined coalitions and all the players on one side of the fence or another," Mr. Jepsen said. "Now it's back to the 1830's and days of Metternich -- coalitions are going to be free-floating and temporary and you'll see a lot of groups playing ball who until now have been shut out of the process."
Mr. Weicker proposed in February a comprehensive plan that he said would both resolve the budget shortfall and stimulate the economy. It would lower the 8 percent sales tax to 4.25 percent but expand the base of taxable items to include things like movie tickets, gasoline and inexpensive clothing.
 
Tax on Dividends
 The existing income tax on dividends and interest, which now peaks at 14 percent for incomes over $100,000, would be scrapped, as would the 7 percent capital-gains tax now assessed on profits from the sale of stock or other assets. Instead, all income would be treated equally and taxed at a flat 6 percent rate on adjusted gross income over $25,000 for a family or $12,500 for an individual.
The Republican alternative would put a cap on the dividends and interest tax, probably resulting in a tax cut for those families in top income categories, but specifics are still not available.
The Governor's press secretary, Avice A. Meehan, said Mr. Weicker would not have any reaction to the alternative until some complete proposal was presented.
"This is just selected bits and pieces," she said.

HEADLINE: New York Tests Electronic Ball and Chain

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
New York City jail guards strapped electronic transmitters on the left ankles of two inmates and then opened the gates for them. As the men strolled from the Brooklyn House of Detention last month they became the first to be released under a city program in which defendants awaiting trial are placed under house arrest and monitored by electronic surveillance.
"They will be under severe confinement," said Michael DeCicco, an assistant deputy warden in the city's Correction Department, who supervises the electronic-surveillance program. "The key difference is that someone else, not the city, is paying their rent." Such routine behavior as taking a walk, visiting a neighbor, going to a restaurant or to a movie, is forbidden. 
 The program begins more than three years after the State Legislature first approved the use of alternatives to incarceration for city inmates. Under state law, inmates charged with nonviolent crimes can be released from jail and placed under house arrest and supervised by the Correction Department.
At least 40 states, including New Jersey, use electronic monitoring in one way or another.
City officials said the recent introduction of electronic monitoring makes it economically feasible to introduce a large-scale alternative program. Allyn R. Sielaff, the city's Correction Commissioner, said in an interview that successful electronic surveillance might persuade the State Legislature to give him wider authority to free pre-trial inmates charged with nonviolent crimes. Current regulations, he said, limit the program to 100 inmates, but the city hopes the Legislature will allow an increase to 1,000.
Freeing 1,000 prisoners, city officials say, would give immediate relief to overcrowded city jails, save the city $35 million a year in prison maintenance costs and alleviate the long-term need for new jail construction. Mr. DeCicco said it costs the city $158 a day to house an inmate. The cost of monitoring an inmate electronically is $60 a day. About 15,000 pretrial detainees are now in city jails.
The executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, Robert Gangi, questioned whether the Correction Department is the one to manage a large alternative program.
"These programs are tough to run and politically risky," Mr. Gangi said. "One mistake -- one violent crime committed by someone who has been released -- and the entire concept goes up in flames."
Spokesmen for legislative leaders agreed in part, saying that Mr. Sielaff's requests faced an uncertain fate this year.
"It's a very sensitive issue," said John E. McArdle, press secretary for Senator Ralph J. Marino of Oyster Bay, L.I., a Republican and majority leader of the Senate. "When cost is the consideration versus the safety of the public we get very concerned."
Fred Jacobs, the counsel to the Codes Committee in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, added, "We want to be convinced by the city administrators that they are using all the tools at their disposal before we embark on any changes."
 
Strict Limits on Behavior
 Under the city program, inmates will be screened to determine that they have nonviolent backgrounds and that they are viewed as good risks to show up in court for hearings and trials.
In each case, the inmate will be required to wear a square, black, three-ounce plastic ankle transmitter at all times. An electronic receiver will be installed in his home to pick up the transmitter's coded signal. If an inmate strays from home without permission, the signal ceases and an alarm is transmitted by a computer to the Correction Department, subjecting the inmate to instant rearrest.
At work and at home, inmates are subject to unannounced visits by correction officers. Except for traveling to and from work or to school or rehabilitation-counseling sessions, the inmates are confined to their homes until their criminal cases are resolved. To leave for personal or medical emergencies, they must get clearance by telephoning a Correction Department officer.
Present state law bars defendants who are arrested for violent offenses or who are charged with the highest crime categoriesfrom release under any alternative program.
In the opening phase of the city program, up to 30 more pretrial inmates will receive electronic anklets, Mr. DiCicco said. Electronic monitoring as an alternative to incarceration has been used in the country since 1986, mainly with convicted nonviolent offenders on parole or probation. A study last year by the United States Justice Department found that in 1989, about 6,500 convicted inmates were out of prison under electronic sanctions.
The first two city inmates under electronic supervision had never been in jail before their arrests in February. Both agreed to be interviewed on the condition that they would be identified only by their given names.
Felix, who is 28 years old and a parking lot attendant, was accused of driving while intoxicated in Brooklyn.
"It was important for me to get out because I can get into an alcoholic counseling program, and I don't want my family to go on welfare," said Felix, who was in jail for three weeks, unable to raise $750 bail. He lives with his wife and 9-year-old daugther in the East New York section of Brooklyn. John, 25, a construction worker from the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn was detained seven weeks on bail of $2,500 after being arrested on charges of unauthorized use of a car and possession of stolen property -- the car he was driving.
As conditions of their release and until they return to their regular jobs, both men agreed to work as cleaners and painters in the House of Detention in downtown Brooklyn. Like incarcerated inmates who are assigned to work details, each is paid $14 for a 35-hour week.
The men said they quickly adapted to walking, sleeping and bathing with the waterproof transmitters.
"This strap is keeping me out of trouble," said Felix in an interview at the Brooklyn jail.

HEADLINE: Budget Woe Gets Worse For Dinkins

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration, already struggling to balance New York City's budget, got more bad news yesterday: further erosion in tax collections and renewed refusals by municipal union leaders to cooperate by making money-saving concessions.
New figures indicate that the city will collect $90 million less in personal income taxes this fiscal year than it expected. 
 That word came as union leaders scoffed at the idea of discussing concessions at a meeting scheduled for today, just weeks after both sides had seemed to agree to cooperate.
The latest tax shortfall brings to nearly $1 billion the amount that the administration has been faced with trimming from the current budget since last summer. On top of that, there is a total projected gap of more than $3 billion in the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
 
Little Time to Recoup
 The personal income tax is sensitive to ups and downs in the city's economy and has varied widely from expectations in the past. But city officials said they were taken aback by the $90 million falloff in March receipts, since it came with only three months left in the fiscal year.
Budget Director Philip R. Michael speculated that lower corporate bonuses might have helped cut tax receipts, and he said the city was not sure whether the decline would continue.
He said he was reviewing what further service cuts or other actions the city would have to take to make up the difference. At the very least, he said, purchasing of supplies would slow.
The city has a reserve fund of $150 million in the budget, but that is already committed to covering previous tax shortfalls and reductions in state aid and other needs, budget officials said. "We're very concerned," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel.
Meantime, just three weeks after the city and the unions agreed in a meeting with Mayor David N. Dinkins to talk quietly about how labor could help the city control its fiscal problems in the coming months, union leaders made clear that nothing had happened on the eve of a meeting to be held with city officials today.
 
Union Leaders Balk
 Sandra Feldman, head of the teachers' union, said she would not attend the session, to be led by Mr. Steisel. "It's a discussion about concessions," she said. "We're not going to do any concessions. We've done a very substantial wage deferral, and we're not going to do more than that."
Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the largest city workers union, also said he would not discuss givebacks.
Aides to Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said he, too, planned to tell the city that he would not make concessions.
Just after Mr. Dinkins and the unions began their latest round of discussions, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said that unless the city unions agreed to concessions, he would not even considering helping the city with hundreds of millions of dollars in possible relief from bond refinancings or other fiscal maneuevers. But Mr. Feinstein and others have said they will not agree to concessions until the Governor puts whatever state-controlled money he has on the table.
Last month Mr. Dinkins said that among the "contributions" from labor that he would seek, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, could be changes in health benefits, reductions in the number of paid holidays and changes in workmen's compensation benefits and work rules.
But union leaders said the city had not yet given them a convincing rationale for cooperating and had not shown them just what additional city programs and services would have to be cut if they did not cooperate. "There's not a feeling of any order in the situation," one union head said.

HEADLINE: Program Selling Pushes Dow Down 45.54

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Heavy waves of program selling toppled the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday, carrying the broader market down sharply as well.
Trading rose to 169.9 million shares, from 138.6 million the day before, but traders said activity was so slow at times yesterday that computer-driven selling exaggerated price movements considerably.
 
Down by 1.6 Percent
 The Dow, which advanced nearly 22 points the day before on program buying, sank 45.54 yesterday, or 1.6 percent, to 2,873.02. 
 The S.&P. 500 slid almost as much, but the smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite and the American Stock Exchange's market value index, edged down only slightly.
Declines led advances almost 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, but while 5 stocks reached 52-week lows, 90 climbed to 52-week highs.
Time Warner again hit a high of 119 before closing at 114 3/4, down 3 3/4. It rose 4 1/2 last week and 6 1/4 on Monday amid talk that it was exploring a number of ways to raise at least $500 million and possibly considerably more, including through a joint venture, to pay off part of its huge debt. One person close to senior company officials said, "None of the possibilities has any substance."
Traders attributed the selloff to Federal Reserve dealings intended to drain money from the banking system and thus raise the Fed funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight money.
Investors had speculated earlier that the Fed had actually eased rates but soon concluded that the Fed's movements telegraphed that it was tightening rates for the moment to bring them up to its 6 percent target.
Traders said that while the plan to tighten the funds rate was not entirely successful, it signaled the Fed's present intention not to ease policy for the moment. But they argued that the Fed could still ease if inflation figures due tomorrow and Friday show, as expected, that price pressure is not strong.
Explaining how low volume affects program trading, Laszlo Birinyi Jr., president of Birinyi Associates, said, "When you have a little bit of selling in a period when activity is not that great, the impact of the selling is accentuated."
He noted that the Dow lost almost 25 points from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M., when volume amounted to only 21 million shares an hour.
Seven waves of computerized selling, he said, chopped the Dow a total of 38 points. From 1:50 P.M. on, wave after wave of selling accounted for most of it.
 
Identity Widely Known
 The identity of the traders is widely known but precisely which ones were active at any given time is difficult to determine. The New York Stock Exchange has repeatedly identified the main ones as Paine Webber, Bear Stearns, Goldman, Sachs, Susquehanna and Morgan Stanley.
David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist and strategist for Jesup, Josephthal & Company, estimated yesterday that two-thirds of the Dow's drop yesterday could be attributed to sell programs and the rest to apprehension over the inflation figures to be released this week.
"There's some apprehension the numbers may be higher than the Fed wants to see," he said, with the implication that the Fed might not ease rates if the numbers are not to its liking.
He said traders were also uneasy about what he called internal politics at the Fed, where some Federal Reserve presidents are said to have disputed the right of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, to act on his own to change the Fed funds rate.
"The market is unduly concerned," he said of the inflation figures. He said he thought the numbers "won't be upsetting" and that the Fed would lower both the Fed funds rate and the discount rate, at which it lends to banks, "before too many weeks pass." Just to play safe, he added that action could even happen much sooner.
The decline among the Dow stocks was widespread, with losses of more than a point in I.B.M., Merck, Sears, Roebuck, Eastman Kodak, McDonald's, Boeing and United Technologies.
Along with I.B.M., other technology stocks gave way. Intel fell 1 7/8, to 46 5/8; Apple Computer 1 1/4, to 68 3/4; Hewlett-Packard 1 3/8, to 50; Borland 2 1/8, to 58 3/8, and Microsoft 1 1/8, to 110 1/4.
Safeway, which offered 17.5 million shares of the supermarket chain yesterday at $20.50 a share, fell 1 1/8, to 20 1/4, with four million shares changing hands.
Gold shares rose slightly after gold prices climbed $3.10 an ounce, to $364.90.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Stocks in Tokyo Dip
 TOKYO, Wednesday, April 10 (Reuters) -- Stocks in Tokyo closed slightly lower at the end of the trading session today. The 225-share Nikkei average was down 48.53 points or 0.18 percent to 26,268.86.

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Bailout Urged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Rhode Island's Governor and Senators today pleaded for a Federal bailout of the state's private deposit insurance system, saying the state had been plunged into a financial crisis even worse than it suffered during the Great Depression.
Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, shut down 35 credit unions and 10 banks on New Year's Day after the private Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation collapsed. 
 Thirty institutions have since reopened with Federal insurance, but 15 others remain closed and their depositors' accounts frozen.
"People have lost money set aside for weddings, had burial accounts frozen, lost homes and businesses," the Governor told the Senate Banking Committee. More than half the state's one million people have been affected, he said.
Mr. Sundlun is backing legislation, sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican. It would make a $500 million pool of Federal money available for low-interest loans to states in which private deposit insurance systems collapse. No more than $150 million could be lent to a state.

HEADLINE: 'Wish List' Site for Sale But Cuomo Still Wishes

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 9

 BODY:
A Georgia developer has put up for sale a large expanse of Adirondack land that New York State wants to preserve as wilderness but says it cannot afford.
The offering raised new alarms about the fate of Adirondack Park, a combination of public and private lands that includes some of the largest wilderness tracts in the eastern United States. 
 The forest parcels, amounting to 87,000 acres, are the second major block of ecologically valuable land to be offered for development since last fall's defeat of a bond proposal that would have raised nearly $1 billion for land protection. The second block of land is Sterling Forest in Orange County, the largest woodland left in the New York metropolitan region, where a company announced plans last month to build a suburban development for 35,000 people.
 
Increasing Sales Feared
 Some lawmakers and environmental groups say Adirondack Park has been left vulnerable to development by the defeat of the bond proposal and the languishing of a package of zoning restrictions and other protective measures recommended last year by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's commission on the Adirondacks.
The Governor has not proposed turning any of his panel's ideas into law, suggesting instead that the economic downturn has slowed development pressure and taken the urgency out of the issue.
Environmentalists contend that unless new restrictions are adopted, the park could be overwhelmed by new development as the market picks up again. They said the offering being made now could be an early indication of such activity.
"This bursts the bubble of the people who are saying, 'Don't worry, with the economy down, what could happen?' " said Bernard Melewski, the acting executive director of the Adirondack Council, a private environmental group. "There are thousands of acres coming up for sale at bargain-basement prices, and the state is without any funds for the first time in 30 years to protect the park."
 
Homesites Planned
 The Adirondack parcels, offered by Lassiter Properties Inc. in Atlanta, are spread through the northern and western Adirondacks. Although they represent a small fraction of the six million acres of land in the park, they are one of the largest combinations of privately owned land in the area to go on the market in recent years.
Some tracts in the property are likely to remain as timber land, and others have partial protection against development, known as conservation easements, that the state purchased three years ago in the midst of criticism over the development company's original acquisition of the land.
But Lassiter, in a prospectus circulated recently, said many tracts were suitable for "acreage homesites" and that it planned to market them for this purpose.
The potential sale may also put new pressure on the Governor and the Legislature to include some funds for land in the new state budget.
 
Public Efforts Invited
 Mr. Cuomo, despite his aggressive lobbying for open-space protection in his unsuccessful campaign to get the bond proposal approved last November, has strongly resisted adding money for land to the budget. He cites the state's fiscal problems and what he says is the need to develop greater public support for such programs.
Although the state had drawn up long lists of land projects it hoped to pay for through the bond proposal, Mr. Cuomo has decided to wait for a new set of regional committees to advise him on future acquisition sites. That will take at least a year, and some environmental groups have criticized the delay.
Mr. Cuomo said he eventually hoped to buy land with money from an environmental trust fund he has proposed, but he has ruled out spending any money on land this year.
The State Environmental Conservation Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, said in an interview today that while the state knew there was a risk that the Lassiter company would sell land, none of the parcels had been considered a top priority.
"Are we worried?" the Commissioner said. "Yes, we're worried, but not any more than we're worried about a lot of other parcels that might be marketed during this period when the public has no resources to buy land."

Asset Sale By Revlon Called Near

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Revlon Inc., the cosmetics giant headed by Ronald O. Perelman, is expected to announce as early as today that it plans to sell its Max Factor division and a German subsidiary to Procter & Gamble for about $1 billion.
People familiar with the details and progress of the negotiations said yesterday that the Procter & Gamble Company and Revlon were scheduled to sign a letter of intent today and that the deal would close soon. 
 Max Factor, whose products include the Almay line of hypoallergenic cosmetics as well as the Max Factor brand of makeup, had annual sales in 1990 of $621 million, analysts estimate. The German subsidiary being sold, Betrix, is a beauty-aids company whose 1990 sales are estimated by analysts at $216 million. The operations together represent about 30 percent of Revlon's total annual sales.
A sale price of $1 billion would indicate that Procter & Gamble would pay $1.20 for every $1 of Revlon's sales, the lower end of the price range that the company was seeking.
 
Would Have 30% of Market
 Procter & Gamble has the leading brand of mass-market cosmetics, Cover Girl, which has about 23 percent of the market. Adding Max Factor and Almay would give it a 30 percent share. Some analysts had been concerned that if Procter & Gamble bought all of Revlon's mass-market brands, giving it 44 percent of the market, the company could face antitrust action.
Revlon, based in New York, has been trying to sell all or most of its assets since the beginning of the year. It has said that Mr. Perelman's strategy has been to acquire companies, improve their performance and then sell them.
The company has denied that big interest payments from its high-yield "junk bonds" have forced it to look for buyers for the assets. But analysts say Revlon has $816 million in debt due in 1992, mostly to banks, and $475 million in bond debt due in 1995.
Mr. Perelman took over Revlon in the mid-1980's and took it private in 1987 with junk bonds.
Revlon, analysts say, cannot meet those payments with cash flow from a cosmetics business hurt by recession and overbuilding by large retailers like department stores and discounters.
Details of the planned sale are sketchy, but the transaction would leave intact the Revlon brand's domestic and international cosmetics business, while paying down much of the $1.5 billion bank debt that has imposed operating constraints on Mr. Perelman and the company.
Mr. Perelman was traveling yesterday and could not be reached for comment.
At its headquarters in Cincinnati, a Procter & Gamble spokesman declined to comment on the deal.
On Feb. 28, word leaked out that Revlon had been trying to sell part or all of its assets, with Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal the most interested of several potential buyers.
What remained unclear yesterday was whether Revlon was still trying to sell the rest of its assets to L'Oreal, which had 1989 annual revenues of $5.4 billion, or to another as-yet-undisclosed company.
If all of the Max Factor/Almay division and Betrix are sold to Procter & Gamble, then Revlon, with about $1.86 billion in annual sales, would be substantially smaller than its two primary rivals in the United States, L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. Each has about $2.3 billion in makeup and fragrance sales, analysts said.
The Revlon brand continues to have substantial international sales, which Horvitz & Associates, an industry consultant, estimates at $540 million.
While it has a number of publicly owned bond issues outstanding, Revlon has no common stock outstanding, limiting the amount of financial information it has to disclose. A Revlon spokesman declined to confirm the analysts' estimates.
Procter & Gamble had 1990 revenues of $24 billion from detergent and other household products. It presumably benefits from the purchase of part of Revlon by strengthening its already leading share in mass-market cosmetics, which are sold in drug stores and discounters like K Mart under the Cover Girl name.
By apparently sticking to mass-market cosmetics, like less expensive lipsticks and makeup, Procter & Gamble also avoids the hazards of entering the entirely new and more expensive market of department store cosmetics. Marketing techniques for such upscale brands as Chanel, Lancome and Estee Lauder involve more elaborate in-store displays, splashy magazine advertisements and television ads that emphasize chic style rather than low price.
Procter & Gamble has scant experience in these areas and would also encounter global giants like Unilever, which has been growing rapidly through acquisition.

HEADLINE: Official Reported to Face Ouster After His Dissent on Iraq Exports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
The White House has ordered the dismissal of an Under Secretary of Commerce for telling Congress on Monday that the Administration ignored warnings to limit the export of American technology to Iraq before the invasion of Kuwait, Administration officials said today.
One official said that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher was told by the office of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, that Dennis E. Kloske, Under Secretary for Export Administration and among the top half-dozen officials in the Commerce Department, should be removed from the payroll by June 1. 
 The White House and the Commerce Department denied that Mr. Kloske's resignation had been requested. They added, however, that he has been planning to leave for some time, but has not submitted a letter of resignation.
Mr. Kloske, reached today in Brussels, where he addressed a conference, said: "I have no comment. Everything I have to say about the subject was said yesterday."
Mr. Kloske told a House subcommittee on Monday that the Administration, and the State Department in particular, had disregarded his recommendations last spring to reduce the flow of advanced American technology to Iraq because the Administration wanted to encourage better relations with Baghdad.
The reported disciplinary action against him reflects the extreme sensitivity of the Administration to criticism that it mishandled relations with Iraq and continued to provide advanced equipment to Baghdad until just a few weeks before President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Democrats have charged that the Administration sought to appease Iraq until shortly before Kuwait was invaded and that the United States sent contradictory diplomatic as well as trade and economic signals to Mr. Hussein before the invasion.
Speaking on Monday to the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, Mr. Kloske said that because of his rising concern about developments in Iraq, he tried to outflank the Administration policy by delaying sales, which required review by the Commerce Department unit that he heads.
"I decided to employ the only option available to a bureaucrat," he told the lawmakers. "I tried to tie up all sales in red tape."
Mr. Kloske came to the Commerce Department with the Bush Administration after serving at the Pentagon and the United States mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
In his Congressional testimony, which was televised by C-Span, he presented a picture of interagency rivalry and dissension.
 
'Dual Use' Products
 The subcommittee hearing was called after recent disclosures that $1.5 billion worth of sensitive "dual use" products -- computers, chemicals and telecommunications equipment that have both military and civilian applications -- were approved for export to Iraq between 1985 and 1990.
Mr. Kloske provided no fresh details on exports of any specific technologies, but said he made his "views clear at the very highest levels" about the technology sales in general.
Both White House and Commerce Department public affairs officers denied that Mr. Kloske's resignation was being sought. They issued similar statements, which suggested that there had been some attempt to coordinate their comments. Both said that Mr. Kloske had been planning to leave for some time.
"The White House has not asked for Mr. Kloske's resignation, and Mr. Sununu made no phone call to Mr. Mosbacher about this," said Stephen T. Hart, a White House spokesman.
Another Administration official said there was a White House staff meeting this morning attended by Mr. Sununu at which Monday's testimony by Mr. Kloske was mentioned.
 
A Crucial Response
 Mr. Kloske especially angered the State Department, several officials said, when he set his position apart from the department's in response to a question from Representative Sam Gejdenson, Democrat of Connecticut and the subcommittee chairman.
As one official said: "In Congressional testimony, the first lesson is that you never differentiate yourself from other parts of the Administration. It's not your place to give juicy details about how decisions are made."
All of the Administration officials spoke on the condition that they not be identified.
Mr. Kloske disclosed that as early as April 1990 he had asked for an embargo of selected technology exports to Iraq and that "the State Department adamantly opposed my position, choosing instead to advocate the maintenance of diplomatic relations with Iraq."
He added that a consensus was then formed by an interagency group "in favor of continued diplomatic relations-negotiations with Iraq."
The thrust of his testimony was that, because the Reagan Administration had dropped Iraq from the list of terrorist-supporting countries in 1982 and resumed diplomatic relations in 1984, there was little he could do legally to stop advanced technology sales, especially with pressures from the business community to open new export markets.
 
The Soviet Angle
 He said he could limit exports only if he could show they would be rerouted to the Soviet Union.
To people who monitor the export-control situation, the episode demonstrates the serious disarray in Administration policies, as decision-makers are being pulled in one direction by security considerations and in another by the need to improve the nation's trade accounts.
"Unless we have a major overhaul of our policies, the Saddams of the future will continue to benefit from this disarray," Jennifer J. White, a senior associate at the Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based policy research group specializing in security matters, said in an interview today.
The export-control issues have become highly emotional, further accounting for the Administration's sensitivitiy.
In the hearing yesterday, for example, Mr. Gejdenson said that after Mr. Hussein used poison gas to kill 5,000 Kurds in Iraq in 1988, the Administration still refused to impose economic sanctions and fought hard against legislation that would have done so.
"Even in April 1990," Mr. Gejdenson continued, "after Hussein threatened to burn up half of Israel with binary chemical weapons, the State Department would not restrict the export of advanced dual-use technology to Saddam Hussein, nor would it put Iraq on the list of terrorist countries."
 
Administration's Stance
 The Administration's position is that it did all that was possible in the circumstances to deal with the issue.
The 36-year-old Mr. Kloske, a graduate of Harvard and a Rhodes scholar, has received generally high marks from the business community for his efforts to help restructure and simplify the export-control program.
Paul Freedenberg, who held the position during the Reagan Administration, said Mr. Kloske's probable departure comes at an "unfortunate" moment because export-control policies are at a critical stage of development and "need strong leadership."
The United States has been trying to reach agreement with its European allies and Japan on a streamlined core list of advanced technologies that would be banned from the Soviet Union. It is also seeking an international accord to prevent militarily useful goods from falling in the hands of terrorist countries.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Europeans Back Off Plan to Help Kurds

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 8

 BODY:
Western nations backed away today from a proposal to set up an enclave in northern Iraq administered by the United Nations where Kurdish refugees could be protected against further aggression by the forces of President Saddam Hussein.
The retreat came after Baghdad heatedly rejected the plan, calling it a "conspiracy" to intrude on Iraqi sovereignty, and the United States gave the concept a lukewarm endorsement. Officials in Washington today expressed disappointment with Baghdad's response but said the United States did not want to press the matter because it involved further encroachment on Iraqi territory. 
 The 12 European Community countries, which endorsed the concept of a safe haven at a summit meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, now say they believe that the best way to discourage President Saddam Hussein from further repression against the Kurds is to persuade Iraq to let more United Nations relief workers establish themselves in Kurdish areas of Iraq.
Prime Minister John Major of Britain proposed the initial enclave plan at the meeting on Monday. The community quickly endorsed the idea, saying it was up to the Security Council to work out the details and leaving open the possibility that force might be needed if Iraq rejected the concept.
 
Resolution to Allow Zones
 Officials also spoke of seeking a mandatory Security Council resolution giving them the right in international law to establish such zones inside Iraqi territory.
But faced with outright Iraqi rejection, as well as clear reservations by the Soviet Union and China and the cool response from Washington, European diplomats say they have scaled back their approach to one that appears more realistic. They now say the best solution lies in encouraging Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to persuade Iraq to allow a semi-permanent United Nations humanitarian presence in the Kurdish areas.
In theory, the relief workers would be there to tend to the needs of the two million Kurds who are believed to be on the move in northern Iraq, fleeing into Turkey and Iran to escape the Iraqi military.
But the Europeans say their very presence in the region would deter the Iraqi authorities from further aggression, in effect establishing zones in which Kurds would feel more secure.
 
Easing Flood of Refugees
 This would encourage more Kurds to move to the secure areas and ease the flood of refugees trying to cross into Turkey and Iran.
"We are seeking to establish zones in northern Iraq where the Kurds would feel safer," Britain's representative, Sir David Hannay, said as the Security Council met to discuss the plan. He stressed that the zones would be "a purely humanitarian concept," not "a juridical or political concept."
A key element in the European approach is the mission that the Secretary General is sending to Iraq later this week on Security Council instructions to report on the plight of the Kurds. It will be led by Ambassador Eric Suy, a Belgian diplomat and former United Nations legal adviser.
Iraq has welcomed Ambassador Suy's visit and promised to cooperate with him and the his team of relief experts. The Europeans hope he will be able to start setting up what would effectively be a dual-purpose United Nations presence in the Kurdish region, helping the refugees as well as discouraging further repression.
 
Creating Conditions to Help
 "By getting the team in there and beginning to organize access for humitarian aid, we will begin to create the conditions for stabalizing and calming the situation," Sir David said, adding that in time the United Nations might be able to encourage the refugees to return to the towns and villages.
But Iraq's United Nations reprsentative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, described the mission as a fact-finding one and said it would be relatively brief. In a letter to the United Nations, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Ahmed Hussein, said the best way to help the Kurds would be to lift United Nations economic sanctions.
However the United States and Britain have made clear they will oppose lifting trade restrictions on non-essential civilian imports when these come up for review in June, if the turmoil and upheaval continues in Kurd areas.
The Security Council also took another step toward formally winding up the Persian Gulf war today when it voted unanimously to send a military observer force of 1,440 to patrol a demilitarized zone along the Iraq-Kuwait frontier.
 
Deployed in Two Weeks
 The force, which is expected to be deployed within two weeks, will allow the coalition allies to complete their military withdrawal from southern Iraq. They will leave behind some 27,000 mainly Shiite Muslim refugees who fled across the allied lines after the their revolt against President Hussein was crushed.
Responsibility for these refugees will then be given to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Today the High Commissioner, Sadako Ogata, wrote to the Secretary General saying she wants assurances from Iraq and Kuwait that they will treat the refugees as protected persons.
There have been concerns that Iraq, which is responsibile for law and order in its portion of the demilitarized zone, might seek to punish the refugees.
The Security Council has yet to approve its formal reply to Iraq's declaration that it accepts the Security Council's peace terms without conditions. That approval is expected on Wednesday. The United States and Britain first wanted to see the text of the resolution that the Iraqi Parliament adopted accepting the Council's terms to make sure that it does not include any caveats.

HEADLINE: Union Head Cites Difficulty In Vote by Two Film Locals

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Although a tentative agreement was recently reached between two film unions and Hollywood producers that would end the stalemate that had shut down film making in New York City, it is "impossible to predict" whether the membership of one union will accept the agreement, said its president.
"It's a tough call; it could be very close," said the union head, Walter Stocklin, president of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators.
 
Overwhelming Rejection
 The union's 2,000 members have been returning mail ballots on the March 19 pact, which offered the film producers money-saving changes in overtime and weekend pay in return for greater health and pension benefits. 
 Mr. Stocklin said that he and Raymond Fortune, the union's vice president, had submitted the tentative agreement to the union's negotiating committee and the executive board, and that both had rejected the settlement "overwhelmingly."
As a result, the mailing of ballots on the proposal included a letter recommending that the tentative settlement be rejected, he said. "Now it's up to the rank and file to decide," he added. The ballots are to be counted on Monday.
The 19-week stalemate has halted movie making in New York City, a vital part of the city's economy. Mayor David N. Dinkins had pressed for a settlement along with the city's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. Members of the other union, Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries, are also voting by mail, and their ballots will be counted this month or early in May.

Record Opening-Day Salaries: Not Peanuts or Cracker Jack

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
If the fact that 223 players are making $1 million or more this year -- 32 at $3 million or more -- is not enough of an economically mind-boggling barometer of the escalation of baseball salaries, consider these developments:
 Nine teams have an average salary of more than $1 million, dividing total payroll by the number of players. The average opening-day major league salary for all players, total 708, is $890,844, and an astonishing 53 percent more than last year's opening-day average, which was in the $580,000 range. 
 In previous years, no individual team average salary ever reached this year's major league average salary. The record for a team average was set by the Mets in 1989 at $865,741.
Rosters and disabled lists -- and thus the numbers -- will change somewhat by Aug. 31, when the official salary studies are conducted by the Player Relations Committee and the Players Association. But the season-opening figures, compiled by The New York Times from contract data obtained from management and player sources, show just how meteorically salaries have risen this year.
 On opening day last year only one player, Robin Yount of Milwaukee, was at the $3 million plateau. This year Darryl Strawberry of Los Angeles, at $3.8 million, heads a hefty group of 32 floating in that economic stratosphere. Last year 153 players were at $1 million or more, this year 223.
 The Oakland Athletics, with a record $36.4 million payroll and 14 of their 27 players receiving $1 million or more, have the highest team average, $1,349,352. The Houston Astros, who lost most of their high-priced players as free agents during the winter, are at the other end of the salary standings with an average of $487,090.
 The five members of the Athletics who are signed for $3 million or more -- total $16.7 million -- make more than the entire payrolls of Houston, Baltimore or Seattle. Add Mark McGwire, and the $19.55 million total is higher than the payroll of those three teams plus Cleveland and the Chicago White Sox. Then throw in Dave Henderson, and the $22.15 million total is higher than the payrolls of those five clubs plus Texas, Montreal, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta and San Diego, or 11 of the other 25 clubs.
 After the Athletics, the Mets have 13 players at $1 million or more, Boston, California and San Francisco 12 each and the Yankees, Kansas City and Los Angeles 11 each. Baltimore and Seattle have the fewest, three each.
 Only 43 players are receiving the minimum salary of $100,000. That total is down drastically from the 1990 opening-day total of 90, although those rosters each included 28 players because of the abbreviated spring training that followed the lockout.
The average team salaries on this page are based on the opening-day rosters and disabled list. All team and individual salaries include base salary and prorated share of signing bonuses.

HEADLINE: Rochester: An Uneasy Symbol of School Reform

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROCHESTER, April 4

 BODY:
This is a story of perestroika, of bureaucrats fighting to keep power, citizens confused, civil servants clinging to the old ways and unions battling management amid economic chaos.
The struggle is set not in the Soviet Union but here in Rochester, an industrial city of 240,000 people in western New York that has become a national symbol of education reform. Rochester became famous overnight after it agreed in 1987 to pay its teachers among the highest salaries in the nation. The quest was one that had eluded education reformers -- overhauling not just a school, but an entire system. 
 As in the Soviet Union, these are dark days for what Rochester, too, calls "restructuring." The city's public school teachers, who have been working without a contract since June 30, refuse to take part in the new programs established with so much fanfare three years ago. Parents say they see no dramatic improvements. And New York State's fiscal crisis threatens severe budget cuts, endangering the steps taken to date.
 
The Importance of Politics
 Still, no one in Rochester seems ready to give up on the ambitious reorganization. Several schools have adopted innovative programs, executives on loan from Xerox and Eastman Kodak have helped revamp the district's hiring, personnel and planning procedures, and the city has begun to attack once taboo issues like weeding out incompetent teachers.
Chastened reformers say they are trying to put into effect the lesson they have already learned: that the politics of reform -- explaining it, selling it and involving the community in it -- are just as important as its content.
"The public is disgusted," said Peter McWalters, Rochester's Superintendent of Schools. "So is the business leadership. Everyone out there is angry. They feel left out, alienated and unconnected. They don't know whether I'm succeeding or failing."
Rochester is battling problems shared by urban districts nationwide: most of its 33,000 students are poor, nearly half are from single-parent households and most black and Hispanic students fare far worse than their white classmates. But the city's effort stands out in its scope.
Teachers received a 40 percent pay increase over three years, raising the average salary after 11 years of service to $45,000 and establishing a veteran teacher slot that could pay as much as $70,000. Teachers, principals and parents were to participate in running schools as part of "school-based management," unhindered by central office bureaucracy. Each middle and high school teacher agreed to counsel 20 students and get to know their families.
 
Partnerships Under Strain
 But in the last few months impending budget cuts and a bruising battle over a new teachers contract have overshadowed reform efforts and strained the unusual partnerships forged among the superintendent, the teachers union, business executives and parents.
"I do feel teachers have been getting bashed," said Marge Kitz, a speech specialist for 25 years. "If teachers get a positive response from the community, you work even more. But now you say, 'Why am I doing this -- nobody's appreciating it.' "
Ms. Kitz was one of the slim majority who rejected the first contract last September. Like many teachers, she was worried about provisions linking pay to performance.
That unexpected vote outraged many parents who believe well-paid teachers should be held accountable. And many minority parents questioned the mostly white teaching force's commitment
Teachers overwhelmingly approved a second contract, which would have given them a 24 percent raise over three years and included some provisions for assessment, but the school board voted that down in January.
Then the teachers erupted, asking a school board member to leave a school where he was a volunteer teacher, telling a critic they would refuse to allow students to attend one of his school speeches and, in many cases, pulling out of the school-based planning teams.
Many community leaders and parents now say they feel betrayed. "These people are public servants," said William A. Johnson, president of the Urban League, whose 1986 report urging Rochester to save its education system was a catalyst for change. "We wanted, we were willing, to pay for radical reform. Now people are saying we put up the money and we don't see the results."
Even the infusion of new teachers, lured to Rochester by the publicized pay increases, was slowed because the high salaries convinced older teachers to defer retirement.
Bill Sanders, a veteran English and reading teacher, agrees that parents came to expect more than could be delivered. "We allowed the public to believe that if they gave us more money we could somehow do things differently," Mr. Sanders said, adding that in reality, "paying me $100 a day more wouldn't make a difference, but valuing reading more than cable TV would."
Contract talks are now before a fact-finding committee, which is expected to recommend a new contract within a few weeks. The school board and the union must then vote on it.
 
Pace Seen as Too Fast
 Adam Urbanski, head of the teachers union, says he sees the union's vote as a clear sign that the pace of change was too fast.
"I can't help but believe if they were very comfortable with the reforms we signed on to, they would have accepted more reform," said Mr. Urbanski, who was widely praised as a visionary after the first contract was signed. "They obviously wanted more time."
Teacher ferment seems remote in the orderly halls of East High School, where the principal, carrying a walkie-talkie, pounces on stray students demanding passes. But at East High this year most teachers balked at the contract's requirement that they counsel students. In turn, parents refused to sign the planning document required under the new school-based management system.
"I do not have high hopes for reform, and the reason for that is that downtown always has the final say," said Dave Swanson, referring to the school bureaucracy. Mr. Swanson, a mathematics teacher for 30 years, added: "They have a very idealized view of what should happen. You go to talk to a kid and he says, 'Get out of my face!' "
Even Mr. Sanders, who is widely respected for his commitment to his students, said he does not feel connected to the larger reform effort. "I think I have some great successes, but that has very little to do with the central office," he said.
 
Many Teaching Innovations
 The successes evident in Rochester are hard to quantify or communicate. Groups of teachers are setting up two new schools, one that would extend the school day to involve more parents and another that would employ new, widely praised methods of teaching students how to read and write. Seventh and eighth grades have been moved out of high school into new middle schools with the sixth grade to conform with studies showing that these are crucial early adolescent years. The advisory system is working well in middle schools.
Teachers have proposed many innovations, and have put some of them into effect. Teachers at Elementary School No. 9 used the Genesee River, which empties into Lake Ontario near Rochester, as the basis of their entire curriculum.
A group of children classified as having learning problems sat on the school lawn recently, using yardsticks, string and calculators to compare the length of the Genesee (158 miles) to the Nile, the longest river in the world (more than 4,150 miles). The program has sent test scores and sudent motivation soaring.
Many businesses have given generously to the schools. Terry Crowley, a Kodak financial analyst, works twice a week with fourth graders, posing real-life math problems. The other day he brought in a Kodak catalogue and ordering forms, and asked the students to figure out how many items they could order without exceeding the budget he had set. The children set to work with calculators, and peppered him with questions.
 
Power to the Teachers
 Much of the hardest work involves coaxing teachers to take more power and central office bureaucrats to relinquish it. That effort has yielded mixed results. Mr. McWalters says several schools' planning teams have bogged down over such questions as whether to put air-conditioning in halls, while others have galloped ahead, experimenting with setting their own budgets.
Such changes are slow, and are not always reflected by test scores. "It's like watching Roger Smith try to change General Motors," said Skip Hansford, president of Hansford Manufacturing, who has also worked with school reformers.
Mr. Urbanski and Mr. McWalters say they believe they failed to explain the reforms better. "We should have had a strategic plan that constantly informed or engaged the other major constituents in this process," Mr. McWalters said. "Unless you work to engage the community constantly, you just lose them."
 
A Question of Accountability
 Mr. Urbanski and Mr. McWalters say that one of the most persistent sticking points remains how to insure that teachers who earn high salaries deserve them: should assessments be based on how well students do or how hard teachers try? Even conscientious teachers like Mr. Sanders at East High are wary.
"I had one girl in the ninth grade," he said. "I called home the first day she wasn't here. Her parents said, 'Why are you calling? She's not enrolled in school.' I called 10 times. But she will show up as my dropout, on my record. I don't mind being held accountable for certain things, but there are things beyond my control."
But accountability is what Rochester taxpayers want and what many educators believe they can get.
Marvin Jackson, who serves on two parent groups here, said it was possible to take into account both student performance and teacher effort. "So what if you don't reach nirvana?" he said. "You have a systematic way of monitoring performance of teachers as they go to a specific goal."
But he added: "We're talking with people who are not used to any accountability. A little seems like a lot when you're not used to any."

Biography
 
Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith
 "Jackson Pollock: An American Saga"
Crammed with anecdotes and details, Steven Naifeh's and Gregory White Smith's biography of Jackson Pollock provoked an uproar in the art world with its contention that the artist was ambiguous about his sexual identity, that he was neurotically dependent on his mother's presence and that he drew inspiration for some of his famous "drip" paintings by observing in childhood the patterns made by his father's urination on a flat stone. Mr. Naifeh, 38 years old, a native of Tulsa, Okla., and Mr. Smith, 39, a native of Columbus, Ohio, both graduated from Harvard Law School in 1977. After working in the legal profession they returned to Harvard, where Mr. Naifeh earned a master's degree in art history at the Fogg Art Museum and Mr. Smith, a master's degree in education. They both live in Aiken, S.C.
 
General Nonfiction
 
Bert Holldobler and Edward O. Wilson
 "The Ants" 
 Bert Holldobler and Edward O. Wilson have never lost their fascination with "the little creatures who run the world," and they communicate that. Ants, they write in their authoritative 732-page book on them, "represent the culmination of insect evolution, in the same sense that human beings represent the summit of vertebrate evolution." Mr. Holldobler is the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University and a professor of behavioral physiology at the University of Wurzburg in Germany. Born in Erling-Andechs, Germany, he came to the United States in 1973 as a professor of biology at Harvard. He is married with three sons. This is the second Pulitzer Prize for Mr. Wilson, the Frank B. Baird Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard, who won one in nonfiction in 1975 for his book "On Human Nature." Born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1929, he was educated at the University of Alabama and at Harvard, where he has taught for more than 30 years. Since 1973 he has also been curator in entomology at the university's Museum of Comparative Zoology. He lives in Lexington, Mass., with his wife and daughter.
 
Poetry
 
 Mona Van Duyn
 "Near Changes"
Mona Van Duyn won for her seventh book, a 69-page collection. She sees herself as a poet of "serious play." As one critic said, she usually looks into metaphorical possibilities and implications inherent in daily life. As she demonstrates in "Sonnet for Minimalists," she can do this humorously: "The world's perverse/It could be worse." Ms. Van Duyn, (pronounced van DINE), 69 years old, was born in Waterloo, Iowa, and lives in St. Louis. In 1947, she and her husband, Jarvis A. Thurston, founded "Perspective, a Quarterly of Literature." For this, she received the $25,000 Ruth Lilly Prize.
 
Fiction
 
 John Updike
 "Rabbit at Rest"
As a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, John Updike equals the record of two other American authors -- Booth Tarkington (1920, 1922) and William Faulkner (1955, 1963). Mr. Updike's second Pulitzer Prize, for "Rabbit at Rest," follows the 1982 prize for "Rabbit is Rich," the previous novel in this series of four about Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom, the former athletic star who becomes a car salesman in a Pennsylvania town. Mr. Updike, 59 years old, who has written a "Rabbit" novel in the ninth year of each decade since 1959, said yesterday that "Rabbit at Rest" is the last, not only because his protagonist dies but also because "I'm not sure I'd be around in 10 years to do another." The prolific author -- 14 novels and countless essays, book reviews, poems and criticisms -- was born in Shillington, Pa. He graduated from Harvard College in 1954 and attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford, England, on a one-year Knox Fellowship. From 1955 to 1957, he was on the staff of The New Yorker magazine, but on staff and off, he has been a frequent contributor to the publication. He and his wife, Martha, live in Beverly, Mass., near Boston.
 
Music
 
 Shulamit Ran
 Symphony
Shulamit Ran, a 41-year-old composer and pianist, is a professor of music at the University of Chicago, where she has taught since 1978. Her Symphony was commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra and was given its world premiere by that ensemble, with Gary Bertini conducting, on Oct. 19, 1990. The Symphony is in three movements and combines freely atonal, Expressionistic styles with currents of direct lyricism. Like many of her other recent scores, its movements involve expansions and transformations of themes heard early in the piece. She was born in Tel Aviv and holds dual Israeli and American citizenship. She came to New York when she was 14 to study at the Mannes College of Music. In September 1990, she was appointed composer-in-residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
 
History
 
 Laurel Thatcher Ulrich
 "A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard, Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812"
In 1982, working at the Maine State Archives in Augusta, Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, who teaches history at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, discovered an immensely detailed diary of a midwife who lived in Maine in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Professor Ulrich, 52 years old, was thrilled with her discovery, she said yesterday, because the great difficulty in writing about the lives of women in the early history of the United States, which is her specialty, is the paucity of source material. "Women's lives at that time were almost completely hidden," she said. In the diary of Martha Ballard, she found evidence of the way in which women were involved in bartering and trading, and detailed information about the practice of obstetrics, in both normal and emergency cases. Born in Sugar City, Idaho, she earned degrees at the University of Utah, Simmons College in Boston and a doctorate at the University of New Hamphire.
 
Drama
 
 Neil Simon
 "Lost in Yonkers"
Neil Simon, 63 years old, won for his play set in the summer of 1942 in a two-bedroom apartment over a candy store in Yonkers. Starring Irene Worth, Mercedes Ruehl and Kevin Spacey and directed by Gene Saks, it tells of two teen-age brothers who have been forced for economic reasons to move in with their grandmother, a stern, distant and iron-willed German-Jewish refugee whose overpowering personality has stunted the adulthood of her own children. "I'm really glad I won for 'Lost in Yonkers,' " Mr. Simon said yesterday on the telephone from Hawaii. "The play came out of instinctive feelings I had and probably awakened in me things I didn't know about." He was born in the Bronx. In the last 30 years, he has written 26 Broadway plays, including "Come Blow Your Horn," "Barefoot in the Park," "The Odd Couple," "Plaza Suite," "The Prisoner of Second Avenue," "The Sunshine Boys," "Chapter Two," "Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound."
 
Feature Photography
 
William Snyder
 The Dallas Morning News
William Snyder won his second Pulitzer Prize for pictures of sick and orphaned children living in primitive conditions in Romania. One picture shows a forlorn child in hugely ill-fitting pajamas crawling along while a worker strides past, ignoring him. Mr. Snyder, 31 years old, was a member of a three-person Dallas Morning News team that won a Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism in 1989. The team traced the movements of the National Transportation Safety Board in investigating an airplane crash. He joined The Dallas Morning News in 1983.

The Herald won for more than 80 articles documenting the rise and fall of a local cult leader, Yahweh Ben Yahweh, who called himself the son of God and was one of the most influential preachers in Miami. Even as top city officials praised him, his followers in the Nation of Yahweh engaged in a pattern of violence, The Herald reported. The lead reporter, Sydney P. Freedberg, tracked down defectors from the cult. Many had given statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and were frightened because no one had been charged. Ms. Freedberg obtained documents linking members of the sect to 14 killings. In November, the cult leader was accused of ordering the murders and indicted on Federal racketeering charges.
 
Beat Reporting
 
 Natalie Angier
 The New York Times
Natalie Angier, cited by the Pulitzer committee for "compelling and illuminating" articles on a variety of scientific topics, compares herself to the pilot of the fictional spaceship that tours the inside of a human body in the movie "Fantastic Voyage." "What I try to do is to humanize everything," she said, "to give the reader the feeling that they are right there in the middle of the scientific process." For example, in a complicated story on the cell cycle, she likened the coupling of proteins to "the vitality of young lovers galvanizing in a cascade of changes in the cell that culminates in division." A graduate of Barnard College, Ms. Angier, 33 years old, worked as an editor for Savvy magazine and as a science and environmental writer for Time magazine. She is the author of "Natural Obsessions: The Search for the Oncogene" (1988), which won the Lewis Thomas Award for excellence in writing about the life sciences. She joined The Times in March 1990.

Public Service
 
 Jane Schorer
 The Des Moines Register
The Des Moines Register was awarded the Pulitzer Prize gold medal for Public Service for a series of articles about a rape and its aftermath that reopened the nationwide debate over whether rape victims should be identified by name in news accounts. In a series of stories in February of last year, Jane Schorer told of the 1988 rape of Nancy Ziegenmeyer and her subsequent experiences with the hospital, the police and prosecutors, the accused attacker and the criminal-justice system. Mrs. Ziegenmeyer called the editor of The Register, Geneva Overholser, with her story after reading the editor's op-editorial piece in The Register questioning the news media's reluctance to use rape victims' names.

For one year, Joseph T. Hallinan and Susan M. Headden were taken off their beats at The Indianapolis Star and assigned to examine medical malpractice in Indiana. The result was a three-part series that showed that doctors who were found liable in several major cases of malpractice had little to worry about professionally. "We found that some doctors who had been found liable in as many as five major cases neither lost their licenses, their insurance nor their hospital privileges," Ms. Headden said yesterday. Mr. Hallinan, 30 years old, joined The Star in 1985. Ms. Headden, 35, joined The Star in 1979.
 
Explanatory Reporting
 
 Susan C. Faludi

"On the eve of the 1986 leveraged buyout of Safeway Stores, Inc., the board of directors sat down to a last supper." Thus began a lengthy artice in The Wall Street Journal by Susan C. Faludi that, in the words of the Pulitzer committee, "revealed the human costs of high finance." The article contrasted the assurances by the owners of the world's largest supermarket chain that no one would be hurt in the buyout that enriched a few investors to the desparation that came to many of the 63,000 employees who were eventually dismissed by Safeway. "I'm just glad that their side of the story got told," Ms. Faludi, 35, said yesterday. She joined The Wall Street Journal in 1990.

HEADLINE: Egypt's 'Reward': Forgiven Debt

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Egypt is about to receive a package of debt forgiveness and other international economic assistance worth billions of dollars in the wake of the Persian Gulf war, American and international economic officials said today.
The help is coming from both creditor governments and international institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The United States, which forgave about $7 billion in Egyptian debt after Cairo backed the allies in the gulf war, has played a key role behind the scenes in winning the help for Egypt. 
 "This package has been in the works for some time and is Egypt's reward for having given legitimacy to the American intervention in the gulf," said Yahya Sadowski, a scholar on Egypt at the Brookings Institution.
 
Meeting Scheduled in May
 Western governments at a meeting tentatively scheduled for the third week in May are expected to wipe out much of the $40.16 billion of Egyptian debts to these governments, according to international monetary officals here.
This does not include $8.64 billion of debts to commercial banks and other private institutions. In addition, at least $600 million is expected to be forthcoming shortly in loans from both the monetary fund and the World Bank.
The quid pro quo for the aid is the Egyptian Government's commitment to economic reform. An I.M.F. team left Cairo today with a letter of intent just signed by the Government of President Hosni Mubarak. The letter is expected to serve as the basis for a formal agreement for a $300 million loan that is tentatively scheduled for I.M.F. board approval in mid-May. The World Bank would also kick in $300 million, its first loan to Egypt since the Gulf crisis began last summer.
Creditor governments have demanded an Egyptian reform program that wins the I.M.F.'s seal of approval before they agree to debt forgiveness.
The exercise is similar to what was put together for Poland, also largely by the United States Treasury.
A consortium of creditor countries, known as the Paris Club for the site of their deliberations, agreed last month to wipe out at least 50 percent of Poland's $33 billion in government debts.
David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said at the time that Poland and Egypt were "unique politically and economically."
Mr. Mulford explained that both countries had the highest debt burden in the world in proportion to their gross national product, and that most of their debt was owed to other governments, rather than to private banks.
On top of this, Egypt has been especially hard hit by the gulf crisis, which, among other things, disrupted its trading patterns and forced hundreds of thousands of Egyptian migrant workers back into the country, putting new pressures on domestic services.
With 55 million people, Egypt is the most populous country in the Middle East, and the second most populous on the African continent after Nigeria.
 
Latin Debt Mostly Private
 In Poland's case, the United States went beyond the 50 percent reduction agreed to by the Paris Club, forgiving 70 percent of Poland's $3.8 billion debt to Washington.
Despite the Administration's argument that Poland and Egypt are special cases, debt-ridden Latin American countries are likely to call for similar treatment.
One major difference, however, is that most of the Latin debt is owed to banks, not governments. For example, official or government debt of Argentina is only 1 percent of its total foreign debt of $56 billion.
The Egyptian package was more difficult to put together than Poland's because of Cairo's poor record on meeting I.M.F. economic conditions.
For example, in 1987 Cairo and the fund came to terms on a $250 million loan, but the Mubarak Government, failing to meet fiscal, monetary and pricing targets, fell out of compliance.
 
Riots 10 Years Ago
 It had been 10 years earlier that the fund and Egypt last came together. Then, too, Egypt, under President Anwar el-Sadat, could not meet the terms. Waves of rioting broke out in Cairo when the Government reduced some of the subsidies on foods, as was demanded by the I.M.F.
The reforms that flow from the new I.M.F. program are also likely to bring political danger, especially as they again touch on removing subsidies from essential foods and services.
In a recent interview with the Cairo newspaper Al Ahram, President Mubarak sought to demonstrate the critical need for foreign assistance.
He calculated his country's overall losses from the gulf war at $20 billion. Among other things, he said, 700,000 Egyptians who worked in Iraq and Kuwait returned jobless. Also, Egypt lost billions in tourism, and revenues from oil exports have fallen because of increases in consumption by the growing population.

HEADLINE: Defying the Wisdom for '92, Ex-Senator Tsongas Dives In

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOWELL, Mass., April 8

 BODY:
The heavyweights in the Democratic Party are temporizing, stalling, waiting for the odds to improve before making any commitment to enter the 1992 Presidential campaign. Paul E. Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, has simply plunged in, calmly defying the collective wisdom of the Capital Beltway.
He knows that after the party's experience with Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, a campaign by another Greek-American liberal from Massachusetts is "fodder for Jay Leno and 'Saturday Night Live,' " as Mr. Tsongas puts it. He knows that the view of much of Washington is that President Bush is all but unbeatable and would certainly not be beatable by someone off the national political scene since 1984, when Mr. Tsongas left the Senate with a diagnosis of cancer. 
 He also knows that every time he has a chest cold, as he does now, someone will probably ask him about his health, five years after he underwent a successful bone marrow transplant for the treatment of lymphoma.
Paul Tsongas, now 50 years old, knows all these things, talks about them blithely on the veranda of his gracious old hilltop home here in Lowell -- and remains convinced that he wants to run.
He was struggling on this gentle morning with a speech he would deliver later in the week to the National Press Club in Washington. "It's hard to make people understand how I think these days," he said.
Were he thinking today as he did back in his days as an ambitious young lawmaker who considered himself a potential Presidential contender, he might make the same calculated decision that many Democrats are now making: "Decide that it's not probable," he said, "and save myself for '96."
But he is no longer a 33-year-old freshman Congressman or a 37-year-old freshman Senator. His battle with cancer, and six years working as a lawyer and businessman, have changed him, Mr. Tsongas said. He is convinced that the nation faces a serious economic decline and that neither Democrats nor Republicans are addressing it as they should. He wanted to get his ideas out. And so he runs.
 
'Pro-Business Liberal'
 Mr. Tsongas is often termed a "pro-business liberal," and he does not object to the description. His campaign white paper, "A Call to Economic Arms," paints a grim picture of "America's manufacturing base under attack," buffeted by outmoded policies and intensifying foreign competition. "Both political parties," the paper argues, "are going to have to abandon the rusty core elements of their economic philosophies and head off in new directions."
Republicans, he asserts, must accept the notion that the United States needs an industrial policy in which the Federal Government is actively involved in helping businesses develop new technologies. "American companies need the U.S. Government as a full partner if they are to have any hope of competing internationally," Mr. Tsongas wrote.
Democrats, Mr. Tsongas said, must reject the politics of "class warfare" and help spur economic growth through measures like a carefully aimed cut in the tax on capital gains. "Class warfare is certainly good politics," he wrote, "but it's good politics at the expense of the nation's industrial base."
Mr. Tsongas also breaks with the orthodoxy of many Democrats by supporting nuclear power as a means of easing the country's dependence on fossil fuels, a stance that he adopted several years ago but that he says is all the more urgent now, given the furor over global warming.
The Tsongas campaign has printed 40,000 copies of "A Call to Economic Arms," and Mr. Tsongas said he is cheered by the response. "I know the usual political analysis is that Bush is unbeatable and we should just have a coronation and skip the election, but that's Washington," he said. "Outside, people really know that the ground is trembling."
This is not a mega-campaign. Its first major fund-raising event will be Thursday night in Boston; Dennis Kanin, Mr. Tsongas's law partner and longtime political adviser, said the campaign expected to raise $250,000 that night. The Tsongas campaign hired a press secretary this week, its first paid staff member, and will open a headquarters in Boston shortly. Mr. Tsongas is expected to officially announce his candidacy on April 30, with appearances in Lowell, Manchester, N.H., and Des Moines.
Mr. Tsongas said he had sought and had received a go-ahead from his physicians before deciding to make the race. Dr. Tak Takvorian, a senior staff physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mr. Tsongas's physician, said the candidate had shown no evidence of the disease since he underwent the bone marrow transplant in 1986.
 
'Could Not Be Better'
 Mr. Tsongas, who has three daughters with his wife, Nicola, a lawyer, said, "On a personal level, our life could not be better than it is now."
He said he was urged to enter the race for governor of Massachusetts last year, but, "It just wasn't me." He said he wanted his ideas on national economic policy to be heard; some Democrats, including the poll taker Geoffrey Garin, suggest that he could play a role similar to that played by Bruce Babbitt, the former Governor of Arizona, in 1988: raising ideas, challenging orthodoxy.
"But the fact of the matter is, nobody's turned that into a successful model yet for winning the nomination," Mr. Garin said.
Mr. Tsongas said, with a smile, that he is ready to press on. "Besides," he said after outlining the rationale for his candidacy, "it's also fun. There's a magic to it."

Mexico-U.S. Phone Lines To Increase

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 9

 BODY:
A.T.& T. announced today that it would increase the telecommunications capacity between the United States and Mexico fivefold by the end of this year, as part of a broad new focus on Latin America.
 Officials of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said the increased capacity, which will be made possible by the completion of five new fiber-optic cables across the border, is planned to coincide with an expected surge in demand for telephone and computer services after a new North American free-trade accord is reached. 

 
A Serious Impediment
 The lack of a clear, reliable communications network to the United States has in the past been a serious impediment to the growth of American business investment in Mexico, forcing many American companies that do business here to establish expensive private phone lines and courier links to their headquarters in the United States.
 The poor quality of existing connections has also placed sharp limits on the use of modern telecommunications devices, such as facsimile, computer networking and data transmission, by foreign and Mexican companies alike.
 The Mexican telephone monopoly, Telefonos de Mexico, plans to spend as much as $2.5 billion this year alone to install digital technology under the terms of a Government agreement late last year to privatize part of the company.
 "As we move toward a North American free-trade zone, improved communication is critical to businesses, travelers and individual callers," said Don Anderson, an A.T.& T. official in San Antonio, where today's announcement was made. The governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States have agreed to hold negotiations on a North American free-trade zone in hopes of joining their three economies in a new trading zone that would include more than 360 million people.
 A.T.& T. spokesmen said that each of the new cross-border cables would be able to carry the equivalent of 37,800 simultaneous voice conversations and would permit the installation of new digital transmission equipment and services as part of a major planned expansion of A.T.& T.'s business in the region.
 Within the next two years, the new cables are to be connected to an 8,000-mile Mexican fiber-optic "backbone network" that will link up 54 Mexican cities with high-quality digital transmission technology. A.T.& T., which now has some 2,000 employees in Mexico, will build 60 percent of that network, and has also announced its participation in a new $500 million fiber-optic underseas communications cable that will connect Mexico with the United States, the Caribbean and Spain.

Record Opening-Day Salaries: Not Peanuts or Cracker Jack

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
If the fact that 223 players are making $1 million or more this year -- 32 at $3 million or more -- is not enough of an economically mind-boggling barometer of the escalation of baseball salaries, consider these developments:
 Nine teams have an average salary of more than $1 million, dividing total payroll by the number of players. The average opening-day major league salary for all players, total 708, is $890,844, and an astonishing 53 percent more than last year's opening-day average, which was in the $580,000 range. 
 In previous years, no individual team average salary ever reached this year's major league average salary. The record for a team average was set by the Mets in 1989 at $865,741.
Rosters and disabled lists -- and thus the numbers -- will change somewhat by Aug. 31, when the official salary studies are conducted by the Player Relations Committee and the Players Association. But the season-opening figures, compiled by The New York Times from contract data obtained from management and player sources, show just how meteorically salaries have risen this year.
 On opening day last year only one player, Robin Yount of Milwaukee, was at the $3 million plateau. This year Darryl Strawberry of Los Angeles, at $3.8 million, heads a hefty group of 32 floating in that economic stratosphere. Last year 153 players were at $1 million or more, this year 223.
 The Oakland Athletics, with a record $36.4 million payroll and 14 of their 27 players receiving $1 million or more, have the highest team average, $1,349,352. The Houston Astros, who lost most of their high-priced players as free agents during the winter, are at the other end of the salary standings with an average of $487,090.
 The five members of the Athletics who are signed for $3 million or more -- total $16.7 million -- make more than the entire payrolls of Houston, Baltimore or Seattle. Add Mark McGwire, and the $19.55 million total is higher than the payroll of those three teams plus Cleveland and the Chicago White Sox. Then throw in Dave Henderson, and the $22.15 million total is higher than the payrolls of those five clubs plus Texas, Montreal, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Atlanta and San Diego, or 11 of the other 25 clubs.
 After the Athletics, the Mets have 13 players at $1 million or more, Boston, California and San Francisco 12 each and the Yankees, Kansas City and Los Angeles 11 each. Baltimore and Seattle have the fewest, three each.
 Only 43 players are receiving the minimum salary of $100,000. That total is down drastically from the 1990 opening-day total of 90, although those rosters each included 28 players because of the abbreviated spring training that followed the lockout.
The average team salaries on this page are based on the opening-day rosters and disabled list. All team and individual salaries include base salary and prorated share of signing bonuses.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Fifteen pitchers who last year had won-lost records of .500 or worse will earn a total of $38,262,503. The group includes some who began this season on the disabled list, such as Orel Hershiser, above, and such high-paid underacheivers as Mark Langston and Mark Davis; dollar for dollar, Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle, at $535,000, is very likely the best player in the majors. He may continue to be one of the best players around after this year, but his salary next year is likely to soar to $2 million; the Tigers will pay the most money for missing the most pitches. Cecil Fielder, above, Mickey Tettleton, Rob Deer and Pete Incaviglia struck out a total of 635 times last season, and the Tigers will pay them a total of $5,816,667 this year; after the Reds won the World Series, Lou Piniella got his boss to make him the highest-paid manager when she nearly doubled his salary, from 350,000 to nearly $700,000. Nice as the raise was, the new salary would place him only 13th on the Reds' players' pay list; Dwight Gooden of the Mets, above, and Roger Clemens of the Red Sox have recently signed the richest contracts ever based on average annual value, but they do not have the top pay on their respective teams this year because the contracts are extensions that begin next year. Each is No. 4 on his club for 1991.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
Kurds Assert Few Outside Iraq Wanted Them to Win

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, April 10

 BODY:
As they contemplate the swift and bloody collapse of their revolt in Iraq, the exiled foes of President Saddam Hussein have come to some bitter conclusions about their defeat. Partly, they say, they were outgunned and partly overwhelmed by the speed and scope of an uprising that took even them by surprise.
Partly, too, they made their own, severe blunders, they say. But beyond those reasons, they assert in homes and offices across Syria's capital, they lost because very few people outside Iraq wanted them to win at all. 
 It is, perhaps, one of the most savage realizations of the Persian Gulf crisis and the subsequent turmoil in both north and south Iraq that the allied campaign against President Hussein brought the United States and its Arab coalition partners to a strikingly unanimous view: whatever the sins of the Iraqi leader, he offered the West and the region a better hope for his country's stability than did those who have suffered his repression.
 
Military Coup Called Object
 "Those who are concerned with the situation in Iraq prefer a solution from inside the establishment," said Fakhri Kareem, a member of the leadership of the 17-party coalition of exiled opposition groups that is based here and includes Kurds, Islamic fundamentalists, Baathists, Communists and others.
In other words, he said, "U.S. officials make no secret of it -- they want a military coup" in Baghdad to topple President Hussein and are prepared to wait for it.
The revolt first broke out in southern Iraq when American and allied forces routed Iraqi forces from Kuwait and President Hussein's enemies sensed his vulnerability. It spread to Kurdish-speaking northern Iraq with such ease and speed, according to Western assessments, that Kurdish insurgents found towns falling to them virtually without a fight.
But President Hussein, marshaling a rump army based on the elite Republican Guard and helicopter-gunship forces held in reserve during the gulf war, turned his forces first on the Shiite Muslim insurgents in the south, then on the Kurdish guerrillas in the north.
 
Ill Prepared for the Uprising
 "We lost," said Izzedine Barawi, a Kurdish spokesman here, "because we were lightly armed and they had heavy weapons, because our people were starving and because we simply could not marshal the large numbers of people who had joined in the uprising." With its speed, seeming spontaneity and broad scope, many exiled Iraqis say, the uprising caught them ill-prepared.
Those were not, however, the only reasons. Islamic fundamentalist officials here acknowledge that by casting the southern revolt as a holy war in the revolutionary style of neighboring Iran they not only invited disputes with secular members of the opposition coalition, but also frightened Iraq's Arab neighbors.
Syria, for instance, "does not want to see mullahs in Baghdad," said an official here, referring to the idea of an Islamic fundamentalist regime in Baghdad that might foment a resurgence of Syria's own Muslim militants. "Syria is in complete agreement with Washington on this," said the official, who requested anonymity. Neither did the Sunni Muslim royal family of Saudi Arabia wish to invite a Shiite revolutionary regime to its borders.
While Western diplomats say Iran apparently provided weapons, moral backing and other support for the rebels in the south, Iraq's Arab neighbors did not. "Syria was a point of passage, a shelter for the exiled officials, but nothing more," an official said. "There was no economic or military aid to the Kurds or anyone else." Syria sided with the United States in the gulf crisis.
 
A Letter Awaits Baker
 At the same time, the United States matched its refusal to be drawn into the civil war with a refusal to talk to those involved in fighting it.
When Secretary of States James A. Baker 3d arrives here on Thursday to discuss the Middle East with President Hafez el-Assad, he will find waiting for him a letter from the opposition groups requesting a meeting. "We hope that your Government will respond positively" to the request, the letter, delivered to the United States Embassy here, says. So far, Iraqi exiles say, there has been no reply to it and the embassy's doors remain closed to them.
Bush Administration officials have met with exiled Iraqis in Washington, but members of the coalition here maintain that those figures have no links to the insurgency.
Moreover, United States policy, reflecting a widespread regional view, is apparently based partly on the conclusion that those who fought the civil war would have wound up fighting one another if they had won, splitting the country into sectarian chunks reminiscent of Lebanon.
"We've seen these guys -- Kurds and Shiites -- threatening one another publicly, in front of reporters," a Syrian journalist said. "You get the Shiites saying they want an Islamic state and the Kurds saying, 'Well, if you do that we'll take up arms against you'."
"A separate Kurdistan," said a Syrian official, "is a casus belli for both Turkey and Syria." Both countries have Kurdish minorities likely to be inspired by a Kurdish state on their borders in northern Iraq.
 
A Weak Hussein Called Aim
 The United States' attitude, a senior regional diplomat said, has also brought several Arab governments to the more cynical conclusion that "Washington wanted a weak Saddam to sign up for the cease-fire terms" set out by the United Nations Security Council last week. These deny Iraq the ability to rebuild its military strength and mortgage part of its likely oil revenues to pay reparations.
"Saddam Hussein has to be made responsible for the postwar conditions in Iraq," the diplomat said. "A new government would have denied the obligations. As it is now, the hardships of postwar Iraq will be the responsibility of Saddam Hussein."
Mr. Kareem, the opposition coalition member, who is also a leader of the exiled Iraq Communist Party, said, "The U.S. seems interested in keeping Saddam as a weakling, an invalid, in order to get his signature on the Security Council resolution."
That argument evokes the question: Who do Iraq's neighbors want to see running the country? The answer, though not unanimous, is a strongman from the military or the Baath Party whose policies will not challenge the region's monarchies and dictatorships by setting an example of democracy.
"Syria would prefer a Baathist government without Saddam Hussein," an Arab envoy said, "not a democractic one, not a Shiite one, not a Kurdish one and probably not a pro-Western one."
Syria and Iraq, longstanding adversaries, are led by rival wings of the Baath Party, which is nominally committed to Arab unity, socialism and freedom, but which in reality is more a principle sinew of power for unelected ruling elites.
"On the other hand," the diplomat said, "a reunited Baath Party under Syrian influence might well be seen as a new regional power bloc, which neither Turkey nor Saudi Arabia would approve."
The calculations reflect another reality, particularly for Iraq's Kurds, a non-Arab Sunni Muslim group that makes up minorities in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey and the Soviet Union.
In 1920, the Treaty of Sevres regulating the break-up of the Ottoman Empire promised the Kurds a state of their own, but the treaty became a dead letter when Mustafa Kemal led a Turkish revolt against its terms, and its promises were never redeemed. Since then none of the Kurds' host countries have seen an interest in even contemplating a revival of the pledges. Countless Kurdish revolts have been crushed.
"Unfortunately," said Massoud Barzani, a leader of one of the two main Kurdish insurgent groups in the fractious coalition, "the Kurds have no friends."

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
Larger Mergers Delayed by War

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
THE economies in the United States and Britain were slumping, Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait and President Bush was building an international coalition to oppose the Iraqi leader. But the business of buying or merging companies apparently went on almost as usual late last year, except that some big deals seemed to fall by the wayside.
But when the Persian Gulf war began in January, activity plunged. By then the United States and Britain were in recession, and European economies were beginning to slide as well. Banks were still tight with loans, and executives were not traveling to make deals or look for them. 
 That's the picture that emerges from data released yesterday on the buying and merging of companies in Europe and elsewhere for last year and the first quarter of 1991.
According to Translink's European Deal Review, mergers and acquisitions in Europe rose to a record last year, as the rush continued to prepare for the economic union of Europe in 1992.
Companies in Sweden, which is not a member of the European Community but wants to join, scurried most frantically to be well placed for 1992. Companies in this small economy wound up ranked fourth in the number of deals and second in the total value of deals whose prices were reported (Because prices are not reported in some deals the dollar comparisons are a less precise indicator of activity). The money spent in 1990, $12 billion, was six times that paid in 1989, the data show.
The United States was third among the acquirers of European companies, with 177 deals, down from 182 in 1989, when it was second. The value of the deals was $11.8 billion, also putting it in second place, but down from $15.3 billion. The big American deal of the year was Philip Morris's $3.8 billion purchase of the Swiss candy maker Jacobs Suchard, accounting for 32 percent of the American total.
But according to a survey of the first quarter of 1991 by KPMG Peat Marwick, both foreign acquisitions in the United States and American acquisitions worldwide fell sharply. The number of foreign mergers or acquisitions fell 53.2 percent, to 66, in the first three months of this year from 144 in the fourth quarter. The value of the deals in which prices were reported plummeted 75.2 percent, to $3.3 billion from $13.3 billion. The Dutch, followed by the Japanese and the British were the leading foreign acquirers.
The number of American company acquisitions abroad dropped 52.9 percent, to 49 from 104, while the value of the mergers or acquisitions was off 53.6 percent, to $1.3 billion from $2.8 billion.
"The economy was part of it," said Herb Adler, a Peat Marwick international mergers and acquisitions partner. "But people were not even going on airplanes. You didn't go and look at a acquisition and you didn't go and see an investment banker." But he said he has seen signs of revival since.
Over all, according to Translink, 1,467 deals took place in Europe in 1990, compared with 1,266 in 1989. The value of the deals in which prices were reported rose 24 percent, to $62 billion from $50 billion. Britain remained the favorite country to buy in, followed by France and Germany. The data include deals that have not necessarily closed.
The leading deal makers were the French in both the number of deals, 263, and the value reported, $13.6 billion. But their aggressive buying, according to Translink's editor, Mark Dixon, is also causing some friction in the European Community because many mergers and acquisitions are by state-owned or controlled companies. The British have tried to block such deals.
There was a drop in the deals by German companies, a clear reflection of the concentration on the rebuilding of eastern Germany. More than 85 percent of eastern German companies are being bought by Germans in the west. Compared with 1990, German mergers and acquisitions were down to 111 deals, from 128, and down to $2.5 billion, from $8.5 billion, in reported value. But the interest in Germany from abroad held up well.
In comparing the first half of the year with the second half, the main impact from the Persian Gulf crisis came right away. Then the rate of deal-making recovered. But it appears from the value of deals reported that some expensive transactions might have been put off because the value of deals does not recover as much.
In August, total deals fell 32 percent, to 95, and the value 80.6 percent, to $1.4 billion. But in September, the number was back to 121, just 19 below the July level. But the value had come back to only $3 billion, still less than half of the $7.2 billion in July. By December there were 134 deals with a reported value of $3.4 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Soviet Unrest; Gold Prices Mostly Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday, strengthened by heightened unrest in the Soviet Union and reports of large dollar purchases by a large Asian bank.
Gold prices rose in Asia but fell elsewhere. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $364.40 an ounce, down 50 cents from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $363.10 an ounce, off 70 cents from its quote of late on Tuesday. 
 The dollar, which rose in European trading, continued to strengthen in New York trading after reports that a large Asian bank had bought dollars.
Further fueling the rise were news reports that Georgia, the southern Soviet republic that declared its independence on Tuesday, was planning a strike to protest the presence of Government troops.
The dollar was helped by a rumor, that later proved untrue, that Georgia had declared a state of war against the Soviet Union. Unrest in the Soviet Union is viewed as hurting neighboring economies, like Germany's.
Also affecting yesterday's trading were expectations on two important economic reports, the Producer Price Index due today, and the Consumer Price Index, due out tomorrow. If inflation seem relatively subdued, traders say the Federal Reserve Board may move to ease interest rates to speed the nation's economic recovery.
Lower interest rates generally hurt the dollar by eroding the value of dollar-denominated investments and making them less attractive.
But Tom Benfer of the Bank of Montreal's New York office, said he was "not totally convinced" a move to lower interest rates would hurt the dollar. He said recent trading activity had anticipated a move by the Fed.
Lower inflation could also ultimately help the dollar against foreign currencies by giving an extra lift to the United States economy, he added.
"I think the dollar still remains and continues to have underlying strength," Mr. Benfer said.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.7800, from $1.7900 late on Tuesday. Sterling also weakened in New York, fetching $1.7760, less than the $1.7945 late on Tuesday.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 137.20 Japanese yen, unchanged from Tuesday. Later in London, it fell to 136.30 yen, and in New York it rose to 137.43 yen, from late Tuesday's 134.85 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.6800 German marks, up from 1.6655; 1.4295 Swiss francs, up from 1.4080; 5.6815 French francs, up from 5.6360; 1,246.00 Italian lire, up from 1,236.50, and 1.1513 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1525.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gasoline Prices Climb by 2 On Report of Supply Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The wholesale price for May deliveries of unleaded gasoline gained more than 2 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange yestesday after a report showed a sharp drop in United States gasoline stocks.
Crude oil and heating oil futures also rose. 
 Unleaded gasoline futures settled 1.25 cents to 2.19 cents higher in New York, with the contract for delivery in May at 70.67 cents a gallon; crude oil was 35 cents to 79 cents higher, with May at $21.05 a barrel; heating oil was 1.26 cents to 1.56 cents higher, with May at 56.02 cents a gallon; natural gas was 0.7 cent to 2.3 cents lower, with May at $1.376 per 1,000 cubic feet.
 
Off 4.9 Million Barrels
 The selloff in petroleum followed Tuesday's weekly inventory report by the American Petroleum Institute, which said the supply of gasoline in large domestic terminals and pipelines totaled 206.5 million barrels as of last Friday, down 4.9 million barrels from the previous week.
Gasoline stocks are only slightly above 205 million barrels, which is recognized by the Energy Department as the minimum operating level before supply shortages could develop, according to the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J.
The fall in gasoline supplies indicates "the recession is losing its grip on gasoline demand" as the summer driving season approaches, Pegasus said in an analysis of the report.
James Ritterbusch, an energy analyst for Paine Webber in Chicago, said gasoline shortages would not necessarily develop if inventories fell below 205 million barrels. He said the Midwest would likely be the first region to feel a gasoline shortage because inventories there are tighter than in other parts of the country.
Grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade in advaance of an Agriculture Department report that indicated export demand for corn and wheat had weakened and wheat consumpution was rising.
The rally partly reflected position-evening ahead of the monthly supply-and-demand report, which was released after the close.

U.S. Supercomputer Plan To Spur G.N.P., Study Says

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
A Government-financed study says that a proposed $1.9 billion Federal program to develop improvements in supercomputers will generate more than $10 billion in revenue for the United States computer industry by the end of the decade.
The report on the fastest computers, which was released yesterday, was prepared by the Gartner Group, a market research firm, for the Department of Energy. The economic impact study estimates that the program will add significantly to the United States gross national product, increasing it by sixth-tenths of a percent to 1.7 percent in the year 2000.
 
The 'Leading Edge'
 The report calls the supercomputer business the "leading edge" in information technology and says that advances made in the design of the fastest computers in turn affect competitiveness in many other American industries. 
 Congress is considering a five-year high performance computing initiative to begin in 1992 and to gradually increase Federal spending for advanced computing research from its present level of about $500 million a year to more than $1.1 billion a year. The additional Federal money would help create a "national data highway" that would link the nation's supercomputers at speeds greater than a billion bits of data a second. It would also supply research financing for advanced computing technologies.
Federal spending to develop supercomputer technologies will do more for productivity and international competitiveness than other Government spending, according to the report's authors.
"Spending for new knowledge probably brings more of a return for your investment than any other expenditure," said Herbert E. Striner, a professor emeritus and former business school dean at American University and senior consultant for the report.
Mr. Striner said that keeping the United States' lead in supercomputer technology was critical to the nation because the ability to process information quickly had a significant impact on decision-making that directly affects competitiveness.
The industries that will probably be helped most by advances in supercomputer technology are aerospace, chemicals, electronics, petroleum and pharmaceuticals, the report said.
The report asserts that Japanese supercomputer companies are now stronger than United States companies, noting that Cray Research Inc., the largest American supercomputer maker has less than $1 billion in annual revenues, while other American supercomputer companies are under $200 million. By comparison, the annual revenues of Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC ranged from $17 billion to $45 billion.
The report said the number of supercomputers installed in the United States had fallen from 81 percent of the world's total in 1980 to 50 percent of the world's total in 1990. During that period the Japanese total rose to 28 percent from 8 percent.
The report predicts that with Federal support the average parallel supercomputer will double in speed by the end of the decade, reaching speeds up to 1.3 trillion mathematical operations a second.
The report was financed jointly by the Energy Department and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Money Market Yields Down After Being Mixed 5 Weeks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for the period ended yesterday, after five weeks of being mixed.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's expect money market yields to remain in flux, leaning more toward the downside as the fixed-income market continues to wait for some Federal action to influence short-term rates. 
 "Everything points to a further decline in yields in money market funds, at least until there are firmer signs that the economy is bottoming," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at Donoghue's. "Right now the news is not bad, but not great."
Tax-exempt money fund yields fell sharply after four weeks on the rise, as demand has finally begun to outstrip the supply of new issues. The average number of days to maturity of securities held in portfolios declined to 49 days, from 50. Assets rose by $1.9 billion, to a total of $92.1 billion.
The average seven-day compounded yield for the period ended yesterday is 4.22 percent, down 25 basis points, while the 30-day compounded average yield, because it lags, rose slightly to 4.35 percent from 4.33 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield is 5.86 percent for investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 6.29 percent for those in the 33 percent tax bracket.
 
Taxable Assets Up
 Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of better than $100 million, which are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund produced the best return on investment for the third straight week, with a yield of 5.25 percent, or about 103 basis points more than the seven-day compound yield. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee.
Assets of taxable funds rose by $6.7 billion, to a total of $465.1 billion. Institutional funds accounted for $5.2 billion of the gain, to a total of $116 billion, as they sought the higher money market yields that lag other markets. Consumer assets rose $1.5 billion, to a total of $349.1 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 9 basis points, to 6.12 percent, while the 30-day yield fell 6 basis points, to 6.20 percent. The fund with the best return on investment for the period ended yesterday was Olde Premium Money Market Series, with a yield of 7.04 percent. The distributor is the Olde Discount Corporation of Detroit.
By comparison, bank money market accounts that compete with the money funds fell 3 basis points, to 5.48 percent according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Workers Must Choose As Jobs Move

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

 BODY:
Lucy Carrero started working for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a part-time messenger when she was a 17-year-old high school student. Eighteen years later she is still there, now as supervisor of 35 medical claims approvers.
"It's a good job," Ms. Carrero said Monday. "I like it." 
 Unfortunately, hers is among thousands of middle-level positions that Metropolitan Life is relocating. So Ms. Carrero, who has lived all her life in the Bronx, may soon have to decide whether to follow her job to Tampa, Fla. Most likely, if given the chance, she will.
"It will be a big change in terms of my personal life," said Ms. Carrero, 35, who supports her two children, ages 10 and 14. "But I need my job. I don't want to have to start all over again."
 
Moving Jobs, Not Headquarters
 Last week Metropolitan announced that it would relocate 3,000 jobs from its headquarters at 1 Madison Avenue to nine other sites around the country, including 1,200 to a new administrative center in Bridgewater, N.J. Another 1,000 jobs will be eliminated altogether, while 5,000 others, including those of all the top managers, will remain in New York City. The company is still notifying employees whether they will be asked to move.
A look at Metropolitan -- where the president, Robert G. Schwartz, emphasized that the company was "committed to keeping our headquarters at 1 Madison Avenue" -- shows that such a move affects not only a business, but people who have spent years or decades there.
Since 1987, New York City has lost more than 100,000 jobs, many of them white-collar positions. But at the same time, the exodus of headquarters seems to have slowed since the late 1970's and early 1980's, as more companies that move jobs are still keeping some ties to the city.
That is the pattern here. Metropolitan Life's decision would result in an immediate loss of 4,000 jobs from the city with no guarantee that they would return.
City city and state officials fear that several other large companies, including Smith Barney, the Morgan Stanley Group, the Bear Stearns Companies and Paramount Communications, could follow Metropolitan, and by doing so not only cut current job levels, but limit expansion and job growth in the city.
 
Keeping the 'Creative People'
 Another worrisome feature of the Metropolitan announcement is that, unlike some other companies, it is moving middle-level managers rather than back-office employees.
"New York's a great place," said Harry P. Kamen, an executive vice president. "But it's not all things to all people."
Mr. Kamen said that Metropolitan wants to keep its "creative people, the investment people, the ones who will develop new ideas" in New York City.
"But when you get to the middle-level managers and the technical people, New York City may not be the most efficient place to operate," he said. Because of the cost of living and other factors, "it's tough to move a middle-management person from Aurora or Wichita to Manhattan."
 
Big Elevators
 The company's decision was prompted by the renovation of one of the buildings in its headquarters -- two block-sized structures linked by tunnels and a 10th-floor skywalk on Madison Avenue between 23d and 25th Streets. Dating from 1929, the building is poorly designed for today's office needs.
"It was organized for large open spaces with row upon row of desks for clerks doing manual entries into ledgers and keeping records on enormous numbers of policies for very small amounts," said Mr. Kamen. "Even the elevators are large -- built for the coming and going of large numbers of people all at the same time."
Now, record keeping is done by computers and the legions of clerks have been replaced by programmers, systems designers and other technical and professional workers managing an increasingly diverse range of services.
"You have work stations and spacious offices," Mr. Kamen said. "Our percentage of clerical workers has dropped in half, from 4 out of 10 to 2 out of 10."
 
'We'll Try to Be Flexible'
 After the work is done in 1996, the building will have room for 6,000 workers.
Company officials say no decision has been made on how many of the 3,000 relocated employees will return, but company officials suggest one likely scenario is none.
"We're talking five years down the road, and we'll try to be flexible," said Mr. Kamen. "But people who relocate to Bridgewater won't be relocated again."
Some of the 4,000 employees affected by the decision have reacted with mixed emotions.
Tom Thurber, a 28-year old software trainer whose job will move to Pearl River, N.Y., said that he was "extremely happy." Mr. Thurber started working for Metropolitan four years ago in its Pearl River office, and was transferred to Manhattan. The commute from his Leonia, N.J., home will now be 20 minutes instead of 45.
Vicki Danaro, who is 38 and has been with Metropolitan for 21 years, has decided not to follow her job to New Orleans. "I don't want to go," she said. "Everything is here. I'm single and live at home, so I'm not all that worried. This is the third time my job has moved, but the other two times I found another one here in New York."
For Jack Davenport, a 52-year-old information services director whose job will shift to Bridgewater, working there would mean having to drive to work from his home in Manalapan, N.J., instead of taking the bus.
"I did a trial run Saturday, and it took me 55 minutes to drive to Bridgewater," he said. "In traffic, that means an hour and a quarter. Right now it takes me an hour and three quarters door to door, but I like other people to drive. I'm very impatient."
Mr. Davenport, who started working for the company as a high school student 34 years ago, said that with the last of his four children about to start college he cannot consider early retirement or accept a severance package.
 
Tough Trips
 The trip to New Jersey will be especially tough on some of his subordinates. "One is an Orthodox Jew who lives in Brooklyn," Mr. Davenport said. "He could not find the same sort of community in New Jersey, so he will have to commute for two hours."
The 1,000 eliminated jobs are a small percentage of Metropolitan's 54,000 employees nationwide. But for a company with a tradition of lifetime employment, the announcement constitutes what Bob Wright, a marketing analysis unit official, called "a break in the culture."
"It's hard to face the reality that after all those years of growth MetLife is downsizing," said Mr. Davenport. "All in all, the reaction is more negative than positive."
One claim approver in her 40's, who declined to give her name, said she expects to be laid off after 16 years. "My job is moving to Florida, but I don't expect to be eligible to go there," she said.
She said she is not fearful, though many of her colleagues are. "Some people have been here for 20 or 30 years," the woman said. "It's very scary for them. There are a lot of unanswered questions."
Mr. Wright suggested that even Snoopy, the cartoon dog who exudes reassurance in Metropolitan Life's advertising, has offered no advice.
"Snoopy's keeping mum," he said.

HEADLINE: Need Is Seen Approaching For Health-Care Rationing

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A new study by Tufts University economists says that employers and the Federal Government have virtually run out of ammunition in their battle to slow the growth of spending for health care.
"We are running out of ways to make savings and approaching the point where we will have to ration health care," said William B. Schwartz, a professor of medicine and a medical economist at Tufts. 
 He said that the savings resulting from the system of pre-set hospital fees, which was introduced in the early 1980's, had been "overwhelmed" by explosive growth in medical technology, as well as by rising numbers of aging patients.
Dr. Schwartz and health-care economists at other universities said that efforts to reduce hospital admissions through health maintenance organizations and through networks of hospitals that provide discounts made little difference in the overall growth of hospital spending in the 1980's.
Hospital costs are the largest ingredient, about 45 percent, in the nation's health-care spending.
"The era of easy reductions" in the number of days that patients spend in hospitals "is largely over," Dr. Schwartz and Daniel N. Mendelson say in an article appearing in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 
'One-Shot Effect' Cited
 Dr. Schwartz said the nation's spending for care for short-term illnesses in community hospitals was growing by 6 percent, or $11 billion a year, in constant dollars, from a base in 1989 of $185 billion. "And if we bring the poor into the system, that would add another $60 billion to the base and $3 billion to $4 billion to the growth each year," he added.
"We never discovered how to control the forces that are driving costs upward," said Mark Pauly, chairman of the health care systems department at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Dr. Pauley said efforts to slow rising costs through health maintenance organizations and medical reviews of expensive cases had only "a one-shot effect" on savings. "Employers say the same thing," he added. "All the devices helped for a while, they say, but now health insurance premiums are going up by 15 to 20 percent a year."
As for making patients and their families pay more of the cost of care, "the jury is still out," he said. "We don't know for sure if it slows the rate of growth." He said a recent study contradicted earlier findings that said increases in health costs had slowed when patients had to pay part of their medical bills.
Frank A. Sloan, a health economist at Vanderbilt University, said that Dr. Schwartz's analysis of the underlying trend was correct. "I buy the rationing argument," he said. But Professor Sloan said there was "undoubtedly still room for savings." He added, "There are lots of surgical procedures and hospital admissions" that could be eliminated because they are not appropriate. Surgical procedures among the elderly, for example, are increasing and should be studied to see whether all of them are justifiable, he said.

HEADLINE: Despite Some Gains by Hispanics, Report Finds Their Income Lags

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
Hispanic Americans have made some economic strides in recent years but they still lag well behind the rest of the nation's population, according to a Census Bureau report issued today.
The study, based on a bureau survey taken a year ago, before the completion of the 1990 census, said nearly two-thirds of Hispanic Americans were of Mexican origin, with Puerto Ricans (10.5 percent) and Cubans (4.9 percent) making up the other largest groupings. 
 In all, the report said, people of Latin American origin account for 13.7 percent of the nation's population.
The bureau said that more than 90 percent of Hispanic Americans lived in cities and that 23.4 percent of Hispanic families were poverty stricken. The poverty figure, based on a cutoff of $12,675 in annual income for a family of four, was an improvement from 1982, in the midst of the last recession, when the bureau conducted its last such survey focusing on Hispanic Americans. That year the proportion of hispanic Americans living in poverty was 27.2 percent.
But even the latest figure was far higher than the 9.2 percent rate of poverty that the bureau found among non-Hispanic families.
 
Decrease in Jobless Rate
 The report did not offer comparisons with other minority groups, like blacks or American Indians. But an earlier bureau report on blacks, based on figures from 1987, found that 30 percent of the black families in the United States were poor.
The latest report said the unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans also decreased over the eight-year period, to 8.2 percent in March 1990 from 16.5 percent in 1982. But that rate, like the poverty rate, was still well above the rate for non-Hispanic workers, which was 5.3 percent.
The report paralleled figures from the 1990 census in reporting a large increase in the number of Hispanic Americans in the last decade. According to the report, in 1990 about 5.9 million American households were Hispanic, an increase of 1.9 million since 1980.
About 82 percent of the Hispanic households were made up of families, with the remaining 18 percent composed of unrelated people living together or an individual living alone. Only about 70 percent of non-Hispanic households in the United States are family households, the report said.
 
Hispanic Groups Compared
 The report tended to confirm some anecdotal evidence about the relative success of various Hispanic groups in the last decade. Cubans had the highest average family income, $31,300, compared with $22,200 for Mexicans and $19,900 for Puerto Ricans.
In all, however, the median income of Hispanic American families was $23,400, just two-thirds of the median income of non-Hispanic families -- $35,200.
About 30 percent of male Hispanic workers were concentrated in lower-paying jobs like laborers or assembly-line workers, compared with 19.5 percent of non-Hispanic male workers.

HEADLINE: Toyota to Sell Cars in Israel, Officials Say

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 10

 BODY:
The Toyota Motor Corporation is expected to announce that it will begin selling cars in Israel despite the continuing Arab economic boycott of that country, officials of the Japanese auto maker said today.
For the last two years, Toyota officials say, they hve been under mounting pressure from Jewish organizations in the United States to begin sales operations in Israel. The pressure has taken the form of letters to Toyota and to newspapers but has not involved any threats of a boycott, according to the officials. 
 All 21 members of the Arab League refuse to have any economic dealings with Israel, and 13 of them participate in a secondary boycott against companies doing business there. Companies that break the boycott can be blacklisted.
 
Boycott Never Acknowledged
 Toyota has never acknowledged that it was complying with the boycott. Rather, company officials insisted they did not have the resources to sell cars in Israel, and "when the time was right they would consider it," a Toyota spokesman said.
Several other Japanese auto makers, including Honda's United States subsidiary, sell vehicles in Israel. Toyota is known as the most conservative of Japanese auto makers, so it is not surprising that it has allowed others to go first.
Like many Japanese companies, Toyota is acutely aware of American political currents. This week, 82 United States Senators signed a letter to the Emir of Kuwait requesting that his country drop the boycott.
And in recent weeks Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has been urging Arab governments to drop economic sanctions against Israel, saying it could reduce tension in the region and "build confidence" in advance of peace negotiations.
In their talks last week, President Bush asked Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan to clarify the Japanese Government's stance with respect to the boycott, a State Department spokesman said.
The Japanese Government, which imports most of its oil from the Middle East, is thought to have counseled some Japanese companies against economic ties with Israel, said William Maslow, general counsel of the American Jewish Congress. The organization publishes a newsletter that monitors developments concerning the 42-year-old boycott.
The Toyota officials said they had been planning to begin exporting cars from Japan to Israel before the Persian Gulf conflict but they suspended the plan because of the crisis. Toyota's decision comes against a backdrop of heightened United States diplomatic action toward easing tensions in the Middle East.
Toyota will begin by selling its 1.6-liter Corolla subcompact and may add more models later. The No. 1 auto maker in Japan hopes to sell 5,000 cars in Israel in 1992, which would amount to about 5 percent of the annual new-car market there.
The company's goal is to grow to about 20 percent of the market within a few years, its officials said. Last year Israelis bought about 109,000 new cars, 15 percent more than the previous year.
"Israel is not a huge market but it is significant," a senior Toyota official said.
The Corollas will be exported directly from Japan, the officals said, but American-built vehicles may eventually be exported to Israel.
Because the United States and Israel have a free-trade agreement, Honda and other Japanese auto makers that export from this country enjoy a considerable advantage over other auto makers, which must pay a stiff tariff.

HEADLINE: Costs Soar for On-the-Job Injuries

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The workers' compensation system of insurance, the 80-year-old program in which employers pay for job-related injuries, is struggling to stay afloat in at least seven states.
Surging medical costs and multimillion-dollar lawsuits brought by injured workers pushed national spending on workers' compensation up nearly 13 percent last year, to $53 billion. Since 1985, the spending has jumped a stunning 83 percent. 
 Insurers say employers are not paying enough to cover the program's costs. All told, workers' compensation insurers estimate that they suffered $5.7 billion in losses last year.
In the latest action to deal with the towering costs, the National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool, which keeps track of the finances of 600 insurer members, has just ordered them to raise their reserves for future claims by 15 percent, or $1.4 billion. Insurance companies say the pressure to hold down rate increases is so severe that several are abandoning the business.
 
Burden on Employers
 Faced with sharply higher insurance premiums in some states, some indignant employers are threatening to move. One Texas boot maker expanded by opening a plant in Missouri instead of Texas, where workers' compensation costs are among the nation's highest.
"The system clearly isn't working," said Donald Elisburg, executive director of the Occupational Health Foundation, a research and legal advisory group sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "The insurance industry talks about losing money. Employers and insurance agencies complain about high costs. And we have enormous problems with workers who can't get the system to work right and wind up going to a lawyer."
Workers' compensation pays the medical bills and an average of two-thirds of the wages lost by workers who are injured at work or become ill because of job conditions. Workers typically send their claims to an insurer representing the employer. Disputed cases may be appealed to a state agency or hearing officer or fought over in a lawsuit.
The coverage, which is regulated by the states, is usually compulsory. In Texas and a few other states where it is not required, employers are increasingly dropping the insurance and gambling that they will not be hit by large medical claims.
Workers' compensation laws typically require employers to pay 100 percent of medical costs resulting from on-the-job injuries. And in many states an injured worker is free to choose a doctor and then switch to another if the first physician seems unwilling to certify that an injury will be seriously disabling. Employers say the system is also abused when some employees claim workers' compensation for injuries suffered off the job that are not fully covered by other health insurance.
Around the country, workers' compensation programs, once the arcane province of state labor and insurance departments, legal specialists and union leaders, are being hotly debated by lawmakers who are feeling pressure from small and large employers. Texas and Florida enacted sweeping changes last year -- which are now being challenged in court -- to curtail lawsuits and big lump-sum settlements. The new Florida law allows employers to reduce medical benefits for injuries suffered on the job. In Michigan, employers say lawmakers have improved the system by cracking down on retirees who were claiming workers' compensation as a virtual supplementary pension.
Employers and insurers say the system is also in serious trouble in Maine, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
Medical payments under workers' compensation have risen even faster than other health-care costs paid by employers. Insurers say this is largely a result of state laws that prohibit cost controls such as requiring employees to go to certain doctors and to pay more of their medical bills.
In some states, red tape has created backlogs of thousands of cases of workers waiting to be paid.
A typical dispute involved Debra Townsend, who has been fighting for 11 years with M-R Products Inc., which operates a small plastics factory in Copemish, Mich., over payments for a back injury she suffered when she lifted molds from a vat on April 28, 1979.
She insisted that she could not do factory work and waited 14 months for the first hearing by an administrative judge. The judge awarded her two-thirds of her $91.49 average weekly pay, but she waited four more years for the money. "The employer flat-out refused to pay," said Timothy Bott, Mrs. Townsend's lawyer. "We had to garnish the employer's bank account."
Geoff Smith, a lawyer for M-R Products, said the payments were delayed because the company's insurer filed for bankruptcy and the company itself had trouble paying bills as Michigan plunged into recession. In June 1984, Mrs. Townsend was awarded $19,458 in back payments, Mr. Smith said, but she did not collect until late in 1985. A state appeals court awarded her an additional $22,500 in penalties, but the Michigan Supreme Court limited the penalty to $1,500.
Mike Russo, the owner of M-R Products, wants his money back, but he too has had to wait for a new hearing -- for four years. "She is still getting compensation from us, but we think she can work," he said. "We offered her a job, and we expect to sue for the money she got."
 
Premiums Vary Widely
 Private employers pay premiums average 2.3 percent of their payroll, though for accident-prone occupations, like construction, premiums can exceed 40 percent of the payroll in some states.
The Vogel Brothers Building Company, a contractor based in Madison, Wis., pays some cement workers in Florida $400 a week. Their workers' compensation premiums add $177 to weekly labor costs, said Daniel Vogel, a company vice president.
The workers' compensation system was started in seven states in 1911, when workers were typically young and suffered injuries like chopped fingers and crushed limbs. In today's service economy, the work force is aging, which can mean more accidents and illnesses. In addition, courts in some states have stretched the coverage to include treatments for stress, back pain and injuries from repetitive tasks at computers.
As insurers shun unprofitable customers, abandoned employees are placed in state insurance pools. In Massachusetts, one of the hardest-pressed states, the pool was responsible for more than half of all workers in 1990. And as costs for the pools mount, private insurers and employers are taxed to pay those costs on top of their own insurance expenses.
 
Wisconsin Removes Uncertainty
 Workers' compensation is supposed to pay promptly without assigning blame. The system works well in states like Wisconsin, where a state agency determines the amounts that injured workers may receive and insures that payments are prompt. By reducing the uncertainty, Wisconsin makes it less likely that workers will shop around for sympathetic doctors or file expensive lawsuits, said Richard A. Victor, executive director of the Workers' Compensation Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Cambridge, Mass. In New York, where payments have been relatively low, injured workers have been more likely to file lawsuits.
In about 15 percent of all cases, the injured workers hire lawyers to put pressure on employers for large settlements. In California, fees for lawyers on either side, and for doctors who testified as experts, exceeded $1 billion of the $9.2 billion total cost of workers' compensation in 1988.
Gary Countryman, chairman of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the nation's largest workers' compensation insurer, said regulators had blocked rate increases that would make up for "rapid cost escalation" in a number of states. Trying to catch up after several years of rebuffs by regulators in Rhode Island, for example, insurers there are requesting a rate increase of 128 percent.
In Florida and Texas, where employers were hit with rate increases of 30 percent in 1989 and 37 percent last year, business lobbyists pushed through laws to roll back rates, reduce coverage for workers and limit lawsuits.
Employers and insurers, sometimes joined by labor unions, have pushed through changes that reduced costs in states like Michigan, one of the highest-cost states until the early 1980's.
Alan H. Strohmaier, director of unemployment and workers' compensation at the General Motors Corporation, said that "in the 70's workers' compensation became a supplemental pension" that many disabled workers who retired could add to Social Security and other benefits. The law was tightened in 1982.
"Now there is a rigorous test to make sure a person is eligible," he said. As a result, he added, Michigan has become "an average-cost state" for workers' compensation.
But in Florida and Texas, labor unions went to court, contending that new laws denied injured workers the right to due process and a fair hearing.
In trying to curb expensive lawsuits, the Texas law would set guidelines for lawyers' fees, replacing their customary 25 percent of any settlement. Employees could not collect lump-sum settlements until after they returned to work. Ombudsmen stationed around the state would help injured employees to obtain their benefits.
The Florida Legislature has enacted changes intended to remove constitutional problems, and the State Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the appeal. Chapin Clark, a senior vice president with the National Council on Compensation Insurance, said insurers would need further rate increases of 87 percent in Florida and 68 percent in Texas if the laws did not survive in the courts.
In its novel approach, Florida would offer an option that would combine workers' compensation with cost-containment features often found in other employee benefits. Under the option, known as 24-hour coverage, employees would no longer have to prove that they were hurt at work, for example, but they could be asked to pay a share, or a deductible, of the medical bills and a percentage of the charges thereafter.
"Florida is a state where the labor movement is weak enough so that some of these things get passed," said John F. Burton, director of the Institute of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers University. "It wouldn't go in a lot of states."
Todd W. Thomas, president of the Florida Employers Safety Association, a lobbying group, said, "Labor and the trial lawyers hate the new law."

HEADLINE: Caution Urged on Recovery

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
The White House said today that it was too early to say the recession is ending, despite some hopeful signs.
But the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said at a news conference that the Administration still believed that the downturn, which began in the second half of last year, would be short. 
 "I don't know if I can point to any new signs" that the recession is ending, Mr. Fitzwater said in response to a question. "You're familiar with leading indicators, housing starts, and there are a few hopeful signs in that area. But I think it would be a little premature to try to reach a firm conclusion at this point."
Administration officials have said they expected the economy to start rebounding by the second half of this year.
Mr. Fitzwater refused to say whether the White House supported the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates. With a record budget deficit discouraging moves to end the recession through new spending programs, the Administration has left much of the recession-fighting to the central bank.

HEADLINE: New Cuts Sap Feeble School Districts

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA CRUZ, Calif., April 4

 BODY:
While California lawmakers wrestle with a record budget deficit, the Superintendent of Schools in this beachfront city hunches over his ledgers, looking for programs to cut and teachers to dismiss from a near-bankrupt school system where fat has long since given way to bone.
The choices are grim, said the Superintendent, Dale E. Kinsley. Can he expect teachers who have been sent pink slips to continue to spend their own money for classroom supplies? Can he ask principals to give up weekends to paint dilapidated school buildings? 
 Can he dismiss more custodians without leaving the schools unsafe and unsanitary? Can he trim counselors without abandoning abused or suicidal children? Can he cancel music lessons in elementary school, drop-out prevention classes in junior high and sports programs in high school, which are among the few specials activities left for the 8,400 students here?
"How far do you go before you say this is not an acceptable environment for students to learn in?" asked Mr. Kinsley, whose district is one of two dozen in the state on the brink of bankruptcy. "There's not much more I can do here without closing the doors, handing the keys over to the state and saying, 'You guys run it.' "
 
More and More of Less
 Mr. Kinsley could barely balance his budget when Gov. Pete Wilson was projecting a $7 billion budget shortfall for the state and calling for $2 billion in cuts in public education. But now it is clear that the financial picture is far bleaker. With a gap of $12.6 billion, a deficit larger than the general funds of all but four other states, public education is expected to lose even more.
"How do we do the same with less, less, less?" asked Dan Cavanaugh, the principal of the Bay View Elementary School here, where the custodian already doubles as the playground attendant and the kindergarten teachers sell flavored ices to pay for art supplies.
Public education was once a jewel in California's crown. But the state that was consistently in the Top 10 in the 1960's and early 70's has fallen to the middle or the bottom of the pack in indicators like per-student spending and student-teacher ratio. The precipitous decline in the last decade, experts say, is largely the result of a 1978 ballot measure that limited local property taxes, which are a major source of school financing elsewhere in the nation.
The current recession has plunged many other states into budget crises that are likely to squeeze the public schools, but none are shackled like California in ability to tax and spend locally for education. California spends $4,598 a student, 24th in the nation, with New York in first place at $8,439. These numbers are for the 1989-90 school year, the most recent data available from the National Education Association and the Federal Department of Education.
 
A City of New Pupils a Year
 Complicating matters further in California is the staggering population growth, which has swamped a school system of 5.3 million with more than 200,000 new students a year, many of them poor, minority youngsters who speak little English and require extra attention. The student-teacher ratio here is 22.7, ranking California 50th in the nation, although actual class size is considerably larger because of the number of specialized teachers. Connecticut, with 13.1 students for each teacher, ranks first in this category.
California's public schools, excluding the public university system, gobble 40 percent of the state budget, or $25.3 billion out of $55.7 billion, a level guaranteed by another of the ballot measures that complicates governance here. To cut the education budget below the 40 percent mark, as Governor Wilson suggests, the Legislature must suspend that 1988 measure by a two-thirds vote. The alarming deficit projections make a suspension likely.
Education advocates recognize that the budget crisis is unlikely to be solved without slashing school spending, but they argue that taxes should be raised to limit the damage.
"I understand the Governor is in a tough place," said Bill Honig, the state Superintendent of Public Education and a defender of guaranteed school spending. "But it all comes down to choices. The cuts that are contemplated will set this state back for a decade."
From one end of California to the other, educators are braced for a hard fight. Recent school board meetings have been crowded, rowdy affairs. At a demonstration last week at the state Capitol in Sacramento, 8,000 protesters carried balloons saying "Save Our Kids" and placards demanding "Schools, Not Prisons."
Among the protesters were four teachers from Bakersfield, with 80 years of experience among them. The morning before the demonstration, they visited Old Sacramento, a riverside reconstruction of a frontier town, complete with a one-room school with hand-pump and wood-burning stove. "It's better than what I've got right now," said Pam Baugher, who teaches fifth and sixth grade in a school where the pipes burst in December's freeze and have yet to be repaired.
Such tales of woe have grown more common as districts consider the new round of cuts.
In San Francisco, at least $25 million must be chopped from a $424.8 million budget, which may mean closing two schools, canceling interscholastic sports and shortening the junior high school day to five periods by eliminating elective courses. In Los Angeles, where the gap is $317 million in a $3.9 billion budget, more than 2,000 of its 30,200 teachers have received layoff notices, out of 10,000 sent statewide.
 
Less Help for Young Mothers
 The Fresno school district is considering trimming a program for teen-age mothers that provides child care so girls can continue in school. And in San Jose, it may be necessary to scale back bilingual education, despite the fact that the district's children speak 58 languages. Also at risk in San Jose is the bus transportation required by a court-ordered desgregation plan and a project to remove asbestos from school buildings.
In Santa Cruz, where $2 million must be pared from a $34 million budget, librarians, music teachers and counselors, already in short supply, will be cut further. Those with teaching credentials will move into classrooms, bumping teachers with less seniority.
Adrienne McGuire, a fourth-grade teacher with seven years of experience and a $25,000 salary, may be among the displaced. Ms. McGuire, who is pregnant with twins, received a layoff notice but will not know if it is final until the state budget is completed in June.
In the meantime, like many teachers here, Ms. McGuire reaches into her pocket to buy the supplies the school can no longer afford, at a cost of about $700 a year.

 Lately she has bought puzzles, batteries, magnets, a fish tank, a tape recorder, 50 pounds of clay and a half-dozen sheep brains for dissection. Along with the brains, Ms. McGuire bought rubber gloves, masks and barbecue skewers, in place of the real probes that she could not afford.
"It set me back a few bucks, but it was so neat," Ms. McGuire said. "You wouldn't not do it just because the school can't pay. All the research says that children have to touch things, and that's what gets eliminated."
Without music teachers, Zoli Torkos, a Bay View fourth grader who hated school until he started violin lessons, will no longer be learning the "Blue Danube." Without money for dropout prevention classes, eight junior high boys, many of them on probation, will be moved back into regular, overcrowded classrooms.
"It's a real smart move that Governor Wilson appropriated large amounts of money for the jail system because that's where these kids will end up," said Susan Toohey, who teaches the special class.
With fewer custodians in Santa Cruz, the broken public address system and the clogged drains at the Bay View Elementary School will not be fixed soon. With fewer counselors, an eighth grader at Branciforte Junior High who came looking for help this week after a beating by her father may find an empty office the next time it happens.
"Suppose I hadn't been available and she ran away?" said Curt Coleman, a counselor. "Suppose she stayed with her boyfriend and got pregnant or got a sexually transmitted disease? The cost to society is tremendous."

HEADLINE: Quick Steps Urged on Warming Threat

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
In a report that was welcomed by the White House and environmentalists, the National Academy of Sciences said today that the United States should act promptly to reduce the threat of global warming.
An academy panel recommended a variety of steps, including raising overall mileage standards for new automobiles to 32.5 miles per gallon from 27.5; increasing Federal support for mass transit and reforestation, and developing a new generation of safe and efficient nuclear power plants. The warming is feared as a result of the steady accumulation of waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide. 
 The steps necessary to address global warming have been a matter of fierce political contention between the Bush Administration and environmental groups. Even within the Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency has favored quicker action against global warming, which the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, has opposed.
The report from the academy, the leading independent source of scientific advice for the Government, seems intended as an adroit compromise between the various factions, and was praised on all sides.
 
Rudiments of National Policy
 Although its recommendations are somewhat general, they point the way to a broad-based national program for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. They lay down the rudiments of a national energy policy, which the Administration has long resisted.
William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, called the report "a step forward," although he said that he did not necessarily agree with everything in it and that his agency had not yet studied it in detail.
The study was commissioned by Congress, and many of its recommendations would require Congressional action.
A senior Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he was pleased the report had not recommended "draconian changes." He also praised the report's cautious stand on the uncertainties of global warming, its cost-benefit analysis, its refusal to propose target dates and quotas for reductions of carbon dioxide emissions, and the importance it places on eliminating another trapper of heat, chlorofluorocarbons.
Dr. D. Allan Bromley, the White House science adviser, said, "I am delighted with the report, as are all my colleagues in the White House." He said actions already taken by the Bush Administration would result in emission reductions on the order of those proposed by the academy.
The academy report "should put an end to the debate over whether it pays to act to slow global warming," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund. "It makes a prima facie case for acting now."
 
'A Nimble Policy'
 Even though the report does not set targets for reducing carbon dioxide, as environmental groups have long advocated, it was described as "a nimble policy" by a member of the panel, Dr. Jessica Tuchman Mathews, vice president of the World Resources Institute.
The panel said the prospect of global warming "poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses," even though it acknowledged that there was great uncertainty about its extent, timing and impact.
The panel said its proposed measures were all of "low cost," meaning they were cheap ways of reducing carbon dioxide and other waste gases. Low cost was defined as less than $10 per metric ton of heat-trapping gases eliminated per year. The panel did not calculate the total value of the initial investment.
The panel said the United States "should resume full participation" in international programs to slow population growth. Daniel J. Evans, the chairman of the panel, called population "the biggest single driver of atmospheric pollution." Mr. Evans, a Republican, is a former Governor and Senator from Washington.
The panel encouraged development and testing of a new generation of safe, efficient nuclear power plants to replace those that burn coal and oil. Its report did not go as far as many environmentalists have advocated in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, concluding that "options requiring great expenses are not justified" now.
Administration officials say steps already taken will allow overall emissions of "greenhouse" gases in the United States to stabilize in the next decade. But they argue that this is nevertheless consistent with the possible reduction of 10 to 40 percent that the academy said could be achieved if its measures were followed.
This is because the academy figure represents the reduction that would occur if all the measures were in effect now. By that measure, said Michael Deland, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the actions already taken by the Administration would amount to a 20 to 25 percent reduction.
The effects of any such measures do not suddenly materialize in one year, but rather come into play over a period of years, in which economic and population growth cause emissions to grow. This is not accounted for in the academy analysis, Mr. Deland said. Mr. Coppock, the director of the academy panel's staff, said that was true.
Environmentalists say the steps already taken by the Administration are not enough to achieve an absolute reduction in the greenhouse emissions in the United States, but would merely allow them to stabilize in the short term while resuming their growth in the long term.
They also assert that some of the important steps recommended by the academy have been specifically rejected by the Administration. Among them are the increase in gasoline mileage standards for new cars to 32.5 miles per gallon and stronger Federal support for mass transit.
Dr. Oppenheimer said the academy's recommendations "go a long way toward meeting the goal of keeping the climate from going haywire."
The panel did not propose target dates and quotas for carbon-dioxide reductions of the kind that some European countries have adopted and that some environmentalists have urged. Members said that was because rapidly changing knowledge about global warming and climate change was certain to render targets and quotas obsolete.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'The Academy's Call to Action'
 Declaring that "despite the great uncertainties, greenhouse warming is a potential threat sufficient to justify action now," the National Academy of Sciences called for these measures:
--Adopt nationwide energy-efficient building codes.
--Improve the efficiency of the U.S. automotive fleet through the use of an appropriate combination of regulation and tax incentives.
--Strengthen Federal and state support of mass transit.
--Improve appliance efficiency standards.
--Encourage public education and information programs for conservation and recycling.
--Reform state public utility regulation to encourage electrical utilities to promote efficiency and conservation.
--Sharply increase the emphasis on efficiency and conservation in the Federal energy research and development budget.
--Utilize Federal and state purchases of goods and services to demonstrate best-practice technologies and energy conservation programs. (Source: "Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming," National Academy of Sciences)

HEADLINE: Health Care Plan Falters In Massachusetts Slump

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The Massachusetts plan to guarantee health insurance for all, once hailed as a model for the nation, is faltering under the weight of a soured economy, a hostile new Governor and the fierce opposition of small-business owners, who would be required to pay for coverage of employees.
The pathbreaking plan was adopted in 1988, as Gov. Michael S. Dukakis promoted universal health care in his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and was to be phased in over several years. Major parts of it resemble proposals being considered in other states and Congress as the nation confronts spiraling health costs and widening gaps in the insurance system.
 
Governor Threatens Repeal
 The plan's centerpiece -- a requirement that businesses employing six or more workers offer them health insurance or pay the state to do it -- was originally scheduled to take effect next January. But it now seems unlikely to materialize for years, if ever. The new Governor, William F. Weld, a conservative Republican, has asked the state legislature to repeal it, calling the requirement "an obstacle rather than a vehicle for improved health benefits for all." 
 Here as elsewhere, nearly all larger companies offer health insurance but many small and low-wage businesses do not, leaving many workers and their families unprotected from the often startling costs of medical care. Society's poorest people receive public insurance through Medicaid, and it is the working poor who account for most of the uninsured.
Requiring employers to offer health insurance has been a commonly proposed answer. But the stalling of the Massachusetts plan shows how hard it will be to achieve consensus on redesign of the nation's health care system.
 
Fear of Negative Message
 Promoters of the employer requirement insist it is a sound approach being aborted by ideology and ignorance.
"It's distressing to me to see the message that wholesale repeal would send to other states," said State Representative John E. McDonough, a Boston Democrat who is a main supporter of the plan. "It's being killed not because of the design of the program but for political reasons, and because of a recession."
Opponents say that in the absence of other measures to control soaring medical and insurance costs, the plan would place crushing burdens on fragile businesses and a broke state government, and put the state's economy at a competitive disadvantage.
"Just mandating something doesn't make it work," said Charles Baker, the new Under Secretary for Health. "I'd rather try to get at the root causes of the problem through hospital financ- ing and the insurance system. We can try to lower the cost of insurance, and get more people into it that way."
Even proponents of the mandated employer benefits want a delay to let the recession ease, and the Democrat-controlled state legislature voted last month to postpone the requirement until 1994.
But Governor Weld, who took over from Mr. Dukakis in January, vetoed the delay and demanded repeal. Though consumer groups and unions are fighting to save the employer requirement, legislators say the political mood has shifted and the Governor has a good chance of having his way.
Parts of the 1988 plan are alive and well. Programs providing low-cost health insurance to the disabled and to temporarily unemployed workers and health centers for the poor, for example, have helped tens of thousands of people and will be continued.
"We feel good about what we have accomplished so far," said James Hooley, until recently head of the Department of Medical Security, the agency implementing the new plan.
The debate on the plan has galvanized Democrats, Republicans, and consumer and business groups alike to begin rewriting the insurance rules. Their goal, as outlined in the 1988 law, is to assure more stable, affordable policies for small companies. Under current practices, small firms often pay far more for insurance per person than large ones, and they are experiencing huge jumps in premiums and ever-greater restrictions on coverage.
But the far-reaching and controversial change in the 1988 law was the requirement that companies with six or more workers either offer health insurance or pay a tax of up to $1,680 per employee. The state would use the proceeds for bare-bones policies that would be offered to all uninsured workers, who would pay premiums linked to their incomes. The tax would rise with inflation. While some state subsidies would be required, employers and workers would be the main financers.
Only Hawaii, a small, insular state with a different social tradition, has required employers to offer health insurance.
Massachusetts has fewer uninsured people than most states -- an estimated 8 percent of residents, nearly half a million, as opposed to 13 percent of people nationwide.
Mr. Hooley, the former state official, said his experience had only reinforced his belief in the need for requiring employer payments.
"Our goal from the beginning was to work with business to encourage them to offer insurance voluntarily," Mr. Hooley said. "But you need that mandate out there as a statement. Our system of health insurance will never be universal unless you have something like this."
In the new economic and political climate, larger companies' support for the law has faded, and the owners of small businesses who long opposed it have intensified their attacks.
Restaurant owners have been among the most outspoken foes. Even those that already offer insurance argue that the mandate would impose intolerable costs on a labor-intensive industry with many low-paid workers.
Bob Shaughnessy, owner of The Other Place in Boylston, in central Massachusetts, said he offers to pay part of the cost of health insurance for his 32 employees -- 25 percent after six months of employment and up to 75 percent for long-time workers. Only six, all but one of them managers, have taken the offer, and his current annual outlay for insurance is $ l6,248, he said. Under the state mandate, he would have to pay $53,780 -- an amount that could bankrupt him, he said, or force him to raise prices steeply.
"I'm not against universal insurance," Mr. Shaughnessy said, "but this is not a fair way to fund it, and it should be done at a Federal level."
Less typically, perhaps, Chris Anslono, owner of Lynn Carburetor and Auto Service in Lynn, north of Boston, said he favored the 1988 plan. A fee of $1,680 per person, he said, would be less than the price of most insurance policies now offered to small groups, and he would be willing to pay such a fee to obtain coverage.
For now, Mr. Anslono and his three employees are benefiting from subsidized insurance offered through a small state pilot project. Previously he had been unable to find an affordable policy for employees, Mr. Anslomo said, making it hard to keep them. "I had trouble getting help," he recalled. "They all wanted to go to the big dealers because I just couldn't offer the benefits."
 
'More Ideological Than Rational'
 The law's proponents say that companies already offering insurance would actually benefit from the mandate because they are now, in effect, subsidizing companies not offering it. The hospital costs of uninsured patients in the state are paid through a 10 percent surtax on bills of insured patients -- bills paid, in the end, by companies through their premiums.
"The business opposition is more ideological than rational," said Robert Restuccia, director of Health Care for All, a consumer advocacy group in Boston.
But many business leaders doubt they would ever see financial gains. In any case, some privately say, the opposition is driven by a visceral distrust of government control.
Former Governor Dukakis, who spoke Tuesday by telephone from Hawaii, where he is lecturing on health care, said he still believes employer requirements are essential. "It's the right thing and the fair thing and it's in the interest of business as a whole," he said.
A threat to any plan for broader insurance is the spiral in medical costs, especially hospital costs. Alan Sager, an expert at the Boston University School of Public Health, argued that the 1988 law was destined for failure because it failed to couple universal access with meaningful cost controls.
No state by itself can have effective cost controls, Mr. Dukakis asserted. "The states are going to continue to struggle with these issues until we get leadership from Washington," he said.
Even as they struggle to save the 1988 plan, consumer groups are offering more sweeping proposals for change that they say would provide universal access while holding down costs. Mr. Restuccia's group has proposed financing all care through taxes, with strong cost controls. But in the meantime, he said, "We see the employer mandate as an important step forward."

HEADLINE: For Foreign Films, Vita Is No Longer Dolce

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 10

 BODY:
For a decade the Unifrance Film office here was the French Government's outpost in Hollywood, a tireless promoter of French films and film makers. This month, however, the French shut the office in favor of a much more modest effort based in the French consulate, thereby significantly scaling back their presence in a city that regards itself as the world movie capital.
The change was made, said Catherine Verret, head of the French film office in the United States, because it no longer made economic sense to maintain a separate operation here, "given the number of our films actually bought in Los Angeles." But in a large sense, the decision also symbolizes the difficulties and limited prospects foreign-language films encounter in the American market these days. 
 Though Americans spent $5.1 billion at the box office last year, foreign-language films accounted for no more than 1.5 percent of that figure. When in January the trade journal Variety published a list of the 60 most successful foreign-language films to be released in the United States, only one of the top 10 was made during the last decade: "Cinema Paradiso."
 
Young Audiences Turn Away
 The days when a foreign-language film like "La Dolce Vita" or "La Cage aux Folles" could earn $18 million at the box office and compete with home-grown offerings are long gone, many film distributors and exhibitors reluctantly conclude. And also gone is the notion that hip, educated young audiences can be relied on to provide traditional support for foreign-language films.
"For the most part, the young audience has been drifting away," said Steve Rothenberg, vice president of theatrical distribution at the Samuel Goldwyn Company, whose most recent foreign-language release is "La Femme Nikita." "There's a whole generation of college students that hasn't been weaned on top-notch foreign-language films the way people in the 60's and 70's were, and that affects the grossing potential of these films. It means you're not getting an audience that is between 18 and 50, but only one that is over 30."
The success of "La Femme Nikita," which has quickly become a favorite among young moviegoers since its release a month ago, is the exception that may prove the rule, film distributors and exhibitors said. Through special mailings and screenings for "young sophisticates" who frequent nightclubs, art galleries and fashion shows, Goldwyn has worked assiduously to build a word-of-mouth campaign around the film, an unsettling mixture of American violence and gloss, in the mode of "Total Recall" or "Die Hard," and French sentimentality and style.
 
Escapism in French
 "It's a pure escapist entertainment that happens to have been made in French," said Gary Meyer, executive vice president of Landmark Theaters, the country's largest theater chain specializing in foreign-language films. Most of the time, he added, "the under-30 crowd, which was our principal audience when we started this business 16 years ago, is much harder to pull in on a regular basis now," and as a result, "we have changed our programming and booking philosophy."
In some respects, never have so many foreign-language movies been so readily accessible to American audiences. On cable channels like Bravo, Cinemax and Arts & Entertainment, foreign movies have become a staple of programming, and even mom-and-pop video stores are now likely to carry prestige titles like "Manon of the Spring" or "My Life as a Dog."
But in first-run movie theaters, where film reputations are made or broken, it is a more complicated story. Since the mid-1980's, the centralization of theater ownership in the hands of a few giant national chains, often affiliated with Hollywood studios, has resulted in fewer and fewer films playing in more and more theaters at the same time, a situation that does not favor foreign-language films.
Hollywood studios, several of which operated "classics" divisions a decade ago in order to distribute and promote foreign-language films, have closed those divisions and largely abandoned the arena to much smaller independent distributors. Those companies may be enthusiastic about foreign-language films, but cannot afford to spend the average of $11.6 million per film that Hollywood studios spent on advertising and print costs last year.
"Most of them just don't have the money," said Gabriel Desdois, who has been buying and selling rights to French films in the United States since 1957.
Some of the multiplex theaters, especially those in urban areas, have been willing to reserve a screen for what are euphemistically called "specialty films." But distributors complain that the large chains have neither the patience nor the willingness to nurture a foreign-language film seen as a difficult sell, and in many cases quickly pull such movies in favor of a similar release or when quality English-language fare becomes available.
 
Hollywood's Own Versions
 Increasingly, Hollywood studios are also competing with foreign-language films by doing their own versions of hit European films. They may retain the original director and writer for the remake, but in order to appeal to a mass audience that would normally shun any movie with subtitles, they substitute American actors, locations and situations for the French, Spanish or Italian originals.
"A lot of studios have their people in Europe looking at these movies, in some cases securing the remake rights even before the movie itself has been sold," said Russell Schwartz of Miramax Films, a New York-based independent distributor whose recent releases include China's "Ju Dou," Germany's "Nasty Girl" and Spain's "Ay, Carmela!" "Disney in particular has really mined that."
Indeed, Walt Disney Studios' "Three Men and a Baby," based on the French film "Three Men and a Cradle," and its sequel, "Three Men and a Little Lady," have together earned more than $235 million at the box office. Disney has also scored hits with "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" and "Three Fugitives," and other studios have had success with "The Woman in Red" and "The Man With One Red Shoe," all based on French films.
 
More Remakes Planned
 Most recently, Warner Brothers has acquired remake rights to "La Femme Nikita," which many film industry executives think has the potential to be a big hit if the right actress can be found to play the glamorous assassin around whom the story revolves. No casting or shooting schedule has yet been announced, but Julia Roberts, Demi Moore and Debra Winger are rumored to be interested in the role.
In addition, Jane Fonda has acquired the rights to the Spanish director Pedro Almodovar's farce "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," which earned about $7.5 million in its original version. Also, Disney plans to redo the French-made "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," about the romance between a white executive and a black cleaning woman.
"I certainly would not say ours is a growth segment of the industry, and now we have the studios in our backyard," Mr. Schwartz said. "But I'm also not a doomsayer. It's a tricky thing, you have to be careful, you have to work harder, but foreign-language films can work and they are not going to disappear."

HEADLINE: Early Action Rescuing Troubled Families

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn.

 BODY:
THE turning point in Connie Neer's life, after a history of beatings, bouts of drinking and hitting bottom, came when she decided to fight to keep custody of her 2-year-old daughter, Nicole.
The state had already taken two older girls from Ms. Neer, 25, an admitted drug and alcohol abuser, before Nicole was born. A minor car accident last fall revealed she had violated her promise to the courts to remain sober. 
 But an agent of the state who showed up on her doorstep did not come to carry away Ms. Neer's youngest daughter. Instead, as part of a local program based on successes that are transforming the nature of social work across the nation, Ms. Neer agreed to meet with a family therapist in her home several days a week for a month.
The therapist was to be an advocate for the mother, not her keeper, giving pointers on how to manage her life successfully and to move her gently away from behavior that had caused her to drink and to neglect her children. For the first time in her life, Ms. Neer was taking lessons from an expert on how to be a responsible grown-up and parent.
Mother and child are reaping the benefits of a national movement in social work to cut through red tape by intervening directly inside troubled homes before children suffer serious neglect or abuse. The technique comes under the rubric of family preservation: the re-orienting of the child-welfare system to assist families in crisis before it is necessary to remove children from their homes.
"People are realizing that intensive intervention in the home at the first sign of a problem can dramatically improve family functioning," said Kristine E. Nelson, director of research at the University of Iowa's Family Resource Center on Family Based Services.
Advocates of this approach, now used in some 30 states, say it not only keeps families together but also reduces the burden on state budgets by producing huge savings for welfare agencies and the courts.
"The pace is accelerating because states have learned that intervention produces dramatic results," explained Peter W. Forsythe, vice president of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation of New York. "One of the most exciting things just becoming clear is its impact in urban centers of chronic neglect."
Others in the field say inner-city turmoil defies the best of intentions.
"The problems are so overwhelming in cities like New York and Chicago, especially as funding for social programs drop, that I sometimes walk away shaking my head," said Marcia Allen, director of Iowa's National Resource Center.
There are about a half-dozen intervention programs in the New York metropolitan area, and many more are planned if the current state budget is approved. New Jersey was a pioneer in financing the programs, but support has flagged because of budget problems.
The movement is a response to the view that child welfare agencies are losing the fight to address the best interests of abused children.
"With the breakdown of family life and divorce, substance abuse and unemployed parents dumping on their kids, we are seeing more abused children at a younger age and far sicker than abused kids 10 years ago," said Judy Allen, a program supervisor at the Connecticut Department of Children and Youth Services.
State agencies beleaguered by backlogged caseloads often took action only after a child was severely mistreated and had to be protected.
But removing children from homes did not guarantee a bright future. The quality of life in foster homes or state schools could be more emotionally damaging to children than the homes from which they were rescued, according to experts.
In intervention cases, parents agree to undergo counseling as a way to work out abuse problems before the state moves more aggressively against them. For the parents, it is a way to hold the authorities at bay and to keep a child they care for and want.
Although there are variations in the methods that are used, the underlying premise is that a caseworker can quickly identify problems and rectify them after observing a family at home for several hours a day, several times a week.
In some homes, the problem is communication. In others, it may be the division of household chores or the unsettling effects of the behavior of one member of the household.
The program in Connecticut, in a typical pattern, is run by private agencies paid by the state. Free of rigid office schedules and paperwork, caseworkers make themselves available any time family members need them.
If a parent's work schedule prevents daytime counseling, the caseworker will be there in the evenings or on weekends. If there is a crisis, he or she will respond in the middle of the night.
"It's very hard for public agencies to bend to these hours," said Susan Morton, program coordinator of the Child and Family Agency of Southeastern Connecticut, a private non-profit agency that handles the state referrals in a two-county area.
Intervention is also proving to be cost effective. Thomas P. Gullotta, chief executive officer of Ms. Morton's agency, said the cost of placing an abused child in foster care or a shelter and providing care by psychologists and specialists could be as high as $80,000 a year, as compared with only about $4,000 for intervention programs that prevent a family breakup.
Connecticut officials say the state program has been credited with preserving the homes of some two dozen children, including Ms. Neer's, in the first six months of operation.
Seated on a sofa in her apartment on a bluff above the Thames River, Ms. Neer spoke of the dark days in her life.
"I was sexually abused constantly in my childhood," she said. She had her first drink at 11 and was an alcoholic by 16, a year before giving birth to her first child.
By 20, she said, she was smoking crack and living with a man "who would punch me and kick me when I was pregnant."
Ms. Neer said she did not strike her children when she was drunk, but ignored them. Her behavior attracted attention, and eventually the custody of her two older daughters -- now 6 and 8 -- was given to her mother in another city, Ms. Neer said.
She was ordered to attend alcohol and drug abuse programs and said she was getting her life back on track until the accident last autumn alerted the authorities that she was drinking again. To keep Nicole, she reluctantly agreed to participate in the intervention program.
"My attitude at the time was it was going to be a hassle to let some social worker practically move into my home, but I figured I'd do it to keep everyone off my back," she recalled.
Into her life walked Mary Cay Whewel, a therapist from Mr. Gullotta's agency whose first goal was to win Ms. Neer's confidence.
At first, there were long discussions around the kitchen table on household budgets and ways Ms. Neer could continue working while attending night school.
"It was awkward at first," Ms. Neer said. "But after the first week I discovered it was nice having someone smart to talk to and learn from but who wasn't bossing me around."
Soilo Arroyo, Ms. Neer's 22-year-old fiance, said he also benefited from the caseworker's advice.
"Pretty soon she helped us bring out things we were hiding in ourselves about Connie's past mistakes that limited our relationship," he said.
After four weeks, Ms. Whewel moved on to other clients. Ms. Neer, fortified by a new confidence, says she has not had a drink since the accident and hopes one day to get her older daughters back.
In Higganum, 30 miles north of New London, Franklin and Barbara Bruce await the day that their son Arthur, 13, will be permitted to return home.
He was placed in a state school last fall after neighbors reported seeing his father strike him with a cane, and intervention was arranged to protect the family's three other children.
Lorraine Plante, who was given permission by the Bruces to discuss their case, said that they were typical of intervention families "who have trouble making things work in their lives and who handle every conflict by yelling or striking out."
"But in its own way this family is bonded," she said. "They love each other."
She has met with them on weekends, when Arthur visits, to work on communication skills. The Bruces say they are hopeful Arthur will be home this summer -- for good.

Mr. Cuomo's Board Walk

 BODY:
In 1976, a newcomer to New York State government named Mario Cuomo served on a panel that urged major pruning of the do-little boards and commissions that provide patronage for the Governor and the Legislature.
Now, in his ninth year as Governor, Mr. Cuomo has rediscovered his reformer's passion. Seeking to close a huge deficit, he proposes with new conviction to eliminate dozens of boards and commissions and their superfluous or overpaid positions. Even so, his hit list is far too short. 
 It overlooks, for example, one padded agency cited in the 1976 report: the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, whose five supposedly full-time members could well be replaced by one full-time chairman with other members serving part time.
The top-heavy Workers Compensation Board and the Racing and Wagering Board, both missing from the list, also seem choice targets. So does the Labor Relations Board, whose members earn a generous $65,702 a year for part-time work. The Governor plans to merge this board with the three-member Mediation Board, but he would eliminate only one of the six full-time board members.
With the budget in dire straits, is this really enough?

HEADLINE: Bring Germany Into New World Order

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Bonn correspondent refers to "suggestions being made in Bonn that the Government renege on its pledge of $11 billion to help defray the costs of the gulf war" (news article, March 22), presumably because the United States is seen as seeking far more than the actual cost.
The German attitude to the Soviet Union is somewhat different. Large sums were paid for Soviet concessions on matters of German national interest -- ultimately serving United States interests as well. This included 5 billion marks in aid, an incentive for Soviet acceptance of a unified Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and 12 billion marks as a grant for troop withdrawals and housing for them in the Soviet Union. There was a 3 billion mark interest-free credit and also nearly one billion marks raised privately by Germans as charity for the Soviets. 
 Bonn is not making an issue of 1.2 billion marks the Soviets owe German companies. Yet now Moscow is dragging out the troop withdrawals and demanding further payments. It is not clear what German opposition there is to this apparent extortion.
But generosity is not the issue, and the Germans are free to decide who their friends are. More important, the unseemly haggling over the German (and Japanese) contribution to the Persian Gulf action suggests a missing link in the new world order. Germany and Japan should be brought into the United Nations Security Council as permanent members. Their absence is due solely to their defeat in World War II. Their development and economic weight entitle them to rank with the major powers responsible for world order.
Contrary to Lenin, a defeated adversary is not to remain defeated forever, and a new world order would surely benefit for admitting these nations to responsibility. Their inclusion may provide an impulse for amending their constitutions to accord with their status in the international community.

Joule Division Names Chief Operating Officer

 BODY:
Mary Ann Pope has been named chief operating officer of the temporaries division of Joule Inc., a regional temporary services company in Edison, N.J.
Mrs. Pope, who is 51, joined Joule this week after a 20-year career with Olsten Services, a national temporary services concern based in Westbury, L.I. At Olsten, Mrs. Pope rose from payroll clerk to office manager to head of the company's operations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
 She moved to Tampa, Fla., in 1986 to oversee the company's Florida operations, but left last fall and moved to Cherry Hill, N.J., to be closer to her four sons and two daughters, aged 20 to 28, who are scattered across New Jersey and New York.
Mrs. Pope said that because she was raising six children she never expected to work outside her home. But in 1970, her husband, Antonio, a businessman, became ill and Mrs. Pope went to work to support her family.
At the same time, Mrs. Pope, who graduated from Blessed Sacrament High School in Newark in 1958, enrolled in classes at Montclair State College in Montclair, N.J.
"You just do what you have to do," she said. "I had tremendous support within the family. And I liked what I was doing."
Mrs. Pope began working as a consultant for Joule in February and said she looked forward to playing a senior management role at the company, which had sales of $36 million last year. She said the recession and the layoffs that have accompanied it should increase demand for the concern's temporary employees.
"Companies still have to provide their services," Mrs. Pope said. "And they use temporaries because they don't have to make commitments to them. It's extremely cost-efficient. You can shut it off, just like the water."

HEADLINE: WASHINGTON TALK;
An Oddity In a City That Seeks Publicity

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
In this city of publicity hogs and monstrous egos, Nicholas F. Brady is an oddity. The Treasury Secretary is so diffident, so uncomfortable in the limelight, so averse to making news that his influence in the Government is difficult to assess.
He has had some real accomplishments. Early on, he engineered passage of legislation to deal with the savings and loan mess. His plan to cut the debt of third-world countries has generally worked. He got Robert L. Clarke reappointed as comptroller of the currency over the objection of John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff. He negotiated generous contributions from Japan and Germany to the Persian Gulf war effort. And early this year he presented Congress with a comprehensive plan to revamp the nation's anachronistic banking laws. 
 But he has been so careful to wipe away his fingerprints that he has received little credit, and he has been widely portrayed in the press as a lightweight. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, wondered in a front-page profile in January whether Mr. Brady was "up to the task," and said that under his leadership the Treasury had often "seemed asleep at the switch."
Fred Barnes of The New Republic may have put his finger on the Treasury Secretary's bad press in an article in The International Economy magazine. "Brady," Mr. Barnes wrote, "is simply not a Washington person."
Certainly not like James A. Baker 3d. When Mr. Baker was Treasury Secretary in Ronald Reagan's second term, reporters followed him almost everywhere, much as they do now that he is Secretary of State. Mr. Baker operates masterfully. His quotes enliven broadcasts and fit neatly into the third paragraph of news articles. His staff is adroit at the kind of leaks that make the boss look good.
That may explain why Mr. Baker received most of the credit for the enactment of tax reform in 1986 and for the rapprochement between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It may also explain why Mr. Baker has largely escaped blame for the savings and loan disaster, which happened on his watch at the Treasury, and for his State Department's miscalculation of Saddam Hussein's threat to Kuwait.
By contrast, Mr. Brady has little use for the press. When he left Tuesday for a 10-day trip to Europe and the Middle East, a trip billed as an examination of what is needed to get the world's economy back on a growth path, nary a reporter was on his plane. He has never made news on a foreign trip before, and no one expects him to do so this time.
Until he came to Washington, Mr. Brady had spent his adult life on Wall Street as an investment banker with Dillon, Read & Company. He made his living cutting back-room deals that would have fallen apart if word had seeped out, his staff says, so he is naturally mistrustful of reporters.
He gives a terrible interview. Normally relaxed and charming, Mr. Brady tenses up when the tape recorder goes on. At the beginning of an interview last month, a reporter tried a new tack and threw him the softest of lobs. Was there anything, the reporter asked, the Secretary would like to talk about? No, Mr. Brady responded, looking at his watch. Let's get the questions over with.
On Tuesday, just hours before he left for Europe, his staff persuaded him to call reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post to his office to promote his trip.
He was like a circus barker with laryngitis. He said absolutely nothing controversial, or even insightful. Then he asked that the entire session be "off the record" or "on background," meaning he could not be quoted. But neither reporter had anything to write, and Mr. Brady left town without fanfare.
At a news conference in Houston last weekend, Mr. Bush joked that he was happy for the third-world debt strategy to be called the Brady Plan while its success was still in doubt, but that now it should be called the Bush Plan.
That's fine with Mr. Brady. He insists that he is fundamentally a staff man, that his only goal is to serve his friend, George Bush, and that he will be recorded favorably in the history books as long as Mr. Bush is a successful President.
And his ambitions beyond that? "I'm not running for anything but the city limits," he says.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Drop by 70,000

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters)

 BODY:
The number of new unemployment insurance claims dropped by 70,000 in late March after soaring to the highest level in more than eight years, the Labor Department said today. But analysts cautioned that the drop might not be a sign the nation's jobless situation was stabilizing.
New applications for unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 473,000 in the week ended March 30, compared with 543,000 the week before. 
 People actually receiving benefits under regular state in the week ended march 23, the latest period for which the figure was available. That was a decrease of 97,000 from the previous week's seasonally adjusted revised level.
The last week in March included Good Friday, which could have reduced the number of people filing claims and could be a reason for the decline, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Curb Deadly High-Tech Trade

 BODY:
The Bush Administration routinely approved sales of U.S. arms-related high technology to Iraq right up to the time that the Iraqi Army marched into Kuwait. Now that its own Under Secretary of Commerce has expressed second thoughts about that shortsighted practice, how does the White House respond? It tries to fire him, only to learn he's already resigned.
What's really needed from the White House is a frank acknowledgment of past mistakes and a tougher policy to control sales of advanced technology that can be put to military use. That policy won't be easy to devise, given the economic incentives to promote exports. But it won't work at all unless President Bush takes the lead. 
 The Commerce Department official who irked the White House, Dennis E. Kloske, told a Congressional hearing Monday that he tried to "tie up all sales in red tape" last April after Saddam Hussein threatened to destroy Israel with chemically armed missiles if it attacked Iraqi weapons plants. He blamed the State Department for "choosing instead to advocate the maintenance of diplomatic relations with Iraq" by continuing sales.
But Mr. Kloske's own office is just as blameworthy for vigorously promoting high-tech exports to Iraq. Between 1985 and 1990 it approved 771 licenses to export $1.5 billion worth of computers, chemicals and communications gear that Iraq could put to military as well as civilian use. In 1989 Iraq bought command-and-control equipment that U.S. planes targeted two years later.
That's why licensing decisions can't be left up to the Commerce Department without strengthening the hand of other agencies in setting policy.
Export of technology with both civilian and military applications poses an exceptionally tough problem for arms control. For instance, krytrons, which can be put to innocent use in ordinary office copiers, are also well designed for triggering nuclear weapons.
To ascertain what use an importing country intends to make of krytrons takes knowledge of what other weapons components it has been buying and from whom. Intelligence-sharing among supplier states is thus essential to controlling sales.
The global diffusion of technology makes it impossible for the U.S. to bar sales on its own. A unilateral embargo is more likely to harm U.S. industry than to slow the spread of weapons. Foreign manufacturers, a recent National Academy of Sciences study found, often buy technology elsewhere to avoid U.S. controls on re-exporting.
Technology is advancing so rapidly, and spreading so widely, that it would be impossible to embargo every potentially dangerous item. Unless arms controllers concentrate on building higher fences around fewer technologies, they'll be overwhelmed.
Mr. Kloske's self-serving testimony suggests that there's plenty of bureaucratic blame to share for transferring arms-related technology to Saddam Hussein. But preventing another dangerous dictator from getting his hands on deadly technologies requires a new policy that gives priority to leaving new orders unfilled.

HEADLINE: Central Europe's Central Need

BYLINE: By William H. Luers; William H. Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

 BODY:
To head off further deterioration in Central Europe, beset by fragmenting ethnic nationalism and collapsing economies, the industrial democracies must help provide the region with a new political structure. The West and Japan should not become so mesmerized by Soviet disorder that they fail to contribute to the democratic development of Central Europe and the Balkans.
Tensions are so rife that Eastern European political leaders and intellectuals will meet in Prague this weekend to ponder a response to them. They will be mindful of the murder of Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, who ran Germany's office responsible for liquidating some 8,000 companies in eastern Germany. 
 The Soviet Union's lurch backward toward a more conservative, controlled system threatens Central Europe. And while the Warsaw Pact is dead, the troublemaking potential of the Soviet police and Communist network in the region isn't.
What can the West do? Economic assistance, partly motivated by a desire to retard large-scale migration to Western Europe, is growing. Private investment is barely beginning. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is being installed. But Westerners are showing impatience with the slow pace of change while Eastern European leaders cry out for closer, more structured ties to the West.
Membership in the European Community and NATO is out of reach for any of the nations in the next decade. Membership in the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Council of Europe is not sufficient to give them a true sense of belonging, nor enough to provide the security and incentives needed to save themselves from a spiral into chaos.
The Europeanwide structure, the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, suggested as the vehicle for incorporating these new states into Europe won't work.
Western Europe want to keep the 12-member European Community exclusive. NATO cannot help: Its military strength makes it attractive to the new, insecure Central Europe but frightens the weakened Soviet Union. Germany could help but, going through troubling changes, is preoccupied with its own agenda.
The U.S., with Germany, should encourage Western Europe to build a new political and economic organization to nurture the emergence of the new democracies. It would be underwritten by NATO and the European Community but offer looser criteria for admission, and covenants that reduced any implied threat to Moscow.
This organization, with industrial democracies as full members, would be open to all Central European countries that reached certain thresholds in democratic institutions and market economies. It would stress regional cooperation and concentrate on economic and political development. It would seek to enlarge significantly public and private funds directed to the region. It would be designed to discourage local conflicts and head off Balkanization. And it would include a collective-security component in which the Central European members would provide the defensive military force. NATO's role would remain ambiguous but implied.
The key obstacles to such an enterprise would be Western European indifference and resistance to yet another European organization, Central European enmities and Soviet fears.
U.S. and German leadership could overcome Western indifference and resistance and diminish Central Europeans' fear of German dominance. Central European enmities could be subdued if the political and economic benefits to regional cooperation were substantial enough.
Overcoming Soviet fear that this new grouping would extend NATO to the Soviet borders would be the most formidable obstacle. The Soviets should appreciate that stability in Central Europe is in their interest.
The new organization need not involve a huge bureaucracy. But it must be committed to building democracy and economic stability in this cauldron of some of modern history's most violent wars.

HEADLINE: Rights and Economy Aren't Separate Issues

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is unfortunate that in "Rights Movement in Struggle for an Image as Well as a Bill," your April 3 front-page article about renewed efforts for the civil-rights legislation that was vetoed last fall by President Bush, you treat the civil-rights movement as if it were a monolithic entity struggling to define itself.
Today's civil-rights movement is, as it has always been, a multifaceted coalition of organizations, each of which concentrates on different aspects of the effort to achieve parity for African-Americans. 
 Thus, the National Urban League strongly supports the civil-rights bill so urgently needed to repeal Supreme Court decisions that make it easier for employers to discriminate. But the bulk of our advocacy and our service programs focuses on two areas critical to minority Americans and the poor: education and career development, and employment and training.
Those who accuse civil-rights groups of ignoring the crucial economic problems of African-Americans or who condemn them for not transcending black concerns, conveniently choose to ignore the National Urban League's Urban Marshall Plan proposal.
The Urban Marshall Plan calls for investments in this country's human and physical infrastructure to benefit all of the disadvantaged and lay the groundwork for United States economic resurgence.
We object to articles that misinform the public into believing that civil rights and social problems represent an either/or choice for the civil-rights movement. Both need to be pursued, and both are being vigorously pursued.

 BODY:
RUDY PERPICH, former Governor of Minnesota, says he is considering an offer to become Minister of Foreign Relations in the Yugoslav republic of Croatia.
Mr. Perpich, speaking by telephone from Yugoslavia on Wednesday, told a Minneapolis radio station that "I really see many more walls that have to come down, especially in this part of the world." 
 Croatia, which elected a non-Communist government last year, wants greater sovereignty and a free-market economy with Western help.
Mr. Perpich, who is of Croatian descent and speaks the language, was offered the job by FRANJO TUDJMAN, the President of Croatia, who visited Minnesota last fall, an aide to Mr. Perpich said.

HEADLINE: Bush Aide Sees Recovery Soon

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
The chief White House economic adviser, Michael Boskin, said today that the economic recovery had not yet started but that certain precursors had been seen that precede a recovery by two to five months.
Interviewed on NBC television's "Today" program, Mr. Boskin said the recovery should begin in the next few months. 
 "First, we will see the economy stabilize, stop contracting," he said. "We'll see some mixed signals for a few months. Then in the second half of the year we will probably see the economy growing in the 2 to 3 percent range at an annual rate."
Mr. Boskin said precursors of a recovery were present, including lower interest rates, a growth in the money supply, lean inventories and rebounding consumer confidence.
"All of these are good signs and generally precede a turnaround by a period of from two to four to five months, usually," he said. "I must emphasize that the recovery has not started yet. These are preconditions."
Mr. Boskin said the Federal Reserve Board had begun to ease monetary policy more aggressively, but said there was room for interest rates to fall.
"We do believe there is ample room, as conditions warrant, for rates to fall further," he said, adding that this should be true unless inflation, which seems quiet now, is worse or if the recovery is faster than expected.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Subaru Puts $60 Million Account in Review

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
EDWARD VICK, who became the president and chief executive of Levine, Huntley, Vick & Beaver just two months ago, is facing his first big test: Subaru of America, the agency's biggest client, said yesterday that it had put its $60 million account into review.
Fred Heiler, a Subaru spokesman, said the company was not specifically dissatisfied with Levine, Huntley's work but wanted to talk to other agencies to make sure it was getting the best work available. 
 Executives at Subaru and Levine, Huntley said the Japanese car maker had been considering switching agencies since late last year. It began to think about new marketing strategies after it was acquired by Fuji Heavy Industries in 1990.
Last year, Subaru's sales were somewhat disappointing, but in the first quarter of this year the company gained sales and market share despite the economic slowdown. For January through March, its share of the United States market rose to nine-tenths of 1 percent from seven-tenths of 1 percent, and for March it soared to 1.4 percent. The improvement is due mainly to the Legacy sedan, Subaru's new compact, which ranges in price from $12,600 to almost $20,000. Legacy sales rose to more than 11,000 in the first quarter, from fewer than 4,000 in the period a year ago.
Mr. Vick was brought in to replace Robert Schmidt, the former chairman of Levine, Huntley who abruptly left in January. Mr. Schmidt had close ties to Subaru, which has been the agency's client for 16 years.
Mr. Vick was considered an ideal replacement by many in the industry because he had worked with BMW while he was an executive at Ammirati & Puris during the 1980's. "Subaru needs to be repositioned so it will be on more people's shopping lists," Mr. Vick said. "I see us as a new agency that has a new point of view on the car."
Subaru, which had been marketed as a reliable car, now wants to position itself so it will be attractive to more affluent car buyers, executives at Subaru and the agency said.
Previous commercials for Subaru have taken a humorous approach, demonstrating the car's solid, no-nonsense construction. One spot showed a young man racing over a rainy road littered with obstructions like fallen trees, to reach a young woman's house before her parents return home.
Mr. Heiler would not say what agencies Subaru was considering. The initial list is likely to be long, because an account this size will set off a free-for-all among scores of agencies hungry for business. Because of its high visibilty, a national car account is prized by small and midsize agencies trying to make names for themselves.
Some agency executives speculated that the most likely candidates for the short list of finalists would be Bloom FCA; Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss; TBWA Advertising, and Altschiller Reitzfeld Tracy-Locke.
Subaru has hired Ernst-Van Praag, a New York consulting firm, to help it find an agency.
Levine, Huntley will also be included in the review, but the agency's chances of winning are probably slim. An incumbent rarely wins in reviews because the client is already dissatisfied enough to start looking elsewhere.
What is more, Levine, Huntley has already been given a second chance. Subaru agreed to delay the review, giving Mr. Vick and the agency an opportunity to come up with fresh ideas.
The agency presented those ideas earlier this week. And, although neither the agency nor client would discuss the outcome of that meeting, it seems clear that Subaru was not impressed.
Still, Mr. Vick said his agency had a good shot at keeping Subaru. He recently hired Tom Benghauser, an advertising executive who has worked on a number of auto accounts, to take charge of the Subaru business. In addition, Mr. Vick said he had restructured the top management at the agency. Now, the executives who work the most closely with clients report directly to him.

Dollar Declines Worldwide On Sales and Price Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar headed steadily lower on world markets yesterday as investors continued to view the climate as favorable for lower United States interest rates.
Gold prices also declined. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $362.90 an ounce, off $1.50. The Republic National Bank said gold had declined $1.20 an ounce, to $361.90. 
 The selloff in the dollar was touched off by drops in the retail sales figures and the Producer Price Index. Traders said the data might encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Such an action is historically bearish for the United States currency because lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable to investors.
 
Short-Term Speculation
 The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, which measures the prices of finished goods before they reach the consumer, fell three-tenths of a percent in March, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. The figure was in line with expectations.
But the Commerce Department separately reported a greater-than-expected decline in retail sales, which dropped eigth-tenths of a percent last month,
The reports spurred "short-term speculation of the possibility of lower interest rates," said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at the Refco Group in Chicago.
The dollar declined in Europe, and the selling continued when trading shifted to domestic markets. "The dollar gradually wound lower, finishing the session at the bottom of its trading range," said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the consulting firm IDEA.
Despite the decline in producer prices, the underlying inflation rate, which excludes energy and food costs, rose two-tenths of a percent, half of the February gain. While economists view the advance in the underlying rate as moderate, Mr. Chandler said it tended to lag and might encourage the Fed to keep rates at current levels.
Dealers said much activity centered on trading in the Japanese yen and the German mark, which continued to be under pressure from the economic toll of unification.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 136.65 yen, from 137.20 yen on Wednesday. Later in London it fell to 135.90 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 136.20 yen, down from 137.43 on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7905, from $1.7800 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.7904 to buy a pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.7760.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6705 German marks, down from 1.6800; 1.4118 Swiss francs, down from 1.4295; 5.6485 French francs, down from 5.6815; 1,239.75 Italian lire, down from 1,246.00, and 1.1506 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1513.

HEADLINE: J. P. Morgan Has a Surge In Earnings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
J. P. Morgan & Company said yesterday that profits after one-time items were excluded rose 61.5 percent in the first quarter, mostly because of strong gains in foreign exchange and bond trading.
The company had net income of $273 million in the quarter. Last year it had net income of $399 million in the quarter, but that figure included a $230 million gain from an accounting change. 
 Morgan, the country's fourth-largest banking company, avoided the losses on bad loans that have badly hurt other banking companies recently. Loans to commercial real estate projects and highly indebted companies -- two areas in which other banks grew rapidly in the 1980's and are now suffering heavy losses -- were much less prominent at Morgan. Its losses on all kinds of lending have been minimal.
 
Better Than Expected
 Morgan earned $1.40 a share, up from 86 cents, excluding the effect of the accounting change that had added $1.23 a share in the first quarter of 1990. First-quarter profits were about 40 percent higher than analysts had expected, and Morgan's stock rose sharply, to its highest level of the year. The stock closed yesterday at $50.625, up $3.25.
The $461 million in gross earnings from all kinds of trading at Morgan was the largest ever for any bank in a single quarter. Gross earnings from foreign exchange trading were $109 million, up 49.3 percent from a year earlier. Other trading profits, particularly from bond trading and interest-rate and other swaps, rose 151.4 percent, to $352 million.
Morgan set aside only $10 million to its reserve for bad loans, while its holdings of delinquent or other troubled loans excluding loans to third world countries, fell to $269 million from $295 million at the end of the year. Both the amount added to the reserve and the level of troubled loans are small fractions of the levels at other banking companies, which have fewer loans.
 
Problems at Other Banks
 For example, Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I., said yesterday that its troubled loans and holdings of real estate acquired in foreclosure increased by about $65 million, to $1.45 billion, in the first quarter. Among its five New England banking units, Fleet Norstar said, the greatest increase in troubled loans occurred at its banks in New York, rather than in New England, where problems were most severe in 1990.
Over all, Fleet said it expected to earn $25 million to $26 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $98 million a year earlier. The company will announce complete results next week.
The Bank of New York Company earlier this week announced a $254 million increase in delinquent and other troubled loans, to $1.85 billion. Because of the rise in bad loans, and the need to add $343 million to its reserve for bad loans, Bank of New York lost $63 million in the first quarter.
Raphael Soifer, a banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman, noted that while other large banks were still coping with increases in their bad loans, Morgan was well positioned to gain some business.
Although Morgan has pushed development of its trading and financial advisory services and reduced emphasis on corporate lending over the last decade, it noted in its 1990 annual report that "good lending opportunities have resurfaced."
One sign of those opportunities, analysts said, was the increase in its holdings of loans to highly indebted companies to $2.2 billion, from $1.9 billion at the end of the year. Many other banking companies have been trying to reduce their holdings of such loans.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Strong Profits Are Reported At Intel and Advanced Micro

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 11

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reported unexpectedly strong first-quarter results today. They attributed the results to strong demand for microprocessors, the computers-on-a-chip that are the brains of personal computers, as well as some larger machines.
"We are delighted with this performance, given the current turbulence in the economy and in our industry," said Andrew S. Grove, Intel's president and chief executive. All Intel products exceeded order and shipment goals, he said. 
 One sign of the turbulence in the industry was the International Business Machines Corporation's announcement a few weeks ago that first-quarter results would total about half the company's profit a year ago. The disclosure stunned Wall Street, delaying trading in I.B.M. shares for 90 minutes because of an order imbalance.
Indeed, analysts said yesterday that Intel's results seemingly belied the downturn affecting the economy and most of the personal computer business. One possible explanation is that the jump in sales represents Taiwan and Hong Kong clone makers who are only now beginning to get volume shipments of the 386 chip, which had gone to larger customers.
"The rate at which Intel is growing its microprocessor business does not seem consistent with what we are seeing in the overall PC market," said Rajiv Chaudri, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York. "My suspicion is you are seeing a product cycle ramp that will probably run out of steam in another three to four months. The other explanation is that we are all very wrong about the strength of the PC market."
During the quarter, Advanced Micro began volume shipments of its long-awaited AM386 chip. A clone of Intel's 386, the Advanced Micro product breaks Intel's monopoly on the chip at the heart of I.B.M.'s powerful personal computers and compatibles.
At the same time, Intel's 386 and 486 microprocessors are moving to more mainstream use, increasing sales. Next week, Intel is expected to introduce a lower-cost version of the 486, its top microprocessor, which is expected to further spur demand.
Many analysts increased their earnings estimates today for the companies. Intel's shares rose $4.50 each, to $52, in over-the-counter trading. Advance Micro's stock gained $1, to $12.625 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the quarter, Intel reported earnings of $197.4 million, or 95 cents a share, up 37 percent from $143.7 million, or 73 cents a share, for the comparable period a year ago. Its revenues rose 27 percent, to $1.13 billion from $894.4 million.
Largely on the strength of its 386 clone and other new products, Advanced Micro returned to profitability in the quarter after a $45.6 million loss in its fourth quarter. The company's earnings totaled $4.2 million, or 2 cents a share, down sharply from $13.1 million, or 13 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago. Its sales grew slightly, to $274.3 million from $271.4 million.
"A.M.D.'s plan for returning to solid profitability in the current quarter is on target," said W. J. Sanders 3d, Advanced Micro's chairman and chief executive. "Cost-containment measures implemented in the past two quarters are contributing significantly to improved operating results."
At more than $10 million, shipments of the AM386 chip exceeded the company's expectations, and it is increasing production rapidly, Mr. Sanders said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Investigators Tell of Abuses In Sale of Nursing Home Insurance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Investigators from the General Accounting Office told Congress today that they had found numerous abuses in the sale of private insurance intended to cover the high costs of nursing home care for elderly people.
The testimony laid a foundation for Congressional efforts to set minimum standards for such insurance, perhaps as early as this year, even though insurance executives insisted there was no need for Federal regulation. 
 The Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, Richard P. Kusserow, seemed to lend support to the call for minimum Federal standards. He reported that only 17 states had adopted all the standards recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an organization of state officials, for the regulation of long-term care insurance policies.
The market for nursing home insurance is booming, as people try to protect themselves from the ruinous costs of long-term care. Nursing homes charge residents an average of $68.50 a day, or $25,000 a year, and in big cities the annual cost often exceeds $40,000. The Reagan and Bush Administrations have encouraged the development of a market for private insurance to cover such costs, hoping that it would reduce the demand for an expensive new Federal program.
 
Pitfalls for Elderly
 Nearly two million people now have private insurance to help pay for long-term care. The number of people with such policies has more than doubled in the last three years and is sure to grow as the elderly population increases.
At a Congressional hearing, Janet L. Shikles, director of health financing and policy issues at the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, testified today that purchasers of long-term care insurance faced "unpredictable premium increases." In addition, she said, they had little or no protection against inflation in the cost of such care, had difficulty getting the benefits to which they were entitled and might lose their entire investment if they missed a premium payment after 20 years.
Aggressive sales agents have sold policies to consumers who do not need them, including low-income people who may be eligible for Medicaid, she said at the hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. In California, she reported, agents sold an elderly man 16 different health insurance policies over four years, half of them with nursing home coverage.
Representative Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, both Democrats, said they would soon introduce legislation to protect consumers by setting minimum Federal standards for long-term care insurance. Such insurance covers nursing home bills and may also help pay for health-care services provided to elderly people who live at home.
Last year, Congress set tough new Federal standards for private health insurance that fills the gaps in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Mr. Wyden said that as the Federal Government tightened standards for such Medigap coverage of hospital and doctor bills, unscrupulous insurers were shifting their attention to the market for coverage of nursing home care.
Senator Pryor said the Inspector General's findings suggested that many purchasers of long-term care insurance remained "extremely vulnerable." Mr. Kusserow, the Inspector General, reported that "only nine states were able to provide data on administrative and enforcement actions" against companies and agents selling insurance for long-term care.
Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who is chairman of the health subcommittee, predicted that Congress would soon set minimum standards for such insurance, just as it did for Medigap insurance last year, because states are not moving fast enough to prevent abuses.
Spokesmen for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and for the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents more than 300 companies, testified against Federal standards, saying they would stifle development of the market for long-term care insurance.
Mary Nell Lehnhard, vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, warned that if the Government required insurers to provide too many benefits, policies would become so expensive that people would not be able to afford them. Protection against inflation is particularly expensive, she said.
But Joshua M. Wiener, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization, testified that without such protection, "the buying power of most policies erodes dramatically over time." The erosion is significant because there may be an interval of 20 or 30 years from the time a person buys a policy until the time it is used.
The average age of people admitted to nursing homes is 80, and the average age of people buying insurance for long-term care is 70, Mr. Wiener said. Insurers are encouraging people to buy such policies at younger ages, in their 40's or 50's, so the premiums will be adequate to cover later costs.
Policies now on the market typically pay $50 to $100 a day for nursing home care. The average premium rises with the buyer's age: $505 a year for a person who is 50 years old, $1,055 for a person who is 65 and $3,815 at age 79.
Gail E. Shearer, manager of policy analysis at Consumers Union, testified that "the private long-term care insurance market is not serving consumers very well," and she appealed to Congress to set minimum national standards. In the absence of uniform definitions for such terms as "skilled nursing care" and "medically necessary," it is virtually impossible to compare policies, she said.
 
Reluctance to Send Copies
 Ms. Shikles, from the General Accounting Office, said that consumers often had difficulty getting insurance companies to provide copies of the long-term care policies they were selling. "If you call them on the phone, they don't want to send you the policy they send to agents," she testified. "They send you marketing material, but not the policy." Another problem, Ms. Shikles said, is that most insurers do not offer any refund or partial benefits to people who discontinue their policies.

HEADLINE: Congress Still Uneasy on Cambodia

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
The Administration's freeze on aid to the non-Communist guerrillas fighting in coalition with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia has dampened but not silenced Congressional criticism of the United States role in Cambodia.
Washington announced the suspension of at least $7 million in aid to the non-Communists on Wednesday because officials had found evidence that the rebels violated a Congressionally mandated restriction against battlefield coordination with the Khmer Rouge. The Chinese-supported force has been held responsible for more than a million deaths from killings and starvation when it held power in the 1970's. 
 In a hearing of the Senate subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs today, several Senators continued to express criticism of a peace process backed by the Administration that allows the Khmer Rouge to take part in a Supreme National Council that would help the United Nations and Government oversee proposed elections. But the sparks and harsh confrontation that characterized the hearings on Cambodia last year were absent.
Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska and a leading critic of the Administration's policy, appeared to express the tone of his colleagues' opinions when he said, "I do not doubt the wisdom of cutting off aid." But he added that the Administration should lift its trade embargo on Cambodia as a way to encourage democracy.
 
Support for Coalition
 Since Vietnam invaded Cambodia and installed the Hun Sen Government in 1979, Washington has backed a loose coalition of guerrilla groups, including two non-Communist groups dominated by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer Rouge. That policy became increasingly unpopular in Congress after the withdrawal of ost Vietnamese military forces in 1989 and as the Khmer Rouge made steady military progress.
Under Congressional pressure, the Administration last year dropped its support for a Cambodian delegation at the United Nations that included members of the Khmer Rouge and began contacts with Cambodian Government officials. Congress also halted covert aid to the rebels, and approved legislation that pressed the Administration to broaden ties with the Hun Sen Government.
A senior Senate aide who monitors Cambodia said the Administration's suspension of aid "has muted the reaction." The official also noted that members were pleased that the Administration was beginning to accept bids from humanitarian organizations seeking to distribute more than $5 million in aid for needy children living in areas governed by Phnom Penh.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy has introduced legislation to cut off aid to the Cambodian opposition permanently, but few members have expressed support for his bill so far. But the debate will most likely heat up again should the Administration reinstate aid to the guerrillas or should the Khmer Rouge open a major military offensive. There is currently a lull in the fighting.
 
Accord 'Within Reach'
 Richard H. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, testified today that the diplomatic process to bring about a cease-fire, an interim government supervised by the United Nations, and free elections was making progress despite reports that it had stalled.
"A comprehensive settlement agreement is now within reach," he said, "if the Cambodian parties and others -- including Vietnam -- will cooperate."
That assessment was contradicted by several Senators.
"The Administration says that it wants to isolate the Khmer Rouge through the settlement process," said Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California and chairman of the subcommittee. "Let us be clear about what the proposed settlement does: It gives the Khmer Rouge political legitimacy."
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, asked rhetorically, "Why are we indirectly supporting the Khmer Rouge by supporting the non-Communist allies of the Khmer Rouge while trying to defeat the only Cambodian force fighting the Khmer Rouge?" Mr. Murkowski suggested that the Administration was wrong to isolate the Hun Sen Government given that it had begun to privatize the economy.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Consumers' Role In a Recovery

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
THERE is less to the consumer debt crisis than meets the eye. Some economists doubt that households are too deeply in debt to spend the nation out of a recession. As the economy recovers, slow growth in incomes is more likely to restrain consumer spending.
True, Americans borrowed during the 1980's as never before. They increased their debts, including mortgages, to almost a year's income, compared with a couple of months' income in 1950. 
 But even if consumers are not about to fuel another 1980's-style boom, debt will not keep them from spending.
First, consumers seem to be handling their debt well. Loan delinquency rates are not alarming. Late payments on mortgages are declining and late payments on installment debt, while high, are well below the levels of a few years ago. Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve, said the households that took on much of the debt during the expansion were those most able to afford it.
Consumers borrowed not only to ski in Vail, but also to invest in securities and homes. "To look at debt and not assets is silly because debt is such a small part of the balance sheet," said John D. Paulus, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley, who has just studied consumer balance sheets. Consumers added $9 trillion in assets but only $2 trillion in debt during the expansion from 1982 to 1990, according to the Federal Reserve. At the end of the expansion last year, husehold assets equaled more than five times their debts.
Not all the gains in assets reflected new BMW's, Sub-Zero refrigerators or inflated house prices on the two coasts. The value of households' financial assets -- including securities, savings accounts and insurance policies -- rose by roughly $7 billion during the expansion, more than twice as fast as the value of so-called tangible assets. Even the increase in financial wealth wasn't just the result of a free ride up the Dow Jones average. It mostly reflected bigger bank balances and more purchases of Treasury securities and corporate bonds.
Consumers' net worth was 70 percent higher -- or 30 percent after inflation -- last year than in 1982. Consumers accumulated wealth so consistently that they finished the decade with net worth of more than four times after-tax personal income -- the same as at the end of the 1960's.
The fear that consumers will have to prune spending to avoid bankruptcy is overblown because they can cash in much of their wealth in the time it takes to call a broker or stop at a teller machine. The most liquid financial assets, including bank accounts but not stocks, exceed debt by a wide margin.
It stands to reason that consumers have been prudent: It is the only group that spends its own money. Managers spend their shareholders' money and bureaucrats, the taxpayers'. Households, those supposed profligates, not only pay their own way, but are also net lenders to business and government.
But the good news about debt is not sufficient to guarantee a robust economy recovery. That is because consumer spending depends primarily on income. Consumers typically spend 80 cents of each extra dollar of income, compared with a nickel of each extra dollar of wealth. "Historically, consumer spending reflects income growth," not indebtedness, Mr. Paulus said.
During the next expansion, consumers are therefore likely to raise spending about as fast as their incomes allow. But income growth will probably be anemic compared with past recoveries, said Richard B. Berner, a Salomon Brothers economist.
Incomes may lag because employment is unlikely to grow as much as in past recoveries. Unemployment has remained lower than in some past recessions, and service companies are likely to remain cost-conscious. Wage gains are likely to be slight.
In addition, the $700 billion that households earn from interest is shrinking as rates fall. And tax increases at all levels, according to Mr. Berner, are draining about $36 billion from consumer budgets this year -- more than the cost of last summer's oil shock.
If incomes grow only modestly, consumers are also unlikely to increase their rate of savings, which has recently fluctuated between 4 and 5 percent. Saving often does rise during economic expansions, said Edward F. McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs. But that is because income growth is usually so strong that consumers can afford to both save and spend more.
Far from worrying about levels of debt, some economists say the nation has more to fear if consumers suddenly become much more thrifty. A panicky cutback in spending was enough to set off a recession last year. An abrupt rise in saving would keep the recovery away.

HEADLINE: Job Prospects for Graduates Seen as Bleak

 BODY:
After investing tens of thousands of dollars and countless hours in legal education, a substantial number of third-year students at law schools nationwide may graduate this year without job offers.
Though the situation is most acute in New York and other major cities in the Northeast, law firms are being forced by the recession to reduce the number of entry-level positions they offer, recruiters say. Citing economic reasons, some of the same firms only recently laid off scores of associates. 
 "I don't know what these students will do," said Lujuana Treadwell, executive director of the National Association for Law Placement, an organization of law firms and law schools that researches legal recruiting. "I'm sure some of them will take the bar exams and get jobs after they've been admitted to practice. Others will turn to jobs in other areas that use their legal backgrounds."
 
Tough Going for Class of '91
 Ms. Treadwell said the Class of 1991 faces the bleakest job prospects since the early 1980's.
Some entry-level jobs do exist. "You always have to have entry-level people," said Robert J. Kafin, the chairman of the hiring committee at Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn in New York. "You have to be able to advance entry-level people. And to advance entry-level people, you have to bring in someone to do the jobs they used to do."
But most larger firms have already given the bulk of these jobs to students who worked for them last year as summer associates, said Jody Greenspan, director of recruitment at New York University Law School.
 
Recruiting Was Down
 The National Association for Law Placement will not begin collecting data on the employment status of 1991 graduates until the fall. But 70 percent of the law schools that responded to a December 1990 survey by the research group reported that fewer firms traveled to their campuses to interview third-year students last fall. This is taken as an indication that, unlike in past years, many firms had little need to look beyond the talent tapped last summer.
Those third-year students who did not convert their summer employment into permanent jobs face the greatest difficulty because they are likely to be overlooked by firms that are hiring, experts said. But Ms. Treadwell said that these students and many who were spurned by larger firms last fall may find work at smaller firms or in Government agencies, which interview in the spring.
Like many other large firms, Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn continued to recruit at the nation's top law schools this year, but it bypassed many of the regional schools that helped fill its personnel needs in the boom of the middle and late 1980's, Mr. Kafin said.
One whose job search may have been hampered by the recession is Diane Vogel, a third-year student at Albany Law School.
Ms. Vogel, who is on the law review and heads the international law society at Albany, worked last summer at one of the largest firms in New York. But no offer of a permanent job followed, and Ms. Vogel, who has student loans to repay, is concerned about her prospects.
"I have faith that I'll find something; I don't have faith I'm going to find the optimal job," she said. "People are jumping at the first job that comes along."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Up Moderately

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Fresh reports presenting a mixed picture on the economy and inflation had little impact in the credit markets, where prices of Treasury securities moved modestly higher yesterday in light trading.
Analysts noted that another important inflation report, one on consumer prices, is scheduled for today. 
 Analysts and market participants were mostly puzzled by a report on retail sales, which showed that sales fell a sharp eight-tenths of a percent last month.
That number, which suggests continued weakness in the economy, would have been greeted more favorably had it not been accompanied by a huge upward revision in February's sales figures. Retail sales rose by 2 percent in February, not the eight-tenths of a percent increase that was originally reported.
"That big upward revision made people think twice about what the March numbers really might be," said Richard B. Berner, a vice president and economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.
A report showing that initial unemployment claims fell by 70,000, to 473,000, in the week ended March 30 was also somewhat troubling, even though the figures were skewed because of the Good Friday holiday.
The inflation numbers carried a less ambiguous message.
 
Producer Index Up
 Excluding food and energy, the Producer Price Index rose by two-tenths of a percent in March, down from a rise of four-tenths of a percent in February. Over all, the index fell three-tenths of a percent in March, the fourth straight monthly decline.
The report sparked some speculation that the Federal Reserve might move soon to lower short-term interest rates. Reflecting that, short-term money market rates moved down fairly sharply. But bond yields were little changed.
The Fed, however, chose not to take that step yesterday.
For the second straight session, the Fed entered the market to drain reserves from the banking system at a time when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading under the 6 percent level that is seen as the Fed's target.
"The market's tepid reaction to the reports has implications for the Fed," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago.
"The Fed really wants to be in a situation where they are following the market, not leading it."
The pending release of the consumer price report may also have been a reason for the market's measured reaction. "There is considerable risk on Friday," one Government bond trader said.
In advance of the report, most economists projected that excluding food and energy prices, the Consumer Price Index will show a rise of about three-tenths of a percent for last month, a big drop from the large rise of seven-tenths of a percent recorded in February.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 95 27/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.25 percent, basically unchanged from Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 7/8, up 2/32, to yield 8.06 percent. Anticipating a possible easing move by the Fed, the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes rose by 5/32, to a late price of 100 13/ 32, to yield 6.89 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates fell fairly sharply.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.52 percent, down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 6 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.63 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 8 basis points, to a late rate of 5.81 percent.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended April 1.
M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely watched by the Fed, fell by $2.1 billion. It was the first time in weeks that M-2 had not posted an increase. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose one-eighth to a quarter of a point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about one-eighth.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell 0.8% In March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
In the clearest evidence to date that revived confidence has done little to spur consumer spending, the Commerce Department estimated today that retail sales fell eight-tenths of 1 percent last month. That put sales slightly below the level of March 1990.
Analysts said the decline, which was widespread, indicated that the economy remained mired in recession and that the Federal Reserve had compelling reason to make another round of cuts in interest rates to hasten a recovery.
 
Producer Prices Fall
 Giving the Fed still further maneuvering room, the Labor Department reported today that prices received by American finished-goods producers eased by an unexpectedly large three-tenths of 1 percent in March, the fourth straight monthly decline. 
 The "core rate," which excludes food and energy, rose a reassuring two-tenths of 1 percent, less than half the average for the two preceding months. [Page D8.]
Partly in reaction to the producer price numbers, stock prices rose sharply today, with the Dow industrials gaining 30.95, to 2,905.45. In the credit markets there was little reaction, with many analysts and traders puzzled by the retail sales numbers.
A report of higher chain-store sales today offered some grounds for optimism, some said, even though it was discount stores that posted the biggest gains. Low inflation, in fact, has been one of the factors holding down retail sales volume. [Page D8.]
Yet another report showed that initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 70,000, to 473,000, in the week ended March 30. But this was generally disregarded, partly because of the Good Friday holiday.
 
February Figure Revised
 The retail sales figures cover everything from gasoline to refrigerators but do not count real estate or intangibles like college tuition.
As grim as they seemed, the retail figures had a bright side: Sales in February were revised to show a 2 percent gain instead of the eight-tenths of 1 percent gain that was initially estimated.
This, noted John D. Paulus, chief economist for Morgan Stanley & Company, means that the most recent two months have posted an average six-tenths of 1 percent gain in contrast to an eight-tenths of 1 percent average decline for the October-January period.
"There's some evidence here that the consumer may be bottoming out," Mr. Paulus said.
The March decline, though, might have been greater had it not been for the fact that Easter fell in March this year, while last year it fell in April.
Mr. Paulus and other economists said they expected the Fed to move as early as Friday to cut rates, providing the "core" Consumer Price Index, published at 8:30 A.M., rises no more than, say, four-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Discount Rate May Be Cut
 A Fed move will presumably include a cut in the discount rate, now 6 percent. Some economists, however, said they thought the Fed would defer further easing until it saw more economic deterioration.
Still, the finished-goods P.P.I. has not declined for such a sustained period -- albeit mainly because of energy -- in five years, and analysts also noted that the indexes for goods at the intermediate and crude stages both fell sharply last month.
Unlike some recent months, retail sales figures were not dragged down by the automotive sector, which fell by the same eight-tenths of 1 percent as the overall tabulation.
But while the March decline was sizable and widespread, the upward revision for February took much of the sting out of it and analysts said these and other figures represented early signs of economic recovery that most still believe likely by mid-year.
 
Economy Seen as Healthier
 "The economy looks less unhealthy than a month ago," commented Gilbert Benz, an economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
March retail sales totaled $149.6 billion, adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences but not for inflation, the Department reported. This compared with $150.8 billion, upon revision, for February.
Durable goods fell nine-tenths of 1 percent to a level 4.8 percent below March 1990, with sales of building materials posting the biggest percentage loss -- 4.4 percent. Sales at furniture, home furnishing and equipment stores rose five-tenths of 1 percent.
Sales of nondurables -- about two-thirds of the total -- fell eight-tenths of 1 percent last month. General merchandise stores had a decline of 2.2 percent and there were also declines for gasoline stations (1.5 percent), apparel and accessory stores (4.9 percent) and eating and drinking places (1.8 percent).
Gains were posted by drug and proprietary stores (1.1. percent) and by food stores.

HEADLINE: Sewage Plant Near Capacity After 5 Years

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Five years after it opened, the $1.1 billion North River sewage plant serving most of the West Side of Manhattan is treating almost as much sewage as it can handle, raising questions about the future water quality of the Hudson River and the future of West Side development.
Today, it is scheduled to reach a milestone when it begins secondary treatment of its sewage, aerating the water to remove more impurities. 
 Environmentalists agree that the Hudson has been cleaner since the plant opened on a sprawling riverfront site between 137th and 145th Streets in Harlem. But they worry that if the plant exceeds capacity, it will have to treat sewage less, and discharge dirtier effluent into the river.
That could prompt the state to restrict new sewer hookups, which could halt new development on the West Side, stifling plans for high-rises, midtown office buildings and projects like Trump City.
The plant has other problems, as well. An elaborate 28-acre park on its roof is at least a year behind schedule and will not open until spring 1993. And the plant continues to release odors that have exasperated Harlem residents since the day it opened.
 
Volunteer Noses Get Training
 "All I can say is, it stinks," said L. Ann Rocker, who lives at 142d Street and Riverside Drive and heads a citizens advisory group concerned about the plant.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who residents say is more sensitive to the issue than his predecessor was, has gone so far as to organize local odor volunteers trained to tell the difference between West Side Highway car fumes and plant emissions like hydrogen sulfide. But much dissatisfaction remains, despite promises of better monitoring and filters, and some residents think the plant's design is fundamentally flawed.
The secondary treatment due to begin today -- in which air is bubbled through the sewage to make more solids settle out as sludge before the water is chlorinated -- should remove 85 percent of the pollutants, up from 60 percent or less. Most plants in the United States have long operated at the 85 percent level, the Federal requirement, but North River's construction lagged so far behind schedule that environmental officials allowed it to open below standards.
"It is a momentous occasion," said Katherine Kennedy, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization monitoring city sewage plants. "But simultaneously, that the plant appears to be at design capacity is depressing because it shows a lack of planning."
Still, New York City has come a long way: before the plant opened in 1986, raw sewage from Manhattan's West Side poured untreated into the Hudson. Now, it handles waste from 550,000 residents and a huge transient population, from Bank Street in Greenwich Village to Manhattan's northern tip.
Sewage treatment plants are designed to work for at least 25 years. Almost from the moment it began operation, the North River plant was at or near capacity -- 170 million gallons a day. To save money in the late 1970's, officials decided to lower its capacity from 225 million gallons.
When a plant takes more sewage than it is designed for, it holds the sewage less time, so fewer solids settle out.
 
Mariner's Nickname for Hudson
 "A plant that is operating right at capacity is stressed, like operating an auto at maximum speed," said Dr. Alan I. Mytelka, director of the Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional regulatory agency.
New York State grants plant permits, and can halt sewer hookups in the area drained by a plant if it exceeds capacity.
Besides North River -- a mariner's nickname for the Hudson River dating to the 1700's -- at least two of the city's 14 sewage plants run at or above capacity. The Wards Island and Newtown Creek plants operate under consent orders requiring city officials to pursue water conservation and increase treatment.
City officials say careful water conservation would keep the North River plant at or below capacity, even with new development. There are no plans to expand the plant.
Carol Ash, regional director of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said conservation could work, especially since she expects little new West Side development because of the city's economic doldrums. But the state will stay on the alert.
"We don't want it to go over capacity, that's for sure," Ms. Ash said.
A study released last month by State Senator Franz S. Leichter of Manhattan found that the plant may be over capacity right now and that the threat of a state development moratorium is real once the economy picks up. In addition, he had doubts that the city's conservation program could save as much water as it claims by 1998: 18 million gallons, or 10 percent of the sewage expected to be generated.
Senator Leichter said he is concerned that expensive high-rises and office buildings will be built before affordable housing, which could be shut out of the market if the state later declared a moratorium. He said the city should enact a short-term building moratorium in the North River service area to establish development priorities before the economy begins to grow.
One problem is knowing exactly how much sewage goes through the plant. Between November 1989 and last June, New York City had no firm idea how much was. At first, the city said malfunctioning equipment let river water into the plant, then blamed seasonal changes. Finally, it said meters had malfunctioned.
That has been fixed, officials say. Now they must figure out how to keep the plant from stinking. All sewage plants have some odor problems, but not all are so close to homes.
North River, most of which is on a platform over the river, is only a few hundred feet from the closest apartments. From the day it opened, it has been plagued by odor problems, although the city Department of Environmental Protection says only 11 formal complaints have been recorded in the last two years.
"Last summer, I never opened my window because it's so bad when it's warm weather," said Mertis Hightower, whose 15th-floor apartment at 626 Riverside Drive faces the plant.
To mollify Harlem residents who opposed the plant, officials agreed to build a park atop it, which will include indoor and outdoor pools, a skating rink, ballfields, a carousel, a restaurant and athletic and culture centers. Bridges to it have been built over the West Side Highway.
"I've never picked up too many odors on the rooftop," said Warren Holliday, program manager for the state Office of General Services, which is overseeing park construction.
Local residents, city officials and environmentalists are skeptical, and say the Koch administration ignored the odor problem. But some are equally unconvinced that the Dinkins administration will effectively control it by measures like installing filters. They want major design changes.

HEADLINE: Weicker Vows to Veto Budget Plan That Does Not Include Income Tax

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 11

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. today placed his administration squarely in the crossroads of a confrontation with the broad middle belt of the General Assembly by vowing to veto a no-income-tax budget plan that had seemed to be gaining support in both parties.
Mr. Weicker said he could not now imagine any budget he would sign if it did not include an income tax. He had previously encouraged lawmakers to seek another way to solve the state's budget deficit and recession and thus avoid the sweeping overhaul he proposed to the legislature in February. 
 Today, he seemed to close off those options. He said the counterproposal offered by Republican leaders, who pledged to skirt the income tax through an increase in sales tax collections and deeper cuts in spending, would worsen the state's recession and saddle taxpayers with budget gimmicks.
 
A 'Flawed' Proposal
 "It's flawed to the extent that it promises no more than what we've got," Mr. Weicker said at a news conference in his office. "I don't want any more of what we have."
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican United States Senator who gave up on his party to run last year on his own third-party ticket, said the Republicans had fashioned a document that is "clearly antibusiness," rife with "gimmicks" and "totally speculative" in adding up projected dollar savings.
The Republican plan had drawn nods of admiration, if not outright support, from many Democrats, including the State Senate and House majority leaders. With Democrats split over an income tax, Republicans believed a bipartisan coalition to break Mr. Weicker's budget plan was within view.
Some lawmakers, mostly liberal income-tax supporters, said the veto threat had effectively killed the plan because a two-thirds majority needed to override a veto was impossible to obtain. Gov. William A. O'Neill, Mr. Weicker's predecessor, never had a veto overridden in 10 years in office.
Other lawmakers said the Governor's words would simply harden the resolve and deepen divisions within the Democratic Party and between the legislative and executive branches of the government.
 
'A Major Blunder'
 "Attempting to intimidate the General Assembly is only going to be counterproductive -- all it's going to do is weld the non-income-tax group together," said Senator James H. Maloney, Democrat of Danbury, vice chairman of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. "It was a major blunder."
Mr. Maloney said he believed that enough votes already existed in the 36-member Senate to pass an alternative budget and that hackles raised by the Governor today could help push a simple majority into a two-thirds majority, or 24 votes, needed to override a veto.
The Republicans have 16 seats in the Senate to the Democrats' 20. In the House, Republicans have 63 seats to the Democrats' 88. Overriding a veto in the House requires 101 votes.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise And the Dow Gains 30.95

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The stock market rebounded yesterday, largely because the Government reported a modest rise in wholesale prices for March. The report was in line with expectations, and analysts expect the report on the March Consumer Price Index, which is due before the market opens this morning, will also be well received.
Program trading by institutions continued to dominate the blue chips, but individual investors seemed to favor shares in the over-the-counter market. As a result, the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 8.55 to close at a record 499.31, toppling the previous record of 497.57 that was set only a week earlier. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chips added 30.95 to close at 2,905.45, a gain of 1.08 percent. In all, 1,108 issues closed higher on the New York Stock Exchange, while 508 declined.
 
Volume Soars
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange soared to 196.6 million shares, from 167.9 million the day before. Technical analysts cited as a positive sign the strong close of the spot June futures in the Standard and Poor's stock index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Index futures trade 15 minutes after the Big Board closes.
The 500 futures closed at 381.50, almost 4 points above the "cash," or actual S.&P. 500 index, which ended up 4.48 at 377.63. According to several Wall Street technicians who guide program trading strategies for their houses, the June futures should have a premium of roughly 2.10 points over the actual index. Instead, the June futures closed a premium of 3.47, compared with one of 1.85 at the previous close.
Futures usually trade above cash prices because the futures price includes the theoretical cost of carrying the underlying goods and related expenses. But the larger the premium on the 500 futures, the better the odds that the market will open higher the following morning, because the program traders will sell some of their futures to take profits and then buy the shares in the less expensive actual S.&P. 500 index.
 
Relief on Producer Prices
 Yesterday morning, a combination of relief on the Producer Price Index's performance, combined with program traders switching out of futures and into the cash market, sent the market sharply higher after the opening. As measured by the Dow average, the market was up over 40 points before traders inevitably began to cash in some profits.
Given the absence of any strong market trend, many blue chips favored by program traders of late were among the most active Big Board issues. American Express led the list, slipping 1/8, to 27 5/8, on a turnover of 5.2 million shares. RJR Nabisco Holdings was second, rising 3/8, to 11 1/2, on a volume of 4.2 million shares.
Among the stocks on the list of 10 most active with the largest price changes, Laidlaw Inc. B fell 1, to 12 7/8; Advanced Micro Devices rose 1, to 12 5/8; Waste Management fell 1 7/8, to 36 7/8, and Upjohn fell 1 3/4, to 46 1/2.
"While the rich closing premium of the 500 futures augers for a good opening Friday, what follows will depend on whether the C.P.I. March index provides no surprises," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer of Zurich, which manages huge amounts of pension funds, as well as other investments.
 
'Awash in Cash'
 Mr. Spilko said that what impressed and many of his peers was the continued strength of the over-the-counter market. "The institutions, which are still awash in cash, have been more or less marking time by engaging in program trading involving the blue chips, such as the 500 indexes," he said. "But individual investors are buying what they perceive as tomorrow's blue chips in the over-the-counter market."
This trend continued despite some fears earlier in the day that the modest rise in wholesale prices would deter the Federal Reserve from easing credit further. These fears were bolstered somewhat when the central bank actually pushed up interest rates a bit by draining reserves from the banking system in what was considered a technical move.
The belief that the Fed will eventually lower credit costs as a means of stimulating the economy was also evident at the American Stock Exchange, where their Market Value Index closed up 2.96, at 365.47.

HEADLINE: Seidman Asks Stiffer Bank Curbs

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, the nation's senior banking regulator, asked Congress today to reverse sharply the deregulatory trend of the last two decades and adopt a law that would make it harder for banks to issue loans for construction and purchases of raw land and other real estate.
Whether or not Congress acts, the pronouncements alone by Mr. Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are expected to reduce credit further in already tight markets for certain real estate loans. Analysts expect that his recommendation will translate into a tougher stance toward such loans by Government examiners, who have the authority to impose restrictions on the institutions they supervise to insure their safety and soundness. 
 Appearing today before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Seidman attributed much of the blame for the current banking crisis to a loosening of the banking laws in 1974 and 1982, as well as a laxness among regulators, that enabled banks to make real estate loans that have since turned into monumental losses in several regions of the country, notably the Southwest and the Northeast. Before 1974, banks had been restricted in making such loans.
"It is time for insured institutions to return to old-fashioned standards of safe and sound banking," Mr. Seidman said. "The restrictions lifted by Congress in 1974 and 1982 should be reinstated."
 
Treasury Officials Disagree
 In recent weeks, Mr. Seidman has delivered several speeches before bank and savings and loan organizations stressing the need for caution in real estate lending. That position has put him at odds with Treasury officials, who declined to include his proposal in their plan to overhaul the banking system that was presented last month.
The Treasury officials said in their presentation to Congress that statutory prohibitions on certain types of bank loans would only aggravate problems that have arisen from already stingy lending for commercial real estate.
The Treasury Department has responded to criticism from bankers and other businesses about the tight lending by seeking to ease accounting standards to coax banks to extend more credit. Both the General Accounting Office and some lawmakers have attacked this approach.
It is too early to tell how receptive Congress will be toward Mr. Seidman's proposal to restrict lending.
In a sign that he was leaning toward endorsing such a move, the House Banking Committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, said at today's hearing that he had voted against the legislation in 1982 that had eased restrictions on lending practices and was troubled by the enormous amount of real estate lending by the banks.
Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is said to be considering throwing his support behind restricting certain kinds of real estate loans.
On the other hand, real estate and banking lobbyists are expected to wage a hard campaign to keep the law from changing.
"Our initial reaction is that this does nothing to address today's paramount crisis, which is the credit crunch," said Steven A. Wechsler, president of the National Realty Committee, a trade organization in Washington representing developers and other business executives involved in real estate. "These suggestions address what could be tomorrow's problem if history repeats itself. Today's problem is the credit crisis."
"I do find it interesting that in 1982, when these statutory restrictions were lifted, they were done to provide the regulators with flexible and realistic standards," he added. "Given the fact that the flexibility has been available, it's not clear what legislation would do."
 
'Paying the Consequences'
 In his testimony today, Mr. Seidman said the F.D.I.C. "has been paying the consequences" ever since Congress and the White House decided in 1974 and 1982 to ease restrictions on real estate lending. The rising number of bank failures has left the fund that protects deposits at its lowest ratio to deposits since its creation in 1934. Mr. Seidman today reiterated his prediction that the fund would probably not be insolvent this year unless the economy failed to recover in the next few months. Many economists and officials have forecast an upturn.
"There may be a time when the taxpayer has to pick up the bill," Mr. Seidman said of the federally guaranteed fund. "I do not believe we have arrived at that point now, and I hope we never arrive at that point."
Mr. Seidman said that whether any new borrowing to keep the bank insurance fund afloat would come from the Treasury or the Federal Reserve was "of secondary significance." The Administration has sought to have $25 billion of the $70 billion in new borrowing authority that the White House has requested be available from the Fed. But some senior Fed officials say that using the central bank for a possible taxpayer bailout sets a bad precedent. The General Accounting Office has also come out against tapping the Fed.
In recent months, Mr. Seidman, who has enjoyed a strong reputation in Congress, has come under increasing political pressure as the bank insurance fund's problems have grown. Many members of Congress continue to praise him. But some lawmakers have begun to draw comparisons between him and M. Danny Wall, the former head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who has been accused of failing to adequately warn Congress of the growing problems of the savings and loan industry.
Mr. Seidman, who will be 70 years old at the end of the month, has deflected the comparisons with good humor. Introducing his wife to the committee today, he remarked, "I think she came to watch the slaughter."
He has also declined to pin down his plans, other than to say he expects to leave before his term expires. His term is scheduled to end in October, but the F.D.I.C. has obtained a legal opinion that an ambiguity in the law may allow him to continue serving through February 1993.
 
Three Changes Criticized
 In his testimony, Mr. Seidman cited three changes in the banking laws that he said contributed significantly to the current banking crisis. The changes, many of which came under the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982, permitted nationally chartered banks to make loans on raw land; allowed loans on construction projects even when the builder contributed less than 25 percent equity, and eliminated restrictions on a bank's total real estate loan portfolio.
"In the three years following the passage of the Garn-St Germain Act, construction and land development loans by Texas commercial banks doubled as a percentage of assets and nearly tripled in dollar terms," Mr. Seidman said.
Congressional aides noted today that the savings and loan bailout legislation adopted in 1989 had restricted some forms of real estate lending and that Congress was likely to be similarly inclined to impose some restrictions on banks.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell 0.3% in March

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level fell in March for the fourth straight month, the first time that has occurred in five years, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index fell three-tenths of a percent last month, reflecting continued big declines in energy prices. 
 The Government also said that the underlying inflation rate, which excludes energy and food costs, rose a modest two-tenths of a percent -- just half of the February gain. Analysts said that bolstered their belief that big gains in the core inflation rate in January and February had been based on temporary factors.
 
No Big Inflation Seen
 "Anyone reading this report can't be saying that inflation is about to roar off," said Donald Ratajczak, head of the forecasting unit at Georgia State University.
He said he was expecting the Consumer Price Index for March to be up about one-tenth of a percent when it is issued on Friday.
The three-tenths of a percent drop in wholesale prices in March left prices declining at an annual rate of 3.9 percent for the first three months of this year, sharply below last year's 5.6 percent rise. That increase was attributed to the big jump in energy prices after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
So far this year, energy prices have been falling at a steep annual rate of 35.4 percent as oil prices retreated from the levels reached in the months immediately after the invasion.
 
Food and Energy Costs
 In March, food costs one step short of retail prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent as small increases in a variety of products offset actual declines for beef, poultry and vegetable prices.
In energy, gasoline prices fell 5.8 percent, while home heating oil costs dropped by 16.5 percent.
Women's clohing prices continued to spurt upward, rising by seven-tenths of a percent. But that was slower than the February increase.
Prices for new cars rose just two-tenths of a percent, far below the gains in January and February, and prescription drug prices, which had been racing ahead, fell eight-tenths of a percent.

The Economy
Retail sales fell 0.8 percent last month, to slightly below the March 1990 level, the Commerce Department reported.

'Miss Saigon' Arrives, From the Old School

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THERE may never have been a musical that made more people angry before its Broadway debut than "Miss Saigon."
Here is a show with something for everyone to resent -- in principle, at least. Its imported stars, the English actor Jonathan Pryce and the Filipino actress Lea Salonga, are playing roles that neglected Asian-American performers feel are rightfully theirs. Its top ticket price of $100 is a new Broadway high, sprung by an English producer, if you please, on a recession-straitened American public. More incendiary still is the musical's content. A loose adaptation of "Madama Butterfly" transplanted to the Vietnam War by French authors, the "Les Miserables" team of Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, "Miss Saigon" insists on revisiting the most calamitous and morally dubious military adventure in American history and, through an unfortunate accident of timing, arrives in New York even as the jingoistic celebrations of a successful American war are going full blast. 
 So take your rage with you to the Broadway Theater, where "Miss Saigon" opened last night, and hold on tight. Then see just how long you can cling to the anger when confronted by the work itself. For all that seems galling about "Miss Saigon" -- and for all that is indeed simplistic, derivative and, at odd instances, laughable about it -- this musical is a gripping entertainment of the old school (specifically, the Rodgers and Hammerstein East-meets-West school of "South Pacific" and "The King and I"). Among other pleasures, it offers lush melodies, spectacular performances by Mr. Pryce, Miss Salonga and the American actor Hinton Battle, and a good cry. Nor are its achievements divorced from its traumatic subject, as cynics might suspect. Without imparting one fresh or daring thought about the Vietnam War, the show still manages to plunge the audience back into the quagmire of a generation ago, stirring up feelings of anguish and rage that run even deeper than the controversies that attended "Miss Saigon" before its curtain went up.
Challenged perhaps by the ill will that greeted their every move, the evening's creators, led by the director Nicholas Hytner, have given New York a far sharper version of "Miss Saigon" than the one originally staged in London. The much publicized (and inane) helicopter effect notwithstanding, this is the least spectacular and most intimate of the West End musicals. The most stirring interludes feature two or three characters on an empty stage or in a bar girl's dingy hovel, and for once the production has been made leaner rather than fattened up for American consumption. (Though the Broadway Theater is among the largest Broadway houses, it seems cozy next to the cavernous Drury Lane, where the show plays in London.) If "Miss Saigon" is the most exciting of the so-called English musicals -- and I feel it is, easily -- that may be because it is the most American. It freely echoes Broadway classics, and some of its crucial personnel are Broadway hands: the co-lyricist Richard Maltby Jr., the choreographer Bob Avian, the orchestrator William D. Brohn.
Without two legendary American theatrical impresarios, David Belasco and Harold Prince, there would in fact be no "Miss Saigon." It was Belasco's turn-of-the-century dramatization of the Madame Butterfly story that inspired Puccini's opera, and it was Mr. Prince who, inspired by Brecht and the actor Joel Grey 25 years ago, created the demonic, symbolic Emcee of "Cabaret," a character that is unofficially recycled on this occasion in a role called the Engineer and played by Mr. Pryce. These two influences are brilliantly fused here. Altered substantially but not beyond recognition, the basic "Butterfly" premise of an Asian woman who is seduced and abandoned by an American military man is affectingly rekindled in "Miss Saigon" by Mr. Schonberg's score and Miss Salonga's clarion, emotionally naked delivery of it. Whenever that tale flirts with bathos, along comes the leering, creepy Mr. Pryce to jolt the evening back into the hellish, last-night-of-the-world atmosphere that is as fitting for the fall of Saigon as it was for the Weimar Berlin of "Cabaret."
The theatrical poles of "Miss Saigon" represented by its two stars are equally powerful. Miss Salonga, whose performance has grown enormously since crossing the Atlantic, has the audience all but worshiping her from her first appearance as Kim, an open-faced 17-year-old waif from the blasted Vietnamese countryside who is reduced to working as a prostitute in Saigon. As her romance with an American marine, Chris (Willy Falk), blossoms "South Pacific"-style in a progression of haunting saxophone-flecked ballads in Act I, the actress keeps sentimentality at bay by slowly revealing the steely determination beneath the gorgeous voice, radiant girlish features and virginal white gown. Once Chris and his fellow Americans have fled her and her country, the determination transmutes into courage, and the passages in which Kim sacrifices herself for the welfare of her tiny child, no matter how hokey, are irresistibly moving because Miss Salonga's purity of expression, backed up by the most elemental music and lyrics, simply won't let them be otherwise.
Mr. Pryce, a great character actor whose nasty streak has been apparent since his memorable Broadway debut in Trevor Griffiths's "Comedians" 15 years ago, makes disingenuousness as electrifying as Miss Salonga's ingenuousness. The Engineer is a fixer, profiteer and survivor who can outlast Uncle Sam and Uncle Ho: a pimp, a sewer rat, a hustler of no fixed morality, sexuality, race, nationality or language. Wearing wide-lapelled jackets and bell bottoms of garish color, he is the epitome of sleaze, forever swiveling his hips, flashing a sloppy tongue and fluttering his grasping fingers in the direction of someone's dollar bills or sex organs. With his high-domed forehead and ghoulish eyes, Mr. Pryce is also a specter of doom, and he manages to turn a knee-jerk number indicting the greedy "American Dream" into a show-stopper with the sheer force of his own witty malice.
As choreographed by Mr. Avian in demented parody of an old-fashioned Broadway song-and-dance turn, "The American Dream" looks like the Fellini-esque "Loveland" sequence in the 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," and no wonder, given the song's imitation Sondheim lyrics and the fact that Mr. Avian was Michael Bennett's associate choreographer on "Follies." Among the other old favorites in "Miss Saigon" are a balcony scene out of "West Side Story," a departing refugees scene out of "Fiddler on the Roof," an Act II song for Mr. Pryce that recalls Fagin's equivalent solo in "Oliver!" and some dancing North Vietnamese who seem a cross between the Peronists in "Evita" and the ritualistic Japanese dancers of "Pacific Overtures." It is only when "Miss Saigon" imitates West End musicals of the 1980's, however, that it goes seriously astray. The helicopter stunt, which will most impress devotees of sub-Disney theme parks, is presented out of historical sequence in an Act II flashback, for no good reason other than to throw Andrew Lloyd Webber fans a pseudo-chandelier or levitating tire. A neon-drenched Bangkok nightlife spectacle in the same act is a grim reminder of the ill-fated "Chess."
Of all the failings of modern British musicals, the most severe has been their creators' utter bewilderment about what happens between men and women emotionally, psychologically and sexually. "Miss Saigon" is not immune to this syndrome, either, and it shows up most embarrassingly in the lyrics characterizing Chris's stateside wife, who, despite a game portrayal by Liz Callaway, induces audience snickers and giggles in her big Act II solo. Chris himself is nearly as faceless, and Mr. Falk, a performer with a strong pop voice and a Ken doll's personality, does nothing to turn up the hero's heat.
If anything, "Miss Saigon" would be stronger if Mr. Battle, who plays Chris's best friend, had been cast instead as Kim's lover. Mr. Battle's grit and passion are far more redolent of the marines who fought in Vietnam than Mr. Falk's blandness, and his one brief encounter with Miss Salonga has more bite than any of her scenes with her paramour. Mr. Battle, who has heretofore been better known as a dancer than a singer, also rescues the sanctimonious opening anthem of Act II -- a canned plea for homeless Amerasian children -- with a gospel delivery so blistering and committed that he overpowers an onslaught of cliched lyrics, film clips and a large backup choir.
With the aid of his designers, especially the lighting designer David Hersey, who uses John Napier's fabric-dominated sets as a floating canvas, Mr. Hytner usually keeps the staging simple. An opening "Apocalypse Now" sunrise that bleeds into a hazy panorama of a Saigon morning is as delicate as an Oriental print, and the Act I climax, in which boat people set off for points unknown, is stunning because it relies on such primal elements as an outstretched helping hand and the slow exit by the characters to the rear of a deep, darkened stage stripped of most scenery.
To be sure, the hallucinatory view of Vietnam familiar from the films of Oliver Stone, the journalism of Michael Herr and the fiction of Robert Stone, among many others, is beyond Mr. Hytner's mission, if not his considerable abilities, just as any thoughtful analysis of the war is beyond the libretto. The text of "Miss Saigon," second in naivete only to "Nixon in China," says merely that the North Vietnamese were villains and that the Americans were misguided, bungling do-gooders. Facts and haircuts are fudged, the corrupt South Vietnamese regime is invisible and any references to war atrocities are generalized into meaninglessness.
Yet the text is not the sum of a theatrical experience, and however sanitizing the words and corny the drama of "Miss Saigon," the real impact of the musical goes well beyond any literal reading. America's abandonment of its own ideals and finally of Vietnam itself is there to be found in the wrenching story of a marine's desertion of a Vietnamese woman and her son. The evening's far-from-happy closing tableau -- of spilled Vietnamese blood and an American soldier who bears at least some responsibility for the carnage -- hardly whitewashes the United States involvement in Southeast Asia. "Miss Saigon" is escapist entertainment in style and in the sense that finally it even makes one forget about all the hype and protests that greeted its arrival. But this musical is more than that, too, because the one thing it will not allow an American audience to escape is the lost war that, like its tragic heroine, even now defiantly refuses to be left behind.

Rayographs in Demand
Predictably, next week's photography auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in Manhattan are much smaller than in recent seasons at these houses, offering fewer images in the $500 to $2,000 range. 
 The recession and lackluster auctions of photographs at both houses in October prompted the cutbacks. Following a three-year boom in the photography market, during which sales doubled in size and the prices for some works went from 3 to 10 times what they had been in the mid-1980's, scores of photographs estimated by the auction houses to bring $2,000 or less did not sell six months ago.
Photographs that had been expected to bring higher prices were also affected at these sales, especially some images by Robert Mapple thorpe. An unenthusiastic response to his floral and erotic photographs left some unsold, while others brought lower prices than the houses had expected.
The bidding for some rarities of the 1920's and 30's, however, was as intense as ever. At Christie's, Man Ray's 1920's Rayograph of a double brush that looks like a ragged bow tie, suspended over a candle, was auctioned for the first time and brought $126,500. The price was the highest paid at auction for a single photograph. At Sotheby's, Alfred Stieglitz's 1922 portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe was sold for $99,000, a record at auction for a Stieglitz photograph.
The success in the fall of the Man Ray work spurred the unidentified owner of an earlier Rayograph to send it to Christie's. He had purchased the 1922 photograph, a strange image of a one-armed doll suspended in air, at Sotheby's in London in 1985 for $11,935. Now Christie's estimates the Rayograph will sell for $100,000 to $125,000 in an auction to be held at 10 A.M. and 2 P.M. next Tuesday. The sale of 439 photographs or groups of photographs is estimated to total $1.7 million to $2.2 million -- about two-thirds the value and size of the house's October auction. Of the 769 offerings in that sale, 497 were sold for a total of $1.8 million against the house estimate of $2.2 million to $3 million.
At Sotheby's sale, to be held at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. on Wednesday, the most important offering is also for an advertising image -- Paul Outerbridge's "Marmon Crankshaft," from 1923. Lighted to show the satiny texture of the metal, the photograph of a Marmon car's crankshaft is signed and dated, one of two prints known of this subject. Sotheby's estimates it to bring $100,000 to $120,000.
"There has never been a print of this image auctioned," said Beth Gates Warren, who heads photography sales at Sotheby's in New York. "The heart of the market seems to be in images of the 1920's and 30's." Sotheby's sale of 480 offerings is expected to total $2.2 million to $3.2 million, compared with the October sale of 755 offerings estimated to bring $2.9 million to $4.3 million. That sale, in which 465 works were sold, brought a total of $2.3 million.
 
Pillows and Fairings
 A wealth of Victorian decorations -- beaded pillows, dried flowers in bell jars, dolls, miniature furniture and shell paintings -- collected by Joshua and Nedda Logan is to be auctioned on May 1 at William Doyle Galleries, 175 East 87th Street, Manhattan.
"Visiting the Logans was a trip to a magic shop," said William Doyle, the auctioneer.
The decorations, theater posters and memorabilia that filled the Logans' fancifully decorated nine-room apartment at River House on the East River are to be sold from their estates. Mr. Logan, the director, writer and producer, was 79 at his death in 1988 and his wife, the actress Nedda Harrigan, the daughter of the vaudevillian Ned Harrigan, died less than a year later at the age of 91.
The auction of about 250 items or groups of items, estimated to bring $100,000 to $150,000, does not include the couple's large collection of automata, which Mrs. Logan bequeathed to the Museum of the City of New York.
 
 CHRISTIE'S, Park Avenue at 59th Street in Manhattan,(212) 546-1010. Viewing hours for photography: 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. today and tomorrow; 1 to 5 P.M. Sunday; 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. Monday.

Onda
 Affected by the sliding economy last year, Karen Hubert and Len Allison found it necessary to close their sumptuous Huberts on Park Avenue and move to more modest quarters downtown. Their latest effort is called Onda. 
 The long, mahogany-lined dining room is austere but comfortable, with brass candle sconces and religious paintings from Peru on the the walls. Frosted glass conceals most of the kitchen. Tables are draped in paper, waiters wear open white shirts and waitresses don white turtlenecks. Entrees and some appetizers have two prices, one for individual portions and another for family style.
 Typical of Mr. Allison's cooking style, the food is a weaving of international threads. A hearty starter is pansotti, a Ligurian ravioli, filled with spinach and enlivened with a ground-walnut-and-herb sauce ($7.50, $13.50).
Shrimp with radish pudding and Chinese sausage is an intriguing combination ($7.50). The quickly cooked shrimp is also flavored with ginger, onions and peppers. The radish pudding is gummy but tasty, and the lean Chinese sausage is a nice contrast to the sweet shrimp. Deep-fried oysters, almost like tempura, are crunchy and light but lack flavor ($8.50).
 For main courses there is a good Chinese-style roasted duck with a sweet layer of skin and an undercoating of fat. It comes with rape ($16, $30). Veal shank is moist and full flavored in its tomato-and-onion sauce with slices of toasty polenta ($14, $26).
And fusilli tossed with white beans, herbs and tomato is a gutsy combination ($7, $12.50).
 Onda (430 Broome Street, at Crosby Street, in Manhattan) serves lunch from noon to 3 P.M. Monday to Friday; dinner from 6 to 11 P.M. daily; brunch noon to 4 P.M. Saturday and Sunday. Mastercard and Visa are accepted.
Alcohol is not served pending approval of a liquor license. Telephone: (212) 925-4743.
 
An Appointment
 Alain Sailhac has been named director of culinary arts, which is the highest teaching position at the French Culinary Institute, the professional cooking school in SoHo.
Mr. Sailhac, best known for his nine-year tenure as chef at Le Cirque, has also been chef at Le Cygne, the "21" Club and the Plaza Hotel.

HEADLINE: Chamorro at Managua Helm: Beloved but Also Under Fire

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, April 11

 BODY:
As she winds up her first year in office, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro finds herself widely loved personally but with her Government besieged on all sides.
Labor groups affiliated with the opposition Sandinista Front have been using the freedoms they did not enjoy under their own Government "to invent new ways almost every day to go on strike, but without knowing how to distinguish between a strike and a takeover," as Mrs. Chamorro notes dryly.
 
A National Healing Process

 At the same time, there have been reports from the countryside that groups of former contras, the rebels who fought the leftist Sandinista Government for a decade with United States support, are rearming to defend themselves against what they say is repression by the army and police, still controlled by the Sandinistas. 
 Finally, the country's pro-private-enterprise groups, which led the opposition to the Sandinista Front during its nearly 11 years in power and played a major role in Mrs. Chamorro's dramatic election victory over the Sandinista Front, are dissatisfied with the slow pace of economic recovery and are angry over her retention of Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, a Sandinista, as head of the army.
Mrs. Chamorro knows the divisiveness that came with the Sandinistas' Marxist revolution; two of her four children backed it and two opposed it. She takes the view that she is presiding over a national healing process and that more time is needed for everything to come together.
She treats the nation of 3.5 million people in a motherly way, calls ministers and advisers "my love," and has brought back into style the Spanish honorifics Don and Dona. Everybody calls her Dona Violeta.
"I know many people don't like the Sandinistas," she said in an interview. "But they have to accept that the Sandinistas are Nicaraguans and are going to live here too."
 
A Visit to Washington
 Although the Bush Administration shares the dismay of many of Mrs. Chamorro's supporters over her continued backing of General Ortega and would like to see her confront the Sandinistas more decisively, on Monday she is to begin an official visit to Washington that includes a state dinner at the White House and an address to a joint meeting of Congress.
Mrs. Chamorro, tall, silver haired and 61 years old, was thrust into revolutionary tumult after the her husband, a crusading newspaper editor named Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, was killed in January 1978. Although the assassination was never traced to the Government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the killing was the spark that set off the insurrection that ended the Somoza dictatorship and brought the Sandinistas to power.
When the new Government was formed in 1979, Mrs. Chamorro served on the governing junta presided over by Daniel Ortega Saavedra, the Sandinista whom she defeated last year and brother of the army chief. But she soon resigned from the junta and became a critic of the Sandinistas.
Ten years later, under the pressure of rapid change in the Soviet bloc and growing internal dissatisfaction, the Sandinistas called free elections, and Mrs. Chamorro emerged as the only candidate who could unite the disparate opposition forces. On April 25 she will complete her first year as President.
 
The 'De Facto President'
 Admittedly a political novice, she is surrounded by a small group of ambitious young men, led by one of her sons-in-law, Antonio Lacayo. Officially Minister of the Presidency, Mr. Lacayo is called the "de facto President" by others in the Government. Also of importance is Alfredo Cesar, president of the National Assembly.
Defending her Government from accusations that it has acted too slowly to reduce inflation and impose a market economy, Mrs. Chamorro said the circumstances in which she inherited the country left her no choice but to deal with matters of war and peace during her first year and only now turn to the economy.
She said her decision to keep General Ortega at the head of the army had been necessary to tame the "wounded tiger" that the Sandinista Front became after its electoral defeat.
"I believe the Sandinista Front now accepts that it lost the election," she said. "But it hasn't been easy for them to do that."
Part of the deal in which General Ortega kept the army command required him to reduce the size of the army drastically. Mrs. Chamorro also won the pledge of some 20,000 former contras to lay down their arms in return for promises of land and temporary assistance.
 
Size of Army Reduced
 Mr. Cesar said it would not have been politically possible for Mrs. Chamorro to change the army leadership while at the same time cutting the size of an army indoctrinated with Sandinista thinking. The Government says the conscript army has been cut from 90,000 to 28,000 and the officer corps from 15,000 to 10,000.
"Once the difficult stages are over, President Chamorro will change the leadership of the army," Mr. Cesar said.
But Ramiro Gurdian, president of a farmers' organization and a decadelong opponent of the Sandinistas, charged that Mr. Lacayo negotiates almost daily with the Sandinista Front on virtually everything the Government wants to do and that the Sandinistas often renege on their promises to him.
He said, for example, that he liked the Government's free-market economic policies, but that the Sandinistas were frustrating them by using the army and police to continue to take over farms and to avoid returning confiscated businesses to private owners.
"The fact is that nothing is done in this country without the approval of the Sandinista Front," he said. "Antonio Lacayo dedicates all of his time to the Sandinista Front and has no time for other things."
 
'Part of Our Culture'
 Mr. Lacayo countered that he talks less with Sandinista leaders than President Bush talks with Democratic leaders, but said it "may be more frequently than is the norm in Latin America for Government leaders to talk with the opposition."
"We think we have to begin to move away from the Nicaraguan attitude that he who is in power is the one who orders and arranges, is the owner of life and wealth, and the other person has no right to express an opinion," he said. "The thinking has traditionally meant that if that person does express an opinion he should be taken prisoner, as Somoza did and Daniel Ortega did."
"That wasn't the discovery of Somoza or of Daniel," he said. "That comes from the last century. It's part of our culture."
Foreign Minister Enrique Dreyfus, who served time in jail in 1981 and 1982 as leader of a business group that criticized the Sandinista Government, argued that the continued influence of the Sandinistas over the army here was not substantially different from the situation in Chile and El Salvador, where elected presidents must tread carefully in dealing with powerful armies.
Acknowledging that the Chamorro Government still faced major challenges in repairing the economy and keeping the peace, Mr. Dreyfus said that "there may be chaos here, but no political prisoners."
 
More Civil Liberties
 Indeed, it is generally accepted that Nicaraguans are enjoying more civil liberties now than possibly at any other time in their history. In addition to broad freedoms of press and expression, the country has its first-ever elected municipal authorities.
"But you can't eat freedom of expression," Mr. Gurdian said. "People are hungry here. The G.N.P. fell 5.7 percent last year, and she did nothing on the economy."
"It's been difficult to criticize her because she's a lady," he added, "but we have to stop thinking of her as a woman -- she's the President of Nicaragua."

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEMURO, Japan, April 10

 BODY:
Mitsuo Yanami still remembers well the day in early September 1945, hours after Japan's unconditional surrender aboard the battleship Missouri, when Soviet soldiers overran the tiny island where he lived, just north of here in the frigid northern Pacific.
"We were shocked," recalled Mr. Yanami, who was 17 years old at the time. "At first we thought they were Americans. After all, the Americans had just won the war, and we didn't even know the Soviet Union was one of the Allies. But then we overheard them talking about Stalin." 
 The Soviets took the last of the islands a day after Japan's formal surrender, expelling Mr. Yanami and 17,384 other residents -- the Japanese are nothing if not precise, and they have accounted for everyone -- and leaving behind a legacy of bitterness that the Government maintains is shared by all of Japan.
On Tuesday, building on a four-decade-long public relations campaign, the aging refugees of the islands off Japan's northern coast see one great chance to win their Northern Territories back: the arrival of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the first Soviet leader ever to visit Japan.
 
Soviets Seek Japan's Help
 The 46-year-old occupation of the islands -- Etorofu (which the Soviets call Iturup), Kunashiri (Kunashir), Shikotan and the Habomai group -- has turned into something of a national obsession in Japan, an obsession fed by influential right-wing groups, powerful fishing organizations and the former islanders themselves. For years this fast-declining fishing town has been dotted with signboards with the rallying cry "Kaese!" -- "Give them back!" -- and the Government has made it clear that a give-back will be the price next week if Mr. Gorbachev wants billions of dollars of Japanese consumer goods, technology for Soviet factories and Japanese-financed oil exploration in Siberia.
It is a price that many Japanese officials suspect Mr. Gorbachev will be unable or unwilling to pay. Yet here in Nemuro, the former islanders who live within sight of their old homeland -- the closest island is only two miles away -- are spending their days spreading and dashing rumors of a secret deal in the works.
For several weeks hopes have risen on reports that Japan may be prepared to pay upwards of $28 billion, masked as economic aid, to regain sovereignty over the islands. That comes to roughly $22,680 an acre for one of the world's most remote, ice-blocked and inhospitable corners. Then the other day a Japanese newspaper quoted the Soviet Defense Minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, as saying there would be absolutely no deal.
Mr. Gorbachev's staff also tried to reduce expectations as they arrived in Tokyo this week. "This is a problem that has gone on for a hundred years," said Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman. "It will not be solved overnight."
 
Nasty Battles Brewing
 Even though it is hard to find anyone here under the age of 70 who says he is actually willing to move back to the islands, nasty battles are already brewing as Japanese families jostle for long-lost property rights.
Mr. Gorbachev may well offer to acknowledge Japanese sovereignty over two of the islands closest to Japanese shores and promise to talk about the other two, a deal that the Soviets briefly put forward and Japan rejected a quarter-century ago. Taking an uncharacteristically hard-line stance, Japan's Foreign Ministry has left little room for such compromises, saying that for the visit to be a success Mr. Gorbachev must now recognize Japan's claim to all four -- even if the actual turnover takes years.
No one can quite explain why the issue has such an emotional appeal for Japan, save for the fact that the Japanese are inculcated from childhood that they live in a small country with no land to spare. When foreigners suggest that the loss of the islands was a relatively small price for Japan to pay for its colonial forays into Korea, Manchuria and vast stretches of Southeast Asia, islanders here respond with cold stares.
 
U.S. Is Blamed Too
 "Certainly Japan was responsible for starting the war," Mitsuo Takaiwa, a prosperous-looking former fisherman. But, he said, the Soviets are more to blame for exploiting Japan's helplessness in the last days of the war, in violation of a nonaggression pact between the two nations. "The U.S. is responsible, too," he said, "for allowing the Soviet Union to do that."
More than 9,000 fishermen have been detained by the Soviets for poaching in the island waters, and fishing seems to be one major reason Japan wants the territory back. The area around Nemuro was harvested to the point of depletion, and major fisheries stand to gain millions of dollars if the islands come back.
But the people of Nemuro say they do not want to kick out the 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet citizens now living on the disputed territory, a figure that includes a large number of military personnel. "I think it may be possible to live together," says Hirotoshi Kawata, a 56-year-old city official who remembers befriending a soldier named Aleksei who was part of the invading party.
But for the 11,000 surviving islanders, the war will not really be over until the islands are repatriated.
"The islands were rich when I was there, and I have always dreamed of returning," Shoji Ashizaki, who once lived on the Habomais. "We Japanese know we can make them rich again."

Dollar Has Broad Advance; Price of Gold Moves Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced worldwide yesterday in erratic trading despite new economic data that were widely interpreted as setting the stage for a lowering of American interest rates.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $361.30 an ounce, off $1.60 from Thursday. The Republic National Bank said gold fell $2.40 an ounce, to a late bid of $359.50. 
 The Labor Department reported that consumer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in March, the first decline in five years, as energy costs continued to fall and price increases for other goods moderated.
The favorable news on inflation, coupled with signs that the recession is holding on, prompted much speculation that the Federal Reserve would move to cut interest rates.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors.
The dollar initially fell on the report, but within minutes the currency was in demand, said David Ogg, a vice president at Credit Suisse.
Trading was volatile worldwide, reflecting general nervousness about the dollar's direction and the inclination among traders to seek quick profits, dealers said.
The dollar's advance was supported when the Federal Reserve later drained reserves from the banking system, a move interpreted by many economists as a clear signal that the Fed is not yet ready to push rates lower.
"The dollar showed a lot of strength," especially when it became apparent that interest rates would not be cut, said John Marchese, chief economist at Pegasus Econometrics Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Some people in the markets say the dollar, which has risen sharply during the last few months, can afford to slip a bit.
Against the German mark, the dollar rose in New York trading to 1.6880 marks, from 1.6705 on Thursday.
Also in New York, the dollar edged up to 136.40 yen, from 136.20 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 135.85 yen, from 136.65 yen at Thursday's close. In London, it rose to 136.30 yen.
The British pound fell in London to $1.7775, from $1.7905 late Thursday. In New York, a pound cost $1.7725, down from Thursday's $1.7904.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.4320 Swiss francs, up from 1.4118; 5.7020 French francs, up from 5.6485; 1,252.25 Italian lire, up from 1,239.75, and 1.1509 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1506.

HEADLINE: Talks Set on Eastern Europe Aid

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 12

 BODY:
Eastern Europe's difficult transition from Communism to capitalism and the growing political and economic chaos in the Soviet Union are expected to be the focus when heads of state and finance ministers of more than 40 countries gather here this weekend.
At the same time, finance ministers of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan -- will gather informally on Sunday night for dinner at the official residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. 
 American and British officials say they expect no major decisions to be made, and they said no communique would be issued after the dinner.
 
Trade Is on Agenda

One of the issues the group is expected to discuss is the global trade talks that were brought to the brink of collapse in December by a dispute between food-exporting nations, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina, and the European Community, over agricultural subsidies in Europe.
Another issue is the dollar, whose value against other major European currencies has risen by about 10 percent in the last month. Officials of the United States Treasury say they will not be unhappy if their foreign counterparts agree to try to keep the dollar from rising further.
Central bank heads from the Group of Seven are not expected to be present; the regular group meeting is set for Washington later this month.
About 30 heads of state and government will attend Monday's inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, set up a year ago to help the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe make the transition from state-run to market economies. The bank has an initial capital of $12.4 billion and the mission of encouraging the development of private business and banking institutions there.
Western delegates will expect Prime Minister Valentin S. Pavlov of the Soviet Union to outline improved conditions for Western investment in the Soviet Union, limited now by bureaucratic restrictions on repatriation of profits and currency conversion.
Jacques Attali, president-designate of the new development bank, said Thursday that about $25 trillion would probably be needed by the Soviet Union in the next 20 years. "The main portion will come from a reorganization of their own assets," he said, "but we know you cannot change overnight five centuries of command economy and bureaucracy."

HEADLINE: Long-Term Rates Decline Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Bond prices surged and long-term interest rates fell sharply yesterday, as traders bought securities in the wake of positive evidence that the recession is finally beginning to have an impact on inflation.
Market participants began buying securities almost immediately after the Government reported that the Consumer Price Index fell by one-tenth of a percentage point last month, the first monthly decline in nearly five years. 
 Moreover, excluding food and energy prices, the "core" inflation rate rose by just one-tenth of a percentage point, well below Wall Street forecasts, and a relief from the numbing increase of seven-tenths of a percentage point recorded in February.
 
 Second Good Report

It was the second good inflation report in two days. On Thursday, the Labor Deparment reported that the Producer Price Index, excluding food and energy, rose by two-tenths of a percentage point, less than half the average for the preceding two months.
Bond traders, who are especially fearful of rising inflation because it erodes the real return of long-term securities, were further encouraged that the Federal Reserve did not respond to the good news by signalling that it had lowered short-term rates.
Around midday, hours after the inflation report was released, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system at a time when the overnight Federal funds rate was trading at 5 3/8 percent, under the 6 percent level that is still regarded as the Fed's target.
For a variety of reasons, the funds rate has traded under the 6 percent level all week. It traded as low as 5 percent yesterday.
"From my perspective, the longer they wait the better," said James R. Capra, a principal at Moore Capital Management, a money management firm.
Later on, bond prices got a further lift when a Fed governor, Wayne Angell, a staunch inflation fighter, commented that the prospects for lower inflation were promising.
Predictably, not all analysts shared the conviction that the Fed has not eased policy.
 
Policy Change Seen
 "You can't unquestionably confirm it, but I think the Fed has made a policy change," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "We have seen the funds rate trade below 6 percent all week, and it seems to me the Fed has orchestrated that. And a lower funds rate is certainly justified by these last two inflation numbers."
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 30/32, up 1 1/8 points, to yield 8.14 percent, down sharply from a yield of 8.25 percent late Thursday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered in late trading at a price of 98 18/32, up by 23/32, to yield 7.96 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, up 3/32, to yield 6.84 percent.
 
Bill Rates Down

Short-term Treasury bill rates fell.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at 5.49 percent, down three basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.75 percent.
A number of corporations took advantage of the sharp drop in bond yields to price long-term issues.
Among the issuers was the ITT Corporation, which offered $150 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Salomon Brothers. The 9.5 percent bonds, which mature April 15, 2021, were priced at $98.925, to yield 9.61 percent, 1.40 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for 10 years, are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Post 0.1% Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Consumer prices edged down in March, for the first monthly decline since early 1986, the Government reported today.
It was the second encouraging inflation report in two days. On Thursday, the Government reported that producer prices fell for the fourth straight month. 
 Tumbling oil prices were the main factor in the overall price decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, but even when the wide-swinging energy and food components were excluded, the Consumer Price Index rose a scant one-tenth of 1 percent after two months of sharp advances.
 
 Reassurance on Inflation

The results, which were better than expected, provided what many analysts said was reassurance that inflation was being kept in check, reassurance they said the Federal Reserve needed to relax monetary policy another notch. This would presumably drive interest rates down again, thereby speeding economic recovery.
There was quick reaction in the credit markets, with bond prices surging and long-term interest rates falling sharply. And the report helped lift stocks, too, as the Dow industrials gained 15.34, to 2,920.79. [Page 40.]
"It took the pressure off the Fed," said Alan C. Lerner, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company. The central bank, he said, can now move to shore up the weak economy without losing credibility as an inflation fighter.
 
 Some Aberrations Seen

And Marilyn Schaja, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said, "The data suggest that the past two months' statistics were aberrations and that inflation is under control."
Yet the figures, which showed inflation running at a modest 2.4 percent annual pace for the year's first three months, do not mean that the risk of serious inflation has been eliminated.
"Core" prices, which do not count food and energy, still climbed at a 6.8 percent annual rate for the three months ended in March, up from 3.8 percent in the December quarter and 6 percent in the quarter ended last September, other analysts noted.
To some extent, said Patrick C. Jackman, a Labor Department supervisor responsible for consumer price data, the index magnified price pressures early in the year and probably understated them in March. He predicted that core inflation for the year would be about the same as the 5.2 percent posted in 1990.
"The recession will not have that much effect," Mr. Jackman said.
The March core rate was the best since December 1982, when interest rates were plummeting and the index's housing component was calculated differently from the way it is now. The overall index had not shown a decline since those of February, March and April 1986, when oil prices were collapsing because of production increases by Saudi Arabia.
 
 Producer Prices Off

On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that prices received by producers for finished goods fell three-tenths of 1 percent in March, the fourth straight decline. The core producer index rose two-tenths of 1 percent, only half as much as in February.
Today's report of subdued consumer inflation, some analysts noted, reflected the current recession -- and the slack demand that characterizes it -- but the data also gave some encouragement about a recovery.
"As the inflation rate goes down, the real value of incomes rise, which translates into stronger demand," said Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "At the same time, as inflationary expectations decline, this should facilitate a decline in long-term interest rates."
The Federal Reserve exerts some control over short-term rates, but long-term rates, a key to corporate investment and thus to business expansion, are determined by the market.
 
 Big Decline in Energy

Today's report showed a 5 percent drop in the price of petroleum-based energy, which is now 18 percent below its November peak. Sharp drops in the price of apparel and out-of-town lodging also contributed heavily to the overall decline.
Food prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month after falling five-tenths in February, mainly reflecting a sharp upturn for fruits and vegetables. The price of bananas jumped 18.6 percent, partly because of reduced supplies and partly because consumers were buying them instead of oranges, which have shown price increases of 57.8 percent this year, including another 5 percent last month, the department said.
The price of housing, the most heavily weighted element in the index, rose just one-tenth of 1 percent in March after a rise of five-tenths in February. Cable television fees jumped 1.8 percent.
The transportation component dropped 1 percent, the third straight decline of this magnitude, reflecting a 4.9 percent drop in gasoline prices and declines for used cars, automobile parts and equipment and automobile finance charges. Airline fares fell 2.5 percent, partly offsetting a 14 percent increase during the preceding six months.
 
 Decline in Apparel

Apparel fell 1.2 percent after two big increases that reflected earlier-than-usual introductions of spring wear, the department said.
Medical care rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to a level 9.5 percent above that of March 1990. Big increases were also posted for reading materials, tobacco products, legal and financial services and funeral costs.
Before rounding, the index covering all urban consumers fell 0.0740192, a rate that if sustained and compounded for 12 months would produce an annual rate of price decline of nine-tenths of 1 percent. The index stands at 135, which means that a group of goods and services that cost $10 in 1982-84 now costs $13.50.
Services, which account for nearly 55 percent of the index, rose two-tenths of 1 percent, while commodities, with just over 45 percent, fell four-tenths.
Among the five metropolitan areas for which figures are collected monthly, prices eased one-tenth of 1 percent in New York and Los Angeles while rising modestly in Philadelphia and San Francisco and by five-tenths of 1 percent in Chicago.
An alternate index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers also edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month.
The regular index's 2.4 percent annual rate of increase in the first quarter was the slowest since the third quarter of 1986, a pace far below the 6.1 percent rate recorded in 1990.
Commodities not including food and energy climbed at a 7.9 percent pace during the latest quarter, up from 3.4 percent last year.

HEADLINE: Earnings Plunge At I.B.M.

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Stung by declining sales across almost its entire hardware product line, I.B.M. said yesterday that its operating earnings plunged 48.7 percent in the first quarter of 1991 and revenue fell 4.5 percent.
The computer maker, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., sent its stock into a tailspin last month after warning Wall Street analysts that first-quarter results would fall 50 percent short of its quarterly results a year ago. Most I.B.M. watchers were predicting that first-quarter earnings would be flat. 
 The stock, which had risen to $127.875 before the company's warning on earnings, tumbled $12.75 that day. Yesterday, it fell $2.125 a share to close at $108.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was second on the most active list.
 
 In Line With Prediction
 The earnings results announced yesterday were generally in line with what the International Business Machines Corporation had predicted last month. But the company's poor performance raised questions for a number of financial analysts who suggested that the giant computer maker had erred in minimizing the difficulty surrounding its current shift to a new generation of mainframe computers.
For the first quarter of 1991, revenue amounted to $13.5 billion, down 4.5 percent from the previous year's $14.2 billion. Net earnings from operations for the three months amounted to $532 million in 1991, compared with $1.04 billion in 1990, or 93 cents a share, compared with $1.81 in 1990.
I.B.M. actually reported a net loss of $1.73 billion for the quarter, but that largely reflected a one-time accounting adjustment of $2.26 billion, or $3.96 a share, to take account of what the company expects it will eventually pay out in health benefits for retirees.
 
Part of Personnel Costs

The theory is that the eventual retirement health benefits of today's employees are part of a company's personnel costs and they should be charged against current profits even though the actual outlays are many years down the road. I.B.M. is one of the first of the nation's leading corporations to comply with the new accounting rule.
The company said it had double-digit revenue declines in a number of its product lines, including both mainframe and personal computers. The company's rapidly growing RS/6000 work station line, introduced last April, was the one positive factor in the hardware sales. But an I.B.M. spokesman said sales of those models had also been disappointing during the first quarter.
"It looks like it could get worse before it gets better," said Steven Smith, a financial analyst at Paine Webber.
Sales of computer hardware declined 17.2 percent worldwide in the quarter over the corresponding three months last year. In Europe, sales of computers were still slightly positive for the quarter, analysts said. But after subtracting for the effect of the dollar, sales also declined there.
"There was one aspect that was truly stunning," said Marc G. Schulman, an analyst at UBS Securities. "I.B.M. indicated that its PC revenues declined as much as its overall equipment revenues. I have to conclude that there is a slowing of the PC market worldwide."
Both software sales and support services, however, increased substantially in the quarter. Revenue from services grew 18.9 percent, while software sales rose 13.9 percent.
 
Confidence Shaken

The unusual weakness of I.B.M.'s first quarter seemed to shake the confidence of a number of analysts who said they were considering further rollbacks in their annual earnings estimates, lowering their forecasts significantly below last year's $10.51 a share.
The company gave no indication that it expected any significant financial improvement until the international economy improved. In a statement, I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, said, "The worldwide economic slowdown has created an uncertain and difficult business environment." He added that he believed the strength of I.B.M.'s product line would permit the company to revive quickly once the economy improved.
I.B.M. said in March that it planned to reduce worldwide employment by 14,000, or 3.8 percent, this year, but the company said yesterday that the employee cuts would not have a financial effect on the first quarter or the rest of the year.
 
No Layoffs Planned

I.B.M. shed 4,000 employees after the sale of the company's office equipment division last month. An additional 10,000 employees will be reduced through attrition. No layoffs are planned but I.B.M. will try to persuade employees to leave by offering early retirement and voluntary resignation incentives.
Several analysts said they believed that while the company has been attributing its earnings decline exclusively to the world economic climate, its product offerings may be causing it more difficulty than it is willing to acknowledge.
"They continue to blame the entire shortfall on the worldwide economy and I think that's hurting their position," said John B. Jones, Jr., an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "The survey data we have show that mainframe sales have fallen off dramatically." Earnings from mainframes make up more than half of I.B.M.'s total profits.
Mr. Jones suggested that a significant revenue decline was attributable to the delay in introduction of the most powerful members of I.B.M.'s new System/390 mainframe family. While it is now shipping air-cooled versions of the new computers, the most powerful high-speed water-cooled machines will not be available for sale until the third quarter, pushing significant revenues toward the end of the year.
An I.B.M. official disputed the suggestion that the company might be suffering the effects of a product introduction delay. He restated that the company believed its revenues were being depressed by a worldwide economic recession.
"I.B.M.'s plan for the first half of the year says flat to down," said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "That sounds like transition to me."
In the market for personal computers, which is a small but growing part of I.B.M.'s business, representing less than a fifth of its sales, Mr. Martin said that the industry had been seeing rather weak growth for the last three or four quarters and that that trend had now been compounded because the average selling price peaked last year and had now started to decline.
I.B.M. is particularly vulnerable to large-scale trends because it is the only personal computer maker that has products at every level, from cheap home personal computers to some of the largest and fastest machines that act as storage systems in office networks.

HEADLINE: SALES-TAX FUNDS DECLINE BY 8.4% IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
Sales-tax collections in New York City dropped sharply over the winter, according to figures released yesterday, raising new alarms about the city's economy, and forcing city officials to scramble to close a new gap of several hundred million in the city's current budget.
"New York City's economy is in free fall," said James W. Wetzler, the New York State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. "Whether it will continue is a matter of speculation." 
 Mr. Wetzler, who released the figures, said the first accounting of sales-tax collections for the quarter beginning in December, including the peak of the Christmas shopping season, showed that New York City sales-tax revenue fell by $55 million or 8.4 percent over the previous winter, suggesting a deep decline in local retailing.
 
'Not Seeing Any Light'
 Since then New York City retailers have reported no signs of a turnaround. The sales-tax figures, coupled with a recent $90 million drop in income-tax withholding in the city below the level forecast, suggests that the deep recession here could be getting worse, even as economists predict a turnaround in other parts of the country.
"We are not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
City officials, who had been in the midst of a methodical review of proposals to close a $3 billion gap in the $29 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1, immediately shifted their attention to a search for extraordinary measures simply to keep this year's budget in balance in the remaining 11 weeks of the current fiscal year.
Among other measures, city officials are considering closing down portions of the government and furloughing city workers, deferring wages of city employees and asking the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation to step in and provide the city with surplus funds. Such measures have been questioned in the past by the city's two bond-rating agencies.
"It is very difficult to cut the budget at this late stage in the year," said Norman Steisel, the first deputy mayor. "We have to turn a lot of buckets upside down."
Mr. Steisel said that the decline in income- and sales-tax collections alone would create a gap of $200 million in the current year. He suggested that the gap could be even worse but would not provide details.
Other officials noted that with $1.6 billion more in income and sales taxes due before the end of the fiscal year, tax receipts could fall further. And with the poor economic news likely to lead to higher welfare and Medicaid costs they said the city's budget gap could increase to $300 million this year, even after using a $150 million reserve fund in the current financial plan.
This could require a virtual halt in new hiring -- except for police officers, correction officers and teachers -- and a suspension of all but the most essential city purchases, and even this would not suffice, city officials said.
The Dinkins administration has begun seeking concessions from municipal unions in order to avert layoffs and deep service cuts in the next fiscal year. In the last few days, city officials began calling union leaders and apprising them of the worsening fiscal news in preparation for intensified negotiations.
The union leaders in turn have refused to consider concessions, questioned whether any were needed and demanded that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo intercede to help the city find cash to balance the budget. Governor Cuomo has insisted that the unions make concessions first.
In a measure of the nervousness over the worsening situation, city officials who met with Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday reported that the Mayor, known for his non-confrontational style, was growing increasingly piqued at the Governor and the State Legislature.
"The Mayor is getting increasingly frustrated with the whole scene in Albany and at the posturing of the Governor, even though the posturing is a part of an effort to be helpful to the city," said one city official, who insisted on anonymity.
Yesterday, Stanley Hill, the executive director of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, said that city officials apprised him of the declining tax receipts and called a meeting for next Tuesday, but said that union leaders were unwilling to make concessions.
 
Retailing Picks Up Elsewhere
 Mr. Wetzler said that the deep decline in sales taxes reflected a weakness in the economy, with Nassau and Suffolk Counties reporting lesser declines in tax revenue, of about 3 percent; Westchester County showing a tiny increase, and New York City the weakest of all.
He said that out of the 8.4 percent decline in the city, six percentage points were clearly the result of a falloff in sales, while the remaining percentage points appeared to result from more technical, if equally telling factors -- including the failure of several large well-known and financially troubled retailers to file quarterly sales-tax payments on time.
With the end of the Persian Gulf war, retailing has picked up in other parts of the country, and has been seen as an early sign of the winding down of the national recession.
But the falloff in income-tax witholding in the city in March suggests the opposite is happening here, though analysts say they cannot rule out the possibility that the poor results were a fluke until they review another month of data.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said that the current recession has been broader and deeper than the other recessions in the last decade, making it exceedingly difficult for economists to forecast when it might end in New York City. "The forecasts have not been very good," he said, "because there are a lot of surprises, a lot of jokers in the deck."
As a measure of the problems in retailing, he noted that of the 100,000 jobs lost in the city since the recession began in September 1989, about 37,000 were lost in the retail and wholesale trade.

HEADLINE: As Bases Are Closed, Some Towns Transform Setback Into Advantage

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
What happened to the 86 military installations that the Department of Defense planned to close or scale back in 1988 after a bruising battle with Congress over how to reduce military costs?
One closed.
Of the major installations picked for closing, only Pease Air Force Base at Newington, N. H., has actually ceased operating. And that did not happen until April 1, when the last of 3,700 military personnel and their dependents as well as 1,000 civilian employees departed the 4,255-acre base, leaving nothing but a cold Atlantic wind to whistle down the 11,300-foot runway. 
 Most of the larger bases scheduled to close or reduce operations are steadily moving in that direction, including the Presidio, overlooking San Francisco Bay, Fort Sheridan on the shores of Lake Michigan north of Chicago and Fort Dix, N.J. Fort Dix was schedfor cutbacks two years ago but has now been scheduled to have its role as a troop training center ended.
Many smaller installations -- like isolated office buildings, housing for military families and military laboratories, which accounted for two-thirds of the marked installations -- have been phased out or have completed their reductions in personnel.
 
Completion Set for 1995
 The closings and reductions, intended to save the Pentagon $5.6 billion, began in January 1990. They are scheduled to be completed by October 1995.
Civilian workers at the installations and local businesses nearby are finding themselves caught in an economic squeeze as the Pentagon order is implemented. But at the same time, local governments and local real estate concerns are scrambling to acquire the properties, hoping that they, like many others who previously have felt the impact of military belt-tightening, can turn adversity into advantage.
Also, for every community that looses troops and, by extension, money, another gains. For example, communities in South Carolina, Kentucky and Missouri stand to profit from the shifting of Fort Dix's troop training operations to bases in those states.
 
Plans to Meet the Schedule
 The pace of the closings and reductions ordered in 1988 has not moved more rapidly, military and Congressional officials say, because of time-consuming logistical details, not foot-dragging. Not only must uniformed personnel and major pieces of equipment be transferred to new bases but equipment and other material left behind must be disposed of safely. That includes dangerous toxics and military refuse that have accumulated over the years in various base dumps and pits.
"The task will be completed, on time, and there's no stopping it," said Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman. "But there are a great many details involved, particularly in shutting down a large base and making sure a safe environment is left."
A study conducted in early 1990 by the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment of 100 base closings over the past 30 years found that the net effect was often positive over the long term, despite initial short-term economic pain.
 
Civilian Employment Improved
 Three-fourths of the closed installations were acquired at minimal cost by local governments or private business and were converted to office and industrial parks or were used to house educational institutions. Many of the air bases became municipal airports.
In the end, the study found, civilian employment on the former military sites climbed more than 50 percent above what it had been when the Pentagon was running things.
Many of the community recovery efforts the study found in earlier closings are under way at bases being closed or reduced in size under the 1988 order. For example, several Southern California communities near George Air Force Base, east of Los Angeles, already are competing to acquire that installation, hoping to turn it into a commercial airport that will improve the region's economy.
"The history of base closings has been that many communities often prosper in the long run, though jobs and income are lost at first," said Andrew A. Feinstein, a base specialist on the staff of the House Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities. "Many bases have excellent buildings and roads and other infastructure that can be turned around for community use. When the Government surrenders the bases, the cost to the buyer is usually minimal, or maybe even nil if the buyer is a local government."
 
U.S. Agencies Get First Choice
 Initially, a base bein closed is offered to any other Federal agency, including another branch of the armed services, that can make a case that it needs the land and buildings.
In the case of the Presidio, which sits on one of the most spectacular pieces of real estate in the country, an agreement has been reached to incorporate the site in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
If no other Federal agency seeks a closed base from the Pentagon, the property can be sought by state and local agencies and governments, as in the case of George Air Force Base. If there is no state or local government interest in the property, it can be sold to private interests like a developer.
"No matter who gets the property in the end," Mr. Feinstein said, "the Federal Government hardly ever recovers its original investment in land and buildings."

GRAPHIC: Chart: COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN
Twelve dates in the base closing process
 
April-June -- The Defense Base Closure Realignment Commision holds public hearings on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposals.
 
July 1 -- The Commision sends its recommendations to the President.
 
July 15 -- Deadline for the President to either accept the list, reject it, or return it to the commision for revision. If he rejects it, the process stops. If he returns it, the commision has four more weeks to revise the list to satisfy the White House. Once the President approves the list, he sends it to Congress, which has 45 legislative days to reject it before it takes effect. Congress cannot modify the list. If Congress rejects the plan, no bases will be closed.
 
Aug. 15 -- Deadline for the commision to submit a new report, if the President disapproves the first one.
 
Sept. 1 -- Deadline for President to approve or disapprove a revised commision report. If the President disapproves, no bases will be closed. If he approves, he sends it to congress for action.

The Economy
Consumer prices edged down in March, for the first monthly decline since early 1986, the Government reported. Tumbling oil prices were the main factor in the 0.1 percent decline, but even the "core" rate rose a scant 0.1 percent after two months of sharp advances. [37.] 
 Stocks of unsold goods held by businesses fell in February while sales rose, the Commerce Department said, in a sign that inventories were being held tightly in check. [38.]
 
Companies
I.B.M. said its operating earnings plunged 48.7 percent in the quarter and revenue fell 4.5 percent. The company has been stung by declining sales across almost its entire hardware product line. I.B.M. actually reported a net loss of $1.73 billion, but that largely reflected an accounting adjustment. [37.]
RJR Nabisco has fundamental problems in its tobacco business. And the company counts heavily on cigarette revenue to help pay off its remaining debt and stem yearly earnings losses. The company's problems center on an especially sharp drop in the sales of full-price brands. [37.]
A European consortium pressed ahead with its offer to acquire Executive Life, while policy holders and other customers tried to assess their risk of losses. [37.]
The collapse of Executive Life will prod the House to try to impose Federal regulations on the insurance industry, lawmakers and their aides said. [41.]
Wells, Rich, Greene lost the $20 million Benson & Hedges account to Leo Burnett after a long battle to hang onto it. The shift is a significant blow to the agency, which helped create the brand's image as a hip cigarette when it was introduced in 1966. [37.]
Consumers Union suspended its chief financial officer, saying he had been involved in a commission-kickback scheme. [39.]
Microsoft said the F.T.C. had expanded an investigation of its competitive practices. [39.]
Many restaurants no longer accept American Express cards because the fees are too high. Consumer's World. [50.]
 
International
Germany's banks are discovering credit cards after decades of scorning them as a plastic plague threatening the nation's economic health. [37.]
When heads of state and finance ministers gather in London, the focus is expected to be on Eastern Europe's difficult transition from Communism to capitalism and the growing political and economic chaos in the Soviet Union. [38.]
 
Markets
Bond prices surged and long-term interest rates fell sharply, as traders reacted to evidence that the recession is finally having an impact on inflation. [40.]
The stock market ended the week on a strong note, with three leading indexes posting records. The Dow rose 15.34, to 2,920.79, for a gain of 24.01 for the week. [40.]
The dollar advanced worldwide in erratic trading despite new economic data widely interpreted as setting the stage for a lowering of American interest rates. [45.]
Cotton futures rallied strongly as a surge of buying erased the previous day's losses. [45.]
 
Today's Columns
The owners of closely held businesses who have planned for an orderly succession may have unwittingly set a trap, but the situation can be rectified. Your Money. [38.]
An air-conditioner that blows air over ice has been patented by a New Jersey company. High technology it's not, but the inventors see many advantages. Patents. [38.]

HEADLINE: Plan to Close Bases Is Met With Protests From Affected States

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney faced an expected wave of Congressional protest today as he formally announced his recommendation to close 31 major military installations.
House Armed Services Committee analysts estimated that the closings would wipe out nearly 70,000 military and civilian jobs by 1997, or 3.3 percent of the 2.1 million military and civilian personnel serving in the United States. The Pentagon runs 485 installations around the country. 
 Mr. Cheney expressed understanding for the outcries by lawmakers from the 20 states affected by the move, but he said that if local opinion was allowed to prevail it would be impossible to close any bases.
"The fact is that a shrinking budget clearly requires us to make some hard choices and to establish priorities," Mr. Cheney said at a Pentagon news conference today. "We have to concentrate on unglamorous things in the future, like operations and maintenance, if we're going to maintain a combat-ready force."
The Pentagon plan, which goes to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission for further review and action, must be approved by President Bush and Congress before taking effect.
But the plan, which hits California, Arkansas and Indiana the hardest, must first survive the lobbying efforts of members of Congress. Many denounced the plan today, while lawmakers from areas where bases will remain open praised Mr. Cheney's wisdom and claimed victory to home state voters.
"This is a terrible recommendation," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, where more than 5,500 employees stand to lose their jobs at England Air Force Base.
 
'Dodged a Bullet'
 "The Pentagon's recommendation is unwise, unfair and unacceptable," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said of the plan to close Fort Devens in his home state.
In contrast, Senator Wendell H. Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, praised Mr. Cheney for sparing Fort Knox, near Louisville. "In a time of scarce defense dollars and base closures all across this country, I think Kentuckians can take heart that we dodged a bullet today," Mr. Ford said.
Arkansas would be hardest hit in percentage terms by Mr. Cheney's plan, losing 7,000 jobs, or 49 percent of its military-related employees, with the closing of Eaker Air Force Base and Fort Chafee. Indiana would lose more than 8,000 military and civilian jobs with the closing of Fort Benjamin Harrison and the Grissom Air Force Base, nearly 40 percent of its military-related personnel.
California stands to lose the most jobs, however, with nearly 27,000 military and civilian personnel who would be affected with the closing of major installations like Fort Ord, a sprawling base on valuable seaside property near Monterey. In its report, the Pentagon estimated that the shutdown of Fort Ord would result in a loss of 17.5 percent of jobs in the surrounding community.
 
Disappointment and Relief
 Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he was displeased but not surprised by the decision to close Fort Ord, which lies in his home district. "At the same time, there is a certain relief in knowing that this year, one way or another, this issue will finally be decided," he said.
As part of the plan, Mr. Cheney will also ask the commission to close 12 minor installations and reduce or realign 28 others. Mr. Cheney defended the overall reduction plan as a necessary step toward bringing the military infrastructure in line with its personnel, which he said would decline by 25 percent by 1995.
The secretary said any charges that he factored political considerations into the decision process were "goofy."
"There is nothing to be gained by a Secretary of Defense trying to play base closings for some political purpose," said Mr. Cheney, asserting that budget cuts had prompted the base closings and would force 521,000 layoffs by 1996, nearly the number of troops sent to the Persian Gulf.
 
No Partisan Protests
 Despite protests from some lawmakers today, Mr. Cheney's decisions raised little of the broader-based political protests that followed his 1990 plan to close 86 military sites. Then, Democratic lawmakers charged they were disproportionately hurt by the proposed closings, and the plan was scrapped.
The Democratic Study Group praised the recommendations as "serious and credible," and Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the list "at first glance appears to be fair."
Analysts for Mr. Aspin's committee determined that 60 percent of the large bases to be closed were in Democratic districts and 37 percent were in Republican districts. The remaining 3 percent is accounted for in one base that straddles two districts represented by one member of each party.
But the analysts determined that when Pentagon-recommended transfers and reductions were factored in, districts represented by Democrats would absorb almost 70 percent of the personnel losses.
The recommendation to close the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Naval Station would cost Pennsylvania 20 percent of its military jobs, and some of the angriest reaction to the Cheney plan came from Representative Thomas M. Foglietta, a Democrat who represents that district.
"This is unfair and unjust," he said.
 
Spending to Save
 Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat of South Carolina, was equally blunt. "This decision just doesn't make sense," he said, criticizing Mr. Cheney's decision to include the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base on his list. "Myrtle Beach's A-10 Warthogs won the gulf war, and now the Administration is shutting them down."
Mr. Cheney estimated that the closings he had recommended would cost $5.7 billion over the next five years but save $6.5 billion over the same period. After 1998, the Pentagon estimates, reduced operating costs would save $1.7 billion each year.
"There is no question that it costs money up front," Mr. Cheney said. "It's like a large business enterprise. It costs money to save money."
Mr. Aspin predicted Congress would accept whatever the commission recommended.
The commission, an eight-member panel headed by James A. Courter, a former Republican Congressman from New Jersey, will formally receive Mr. Cheney's recommendations on Monday. The panel will then hold public hearings and review Mr. Cheney's findings, which it can amend.
The panel will send its report to the President on July 1, and Mr. Bush will have two weeks to consider the report. If he approves it, it will be sent on to Congress, which must accept or reject the entire list.
Mr. Cheney said closings were under way at 198 foreign bases, action that did not require Congressional review. He said 24 other bases abroad could be closed after further consultation with allies.
The Defense Secretary said he accepted the recommendations on closings passed on to him by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force with little alteration. He has also recommended through a separate process that reductions be made in the Army Corps of Engineers.
By law, the services are directed to choose bases for shutdown based on military value, the return on investment and the economic impact on the communities in which they are located. But Mr. Cheney stressed today that military considerations received preference.
"My first obligation as secretary is to provide for the nation's defense," he said. "And the judgments and decisions the departments, the services have made were driven first and foremost by military value, not by economic considerations, although economic factors were taken into account."
This rationale provided little comfort for several lawmakers who were headed to their home districts today with a vow to fight for their local bases.
"It is important to understand that the Secretary of Defense's recommendation for base closings is only the first step in the process," said Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., is on the Cheney list and would lose 3,800 employees.
Mr. Nunn said he would lobby to retain Moody and was "puzzled" by the Air Force's decision to include it on the list.
Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, while noting it would be "hypocritical" to welcome base closings everywhere but in his state, criticized the decision to close two installations and shrink two other minor facilities. More than 8,000 military and civilian employees would be affected, according to the Pentagon.
"This is a difficult proposal to swallow," Senator Coats said.
 
Citing Roles in Gulf War
 Most lawmakers representing regions affected by Mr. Cheney's announcement cited the districts' contributions to the Persian Gulf war as a reason to keep the bases open.
Mr. Kennedy cited Fort Devens's role in the conflict and accused the Pentagon of violating the 1988 base closing commission's recommendation to keep the base open.
"I regard today's action as a serious breach of faith by the Administration in its dealings with Congress," Mr. Kennedy said.
Mr. Cheney, who said he has entertained a stream of phone calls and visits from lawmakers in anticipation of the base closing announcements, said he has "enormous sympathy" for the affected communities.
But he rejected arguments that it would be more costly to close down facilities than to leave them open.
"Under that rationale," he said, "the solution for my budget problems is to open bases all over America."

HEADLINE: Labels That Tell the Testing Story

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Opponents of animal testing are urging companies that do not use animals in testing new products to say so on product packages.
Two national groups are involved in the effort, the Humane Society and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, known as PETA. The groups have somewhat different philosphies: PETA, for example, is a vegetarian organization; the Humane Society is not. But both groups hope to end all use of animals in tests of cosmetics and other personal-care products. 
The labels show drawings of rabbits, an animal used frequently to test cosmetics, and either say or convey by image the fact that animals have not been used to test the product.
Some manufacturers use tests on animals to make sure that a product is safe. For example, a sample of a new product may be placed in the eye of a rabbit to see whether it produces irritability and if, so how much. Sometimes a product is fed to an animal to see how large a dose is poisonous.
In recent years, opponents of such testing have argued that alternatives to the use of animals exist. And some companies have replaced animal experiments with other tests that use tissue cultures or computer models.
Thus far, the labeling campaigns, which began last year, are proving a mixed success. Several corporations such as the Body Shop and Tom's of Maine have started labeling their products with anti-animal testing certifications from PETA or the Humane Society.
But though some major cosmetics producers such as Avon Products Inc. and Revlon Group Inc. have stopped animal testing, they have decided not to label their products.
"We are not using the fact that we are not testing on animals as a marketing tool," said Elaine Benvenuto, a spokeswoman for Avon. Dan Moriarty, a spokesman for Revlon, said that company does not use endorsements or certifications from outside groups in marketing products.
 
Health and Safety
 Some comestics industry executives oppose to an end to animal testing, asserting that it remains a vital safeguard, particularly where the testing of new product ingredients is concerned.
"For ingredients already in use, some companies can rely wholly on existing data and the judgments of scientists and non-animal tests," said Irene Melbin, a spokeswoman for the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, a trade group in Washington. "But for products formulated from new ingredients, you can't abandon animal testing and assure human health and safety."
PETA opposes animal testing for any reasons and is also against the use of animal byproducts in commerical products, said Kathy Snow Guillermo, a spokeswoman for the Group.
For its part, the Humane Society does not oppose drug testing involving animals or the use of animal parts as product ingredients. "If you are going to eat the animal, you might as well be using all the animal," said Ms. Mitternight.
The groups also use somewhat differing criteria to determine whether a company will get to use its label. If a company wants to use its label, PETA requires that the company's suppliers of ingredients also not test on animals. That is a requirement that the Humane Society does not make.
The PETA label is used by about 30 companies, who are charged from $100 to $1,000 for its use; the Humane Society, whose label is used by 26 companies, charges up to several thousand dollars, said Ms. Mitterwald, who declined to provide a specific cost range.
Many companies that use the labels sell their goods principally through health food stores, drug stores and supermarkets. Some companies choose to advertise that their products do not use ingredients tested on animals but do not use either group's label.
Although many large corporations have jumped on the environmental marketing bandwagon, most larger cosmetics companies are taking a wait-and-see approach before using animal testing as a major marketing issue.
Part of the reason is a desire by many companies not to raise an unpleasant subject with products that often use fantasy as their strongest selling point. Revlon, for example, uses the phrase "non-animal tested formulas" in promoting it New Age Natural lines of cosmetics, but not with other lines that are also not tested on animals.
 
Pending Litigation
 The case of Carme Inc. shows some of the rancor the issue is producing. For many years, Carme operated as an independent company producing popular shampoos and other personal-care products that were not tested on animals under such labels as Biotene, Jojoba Farms, Mill Creek and Country Road.
But when Carme was acquired in 1989 by the International Research and Development Corporation, which operates laboratories in which animals are used to test the safety of pharmaceuticals, opponents of animal testing moved to organize a boycott of Carme products. International Research fought back with a lawsuit against, among others, a distributor of natural products, claiming economic interference with its business. The suit is pending.
Officials of International Research said in interviews that they have tried for eight months to get the Humane Society to act on Carme's application to use the group's label on its product, but that their efforts have been ignored.
Ms. Mitternight, the Humane Society spokesman, declined to comment on the situation.

HEADLINE: More Restaurants Are Just Saying No to American Express

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Consumers across the country are leaving home without their American Express cards because many restaurants are no longer accepting them. The fees for the card, restaurateurs say, are too high.
The restaurants include places like Jasper's in Boston, Cafe Provencal in the Chicago area and Orso in New York and Los Angeles. Most are white-linen restaurants, although others are casual. 
 "You're talking about some serious money," said Joe Allen, owner of Orso, as well as the restaurants bearing his name in New York and Paris, which also do not accept the American Express card. Orso serves moderately priced Italian food while Joe Allen serves moderately priced American food.
Diners can still charge their meals at establishments that do not take American Express, but they have to use other credit cards, like Visa or Mastercard. Many restaurants will also set up house accounts for regular customers who can then simply sign their checks.
Many of the restaurants that dropped the Amex green and gold cards say they also will not honor the Optima card, the revolving credit card issued by American Express. Executives of those restaurants say the commission charged on Optima cards is also too high, compared with the charges on Visa and Mastercard cards issued by banks and other financial institutions.
Some restaurants that now accept the American Express card are planning to stop or are considering dropping it.
According to The Nilson Report, a Los Angeles credit-card newsletter, the commission on American Express charges, also known as the discount rate, ranges from 2 1/2 percent to 5 percent of the amount charged by diners, as against 1 1/4 percent to 3 1/2 percent charged by bank cards.
 
Percentage Varies With Volume
 The percentage typically declines as the volume rises, so that the smallest restaurants pay the biggest commissions.
Still, the large rate difference between American Express on one hand and Visa or Mastercard on the other angers restaurant owners.
Many of them have long expressed resentment about the high American Express fees, but in the last year or so, the complaints have grown in volume and intensity as the recession gained strength and as Americans sharply reduced spending on dining outside the home. Restaurant owners began re-evaluating their expenses and seeking lower prices from suppliers.
When American Express refused requests to lower its fees, restaurants in Boston, Atlanta, Washington and other cities said that they were dropping the card or that they intended to do so.
"I will not carry the American Express card after April 15," said Jasper White, owner of Jasper's in Boston, an expensive American-style restaurant. "We're paying 2 percent extra, and that is on the gross, including tips and state taxes. It's not worth it to me to carry it any longer."
Officials at American Express say they are aware of the concern about the fees. But they note that American Express has been planning for a year and a half to adjust commissions and that it will announce a new fee schedule by May 1. And Norma Arnold, senior vice president for marketing, said that by focusing purely on rates, restaurants ignored other important factors in comparing cards.
"We acknowledge that we have a premium rate, but we provide extra services," she said. These include promotions like making a list of card holders available to participating establishments.
Ms. Arnold added that American Express did not charge for having the transaction approved or for some other services that restaurants pay extra for when they use bank cards.
Restaurants that dropped the American Express card are unpersuaded by this argument.
In Atlanta, Brad Saltz, chief financial officer of Houston's Restaurants, a chain of 22 moderately priced American-style establishments, said the company discontinued the American Express card last month for only one reason: the commission is higher than those of the bank cards.
In the Washington area, John Laytham, an owner of Clyde's, a group of moderately priced American-style restaurants, said, "We opened a new restaurant six weeks ago and decided not to use American Express there." His company operates seven other restaurants that do accept the card. He said the new Clyde's, in Reston, Va., "has been doing very, very well and the complaints from customers have been pretty minimal."
One of the sharpest protests against American Express was made by Cafe Provencal, a high-priced French restaurant in Evanston, Ill., that dropped the card about 11 months ago. "I decided I didn't need them as much as they needed me," said Andrew Reis, the owner.
Mr. Reis went further by posting a sign on his front door showing the American Express card with a red line through it. The sign also says: "For several reasons, including the reneging on the original commitments made to this merchant, Cafe Provencal no longer accepts the American Express card. Cafe Provencal will gladly make alternative payment arrangements with any customer who expected to pay with American Express."
Some restaurateurs who continuing to accept American Express think that the difference between its rates and those of the bank cards is too large. "They're entitled to be higher than the other guys, but are they entitled to be twice that of the other guys?" asked Richard Melman, president of Lettuce Entertain You, a chain of 30 inexpensive theme restaurants based in Chicago. "I don't think so."
In Atlanta, John Bolen, finance director of Peasant Restaurants, a chain of 18 restaurants that includes upscale and casual places, said: "I don't think most customers know that restaurants also pay a fee when a customer uses a card. We are now in some discussions with American Express about the level of their rate."
Credit cards have been used by Americans since 1915 and are now a $366 billion annual business in the United States. RAM Research, a credit-card research company, reports that more than five million establishments around the world accept Visa and Mastercard and about four million accept American Express. Experts say most holders of American Express cards also have at least one bank card.
All of these cards are used for many other purchases besides restaurant meals. But stores, theaters and mail-order companies, for example, do not seem to be voicing the same resentment against American Express's commissions.
Specialists in the credit-card field say several restaurants that considered dropping American Express over the years have hesitated because so many expense account diners use the card for business purposes. "Somebody may not want to put that purchase on their personal credit card," said Kurt T. Peters, editor of Credit Card News, a trade publication.
American Express officials say one step they will take soon will be to institute a two-tier pricing mechanism. The company plans to charge half of a percentage point less to restaurants that file credit data through electronic terminals than to those that use paper slips and imprinters. Officials say the program was successful in a test.
"We haven't raised our rates in 13 years," Ms. Arnold said. "In the Northeast particularly, we want to develop business-building strategies with restaurants."
 
Rebellion in the Northeast
 Yet it is in the Northeast, especially Boston, where the movement to drop American Express seems to be showing its greatest strength, taking on the nature of a rebellion or boycott.
A group of Boston restaurateurs met with American Express representatives on March 29, but no firm decisions about pricing were reached. Now some of the restaurant owners plan to announce whether they will accept the card on May 1, depending on what American Express does or does not do at that time.
Steve Di Fillippo, owner of three Davio's Northern Italian Restaurants, which range from informal to formal dining in the Boston area, said that more than 50 Boston restaurants would independently stop carrying the card unless the discount was cut.
"A whole city has banded together," said Mr. Di Fillippo, who has been a leader among the protesters. "If nobody takes it, how can it hurt me?"
And Lydia Shire, owner of Biba, a moderately priced American restaurant in Boston, which dropped American Express on April 1, said: "We're under a lot of pressure to be competititve. We'll take all other different forms of payment, including cash, and we'll even take a check."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Neighborhood Stores;
Columbia Street Tips Hat to Commerce

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
EVEN an optimist would be hard-pressed to make the case that Columbia Street in South Brooklyn will recover the commercial vibrancy it enjoyed years ago. For Destiny has dealt it a series of blows.
First came the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in the late 1940's, dividing Brooklyn at Hicks Street and isolating the Columbia Street district. Then came the movement toward containerization in the shipping industry, which shifted waterfront activity out of South Brooklyn, mainly to New Jersey. 
 Then there was the disruption of a new city interceptor sewer built deep in the watery ground below Columbia Street. The decisive blow was the collapse of several buildings during that work, causing fatalities and widespread property condemnations and vacancies. Commerce shifted, primarily to Court Street.
But in the 80's housing development gradually led the comeback of population and property values along Columbia Street. Now there is a tentative sign of retail revival -- usually a laggard behind housing's heel.
It is showing itself currently in the fifth and final phase of a 212-unit, low-rise condominium development known as Columbia Terrace, built on land acquired from the city. The development is offering four stores for sale as retail condominiums, as well as 32 residential condominiums. Retail condominiums as part of a city-assisted low-rise condominium are a rarity.
"They may be ahead of their time on Columbia Street," said Frederick W. Hilles Jr., who certainly hopes not, since he is offering the 850-square-foot spaces for about $100 a square foot. The residential condominiums of Columbia Terrace, on the other hand, are part of the steady march of residential resurgence in the entire stretch from Atlantic Avenue to Hamilton Avenue on the harbor side of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
Recession has restrained the march. One sign of it is the struggle of a 70-unit converted warehouse called 63 Tiffany Place to sell half its units so that a condominium plan can be declared effective and buyers moved in. The developer, the Cuneo-Leider Management and Development Corporation, has meanwhile put two other condonominium conversion plans on hold.
The commercial side takes on a special interest because commercial projects are so unusual as part of city-assisted for-sale housing developments. Occasionally a few stores will be built in the base of a high-rise, as at the Harlem Gateway condominium built in the mid-80's opposite the northwest corner of Central Park in Manhattan. New commercial condominiums as part of a low-rise development can fairly be described as experimental.
Forcefully encouraged by Community Board 6, Mr. Hilles has become the experimenter.
"In this phase it was very much the sentiment of the community and the board that the project should offer come commercial space," said Robert Acito, district manager of Community Board 6, which covers South Brooklyn and Park Slope. "There is a vision that one day Columbia Street will recapture what it once was -- a thriving commercial street with a dense residential population."
SO Mr. Hilles has built stores at the base of four of the development's 12 three-story attached town houses. Two of the stores are in a simple freestanding brick building on Union Street, in appearance an extension of the older stores lining that commercial sidestreet. The others are at the Union and President Street corners of the residential strip along Columbia Street. These houses present their rear facade to the tree-lined block of Columbia Street between Union and President Streets. The fronts face a private common area at the interior of the property, which is entered through gates on the sidestreets. The development provides no on-site parking.
An incentive for a buyer of a store is that it qualifies, like the housing itself, for 20 years of frozen property taxes under the Section 421a tax abatement program. "Imagine a commercial owner having real estate taxes fixed at $5 or $6 a month for 20 years," said Mr. Hilles.
Frank Mattioli, for one, imagined it, liked the idea and bought the space at the Union Street corner for a showroom and storage area for his Arden Painting Corporation. He is a 38-year-old artisan who arrived from Italy in 1967 and worked in a family painting business on President Street for some years. He established his own firm three years ago and now has 14 people working for him, mainly doing specialty work in glazing, gold-leaf and marble treatments for the likes of Luciano Pavarotti and Pia Lindstrom.
"I prefer to own my own property so no one can kick me out or raise my rent," he said.
The store buyer who can afford to put in, say, $30,000 in cash for a 850-square-foot space selling for $85,000 can come away with monthly occupancy costs of about $550, Mr. Hilles said. A bank can be expected to make a loan for a store at about two-thirds of the property's value. The buyer might be an investor who rents out the space.
MR. HILLES, who is in partnership with Nicholas Lembo, a contractor and developer in Brooklyn, has developed condominiums on Columbia Street since 1984 in the four earlier phases of Columbia Terrace. They began selling for $57,000 under the Federal Section 235 program. The market proved strong enough to allow unsubsidized sales in later phases. People lined up to buy, Mr. Hilles said.
Phase 4 was sold at prices of $124,000 to $142,000, with State of New York Mortgage Agency loans. Phase 5 was put under the development auspices of the New York Housing Partnership, which makes it likely that buyers will have incomes between $36,000 and $53,000. The Partnership began taking applications in March, with occupancy expected by late summer.
Retail space in conjunction with new assisted housing usually is not possible, according to Kathryn Wylde, president of the Housing Partnership, because the obtainable rents are generally not high enough to support the cost of construction. "There is no government aid program to finance new construction of retail space," she said. "On Columbia Street it was felt that the government was responsible for destroying retail space so it ought to be rebuilt."
It is not unusual for New York City to seek out ground-floor store uses in the reconstruction of smaller city-owned buildings in retailing locations, however. Carroll Gardens Association, under the chairmanship of Salvatore Scotto, has sponsored the restoration and rental of four mixed-use buildings at Columbia and DeGraw Streets. Three of the stores have been rented out -- to a butcher, a liquor store and the owner of a street-cart vending operation. Eleven residential tenants live upstairs.
The association also expects to renovate a larger city-owned building with 24 apartments and five stores at DeGraw and Kane Streets. "We will be the largest single owner of commercial property on Columbia Street," Mr. Scott said.
At least 450 new families have come to the area as a result of conversions, rehabilitations and new construction, according to Bette Stoltz, executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation. The conversions, in midrise warehouse buildings, provide no retail space.
THE first major conversion, at One Tiffany Place, sold out in the mid-80's at average prices of $190 a square foot, said Andrew Leider, one of the principals in the development group. Since then the sales slowdown have left it uncertain when the second 70-unit building will be able to open. Listed prices start at $157,000 for one-bedrooms and $219,000 for two-bedrooms.
Retail rents in the area run from about $6 to $8 a square foot a year, said Frank Manzione, who has a real estate office at 223 Columbia Street. "We need a pharmacy, a florist, a shoe store, a drygoods store, a liquor store, a restaurant," he said.
If they want to come, Greg O'Connell will be ready. He bought two small buildings on Columbia Street from the city 15 years ago and only recently began to renovate them.
"We've been holding them," he said. "We didn't want to be the lone wolf. But this year the industry is slow and we need work for the men, so we're renovating them." There will be a store below and three apartments above.

HEADLINE: Cryptozoologists Stalk Elusive Beasts

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
DID a sea serpent visit New Haven harbor in 1896? Do strange big cats roam Connecticut today? Where on Lake Champlain might the legendary monster Champ raise its head? And what's new with Sasquatch, the creature said to leave huge footprints across the Pacific Northwest?
Several Connecticut residents say they love trying to answer those questions. They are members of the International Society of Cryptozoology, an organization devoted to investigating what it calls "all matters related to animals of unexpected form or size or unexpected occurrence in time or space." Cryptozoology means the study of hidden animals, and the professional and amateur scientists who belong to the society study any clues they can find of Champ, Sasquatch and other notable mysteries. 
 J. Richard Greenwell, secretary of the International Society of Cryptozoology at its headquaters in Tucson, Ariz., said he has searched in African swamps for a dinosaurlike creature and in China for a wild man. Other society members, like Gary Mangiacopra of Milford, scour library stacks for accounts of unexpected animals.
Cryptozoologists note that several recognized animals once caught scientists by surprise. In 1938, for instance, Comoro Island fishermen found in their nets a strange, hideous fish that turned out to be a coelacanth, which was presumed to have been extinct for 60 million years. The megamouth shark, a new species, was discovered in 1976.
 
Generally Undaunted
 Such findings should encourage people to view cryptozoology with some seriousness, society members said. But they are used to, and generally undaunted by, other responses.
Cryptozoologists "get a lot of laughs, but they just point out that they're doing it scientifically," said Quentin Keynes, a society member from England who lives part of the year in Riverton. Mr. Keynes, a great-grandson of Charles Darwin and a nephew of the economist John Maynard Keynes, called himself a professional explorer and said he is driven by "intellectual curiosity."
Mr. Keynes makes documentary films about his travels, including one about the Comoro Islands. "I got involved in the coelacanth fish business," he said. "It's my kind of thing."
Russ Kinne, a photographer and writer in New Canaan who has made several trips to the Pacific Northwest to seek Sasquatch, joined the society when it was founded in 1982."Science, with a capital S," may not recognize the huge creatures reported, but never found, over centuries, he said. But scientists should not have the attitude that "we don't find them, so they don't exist," he said. "My bottom line is, it's worth investigating."
Jameston Deveroux of Hamden is another society members and fan of the elusive giant of the Northwest, also known as Big Foot.
"As young teens," in Oregon, "my friend and I were going to be the ones who found Big Foot," Mr. DEveroux recalled. Still fascinated by the subject, he said, he is dismayed by supermarket newspaper headlines like "Sasquatch Jumped Into a U.F.O. and Took Off With Me."
 
'Seen by 200 People'
 Mr. Mangiacopra, a graduate student in biology at Southern Connecticut State University, has spent years researching sightings of unusual water-dwelling creatures. He has unearthed old newspaper stories like that of a sea serpent reported off Lighthouse Point in New Haven on the sunny afternoon of July 19, 1896. "It was seen by 200 people, for half an hour," he said.
He said he has also corresponded with viewers of odd beasts at sea, like the captain of a fishing vessel who sent him a sketch of a 40-foot creature with a mane and bulging eyes that he said he observed in 1957 off the Grand Banks near Newfoundland. Mr. Mangiacopra has written magazine articles on such sightings and is working on a book about them.
In the late 1980's, he also traveled to Lake Champlain to join a team using sonar to determine the water's depth at places where appearances of Champ had been reported.
"Those appearances occurred where the lake was shallow," said Mr. Mangiacopra, adding that such information bolstered the reports' validity.
William Konrad, a retired electronics engineer who lives in Niantic, brought his own sonar equipment to aid the hunt for Champ. "I was only about one-third thinking that there was such a thing, but it was fun to do," said Mr. Konrad, who, although not a member of the International Society of Cryptozoology, helped write an article on the sonar tracking for the group's journal.
Mr. Mangiacopra also keeps a thick file on sightings of wild, unidentified felines in Connecticut. Those reports also intrigue Mr. Deveroux, he said, adding that as a youth in Florida he dreamed of finding the Skunk Ape that is said to stalk the Everglades. Now, he said, he's ready for the Connecticut catamount.
 
'Enormous Scientific Interest'
 "If there was a sighting in Connecticut today, I'd be up tomorrow looking for it," said Mr. Deveroux. "There are lots of things that exist that we just do not have evidence on yet."
Mr. Kinne, a nature photographer, said he will return to the Northwest in the spring to search for Sasquatch.
"I've never come out and flatly said, 'I believe these creatures exist,' " said Mr. Kinne. But, he said, "if they do exist, they're of enormous scientific interest."
Both Mr. Kinne and Mr. Keynes have studied a film that has become a sort of cryptozoology classic, shot in the 1960's by a Northwesterner who died a few years ago. It shows Sasquatch -- or some hairy, hulking creature. Both men said the film seemed legitimate.
"The film was not monkeyed with," said Mr. Keynes. "But, that's not to say it wasn't a man in a monkey suit." Still, he said, "no one has ever come forward and said, 'If you pay me $5,000, I'll tell you how I got up in the monkey suit.' "
As in most matters cryptozoological, the definitive answer remains hidden. Most of the society's 900 or so members have jobs and other responsibilities that limit their pursuits of nature's truth. The society "lives on a shoestring," said Mr. Keynes. But he has tried to help. "I've made a lot of people join," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: SoHo Hotels;
Moving Beyond the Talking Stage

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
HOTELS have been the talk of SoHo since the early 1980's. That is all they have been. Now, however, two young developers have come forward with a project at Mercer and Prince Streets that they say is fully financed and ready to begin.
Two other hotel projects that have won city approval are stalled for want of financing. One would face both West Broadway and Wooster Street, between Prince and Houston Streets. The other would be on Houston Street, between Greene and Mercer Streets. 
 Both delayed projects would be new from the ground up. In contrast, the two young developers, Andre T. Balazs and Campion A. Platt, would create their hotel out of an abandoned six-story, 103-year-old, red-brick Romanesque Revival building. The hotel, to be known as the Mercer, would have 81 rooms (including three in a new roof penthouse), a 90-seat restaurant, meeting rooms, a pharmacy and other small stores. The design team includes Harman Jablin Architects, Serge Becker and Tsao & McKown Architects, all of Manhattan.
"We plan to begin construction, probably in two weeks," said Mr. Balazs, who may be best known in New York as a partner in the M.K. nightclub on lower Fifth Avenue.
Neither he nor Mr. Platt, both of whom are in their early 30's, has ever developed a hotel before, although Mr. Balazs said they acquired the well-known Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood last year.
Their $33 million SoHo project is being financed by debt and equity. The lender, Mr. Balazs said, is a Japanese bank called F.A.D., which he said was "very active in home mortgages." Mr. Balazs said he and Mr. Platt are among a group of individual investors that includes a Japanese real-estate developer and financier, a Japanese retail and clothing executive, a Japanese architect and a Hong Kong hotelier.
The property was bought two years ago, for $8.2 million, from the real-estate developer Lewis Futterman. "I think he had some plans to do something along the same lines," Mr. Balazs said. "For years, it's been an obvious choice for a hotel."
One of the biggest obstacles to hotels has not been zoning, which allows them as a matter of right in SoHo, but rather local opposition. Neighbors fear that hotels would transform SoHo into an ersatz tourist district, with traffic jamming the streets and rents rising beyond the means of residents, artists and galleries.
"There is, I think, a very, very legitimate fear of the crass commercialization of SoHo," Mr. Balazs said. "It has stabilized as a legitimate business-residential community, as opposed to a shopping phenomenon. I find that very heartening because that's certainly the premise behind the hotel -- that this is a burgeoning, vital community that has its own spirit and deserves its own focal point."
Although Community Board 2 approved the developers' request for a special permit allowing hotel, retail and restaurant use on the ground and cellar floors, it did so by a vote of 19 to 9, stressing that its action was "based on the unique nature and location of this particular" building and "should not be taken as a precedent for any future such application or for support of any hotel use in the SoHo District."
The Community Board resolution also explicitly noted the owners' agreement not to install a discotheque or other "entertainment use" in the hotel. Mr. Balazs acknowledged that his involvement in M.K. would have prompted such concern but said, "It makes no sense to wish to develop an intimate, sophisticated, quiet hotel whose very draw is privacy and, at the same time, willingly put in an establishment downstairs that violates every one of those things."
The hotel project on West Broadway and Wooster Street would be undertaken by Richard E. Talmadge of Manhattan and Hawthorn Suites of Waltham, Mass., a Pritzker family concern. The architects are Gruzen Samton Steinglass of Manhattan.
THE irregular building site runs through the middle of the block. At this time last year, the plan was for a 12-story structure on the Wooster Street side, which has a 50-foot frontage, and a one-story structure on West Broadway, where there is a 26-foot frontage. But that was not greeted favorably by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. It has reviewed all three hotel projects because they are within the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District.
In the revised plans, which won approval from the commission, an eight-story structure would be built on Wooster Street with a facade whose broad and deeply recessed window bays echo those of adjoining loft buildings. The top two stories would be set back 20 feet from the street wall and concealed behind a high parapet.
On West Broadway, there would be an eight-story building with simpler, smaller, sash windows, looking much like its neighbors. The top two stories would be set back 18 feet from the street wall. The landmarks commission determined that the upper stories of the two buildings "will not be visible from the street."
The two structures would have a total of 44 suites and seven single rooms. Between them would be a courtyard, some of it used as an outdoor extension of the restaurant.
"I think it would be very delightful and quite unique in its way -- an open courtyard that is somewhat residential in character and yet has activity in it," said Ralph Stein-glass, one of the architects. "We're quite pleased that what we've come up with -- mainly to devise a plan that would be more contextual -- has also produced a hotel design that is more intriguing, more appropriate to the particular niche that it's seeking to place itself in."
Financing, or the lack of it, seems to be the question now. "I don't know if I'd call it an obstacle," Mr. Talmadge said, "but with the current economic climate, we want to get a better sense of where the market's going. It certainly tempered the sense of urgency. But we hope to have the project going sometime late this year or early next year."
Another project, for a 78-room hotel on Houston Street, has been on the drawing boards for a very long time. The design, by Der Scutt of Manhattan, is a contemporary evocation of cast-iron facades and it won an award from the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects -- in 1985.
A year ago, the developer, Hank Sopher, said that while "financing is hard to come by," he hoped to start by the end of 1990.
This month, he updated his assessment: "It hasn't gotten any better. As a matter of fact, it probably got worse. Nothing's going to be done there until the banks open up again. They've closed their doors. They spend 100 percent of their time calling in loans."
Nevertheless, he said, "Eventually I think it's going to be a big winner."
"The most viable area in Manhattan today is the Chinatown-Little Italy-SoHo area," Mr. Sopher said. "A lot of that is due to the influx of Hong Kong and Chinese money and to New York University, which is constant in good times and bad times."
"We've had overtures from nonprofits," Mr. Sopher said. "We've had one very interested institution that would love to build community facilities there, housing for its people." Besides saying that the institution in question was not New York University, he did not further identify it.
"As far as a commercial hotel," he said, "unless someone wants to build it all-cash, it's not going to happen."

 BODY:

Rejection on Refinancing
 
Question: I asked permission from our co-op board to take out a home equity loan to help pay my son's college tuition. I had no mortgage and the co-op permits up to 80 percent financing for new stockholders. The board rejected my request, so I had to take a personal loan, with almost no tax benefit. Was the board's action legal? . . . Candy Eng, Jackson Heights, Queens
 
Answer: Legal experts are unsure. Stuart M. Saft, a real estate lawyer and chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said the answer depends on whether your co-op lease requires approval for financing. If it does, he said, the next question is whether the board "treats everybody in the same situation equally." The board might distinguish between existing owners and new buyers, he said.
Michael R. Finder, a Manhattan housing lawyer, said the case as described "sounds suspect to me, a loose or ill-defined policy or practice that doesn't seem rational." You might appeal to the board to reconsider its policy. A letter or visit from a lawyer might help, but taking the board to court could be prohibitively costly. Another approach would be a petition from shareholders seeking a revised policy.
Mr. Finder said your neighbors might be supportive both out of fairness and self-interest, because they, too, might want to refinance some day, and an overly restrictive policy could affect the marketability and value of apartments.
 
Electricity Charges
 
Question: I own a rent-stablized co-op in Tudor City. The maintenance charge was changed, making a separate bill for electricity. Can this be added to the rent my tenant now pays me? . . . Daniel E. Ronan, Oyster Bay, L.I.
 
Answer: No. Thomas R. Viola, spokesman for the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said a landlord cannot change the terms of a lease in a stabilized apartment. Anthony J. Colella, Tudor City's managing director, said your building, the Essex, converted to submetering a year ago. Removing electricity costs from the overall budget resulted in a 6.1 percent saving in the maintenance fee. The size of your individual electric bills, and whether you have a net gain or loss under the new system, depend on how much power your tenant uses.
 
Man of Many Hats
 
Question: The co-op sponsor of our Washington Heights building placed it under a 25-year wraparound mortgage, charging 15.5 percent, with himself as lender and beneficiary. Now that market rates are lower, the co-op would like to refinance, but he refuses. He also gave himself a low-cost 30-year lease for the garage, which he rents out at a sizable profit. He is the building manager and holds two seats on the board. Are these practices legal and what can be done to remedy them? . . . J. Backer, Manhattan
 
Answer: They may be legal, depending on the offering plan and mortgage terms. Mr. Saft of the Council of New York Cooperatives said the practices are legal if they were accurately disclosed in the plan and if the sponsor has met all his responsibilities. The co-op could circumvent the refusal to refinance if the mortgage terms permit prepayment (using the proceeds of a new loan from another lender) without prohibitively expensive prepayment penalties. As for the garage lease, Mr. Finder, the housing lawyer, said that depending on the details, you may have recourse under the Federal Condominium and Cooperative Conversion Protection and Abuse Relief Act. Some garage leases held by sponsors have been found illegal under the act.

'VOICE OF THE PRAIRIE'
 A Midwesterner who becomes a popular radio personality during the 1920's is the principal character in "The Voice of the Prairie," a play by John Olive opening on Friday at the Schoolhouse in Croton Falls. It runs through May 5.
 The character, David Quinn, parlays a natural talent for storytelling into a successful career, spinning tales of his youth for the radio audience. His fame is instrumental in reuniting him with a long-lost sweetheart.
 The play was performed to flattering reviews in 1987 at the Hartford Stage Company and at the Chelsea Stage in Manhattan last December.
 "Three actors play many roles," said James Shankman, artistic director of the Coyote Theater, a company of professional actors from New York, based at the Schoolhouse. "It's a memory piece," he continued, "with suggested sets, and items of clothing that are put on or taken off onstage as the characters switch roles or move back and forth between the 1890's and the 1920's."
 Mr. Olive's plays, including "Killers," which had its premiere in 1989 with Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago, "are being seen more and more in regional theaters around the country," Mr. Shankman said.
 "The Voice of the Prairie" will be performed Fridays and Saturdays at 8 P.M., Sundays at 7 P.M., with matinees April 28 and May 5 at 3 P.M. Tickets are $12.50 and $15 and can be reserved by calling 277-8477.
 
SKETCHES SOARING
 The days when pencil sketches and other graphics were priced at a markedly lower range than paintings are apparently coming to a close. Thirty-six black-and-white sketches by 25 major artists, being shown today through May 12 at Nardin Fine Arts in Cross River, are as costly as many paintings.
 "It's outrageous, but that's how it is, in spite of the depressed economy," said Concetta Nardin, the gallery's owner.
 The list of artists is impressive, and the works are all framed, some in the original frames and mountings. Most of the works were done in pencil, but some are in conte crayon, ink or charcoal. They include a 9-by-12-inch charcoal sketch of a standing woman by Bonnard for $36,000.
 A 7-by-8-inch preliminary sketch for a painting by Mary Cassatt is priced at $16,000. The most expensive piece is by Yasuo Kuniyoshi, a pencil sketch of two girls in Paris, measuring 12-by-21 inches, and important, Ms. Nardin said, "because it is different from his other work -- more rigid, calculated." It costs $45,000.
 A few drawings cost about $900, including one by Max Weber and another by Raphael Soyer. Whistler, Hopper, Stella, John Marin, Marsden Hartley, Marsh, Noguchi, John Sloan, and Milton Avery are some of the other artists in the show.
 The gallery is on Route 35 in Yellow Monkey Village, open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Call 763-8451 for more information.
 
ROGER McGUINN RETURNS
 Are you close enough to the 60's to remember "Turn, Turn, Turn," the Byrds, and Roger McGuinn, leader of the band?
 Well, he is back, appearing at the Music Hall on Main Street in Tarrytown this evening at 7:30 with a new band that features Tom Petty, Elvis Costello and Michael Penn. The group has recorded an album, McGuinn's first in 10 years, titled "Back From Rio," which Rolling Stone magazine dubbed "the first great album of 1991."
 Tickets are $20 and can be reserved through Ticketmaster or by calling 332-8497.
 
ONE-DAY BOOK SALE
 New Rochelle Library's yearly spring-weekend book sale has been compressed from two days to one because of budget reductions requiring the building to be closed on Sundays.
 The sale, with up to 10,000 items, will run from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday. The selection will include hardcover and paperback fiction, mysteries, biographies, history, sociology, psychology, religion, philosophy, political science, children's books, reference books, multi-volume sets, large-print books and a selection of records and some framed prints that were part of the library's collection.
 Everything is in good to excellent condition and prices are 25 cents to $50 for a set of encyclopedias. Leftovers will be sold for $1 a bag the following Monday. The library is downtown at Library Plaza.
 
MANAGING RISK
 "Risk Management Challenges in the U.S.S.R. and Changing Eastern European Economies" are to be discussed when the World Trade Club meets for lunch Wednesday at the Rye Town Hilton.
 Sharon R. Fitzsimmons, director of finance and treasurer of Philip Morris International, will be the speaker, focusing on her own recent experiences in the volatile climate under which trading and investing in those parts of the world must be accomplished. Ms. Fitzsimmons is a graduate of the International Senior Management program at Harvard's Graduate School of Business.
 A reception will begin at 11:45 A.M., with lunch served at 12:15 P.M., followed by Ms. Fitzsimmons's talk and an open discussion. Tickets are $40 and can be reserved by calling 948-6444.
 
NOT SO RETIRING
 Workshops for people middle aged and older who want to put their skills and experience to profitable use are being held this spring by the American Association of Retired Persons. The series begins with a session on assessment and planning, from 9 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. tomorrow.
 Six additional sessions, scheduled on April 18, 22, 25 and May 2, 9 and 16, will deal with identifying skills and work preferences, collecting information, barriers to be faced, communicating effectively in interviews and the workplace, becoming acquainted with realistic job options and creating and implementing a job-search plan.
 All sessions will be held from 9 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. at MONY Financial Services, at 4 Manhattanville Road in Purchase. There is no charge. Registration will be available tomorrow morning at the meeting, or call 381-2048.
 
RUSSIAN CHAMBER CHORUS
 A Manhattan-based choral society called the Russian Chamber Chorus will perform in a two-part concert Friday at 7 P.M. in the O'Byrne Chapel of Manhattanville College in Purchase.
 Under the direction of Nikolai Kachanov, the program will span the rich choral repertory of Russian music, from ancient sacred chants to contemporary works, followed by 19th- and 20th-century classical and folk songs. Admission is free.

A Visit to the Bayou, 26 Miles From New York

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Just 26 miles west of New York City, a bit of the bayou flourishes. It's the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge in Meyersville, N.J., and for lovers of wildlife, particularly bird watchers, spring is an opportune time for a visit.
The Great Swamp Refuge, operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, contains 7,000 acres of woodland, marshes and swamps, much of it inaccessible to visitors, by Federal law. But in one area, two boardwalks wind briefly through the Great Swamp, taking visitors though a still, eerie but beautiful world of marsh plants, rotting trees and water, colored myriad shades of green by moss and pond scum. 
 The boardwalks lead to bird-watching blinds, small sheds with slits cut in their walls that allow visitors to observe without disturbing the animals. Some 222 species of birds have been sighted in the Great Swamp. Some make it a permanent home; others use it as a stopover on migratory flights.
Bird species commonly sighted in spring include Canada goose, wood duck, mallard, American kestrel, mourning dove, downy and hairy woodpeckers, Eastern bluebird, great blue heron, yellow warbler, hummingbird and cardinal. Binoculars are essential, and a bird-watching guide is a handy reference tool.
 
Cold-Blooded Creatures, Too
 On a sunny day, painted turtles sun themselves on tufted grasses that dot the Great Swamp, and a patient, keen-eyed visitor may hope to spot several species of snakes, including the Northern water snake and Eastern ribbon snake. Mammals common to the Great Swamp include white-tailed deer, red fox and river otter.
The Great Swamp also attracts plant enthusiasts. Spring wildflowers commonly seen there include several species of anemone, blackberry, lily-of-the-valley and wild violets.
The Great Swamp, bounded by the towns of Chatham and Gillette, was formed more than 25,000 years ago when a retreating glacier helped create a giant lake, which scientists estimate covered an area 30 miles long and 10 miles wide.
As water slowly drained from the lake, several extensive marshes and swamps formed. By the mid-1800's, farmers had drained most of the marshes. But the small farms eventually proved economically unfeasible, and the area soon reverted to wilderness.
A proposal in the 1950's to fill in the Great Swamp and built an airport that galvanized local conservationists. They raised more than $1 million through donations, and the money was used to buy 3,000 acres that forms the nucleus of the wildlife sanctuary.
 
Beware Wet Feet and Ticks
 Rangers recommend that visitors wear sneakers or waterproof shoes, although the boardwalks remain dry. The best times for observing wildlife are early morning and late afternoon. Spring is a particularly good time because foliage is still scant, making bird watching easier.
Because the area is a swamp, expect to find numerous mosquitoes and ticks from mid-May to September. Deer ticks, which can transmit Lyme disease, have been found in the area. As a result, insect repellent is advisable, as are long-sleeved shirts, and trousers rather than shorts. In April, however, the Great Swamp is relatively insect-free.
There are also some hiking trails in the Great Swamp refuge, but some are several miles by car from the wildlife observation area. Parking areas are provided at various access points to the swamp. Parking along roads in the area is prohibited. Most of the trails are short walks through woods and thick bambles. They are particularly well-suited to families with small children.
There is no food service in the refuge. Some nearby parks have picnic areas. In Meyersville, Casa Maya serves unusually good Mexican food. It does not have a liquor license, so those wanting beer or wine must bring their own.

 
 
 
Getting There
 The Great Swamp can be reached by car from New York City by taking the New Jersey Turnpike to Exit 14, Interstate 78. Take I-78 west to Exit 40 and proceed north along State Highway 531 to State Highway 638. This will lead to Meyersville. Follow signs for the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.
Brochures detailing the types of wildlife found in the Great Swamp are available from the visitors' center, which is open daily from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., except for holidays. Information: (201) 647-1222.

Kerkorian's Strategy for T.W.A.: Cold Cash
 

Last week, Carl C. Icahn, chairman of T.W.A., kept asking Kirk Kerkorian, the Beverly Hills financier, "where's your plan?" Mr. Kerkorian wants to buy T.W.A. from a resistant Mr. Icahn. Late Friday, he delivered the plan. With the help of T.W.A.'s unions, he is petitioning Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner to stop the sale of T.W.A.'s trans-Atlantic routes to American Airlines. This would deprive T.W.A. of $445 million to pay off some of its $2.7 billion in debt. He is also petitioning Mr. Skinner to allow direct talks between Mr. Icahn and himself, which the American agreement precludes. And he is promising cash -- lots. First there is $250 million in working capital from his Tracinda Corporation. Then there is $441 million in union givebacks. The plan also calls for keeping existing routes and buying new planes -- something Mr. Icahn could not afford to do. Can Mr. Kerkorian pull it off? He is asking Mr. Skinner for 60 days to try.

Hollywood's Lobbying Loss
 
For Jack Valenti, the $700,000-a-year lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America Inc., it was a rare defeat. After months of wrangling and one postponed vote, the Federal Communications Commission decided last week to let the television networks in on the $3 billion rerun market. Since 1970, largely through Mr. Valenti's deft lobbying efforts, they have been prohibited from owning the prime-time shows they broadcast. The rationale Mr. Valenti has been using for the last 21 years is that ownership would concentrate too much power with the networks. With last week's 3-to-2 vote, however, the F.C.C. finally recognized what almost everyone else already knew: the networks have lost much of their clout. The networks now get full resale rights to as much as 40 percent of their shows and royalties on the rest. The losers? The studios. They must share the loot.
 
The Teflon-less Nancy Reagan
 
It seems Nancy Reagan has little of the stuff her husband has: teflon. Everything seems to stick to her surface, whether warranted or not. The former First Lady has been portrayed unflatteringly by authors as diverse as Donald Regan, former White House chief of staff, and her daughter, Patti Davis. But now Mrs. Reagan has joined the oeuvre of Kitty ("His Way," a biography of Frank Sinatra) Kelly. Ms. Kelly's treatment of her latest subject gives Reaganomics, and "trickle up," a new spin, especially for the publisher, Simon & Schuster, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc. The book, which sells for $24.95, sold 90,000 copies in the first two hours. The initial print run was 925,000.

Digital Takes a Partner
 
Until now, if the Digital Equipment Corporation sold it, chances were it invented it and manufactured it too. But after four years of trying to develop its own "massively parallel" supercomputer -- a machine that achieves blistering speeds by dividing calculations between many different microprocessors -- Digital gave up on going it alone. Digital -- with $13 billion in sales -- has thrown its lot in with tiny Maspar Computer Corporation, a computer maker in Sunnyvale, Calif., with just $8 million in sales. Maspar makes machines with as many as 14,000 microprocessors. The companies will form a joint venture to produce a quick number-crunching machine with at least 128 microprocessors. Will the corporate cultures mesh as well as the microprocessors? Jeff Kalb, president of Maspar knows Digital well. He was once a vice president there.
 
Last week in Tokyo, Cray Research Inc. announced a new mid-priced supercomputer called the Y-MP4E. The machine, which is not based on parallel processing architecture, will be available in May and will sell for $7.3 million, about two-thirds the price of the average Cray computer.
 
J. P. Morgan & Company has a reputation for doing things right. Last week it did it again. The nation's fourth-largest bank reported a 61.5 percent increase in first-quarter profits, to $273 million. It attributed this rise to its foreign-exchange trading operations.
 
Revlon's New Look
 
Max Factor's luscious lashes will soon belong to the Procter & Gamble Company. Revlon Inc., which owns Max Factor, is selling the line along with Betrix, a German beauty-aids company, and Almay, a line of hypoallergenic cosmetics, for $1.14 billion. For P.& G., which owns Cover Girl, the biggest mass-market cosmetics brand, the addition of Max's lashes will put its domestic market share at about 30 percent of the market and give it added strength in Europe. For Revlon, the deal means cash to pay down some of its $800 million in bank debt due in 1992 and some of its $1.1 billion in "junk bond" debt. It cannot pay these from cash flow. What kind of gloss do the analysts give the sale? At $1.20 for each $1 in sales, they say P.& G. got itself a deal.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY


Hints That the Fed Will Act
 
Consumer prices fell in March, along with a lot of other indicators, a sure sign that the recession is beginning to cleanse the nation of inflation. It also gives the go-ahead to the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to the Labor Department, prices were down 0.1 percent, the first decline in five months. But even though the numbers look good, "one swallow doesn't make a summer," said Francis Schott, chief economist of Equitable Life Assurance Society in New York. It is the year-to-year figures the economists really look at. "Those numbers still show inflation hovering at about 5 percent." Still too high to bring much joy to a pensioner's heart, but low enough that the Federal Reserve may lower rates. "Fed fund rates will come down to 5.75 percent -- enough to shake the prime rate loose, down to 8.5 percent within four weeks," said Mr. Schott.
 
Inflation Worries Recede
 
There are other negative numbers for March that look surprisingly positive: producer prices fell by 0.3 percent, the fourth straight month of declines, according to the Labor Department. Declining producer prices send another strong signal that inflation is easing throughout the economy. "This is really welcome news," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. But the decline in producer prices comes at a price: the economy is limping along at barely 70 percent of its capacity and wages are not growing at all -- more fallout from the recession. Although four months are still not enough to signal the beginning of a larger trend toward stable prices, "it is quite a good start that provides room for the economy to bounce." The economy is laying its own foundation for a smooth recovery.
 
Retailers Out in the Cold
 
Retail sales are languishing too -- bad news for the nation's debt-encumbered retailers, but more good news on the inflation front. Sales fell by 0.8 percent for March, according to the Commerce Department. The biggest declines in sales were for big-ticket, durable items. These goods are the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. For the Federal Reserve, which watches these numbers closely, the evidence continues to mount that if it lowers rates, the economy will respond.
 
Companies Still Skeptical
 
Consumers may be confident, as the surveys show, but companies are still scared stiff. Businesses are not willing to spend. According to the Commerce Department, businesses are planning to expand their investment this year by a very cautious 3.2 percent after inflation, the weakest increase in five years. This follows rises of 4.5 percent in 1990 and double-digit increases in '89 and '88. According to Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago, all optimism should be guarded. "The numbers still do not indicate the end of the recession is here."
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
OPEC's Cash Pinch
 
Once OPEC was flush with cash, now all it has is oil. The situation has gotten so bad for the cartel that its Secretary General, Subroto of Indonesia, said last week in Washington that OPEC could not afford to raise production without first getting financing from abroad. Cash-strapped during the 1980's, OPEC neglected to invest in new production capacity. "They're going to have a tough time financing expansion," said Hossein Askari, an adviser to the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington. "Especially Saudi Arabia since it also has to pay for an expanded military." OPEC countries dipping into the world's pool of capital could help send interest rates higher. But if they don't dip in, oil supplies could be tight by mid-decade, analysts say.
 
Mexico and U.S. Get Cozier
 
They used to refer to themselves as distant neighbors. Now they are worried they can't get close enough. In Houston last week, President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico embraced the idea of a free-trade pact between the two countries. Although there is opposition to such a pact in Congress -- many fear it would bring down American wages -- Mr. Bush is pushing ahead with negotiations under a so-called "fast track" provision. Unless Congress revokes the provision this June, the only vote permitted will be yea or nay when a treaty is finally negotiated. Congress can make no amendments. Mr. Bush pledges to make the pact a priority. He is likely to get his way.
 
The Little Stock Exchange
 
When Poland's new stock exchange opens next week in Warsaw, it will be housed in the former headquarters of the Communist Party, a fitting tribute to the changes in Eastern Europe. At first the exchange will be tiny -- shares of just six companies will be traded and the exchange will be open just one day a week. But Poland has high hopes. The Government is mulling over a plan to give each adult a voucher that could be used to purchase stock.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Dollar and Overseas Stocks

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
For foreign companies that do business in the United States, a rising dollar may look like a good bet. There is the bonus of translating dollar profits back into their home currencies and the competitive edge of their exports to America. But looks can be deceiving.
Take, for example, the Sedgwick Group P.L.C., a British commercial property and casualty insurance broker. More than 50 percent of its sales come from the United States. But since the dollar began to rally in February, the company has underperformed the Financial Times world index for the London market -- rising 7.8 percent compared with 11.7 percent for the index. Meanwhile, a group of other dollar-positive stocks with smaller percentages of sales in the United States have outperformed the market. 
 The problem is that the benefits of a stronger dollar can be overwhelmed by other factors. In Sedgwick's case, according to Roger Harvey, an insurance analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, investors were disappointed that insurance rates didn't rise as much as expected this year. The stocks of insurance companies and brokers like Sedgwick rallied at the end of last year on the hope of increases. And this disappointment, he said, has undercut the dollar's lift.
In addition, the benefits of a dollar rally could be muted for many companies because they had already hedged their exposure to the dollar, meaning they may not now get the full benefit of a rally. And each country in Europe is affected differently by a dollar rally.
Paul Feldman and Sushil Wadhwani of Goldman Sachs & Company in London and Mushtag Shah, a research associate at the London School of Economics, have examined these issues in a new analysis of the dollar's rally. "The idea of this was to alert people that they should not just buy the stocks that have U.S. dollar earnings," said Mr. Feldman. "Maybe this will make people go back to their analysts and ask, 'Why did this stock do that?' "
They concluded that the Dutch market should benefit the most from a dollar rally. Into this calculation goes a measure of earnings of companies in these countries that are dollar sensitive, a count of imports and the impact of a lower local currency on domestic inflation. Also included is what they call a "market sacrifice ratio," which seeks to rate a country's willingness to accept a little more economic growth in exchange for a little more inflation. For example, Italy is very willing but Germany is not.
From this, and some additional equations and market assumptions, the team has concluded not only that the Dutch market is the biggest beneficiary but that it is followed in decending order by Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Britain and France. With a 10 percent increase in the dollar, the Dutch market could rise 3.9 percent and Switzerland 0.9 percent, not counting other market influences. But there are losses of 0.1 percent for Germany, 0.2 percent for Italy, 1.3 percent for Britain and 1.9 percent for France.
The Dutch and the Swiss markets have the highest earnings exposure to the dollar. While British stocks have a higher earnings exposure than Italian stocks, they have a more negative dollar response because of Britain's greater concern about inflation. This means interest rates are apt to be relatively higher than Italy's.
On individual stocks, the Goldman report tries to pinpoint companies whose dollar bias will allow them to outperform their local market as a whole. The picks are based on analysis of stock movements compared with currency fluctuations since 1986.
But the list is no sure thing. Sedgwick, which has the highest dollar exposure, is on the list of 15 British stocks. Still, as a group, the 15 outperformed the rest of the London market by an average of 4 percentage points from Feb. 11 to April 2, during which time the dollar rose 13.6 percent against the sterling.
Also among the 15 are BTR, Lonrho, Glaxo, BOC and Shell. Both Shell and BOC have underperformed the market but for no clear reason, which leads Goldman to believe that they may have some good gains ahead.
Among the companies on the other country porfolios are KLM and Ahold in the Netherlands, Pirelli & Company and Eridania in Italy, Tattinger and BIC in France, Ciba-Geigy and Nestle in Switzerland, and BMW and Hoesch in Germany.
 The portfolios from other countries did better in outperforming their markets than those on the British list. Based on history, the British companies were expected to outperform the market by 3.5 percentage points, just below the actual 4 percent gain.
And making the various choices even more difficult, the analysts found that while overall markets might have declined during a dollar rally, the portfolios in these countries did as well or better than the Netherlands and Switzerland.
 For example, the Dutch portfolio on average rose 4.8 percent, 1.92 times the predicted rate of 2.5 percent. But the German portfolio outperformed the market by 9 percent, 1.96 times the predicted rate. The Italian portfolio was 1.75 times the predicted rate, while the Swiss portfolio was just 1.42 times the predicted rate. One conclusion is that the German stocks, like BMW and Hoesch, have already moved too far.

HEADLINE: Taming Hollywood's Spending Monster

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were arguably Hollywood's hottest production team during the late 1980's, with a string of hits for Paramount Pictures that included "Top Gun" and the two "Beverly Hills Cop" films. Early last year, they were rewarded by Paramount with a new five-year contract that was lucrative even by the bloated standards of the movie business. But in November, barely 10 months later, the studio severed its ties to the pair.
 Publicly, both sides said the split had nothing to do with the disappointing performance last summer of "Days of Thunder," starring Tom Cruise. But it wasn't difficult for anyone in Hollywood to read between the lines. Paramount, by then suffering from a string of expensive flops, had decided it could no longer stomach the high-cost movies it had looked to Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bruckheimer to make. And in dumping the producers, the studio's management hoped to demonstrate to its nervous parent, Paramount Communications Inc., newfound commitment to financial restraint. 
 The incident is perhaps the most vivid sign yet of how Hollywood studios are trying to reform their history of free spending. Shaken by poor box-office performances and declining profit margins, studios say they are taking a harder line in negotiating deals with actors, producers and directors. And they are increasingly turning thumbs-down on proposals for expensive action movies and those laden with special-effects, looking instead for more "story driven" films, to use Hollywood's euphemism for movies that actually have coherent plots.
Yet Hollywood's new austerity seems to be more rhetoric than reality. Few in the industry disagree with what Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, recently called "a tidal wave of runaway costs and mindless competition." But the reforms so far have not been terribly deep and there are doubts that anything short of a tidal wave of red ink for studios will give them the will or the discipline to rein in costs.
As the financial risks of movie-making increase, studio executives, if anything, feel more compelled to play it safe by hiring established stars or peppering their movies with spectacular effects and lavish locations.
 
The Power of Agents
 Indeed, movie theaters this year will be filled with some of the biggest financial bets in movie-making history. Despite denials by Carolco Pictures, industry executives insist that its upcoming "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" cost almost $90 million to produce, which would make it the most expensive film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the star, is reportedly being paid $15 million.
Studio executives, it seems, are unwilling to challenge the immense power of talent agents like Michael Ovitz of the Creative Artists Agency in negotiating deals -- a fundamental change that many in the industry say is required for any long-term impact on costs.
Hollywood, in fact, may be among the last American industry to come to grips with bloated costs because it still has little incentive to do so. It has had no trouble retaining worldwide dominance in entertainment. New investment has been brisk, as shown by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company's purchase last year of MCA Inc., the parent of Universal Pictures, and Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures. And while profit margins are eroding, the top studios are still profitable. Amid the flops, there were plenty of successes last year. "Home Alone" cost 20th Century Fox less than $20 million to make and has grossed more than $250 million at the domestic box office. Disney had a surprise hit with "Pretty Woman," and Paramount had "Ghost."
Still, the industry's outlook could darken dramatically if costs go unchecked.
The average cost to the major studios of producing a feature film last year rose 14.2 percent, to $26.8 million, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Because the major studios are releasing more films, they are having to spend more money to attract the attention of moviegoers. Marketing and distribution costs -- primarily advertising -- climbed by an average 25.9 percent last year, to $11.6 million per film. That brought the total cost to an average $38.4 million, up 17.4 percent in a year and nearly triple the 1980 average.
At the same time, domestic box office receipts in 1990 fell by 0.2 percent, to $5.02 billion, and theater attendance dropped 6.6 percent, to 1.06 billion. Perhaps even more worrisome, industry executives say, growth rates are slowing in the revenue sources that financed much of the recent run-up in costs, including foreign box office receipts and the sale of video and television rights.
"Everyone's been looking for a bigger piece of the pie, but the pie has stopped growing," said Frank Mancuso, who was the chairman of Paramount Pictures until a management shake-up forced him out last month.
The studios have spent lavishly in recent years to find the next blockbuster, a film to repeat the huge success Warner Brothers had in 1989 with "Batman," which grossed $250 million in the United States. But they have often miscalculated the appeal of the underlying stories.
Today, Hollywood's back lots are littered with the financial wreckage of the resulting big-budget flops. Paramount is reeling from losses on "The Godfather Part III" and "The Two Jakes." Warner Brothers is awash in red ink from "The Bonfire of the Vanities." Robert Redford's latest movie, "Havana," was a disaster for Universal Pictures. Walt Disney Studios executives insist that "Dick Tracy" made money, but almost no one believes them.
 
Pressure on Profits
 Because the major studios are part of larger corporations or are owned by foreign companies, it is difficult to track their bottom lines, but analysts and industry executives say the downward trend is clear. Profits from Disney's studio in 1990 were the lowest in three years, according to a recent internal memorandum from Mr. Katzenberg, although Disney was the year's box-office leader.
Paramount's box-office troubles have depressed results at its parent company, Paramount Communications, which lost $7.3 million in the quarter ended Jan. 31. Martin S. Davis, the company's chairman, told analysts earlier this month that he expects a loss in the current quarter, blaming in part "the weak performance of our motion picture releases."
Paramount Pictures' string of flops clearly undermined the position of Mr. Mancuso, who had headed the operation since 1984. While he might have been responsible for Paramount's failures, Mr. Mancuso, in their wake, enacted the industry's most far-reaching program to hold down costs -- one that has continued since his departure. In the months before he left, Mr. Mancuso and the studio's other top executives decided to reverse their strategy of concentrating on big-budget films and sequels and work primarily on films that could be made for around the industry average of $27 million.
Paramount has let it be known that it would no longer pay to sign top stars like Tom Cruise, who can command $8 million or more per film. The studio cut the number of films in development in half, to about 125. And executives tried to take a stricter line on production expenses, pressuring directors to stay on their shooting schedules, for example.
"It's become relatively clear that other studios have gone through similar examinations of their practices and have also concluded that things must change," Mr. Mancuso said in an interview last month before losing his job.
 
A New Caution
 At Disney, for example, Mr. Katzenberg has said the studio will be much more hesitant to take on big-budget extravaganzas like "Dick Tracy," and another top executive says Disney will no longer pay to have two big stars in a film, as it did recently with "Scenes from a Mall," with Woody Allen and Bette Midler. Columbia Pictures has recognized that on a financial basis, "more and more projects don't add up for us," said Frank Price, the chairman.
Even Carolco Pictures, which in the past has concentrated almost exclusively on big-budget films with stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, now wants to produce a few less high-cost films each year and a few more moderately budgeted movies. And virtually every studio is developing more romantic comedies -- a genre considerably less expensive than action films.
Some studios have also responded by laying off more of the financial risk, limiting their financial exposure and their profits. Warner Brothers, for one, is making deals with independent producers and foreign entertainment companies under which it will put up the money for marketing and distribution, but not for producing movies. It is to some extent following a strategy used by Disney.
 Despite the tougher bargaining posture that studio executives say they are taking, their willpower in negotiating with highly paid stars and their powerful agents is suspect. Some studio will almost certainly give in to Macaulay Culkin, the 10-year-old star of "Home Alone," who industry executives say is asking as much as $4 million for his next film.
 In the view of frustrated studio executives, the problem lies primarily with agents who, they argue, push constantly for the last possible dollar that can be wrung from a deal. Agents disagree, saying that deals come down to what studios are willing to pay. But to hear agents tell it, the industry's big problem is not rising costs but that studio executives, with their multimillion dollar salaries and private screening rooms, have lost touch with the public.
 
Looking Inward
 The dismal results of the last year have certainly prompted a greater degree of self-analysis among executives, producers, directors and others in the industry. Mr. Katzenberg, Disney's studio chief, wrote in an internal memo earlier this year about the need for his company to focus less on big budgets and hype and more on developing good stories capable of grabbing audiences emotionally. The memo, which was widely circulated throughout Hollywood, gave voice to the uneasiness about creative bankruptcy and excessive costs as studios chased frantically and fruitlessly after the next "Batman."
"It seems that, like lemmings, we are all racing faster and faster into the sea, each of us trying to outrun and outspend and outearn the other in a mad sprint toward the mirage of the next blockbuster," Mr. Katzenberg wrote.
But the memo was disparaged by agents and executives at other studios. They saw it as an attempt by Mr. Katzenberg to deflect criticism about Disney's own lack of financial discipline in developing upcoming movies like "Billy Bathgate," starring Dustin Hoffman, and "Rocketeer," an adventure film that despite having no big stars will cost more than $35 million to produce.
Can Hollywood really change? The evidence so far suggests that the reare real, but superficial.
Consider Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bruckheimer. Unwanted at Paramount, they quickly signed with Disney. Industry executives say their deal is lucrative by any measure, although they are no longer guaranteed a huge payday even if a film flops, as they were at Paramount.
Many experts think the industry will have to make more fundamental changes. Peter Dekom, a lawyer who is one of Hollywood's leading deal makers, said that studios may reduce expenses by employing less well-known actors, but will then have to advertise more to draw audiences to the movies because they will lack the built-in drawing power of a top star.
But he said the only way the economic structure of the business can really be altered is for the studios to invest more time and energy in developing their own stars from scratch under long-term deals, something movie makers have not widely done since the demise of the old studio system decades ago.
"The studios say cut costs, cut costs, cut costs," Mr. Dekom said. "But so far all I see is people tearing things down, not building any new, more efficient structures."
 
 
 
Anatomy of a Big-Budget Deal
 Judging from some of the movie deals now in the making, you would never know Hollywood was taking a dimmer view of high-budget films. "Hook," by the Sony Corporation's Tri-Star Pictures unit, a movie about the pirate captain from "Peter Pan," will undoubtedly be among this year's most expensive. It is an illustration of the power of brand-name artists and their agents and why Hollywood has such trouble making money on big-budget films.
Industry executives said Tri-Star agreed to pay Steven Spielberg, the director, and the two stars, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, a huge percentage of the film's gross revenues in lieu of cash salaries.
As outlined by a person familiar with the deal, the director and the two stars would collectively receive 40 percent, or $20 million, of the first $50 million in revenues received by the studio. That would leave $30 million for Tri-Star to begin covering the film's production costs, which are not publicly known. It is unclear how the 40 percent would be split.
The studio's revenues would hit $50 million when the film has sold roughly $110 million in tickets, since theaters typically keep slightly more than half the ticket revenues. A film that did $110 million in ticket sales would be a substantial hit. One factor in Tri-Star's favor: "Hook" is likely to draw well around the world.
For any revenue Tri-Star takes in between $50 million and $120 million, including videocassette and television rights, the cut taken by the director and the stars would decline to less than 20 percent, allowing the studio a greater opportunity to recover not just the production costs but interest expense, studio overhead and the tens of millions of dollars it will undoubtedly spend on advertising. Should the movie reach $120 million in revenues, Tri-Star would keep roughly $85 million, with Messrs. Spielberg, Hoffman and Williams splitting $35 million.
Above $120 million in studio revenue -- or roughly $250 million in worldwide box-office sales -- the deal calls for the share going to Messrs. Spielberg, Hoffman and Williams to kick back up to 40 percent.
Does it all add up to a profit? Rivals are doubtful, but Michael Medavoy, Tri-Star's chairman, seems confident. "Everyone who points a finger at 'Hook' would love to have it," he said. "This is not the picture to hold up as an example of costs run amok."

 
 
A 'STAR TREK' SOLUTION
 When Paramount Pictures first worked up a budget for "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country," the numbers didn't add up. Its solution may serve as a prototype for other studio's trying to pare costs.
The asking prices of all the stars, including William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, and costs for the special effects and elaborate sets envisioned by the producers would have added up to $41 million. That is not an outrageous sum to make a movie generally, but it is for a "Star Trek" movie. The series has had little appeal abroad and would be unlikely to sell $100 million in tickets at the box office in the United States, the minimum needed for a $41 million film to break even.
So Paramount and the producers agreed to cut back on the special effects, use more sets from previous installments and even use old costumes. Most important, Mr. Nimoy and Mr. Shatner agreed not to take any cash up front.
Instead, the actors will receive a portion of the film's revenues, a deal that will leave them with relatively little if the movie flops, but that could be extremely lucrative if it is a hit.
The bottom line: The film's production budget was reduced to $27 million, and filming begins this month.

HEADLINE: All About/Initial Public Offerings;
Company Hunger, Investor Interest Mean a Hotter New-Issues Market

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Initial public offerings -- companies' first sales of stock to the public -- have all the excitement of opening night on Broadway. Will the offering be a success? Will it flop? After months of meticulous preparation, Wall Street bankers and corporate executives hold their collective breath as the stock is tossed out onto the market and there, in the instant of a trading day, is judged a winner or shrugged off into oblivion.
Some offerings are, indeed, show stoppers. One of the most dramatic came in 1956 when investors lined up outside brokerage houses to get the first public offering of Ford Motor Company shares. In 1980, Apple Computer went public with similar fanfare. "Not since Eve has an apple posed such temptation," as The Wall Street Journal put it. 
 The volume of initial public offerings tracks the stock market -- as the market rises, more companies sell equity; as it falls, they wait for a better price. Not surprisingly, these offerings peaked in 1987, when 517 companies went public, raising $14.5 billion, according to Investment Dealers Digest, an industry newsletter in New York. After the October crash that year, volume dropped precipitously. In 1990, only 169 companies went public, raising some $4.6 billion.
But most analysts say the initial-sale totals are poised for a takeoff, reflecting pent-up demand by companies for capital as well as a feeling that the market euphoria following the gulf war is a time to strike. And earnings-starved Wall Street firms are eager to collect the issuing fees.
"Today's new-issue market is as hot as a hot tin roof and its getting hotter," said Charles Allmon, editor of the Growth Stock Outlook, a newsletter based in Bethesda, Md."This market is warming up."
Investor interest is being whetted by the recent performance of many initial public offerings, which, as a group, have risen more than the stock market as a whole. Robert Natale, a vice president of equity research at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, has has the data, in the form of a new-issue index, composed of investment-grade nonfinancial issues. In the four weeks ended April 5, that index rose 10.8 percent, compared with a 4.4 percent gain for the over-the-counter composite index and a gain of only 0.1 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which tracks larger companies.
First quarters are usually slow for initial public offerings. Investment Dealers Digest, reports that there were 27 issues, raising $1.5 billion in the 1991 first quarter, compared with 44 issues raising $1.7 billion in the previous year's first quarter. The number of issues may be off, but the trend is not, said Mr. Natale, pointing both to dollar volume and the month-to-month trend: 4 offerings in January; 18 in February; 14 in March and five in the first week of April alone.

 
 
Risks in a Rite
Responsibilities Rise In the Public Arena
 Going public is a rite of passage -- a sign that a corporation is large enough to move into the public marketplace. Usually, the change is a way to bring new visibility and new capital to a fledging operation. When a company sells equity -- amounting to a claim by stockholders against the assets of the company -- it is raising money to pay for future growth and expansion. A successful offering helps set the stage for the company's return at a later date for more money.
The initial public offering is also how the initial private investors cash out -- it is their shares that are sold, often providing them with a sudden windfall.
But with the riches come new responsibilities: oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a listing on a major stock exchange, scrutiny by the financial press and brokerage analysts and the constant rise and fall of its stock price. "There are all kinds of responsibilities associated with going public," said Michael B. Connolly, a senior manager at KPMG Peat Marwick. "And a company's reputation can really be damaged if the stock sinks in the aftermarket. A lot of companies are concerned about what happens to them after they go public."

 
 
Watch That Price
The Honeymoon Tends to Be Short
 Initial offerings tend to go through a brief honeymoon period, often rising on the first day of trading, which provides an easy profit for investors who quickly "flip" the stock. For instance, Medical Marketing Group, a data-collection company, went public at $12.50 a share in late March, and lept to $20 a share that same day.
William Benedetto, of the private investment firm, Benedetto Gartland & Greene, says this sort of action comes from the pricing strategy of Wall Street. The Street usually tries to keep investors happy, even at the expense of the issuing company.
In the current market, Mr. Benedetto said, with so many companies hungry for new money, Wall Street firms have been underpricing issues so buyers will reap an immediate 10 percent or so. "Anything less than that is a mistake," said Mr. Benedetto. "Pricing has been very, very favorable to the investor, and that's why the market is so hot."
It is not altruism that propels Wall Street, here, but, not surprisingly, greed. "Investment banks make money from big institutional buyers every day," said Mr. Benedetto. "So they have an enormous economic incentive to keep buyers of stock happy. The issuing company provides income to the bank maybe once every three years or so."
Investment bankers -- who typically get 6 percent to 7 percent of the face value of the equity offering -- are walking a tightrope between keeping investors happy and yet not underpricing so much that an issuer is appalled. But they still sometimes miss the mark. Recently, highly touted Regeneron, a biotechnology company, came to market at $22 a share, only to sink that day to $17.
Over the long haul, initial public offerings are poor investments, according to Porter Wheeler, chief economist of the Jefferson Group, a Washington consulting firm. Mr. Wheeler studied the aftermarket performance of 3,186 offerings issued between 1980 and 1990 and found "the performance was distressingly poor, to be frank," he said.
By the end of 1989, only 58 percent of this group was still listed. The rest had disappeared from the markets. Of those no longer traded, about half went out of business or became too small to be listed. The other half were merged into other companies. Of those still trading, only about a third had a market price above the original offering price.
"I was surprised successes didn't balance out the losers," said Mr. Wheeler. "Either companies were too green or couldn't sustain the growth that they were marketed with."

 
 
After the LBO
The 80's Buyouts Reverse Themselves
 By all accounts, the 1980's was the decade of the leveraged buyout, when public companies were purchased by investors and managers and taken private. In the five-year period from 1984 to the end of 1988, total completed LBO transactions amounted to $181.9 billion, including the celebrated $24.8 billion RJR Nabisco deal, according to figures from the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
This legacy is helping fuel the initial-offering market of the 90's as companies reverse themselves and go public once again.
Unlike the case in the 80's, when most initial offerings were small companies going public, the initial offering market of today has a growing number of "reverse LBO's." Mr. Connolly of Peat Marwick estimates that reverse LBO's amount to up to 20 percent of the current market.
"There's clearly an investor preference for companies that have been through the buyout process," said Mr. Benedetto. "Investors want large companies that have been through the buyout process. This isn't a trend. It's a fact."
Interest has also been generated by the strong aftermarket performance of some recent reverse LBOs. Safeway Stores, a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts buyout that went public last year at $11 a share, is now trading at around $20. And RJR Nabisco's debt-for-equity swap in February, not a reverse LBO but a deal viewed as a benchmark for that market, was priced at $5.75 a share and has been trading lately at around $12 a share.
"The perception is that reverse LBOs have been good for the early investors," said Mr. Natale. "Many materialized after the successful restructuring of RJR Nabisco. Investors have noticed this and are hoping the same could come true for a number of other reverse LBOs."
Among those offerings that investors are hoping will perform as well are the Caldor Corportion, a discount retailer that Mr. Natale recommends buying at $17 to $19 a share, and Duracell, a battery manufacturer that he sees as a buy at $13 a share. Unless, of course, an investor is interested in "flipping" Duracell. For that, Mr. Natale said he would pay more.
 
A SUDDEN LOVE FOR AUTOZONE

One of the more successful of the recent spate of initial public offerings was AutoZone, a do-it-yourself auto-parts retailer based in Memphis. The company came to market on April 1 at $23 a share, despite initial estimates by bankers that shares would trade between $17 and $19. Demand in preselling "road shows" for large investors was so strong that a higher price tag was possible. And since the offering, AutoZone's shares have traded at between $26 and $30.
What attracts investors to the company, which has 550 stores in 19 Sunbelt states, is more than spark plugs and batteries. The pull is Henry Kravis, and the perceived golden touch of Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, which, with the help of a group of AutoZone executives, had taken the company private. ( The company had been a subsidiary of Malone and Hyde, a food and drug wholesale business).
Only about 10 percent, or 3.7 million, of AutoZone's shares were sold to the public. The rest are held by KKR, employees and company executives. KKR holds the bulk, some 68.4 percent. Before the offering, KKR held 75.7 percent of the company, with mangement and employees owning the rest.
The $85 million raised by the offering is being used to pay down AutoZone's debt, which ranged from $75 million to slightly more than $100 million before the offering. As a result of the offering, the company now has about $180 million in equity and is virtually debt-free.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Fred Carr Is Going for the Gold

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Among the men whose careers were built -- and ultimately destroyed -- by junk bonds, Fred Carr may have the distinction of being the one who believed in them the longest. When the going was good, he did not take the money and run.
But as the First Executive Corporation was crumbling under the weight of defaulting bonds, Mr. Carr engaged in one financial maneuver that seems to have been designed to save his own financial future, perhaps at the cost of policyholders'. The move may net him $10.7 million. 
 Mr. Carr's gambit came in late February, a couple of weeks after the company said it would report a large loss for last year. By then, speculation was flying that its major insurance subsidiaries would be seized by regulators -- as happened to one of them, Executive Life of California, last week -- and there was little doubt that if that happened, First Executive eventually would have to file for bankruptcy.
The move made then was to set up a new subsidiary, called Rhodes Financial, which was supposed to seek outside investors and then go into the insurance business, investing only in high-quality bonds.
By then it was probably too late for any such strategy. But First Executive's subsidiaries nonetheless put $22 million into Rhodes, which immediately guaranteed some obligations of Executive Life.
None of them, as it happened, were insurance policies the company sold. Instead, Rhodes guaranteed $11.2 million in deferred compensation for 11 Executive Life officials, including $10.7 million for Mr. Carr. Should Executive Life fail to make the payments, Rhodes promises to pony up the money immediately, even if a court rules that it would be a fraudulent transfer for Executive Life to pay Mr. Carr. The plan was disclosed deep in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The takeover of Executive Life last week was viewed as old news by stock traders, who instead focused on low inflation figures that renewed hopes for Fed easing. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.01 points, to 2,901.79.
But First Executive's problems are of great importance to many, of whom Mr. Carr is only the most prominent. It should be noted that the evidence is that his ethical standards were significantly higher than many others' in the junk bond market, and his $600,000 annual cash compensation pales next to the tens of millions that some junk buyers were taking in. He owns almost a million shares of First Executive, now almost worthless, which he could have sold for high prices when the company seemed to be prospering. He no doubt thinks he deserves his deferred compensation.
But Mr. Carr, who did not return telephone calls, is not the only one who is going to suffer as a result of his junk buying. There are hundreds of thousands of people -- most of whom never made anything close to $600,000 a year -- whose retirement income depends on Executive Life living up to its obligations. Wouldn't it be nice if First Executive had shown an equal determination to assure those payments?

HEADLINE: Big Boats Take It on the Chin

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

DATELINE: ROWAYTON, Conn.

 BODY:
Brokers and buyers normally crowd the docks and boatyards this time of year along the waterfront of this small Fairfield County village on Long Island Sound. This year, though, the area seems virtually abandoned, and a strange quiet, broken only by the faint clanks of rigging rattling in the wind, fills the air.
"I've been in the business 21 years, and I have never seen anything like this," said R. Grove Ely, the president of Boatworks Yacht Sales, which has offices here and in Essex, Conn. "The business has been extremely slow. Our new-boat business is dead." 
 Buffeted by the recession and now the 10 percent Federal luxury tax on the anything over a $100,000 price tag on a a new boat, yacht sales nationally have fallen steeply in the last year.
Yacht dealers and boating association officials say the imposition of the luxury tax on Jan. 1 has caused further devastation in what was already a recession-ravaged industry. Some extra sales were made in December to people who wanted to beat the tax, but sales so far this year appear to be behind even last year's dismal pace.
The tax adds $10,000 to the cost of a $200,000 yacht, for example, and that's on top of any state and local sales taxes. In states with high sales taxes, like Connecticut (8 percent), dealers say the extra cost makes even their wealthier customers flinch.
"They couldn't have hit us at a worse time," said Carlton M. Barlow, a salesman at Boatworks Yacht in its Essex office.
Many old established manufacturers, like Pearson Yachts in Portsmouth, R.I., have filed for bankruptcy. "If you had asked me in 1987 who our biggest direct competitors are, I would have named five companies, four of which have filed for bankruptcy or ceased operation," said Katherine J. Exner, treasurer of Pearson Yachts. "People aren't buying big boats."
The National Marine Manufacturers Association in Chicago says sales nationally of new large powerboats with built-in engines declined to 7,500 in 1990 from 13,500 in 1988. Sales of new large sailboats with auxiliary engines, fell to 1,600 in 1990, from 2,300 in 1988.
No figures for the inboard powerboats or sailboats have been compiled yet for the first three months of this year, but industry officials say sales from the winter boat shows were poor.
Greg Proteau, director of public and financial relations for the manufacturers' group, said the deepest drop in sales had occurred in the Northeast and Florida. "People are just out of the consuming mode," he said. By contrast, California and the Pacific Northwest have experienced some downturn but less than in the East.
Though the very word yacht conjures up images of the Trump Princess and other 200-foot-long ocean-going vessels that cost millions, most are not so elaborate. Descriptions by manufacturers and dealers vary greatly, but few boats less than 36 feet long would be considered yachts. Prices for vessels longer than that start about $100,000 before running into the millions that buy the very fancy the bedrooms and advanced the navigational gear is.
On a $200,000 boat, the luxury tax would be $10,000, which is 10 percent of the amount above the $100,000 nontaxable floor. The tax was passed as part of last year's Federal budget accord.
Mr. Ely said he had not sold a single new boat that cost more than $100,000 this year. He believes he would have sold three or four except for the recession and the luxury tax.
"We had two car dealers who were going to buy $280,000 boats but backed down because their businesses were down 30 percent," he said.
Mr. Ely noted that he had sold five yachts at more than $100,000 at the end of 1990, as customers tried to beat the luxury tax. But, he added, "These days, there are lot of people out there looking and shopping, but something is stopping them."
The impact of the luxury tax and the recession have also been felt on the boat business on the New Jersey shore, particularly around Egg Harbor. Several boat manufacturers and suppliers there have closed or laid off substantial numbers of workers. The boating industry employs about 31,200 people in New York, 19,000 in New Jersey and 12,000 in Connecticut. About a third of the workers are involved in manufacturing boats, equipment and supplies.The others are involved in sales and service.
At least one boat dealer, Ocean Yachts of Egg Harbor City, N.J., offered to pay the luxury tax on some models of 42 to 58 feet in length from Jan. 1 to April 1. Stu N. Coren, a spokesman for the company, added that many dealers were pricing their boats more aggressively to make up for sales lost both to the recession and the luxury tax. "It was moderately successful," he said about Ocean Yacht's program to pay the luxury tax. "But it was far from overwhelmingly successful."
Mr. Proteau said the recent sales slump was far more pronounced than the one that hit during the 1981-82 recession. He said annual sales of all boats, from canoes to cruisers, dropped from 615,000 in 1979 to 500,000 in 1982. Sales then rose by almost 50 percent, to about 750,000 in 1987 before falling back to 504,000 last year.
He also said the industry's overall employment level had declined to 500,000 people last year, from 600,000 in 1988. "And now, we stand to lose another 6,000 to 8,000 jobs, mainly in the manufacturing end, because of the luxury tax," he said.
Robert T. Healey, the owner of the Viking Yacht Company, a boat manufacturer in New Gretna, N.J., has formed a national organization, the Committee to Save Jobs in Boating, to fight for repeal of the tax. Already, political action committees have been formed in more than 20 states.
Mr. Healey's company has reduced its work force in the last year to 400 from 1,400, although 700 of those jobs were lost when the company's boatyard in St. Petersburg, Fla., was shut down. "I can tell you 20 companies that are in our shape or worse," he said.
Boating industry officials have fiercely criticized the tax, which some members of Congress are seeking to repeal. The tax also applies to new cars that cost more than $30,000, airplanes over $250,000 and jewelry and furs costing more than $10,000, and these industries have also complained about the new tax.
Boat dealers said it seemed unfair that the tax did not apply to some expensive recreational vehicles. Dealers added that aside from hurting their sales and thus forcing manufacturers to dismiss employees, the revenue would not cover the Federal Goverment's costs to administer the tax.
Several dealers said the tax was imposed under the assumption that affluent people who buy expensive goods like yachts would continue to do so despite an additional tax.
That is not the case, said Mr. Proteau of the marine manufacturers' group, adding, "There is price sensitivity at these levels."
Mr. Ely of Boatworks agreed. "The tax does hurt," he said. "It is a lot of money for our customers. Don't forget, if they are buying a $200,000 boat, they are spending $16,000 with the 8 percent Connecticut sales tax. With the luxury tax, they are paying $26,000 in taxes. And that stops them right in their tracks."
Other parts of the boating industry are being affected unevenly. James S. Stamos, executive vice president at Yegen Marine, a marine banking company with its headquarters in Paramus, N.J., said the demand for financing for new boats was down 30 percent since 1988, despite recently improved terms of 10.25 percent for a fixed-rate 15-year loan.
The average boat loan at Yegen Marine is for $90,000 to $140,000. "The luxury tax is really something people are considering," he said.
But there has been an opposite impact on the yacht-chartering business. "Business is booming, up 20 percent from last year," said George Rosen, the president and commodore of the Yacht Owners Association of New York, which offers owners' boats for short-term leasing. "This is the first time I've ever had to work on Saturday and Sunday to show the boats. Some people are spending $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 on four-hour company parties, weddings, proms."
The used-yacht business also remains relatively unaffected by the recession. Industry officials said this segment of the market had remained stable because the luxury tax does not apply to sales of used yachts and because there is an abundance of long-lasting fiberglass boats. Indeed, Mr. Ely said he sold eight used yachts in January and February for $200,000 to $250,000 each.

HEADLINE: Milk Profiteers Hurt Farmers and Consumers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Despite the convincing rhetoric of "Milking Poor Families" (editorial, March 21), I disagree with your assumptions about who gains and who loses by Senator Patrick Leahy's amendment to an emergency appropriations bill. 
 The proposal to raise dairy prices at the farm gate would have done just that -- nothing more. You are wrong to assume that higher farm prices translate directly into higher retail milk prices. Here's why:
Last year, the farm price of dairy products fell 25 percent to 30 percent. At the same time, Department of Agriculture "market basket" surveys indicated that retail milk prices rose more than 9 percent!
Your assertion that higher farm prices "devastate" consumers -- particularly poor consumers -- would have us believe that shoppers are going down to the farm to buy their milk directly from a greedy farmer. Consumers are paying only 24 cents of every food dollar to farmers -- the other 76 cents goes to advertising, processing, packaging. From the cost of a loaf of bread, for instance, wheat farmers collect less than 5 cents.
Lastly, you equate the economic crisis that dairy farmers are facing with what other Americans are suffering as a result of the recession. But when every dairy farmer in the country is operating with red-ink prices, that's not a recession -- that's an emergency.

HEADLINE: The Word on Strategies From A.T.& T.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Everett Dirksen had a favorite rhetorical device for speeches back home in Illinois. He'd pull a newspaper clipping from his pocket and begin to read a spirited editorial denunciation of some political miscreant. After a few sentences, he'd stop, look around in mock astonishment and say: "Why, do you know who they're talking about? They're talking about me."
It's tempting to say I had a similar reaction when I read A. Michael Noll's "The Failures of A.T.& T. Strategies" (Forum, March 31). As he attacked the wisdom of our trying to acquire the NCR Corporation and accused us of lacking direction, he mischaracterized A.T.& T. as it is today and as it is developing for the future. 
 A.T.& T.'s mission is broad and deep: to be the world leader in information technology -- a technology that inescapably involves the best of both computer and communications technology.
A.T.& T. has a well-defined strategy for establishing leadership in this field:
1) Maintaining leadership in its core businesses like network services (which Mr. Noll extols) and the manufacturing and sale of network telecommunications equipment (which he ignores).
2) Establishing world leadership in networked computing, which is the technology driving the growth of electronic transactions. We expect such transactions, now running about 50 billion a year, to reach 200 billion annually by 1995. The critical enabler for satisfying this demand is the marriage of convenient user terminals like NCR's automatic teller machine computer systems and error-free communications networks.
3) To firmly establish A.T.& T. as a truly global company.
The merger with NCR would combine NCR's leadership in the hardware and software of electronic transactions with A.T.& T.'s expertise in the global networking of information.
NCR's technology would benefit from the support of A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories, the world's leading research and development organization. A.T.& T.'s globalization drive would benefit from NCR's vast international presence and customer base.
Mr. Noll apparently would have A.T.& T. stick to its telecommunications knitting, ignoring the fact that telecommunications and computing have been linked irrevocably for years.
More disturbing, he seems to endorse the idea that economic growth is dependent almost exclusively on services, and that manufacturing should be left to others. This approach doesn't add up for America or for A.T.& T. In the new age of information technology, products and services are increasingly hard to separate. Consider: Is a cash machine, or supermarket point-of-sale terminal, a product or a service?
Mr. Noll's implication that A.T.&T.'s "premier network" is not producing new information services is at odds with the facts. A.T.& T. has kept the United States network infrastructure the envy of the world. A.T.& T. has been putting more and more intelligence into its public switched network, available to large and small users at whatever level they wish and without the need for huge capital investments in private networks.
To borrow a phrase, the company has done well by doing good. A.T.& T. had record earnings in 1989, and held them last year, despite a sliding economy, with the help of a 40 percent increase in international equipment sales.
As Everett Dirksen also used to say: "I'll sketch it for you in brief form." We have computers and communications; we have products as well as services. And, yes, we do have strategy and direction.

HEADLINE: Chinese Grow Healthier From Cradle to Grave

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
In a bare obstetrics ward at the Ninth People's Hospital, Zhang Junyong stretched out on a cot and let the doctor listen through a wooden egg cup to the heartbeat thumping from the bulge in her abdomen. "I'm just a bit nervous," Ms. Zhang confessed with a smile.
Yet in contrast to her mother or grandmother, the 25-year-old Ms. Zhang has little to fear when she gives birth to her first child a few weeks from now. In recent decades China has engineered a remarkable health-care revolution, one that has increased the odds that her infant will be alive in the latter half of the next century. 
 While the Communists have yet to deliver on their promises to provide Chinese with lives that are prosperous and free, they have achieved the remarkable feat of offering their people lives that are long and healthy.
 Plague, tuberculosis and other diseases still exist at the margins of Chinese society, but by channeling funds toward prevention of disease and basic care, the Government has saved tens of millions of lives and established a health care network that is widely regarded as a model for the third world.
 
Life Expectancies
 By the prime measures of healthfulness, Ms. Zhang's infant will have better odds of survival than a baby born in New York City. In Shanghai, 10.9 infants out of 1,000 die before their first birthday, while in New York City infant mortality is 13.3 per 1,000 live births.
And life expectancy at birth in Shanghai is now 75.5 years, compared to a life expectancy in New York City of about 73 years for whites and 70 years for nonwhites as of 1980, the last year for which data are available. A spokeswoman for the city Department of Health said it did not have a life expectancy statistic combining all races.
To be sure, New York City's statistics are worse than those for the United States as a whole, where life expectancy is 76 years and infant mortality is 9 deaths per 1,000. Shanghai's figures are the best in China, where the nationwide life expectancy is 70 and infant mortality is 31 per thousand.
But New York and Shanghai are their country's largest and most crowded cities. How can Shanghai, a dilapidated third-world metropolis in a country with a per capita income of $350, give its infants such good odds?
The answer has nothing to do with modern equipment or with money, for Shanghai spends just $38 a person on medical care, compared to more than $2,100 in the United States. It appears that only about 5 percent of the Chinese gross national product is devoted to health expenditures, compared to 11 percent of America's.
"There's no question that in a time when people are despondent about what's happening in China, the health-care system really is a shining light from the Maoist era that continues to shine to this day," Gail E. Henderson, an expert on Chinese health care at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said in an interview. "It's a model for the developing world."
Doctors, health officials and foreign specialists say the Chinese system has succeeded for several reasons. Most fundamentally, it has emphasized prevention of disease, including large-scale projects to improve sanitation and to inoculate children. In the unglamorous but critical foundations of a public health system, like prenatal care, China excels.
 
 Jacks-of-All-Trades Of the Health World
 In visits over the last two years to hospitals and village doctors in seven provinces, the first impression is of rustic examination rooms where the doctors are semi-educated peasants wearing frayed and stained white jackets. Yet the more enduring impression is that these unscrubbed, sandal-clad doctors have a broad range of useful skills -- treating infections, diagnosing pneumonia, assisting in births and pulling teeth -- that in rural areas are more useful than anything at the cutting edge of Western medicine.
In China, money and equipment are limited, and the result is that many die of ailments that could be treated in the West. In most of China, a person who needs dialysis to survive, or a coronary bypass, or an organ transplant, will not get it. He or she will die.
Instead of focusing scarce resources on those relatively expensive procedures, or on extensive diagnostic testing or on care for the aged -- an enormous proportion of American medical spending is devoted to people in the last six months of their lives -- China has tended to put its money into programs like prenatal check-ups, pediatric care and campaigns against epidemics.
"Preventative work is crucial," said Jiang Lianyi, the head of administration of the Shanghai Health Bureau. "The sums are relatively small, and the returns can be enormous."
 
 Exercise, Diet, And Plenty of Tea
 The returns are seen in China's life expectancy at birth of about 70 years, compared to 43 in the West African country of Guinea, 58 in India, 65 in Brazil and 76 in the United States, according to World Bank figures. Third-world health statistics are uncertain, but the World Bank reports that as of 1988 about 31 Chinese infants out of each 1,000 die before their first birthday, compared to 143 in Guinea, 97 in India, 61 in Brazil, and 10 in the United States. (In 1990, infant mortality in the United States declined to 9.1 from 9.7 in 1989.)
"The Chinese health system has done an incredible job," said Dr. B. P. Kean, the World Health Organization representative in China. "If you go just through the figures -- life expectancy, infant mortality, first three causes of death -- without knowing which country it is, it would be very difficult to pick the country as China and almost impossible to pick it as a developing country. The top causes of mortality in the cities are the same as in developed countries: cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and cancer."
Clearly one reason for China's good statistics has more to do with lifestyle than with medical care: most people get plenty of exercise, keep low-fat diets, drink tea or boiled water rather than tainted tap water, eschew alcohol and narcotics, and are extremely unlikely to be murdered or killed in car accidents. Another factor is the lack of a large "underclass" that lacks ready access to medical care.
Nearly all urban Chinese have their medical bills paid by their employer or by the Government, and in rural areas the fees are low enough that they are not an enormous burden. Delivering a baby, for example, costs the equivalent of a few dollars in the countryside.
Dr. Kean credits the Government with stressing health and hygiene far more than most governments, and he notes that a typical Chinese mayor is far more conversant with health issues than mayors of other countries. High-level government backing has been crucial in one of the most critical initiatives, to vaccinate children against infectuous diseases. About 85 percent of infants are inoculated before their first birthday against six ailments: whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, measles and polio.
 
 Watching Progress Week After Week
 One of the greatest successes of the health campaign has been to promote prenatal care. Even in remote villages, far from any road or electricity, pregnant women are often given a card reminding them to visit a local doctor for frequent check-ups. The doctors monitor the pregnancy and encourage the woman to give birth in a clinic if a low birth weight or other problems are anticipated. Local governments hold training sessions for midwives to aid skills and understanding of hygiene.
In the big cities, a woman normally has monthly check-ups in the first trimester of her pregnancy, examinations every two weeks for the next few months, and weekly check-ups as the due date approaches. While many villages lack incubators and equipment for caesarean sections, the system of check-ups and counseling of pregnant women has reduced infant mortality.
Among the most fundamental problems facing the Chinese system is the shortage of doctors in some rural areas, particularly since the dismantling in the early 1980's of the communes that used to provide health care services. In some poor areas, villages have neglected health care since the communes fell apart, and schistosomiasis -- a disease caused by parasites that live in the blood vessels of humans and animals -- spread as communities stopped mass mobilization efforts to combat the parasite.
Those problems seem to have been partly resolved, and now there is again a determined effort to stamp out schistosomiasis. But problems have surfaced, including surging costs as hospitals compete with each other to buy fancy equipment like brain scanners.
As in the United States, a major reason for rising medical expenses is that there are not many incentives to control them. In Shanghai, where few urban residents pay their own doctor bills, health care expenses are rising 30 percent each year. The authorities are now trying to set administrative limits, curtailing the use of brain scans and other procedures.
 
 Will Future Wealth Bring Future Pain?
 Another challenge is the growing number of migrant families, who move to the cities with or without permission to find whatever jobs they can. They pay for their own health care, and often break the rules and give birth to more children than they are allowed to.
"Our biggest headache is the migrants, because they don't get check-ups and they're afraid we'll report them if they have an extra child," said Zhang Huizhong, director of pediatrics at Shanghai's Ninth People's Hospital. "Even if they're sick they don't come to see a doctor."
Perhaps the greatest long-term challenge to the medical system here is simply the changing lifestyle in China. As they grow wealthier, Chinese are eating more, smoking more, drinking more and exercising less. The numbers of drug addicts and migrants are growing rapidly, and some foreign experts believe that the AIDS virus could spread rapidly here. Young mothers enthusiastically buy infant formula instead of breast-feeding their babies, because they think the powder is more modern and healthy.
"We need to spend more money on health education," said Hu Jinghua, the director of Shanghai Public Health News, an official newspaper. "Ours is a poor country, and we can't afford a lot of equipment. Where the money has the biggest impact is health education."

HEADLINE: Nigeria Weighs Ending Curbs on Pretoria

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria, April 13

 BODY:
In a major policy shift, Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has announced that it is considering lifting sanctions against South Africa.
In a speech here Friday night, President Ibrahim Babangida said Nigeria was "gratified by recent positive developments" in South Africa and would consider lifting sanctions to reward initiatives toward dismantling apartheid undertaken by the South African President, F. W. de Klerk. 
 "The international community sees these developments as demonstration of President Frederik de Klerk's commitment to a peace process that will lead to the creation of a free and democratic South Africa," Mr. Babangida said.
He said sanctions could be lifted as early as next month, but only if "the remaining apartheid laws are abrogated." Mr. Babangida did not say specifically which laws would have to be removed, although they are believed to include ones imposing racial restrictions on land ownership and residency.
 
O.A.U. to Meet in June
 If those conditions are met, Mr. Babangida said, he would personally lead an effort to get other African nations to lift sanctions at the June meeting of the Organization of African Unity, scheduled to be held in Abuja, which is to become Nigeria's new capital. Mr. Babangida is assuming the rotating presidency of the group, a yearlong role.
Nigeria was among the first nations on the continent to impose trade sanctions and among those most committed to maintaining Pretoria's diplomatic and economic isolation. Tactics have encompassed financial, trade and investment sanctions, oil and arms embargoes and sports, cultural and academic boycotts.
Analysts said Mr. Babangida's newly conciliatory stance is likely to come as bitter blow to some militant leaders of the African National Congress, who recently appealed for sanctions to be maintained.
The lifting of sanctions being considered by other nations, including those of the European Community, is expected to be high on the agenda of a conference between black American political and business leaders and their African counterparts, scheduled for next week in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast.
 
Some Puzzled by Conditions
 The conference, sponsored by the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, one of the architects of the South African disinvestment movement in the United States, is expected to be attended by at least seven African heads of government, including Mr. Babangida.
Several African and Western diplomats said today that they were somewhat puzzled by Mr. Babangida's conditions for the lifting of sanctions since, in their view, it was unlikely that Pretoria would completely dismantle the 42-year-old apartheid system by June.
Nevertheless, Mr. Babangida's announcement is "a real breakthough," a Western diplomat said, "because until now Nigeria had been pretty rigid and unyielding on the sanctions issue despite the crumbling of apartheid." He added: "It is not clear, though, what they're trying to accomplish, since nobody believes apartheid is going to go away next month, or even six months from now."

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Elizabeth Kolbert

 BODY:

Looking for a Spokesman
One month after Mayor David N. Dinkins's press secretary, Albert Scardino, was carried out of the administration on a wave of bad publicity, at least one person has been informally offered the job. 
 He is Randy Daniels, a former CBS-News television correspondent and a former press secretary to the City Council President, Andrew J. Stein.
Senior New York City officials said that Mr. Daniels, who had lunch with the Mayor a few weeks ago, had been offered the job informally but that he had reservations about taking it.
Mr. Daniels, who works for Caroline Jones Inc., an advertising agency, has been detached from the agency to serve as press secretary to the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Sir Lynden Pindling.
Reached in the Bahamas, Mr. Daniels deflected questions about the offer, saying he had contractual obligations and "until such time as those obligations have been fulfilled, I am not in a position to do anything other than what I'm doing."
Leland T. Jones, a longtime press aide to both Mr. Dinkins and former Mayor Edward I. Koch, has been acting press secretary since Mr. Scardino resigned.
 
Symbols of Excess
Perhaps the most visible target of anti-tax sentiment in Trenton -- next to Gov. Jim Florio -- is Joseph V. Doria. This is not just because Mr. Doria is the Assembly Speaker. It is because, at 5 feet 11 inches and 250 pounds, Mr. Doria is hard to miss.
 As New Jersey's tax rebellion has grown in rancor, some local newspapers and radio stations have gone so far as to use Mr. Doria to personify fat in government. Now Mr. Doria, a Bayonne Democrat, is confronting the problem head on.
 In preparation for a difficult re-election campaign next fall, Mr. Doria is appearing in a television commercial in which he carves up a pumpkin pie while explaining that the state budget goes to pay for education, roads, environment and other good things.
"And I am big enough to admit we can't afford an extra piece of this pie," Mr. Doria adds. He then drops a piece of pie that is labeled "big government" with a crash.
Fifteen pies were used in the taping.
 
Their Idea; No, Theirs
For those in Albany who were not yet convinced that fear of blame was the major obstacle to a new state budget, last week's contretemps over the so-called "Wisconsin tax" was highly instructive.
The proposed "Wisconsin tax," a gross-receipts tax on businesses patterned after one in Wisconsin, seemed to have arrived from nowhere, but suddenly it was under serious discussion at budget negotiations.
Just as suddenly, when reporters asked about the tax's origins, negotiations broke down, as each side rushed to attribute the proposal to the other.
"It came from them," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said, referring to the legislative leaders.
"It's their idea," John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said, pointing back at the Governor's staff.
"If they want to advance it, we'll look at it," Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for the Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, said.
Seemingly embarrassed by all the finger-pointing, Governor Cuomo finally stepped in to accept responsibility for the proposal, but in the process denied that it was really his.
"It wasn't ours, but I will take credit for it," he said.
 
The Meek Learn to Roar
It might not be quite of the magnitude of the meek inheriting the earth, but in Connecticut's General Assembly, the led have definitely become the leaders.
As the two chambers struggle with a formidable budget deficit, a stubborn recession and a Governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who is publicly preoccupied with an income-tax proposal, the majority leaders have become all but paralyzed.
The Democrats control both the House and Senate, but almost all the initiatives in challenging Mr. Weicker, an independent, have come from the disenfranchised: the minority Republicans and the middle-of-the-road Democrats who have few leadership positions -- and thus less to lose in stepping up to bat.
On Thursday, when Mr. Weicker announced that a Republican no-income-tax plan would die on his desk if passed in the Legislature, it fell, predictably, to the unempowered middle-of-the-roaders to speak out in the most ringing terms about the inviolable rights of the legislative branch.
"The General Assembly is not going to be bullied by Lowell Weicker or anybody else," thundered Senator James H. Maloney, Democrat of Danbury, who is co-chairman of the low-profile Labor and Public Employees Committee.
 
Vying for a Judgeship
Mark Alan Siegel is looking to come back.
Mr. Siegel, an eight-term Assemblyman known for his love of publicity, surprised his colleagues last year when he decided not to run for re-election from his Upper East Side district. Now he is looking for appointment by Mayor Dinkins as a Civil Court Judge.
 Mr. Siegel has the backing of the Manhattan Democratic leader, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Dinkins ally, but is opposed by some East Side Democratic leaders, who feel that he is trying to jump to the front of the line of judicial hopefuls in the Sixth District.

HEADLINE: Trump and Civic Groups Team Up to Oversee Big Riverside Project

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Turning their unusual relationship into something unique in New York City, Donald J. Trump and six of his natural antagonists -- civic, environmental and neighborhood groups -- have formed a corporate partnership to oversee the design of Mr. Trump's 76-acre site on the Hudson River.
By creating the Riverside South Planning Corporation, the developer and the civic leaders said they hoped to stay on the cooperative path they blazed last month, when Mr. Trump embraced the groups' counterproposal to Trump City. 
 "Riverside South" is an 8.3 million-square-foot project with a 23-acre waterfront park, separated by a highway that would replace the elevated viaduct now on the river's edge. Apartment towers would line this highway in a kind of large-scale emulation of Riverside Drive.
"The real character, quality and impact of the project have yet to be determined," said the chairman of the new corporation, Richard A. Kahan, who once headed the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Battery Park City Authority.
 
Alternative to 'Combat'
 Besides Mr. Trump and Mr. Kahan, the board consists of representatives from the Municipal Art Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Parks Council, People for Westpride, the Regional Plan Association and the Riverside Park Fund.
While both sides acknowledge the riskiness of their alliance, they believe the potential gain is worth the gamble. "This is an opportunity to demonstrate that there is an alternative process to combat," Mr. Kahan said.
Mr. Trump would sacrifice some control over his project but would get a proposal that might move more quickly through city review, face less litigation and yield parcels that would be easier to sell or lease.
The civic groups would give up their detached, critical role and might lose credibility among their constituents. But they would end up with an extension of Riverside Park, where Mr. Trump proposed a cluster of giant skyscrapers.
There is apparently no precedent for their joint effort. To the extent that civic groups have influenced development in the past, it has been through litigation or bargaining behind the scenes.
The corporation will reach its decisions by consensus, Mr. Kahan said. Should irreconcilable differences arise, Mr. Trump has the right to withdraw from the corporation. He is underwriting its $1 million operating budget.
Under the timetable it set for itself, the corporation is to develop a plan that could be ready for the city's review procedure by the end of the year. Design guidelines set by the board "will, in one way or other, be legally binding," Mr. Kahan said.
 
Trump City Now 'Dormant'
 A new architectural team consists of David M. Childs and Marilyn Jordan Taylor of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Paul Willen of Daniel Pang & Associates. Mr. Willen designed Riverside South and was also the architect in charge of the Lincoln West project for the same site in the early 1980's.
They are to be assisted by Steven Robinson, an architect and opponent of Trump City, and Daniel Gutman, an environmental consultant who worked with Mr. Willen on Riverside South.
This team replaces the firm of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, which had drawn up Trump City, a 14.5 million-square-foot project that included a 1,835-foot skyscraper and 11 apartment towers. Mr. Trump said that plan was "dormant."
"I think the job we did initially was very positive," Mr. Trump said last week. "It galvanized everyone."
Civic leaders had told Mr. Trump that they would fight Trump City fiercely, said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Commission and a Riverside South board member.
On the other hand, Mr. Barwick said, "We told him he could be assured, if he adopted the plan we were proposing, that we would be equally fierce in seeing to it that it would be delivered."
What also motivated the civic groups was a keen desire to see the elevated West Side Highway lowered to ground level and moved well inland, opening up an uninterrupted waterfront park. With that in mind, they came up with Riverside South. "I saw people coming out and loving that plan," Mr. Trump said. "I wanted to take advantage of that."
"This is not a development," he said. "It's a great street or avenue or drive, with individual, separate and distinct buildings on it."
 
Unwanted Highway
 Such a project would be easier to split into discrete parcels. "What I envision is the very distinct possibility that certain sites would be sold or leased to various high-quality developers," Mr. Trump said, although he also contemplates building on a number of sites himself.
Mr. Trump said he was the "No. 1 fan of getting the highway down." Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council and a Riverside South board member, repeated Mr. Trump's observation that apartments facing a waterfront park can be sold for more money than those facing a highway.
Asked whether his decision to form a partnership with civic groups was a measure of desperation, Mr. Trump replied: "I am in much better shape than almost all other developers. The only reason I'm doing this is because it will be a better development that will be approved in record time because of its almost universal popularity."
As to their agenda, civic leaders noted several important points. "There is no other opportunity in the city or the state to create a park," said Frances Beinecke, deputy executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and a Riverside South board member.
The civic leaders say their job is not to supplant formal review by Community Board 7, the City Planning Commission and the City Council.
Nonetheless, Ethel Sheffer, a community board member, is somewhat wary of the corporation.
"One can only hope that it's a good thing," she said, "but amidst all the huzzahs, it's important that this entire effort be scrutinized carefully, because there are many issues that are not only unresolved but that require serious work" -- chief among them being the fate of the highway.

HEADLINE: Medicaid Morass/Troubled Policy in Hard Times
A special report.;
New York's Medicaid Costs Surge, But Health Care for the Poor Lags

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 12

 BODY:
As New York struggles through a fiscal crisis, its ever-expanding Medicaid program, already the most expensive in the nation, has emerged as discouraging proof of just how profound and intractable the state's budget problems are.
Over the last five years, annual spending on Medicaid has increased by 60 percent, to roughly $12 billion. So expensive is the program that it now consumes almost one of every seven state tax dollars. Many county governments are being forced to raise taxes as they, too, strain to pay their share. 
 But to look just at the spending side is to miss the full magnitude of the Medicaid problem. That can be found only in the distressed faces of recipients like William Cummings, an unemployed 31-year-old typist who suffers from asthma. Mr. Cummings receives virtually all of his care through hospital emergency rooms, waiting up to eight hours each time to see a physician.
"I very much would like to have my own doctor," Mr. Cummings said during a recent wait at Jacobi Hospital in the north Bronx. "But where I live, there is no doctor nearby that takes Medicaid."
Medicaid is the primary government health-care program for the poor, financed with Federal, state and in some cases local funds. Despite the vast sums spent on Medicaid in New York, there is widespread agreement that the program fails to deliver adequate services to the people for whom it was intended -- poor people like Mr. Cummings. More and more of its resources are funneled to the elderly -- many of them middle-class -- while for the poor, health care is still often limited to overcrowded clinics and emergency rooms. And at a time when many other social services for the poor are shrinking, many experts say that what is needed is not less Medicaid spending but more.
Stripped of its technical details, New York's gathering Medicaid crisis is a grim metaphor for the quandary facing the state as its social problems and its budget deficit -- now estimated at $6 billion for the current fiscal year -- grow simultaneously. It illustrates the essential conflict between New York's need to cut costs and its reluctance to retreat from the policies that have made its social-welfare programs some of the most generous, and expensive, in the nation.
Efforts to revamp Medicaid and rein in its runaway costs have been stalled for years by a slow-moving bureaucracy and a battery of special-interest groups. And while the state is finally making some genuine efforts to revise the system under the enormous pressure of its budget squeeze, even the most optimistic forecasters acknowledge that Medicaid will remain a drag on the budget process at least through the 1990's. "Your best hope with Medicaid is that you can control the rate of spending increase," said Michael J. Dowling, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's deputy secretary for human services.
New York is by no means the only state where expenses for Medicaid are growing rapidly. Several forces are responsible for this seemingly inexorable growth: the aging population, the AIDS epidemic and the unchecked inflation in health-care costs.
But by almost any standard, New York's Medicaid spending dwarfs that of other states. While New York, for instance, has roughly one-tenth of the country's Medicaid recipients, it accounts for almost one-fifth of the money spent.
The high cost of Medicaid in New York reflects many of the state's peculiar problems, including high labor costs, a heavy reliance on hospital care, and poor people who are on the whole sicker and more troubled than in other states. But it is also a reflection of state policy: Not only is it easier to qualify for Medicaid in New York than in most other states, but once you qualify you are entitled to greater benefits. "New York provides levels of services that would be unthinkable in other parts of the country," said Joshua M. Weiner, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
New York also reimburses hospitals at higher rates than many other states, pegging Medicaid reimbursement to private insurance rates.
The costs of New York's Medicaid program are staggering not only for the state, but also for its local governments. Washington pays for half of all Medicaid costs; New York splits the other half with its localities, one of 14 states to require a local contribution. For New York City, where more than 1.5 million of the state's 2.3 million Medicaid recipients live, the local share of the program came to $1.6 billion last year.
Over the years, to take advantage of Federal funds available for the program, the state has shifted so many health programs into Medicaid that a comprehensive overview is almost impossible. But an examination of major elements of the program shows how Medicaid has become so expensive, and why it is so difficult to bring the cost down.
 
The Program
Broad Access and Many Services

The Federal Medicaid program, begun in 1965, is a vast collection of benefits that, like a weather system, changes form as it passes from region to region. Each state administers its own program, and Federal guidelines give states wide latitude to fashion their own package of services and eligibility rules.
States are required to provide Medicaid to all Federal welfare recipients, as well as to any elderly, blind or disabled people who are eligible for Supplemental Security Income payments. But New York extends Medicaid coverage to many groups beyond this.
For example, more than 600,000 New Yorkers whose incomes exceed the welfare threshold receive Medicaid under a classification called "medically needy." Thirty-six states provide some Medicaid coverage to the "medically needy," but most set their income limits far below New York's. A family of three in New York is classified as medically needy if its monthly income is below $725. In Pennsylvania, the family can have an income of only $467, and in Georgia $308.
Because of New York's high cost of living, the state's liberal eligibility standards have rarely come under attack. But its broad benefits have.
Under Medicaid, states are required to offer several services, including hospitalization, family planning and nursing-home care. But many other benefits, like dentistry, optometry, podiatry and emergency hospital care, are considered optional.
Of the 31 optional services, New York offers 26. Only four states -- California, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin -- offer more. And while most states impose limits on optional services, New York has almost none.
Many experts call this unlimited access an invitation to abuse, which by some estimates consumes as much as $2 billion of New York's annual Medicaid budget.
But proposals to limit access have run into heavy opposition from physicians, who fear more paperwork, and advocates for the poor, who argue that such limits will penalize recipients with chronic medical problems.
Late last year, for the first time, Governor Cuomo succeeded in imposing limits on the services that childless adults can receive without special permission: 14 physician visits and 18 laboratory tests a year. The Governor has proposed extending these limits to other Medicaid recipients as well, but the prospects for that plan are uncertain.
 
The Elderly
The High Cost of Nursing Homes
 When Medicaid was introduced in New York in 1966, it was billed as a significant step toward a truly egalitarian society, a program that would, in the words of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, "make it unnecessary for any citizen to go without needed medical care because he is unable to pay for it."
In the intervening years, however, New York's Medicaid program has drifted away from that original intent. More and more of the program's resources are being devoted to the elderly, many of whom are essentially middle class, rather than to the poor.
"Medicaid is not a program that just takes the mother with three kids who doesn't know who the father is," Mr. Dowling, the Governor's adviser, said. "That's a typical myth."
In New York, children make up 46 percent of the population eligible for Medicaid, but consume only about 13 percent of the dollars. By contrast, the elderly make up only 13 percent of the eligible population but spend 41 percent of New York's Medicaid dollars.
The cost of nursing home care -- which is not covered by Medicare, the main Federal health program for the elderly -- is the major factor behind these skewed statistics. Even critics concede that New York's nursing home care is better than in most states, but it is also expensive. Last year, nursing-home care consumed more than $3 billion, or almost 30 percent of all Medicaid dollars spent in New York.
Although New York pays private physicians extremely low rates under Medicaid -- just $11 for many visits -- its payments to institutions like nursing homes, which have powerful lobbying groups, are among the highest in the country. A study by the National Governors' Association found that in 1989, New York's Medicaid nursing-home rate of $112 a day was second only to New Hampshire's.
 
'Spending Down'

Because nursing-home care is so expensive in New York -- private rates average $143 a day -- it is commonplace for patients to enter nursing homes as private patients and eventually become eligible for Medicaid.
This process is known as "spending down" -- patients spend their assets until they fall below Medicaid eligibility standards. More than half of the people who enter nursing homes in New York as private patients and stay more than two years eventually spend down to become eligible for Medicaid.
While the high cost of nursing-home care makes it easy for elderly patients to spend down, New York has made it even easier.
Three years ago, the Federal Government established regulations intended to prevent elderly people from becoming impoverished because of a spouse's illness. These regulations allowed states, within limits, to chose how much income the healthy, or "community," spouse could keep while the ailing spouse became entitled to Medicaid.
New York, unlike most states, chose the most liberal standards allowed.
The Federal regulations provided, for example, that states could allow the community spouse to keep from $12,000 to $60,000 in assets like stocks; New York's Legislature, after heavy lobbying by organizations for the elderly, chose the $60,000 maximum. Similarly, New York allowed the community spouse to keep the maximum monthly income of $1,500.
"For a good part of our experience, Medicaid is a program for the middle class, not the poor," said Jo-Ann A. Costantino, deputy commissioner of social services.
 
Home Care
Expanding Care, Rising Costs
 In an effort to keep people out of expensive nursing homes, New York has aggressively promoted the use of health-care workers who attend to the elderly and disabled in the patients' own homes.
This campaign appears to have been successful: New York has fewer nursing-home beds per elderly resident than most states.
But success has come at a cost: Last year, New York spent almost $2.1 billion on home health care, or roughly 80 percent of all the Medicaid dollars in the country devoted to such care. (Some states finance home health care using other sources of funds; still, New York's costs far exceed the rest of the nation's.)
Home-care costs in New York have been growing explosively in recent years; since 1985, they have more than tripled. State officials attribute the increase to better wages for home-care workers. But the high cost of home care in New York also reflects the state's comprehensive approach toward Medicaid.
While in theory home care saves money by keeping people out of nursing homes, New York has expanded the service to many elderly people who would not necessarily have needed nursing-home care. Under Medicaid, New York provides not only the kind of home care mandated by the Federal Government -- a kind of at-home nursing care -- but also a simpler form of home care, providing help with dressing and bathing, that is considered optional. And the state sets few limits on the amount of home care.
 
Considering the Cost

In an increasing number of cases, the cost of home health care has come to exceed the cost of a nursing home bed, prompting criticism that the program has grown out of control.
State figures show that there are currently 2,400 home-care cases that cost more than $45,000 a year, the average cost of nursing-home care in New York City. Of these, 150 cost more than $100,000 a year. In one case, Medicaid is providing 24-hour-a-day care to an upstate man with Lou Gehrig's disease at an annual cost of almost $200,000.
Current law bars the state from considering cost when determining whether a Medicaid recipient should receive home health care. This year, Governor Cuomo has proposed changing the law, so that some patients could be moved to nursing homes.
But even if this change is approved, home health care costs are expected to continue to rise steeply, in part because of the state's aging population, and in part because of a changing social structure in which many increasingly mobile children can no longer care for their parents.
 
The Poor
Emergency Rooms As the Sole Option
 There is widespread agreement that the poor families for whom Medicaid was intended are the least well served by New York's system.
New York's reimbursement rates for private physicians are so low -- in some categories they are second-lowest after West Virginia's -- that only 25 percent of the state's doctors regularly treat Medicaid patients. As a result, many recipients have come to rely on expensive emergency-room treatment as their primary form of medical care.
A visit to the emergency room at any municipal hospital in New York City offers testimony to the failures of New York's Medicaid program. On a recent afternoon at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, for example, about two dozen patients sat outside the emergency room, waiting to be seen by a physician, while inside, the more seriously ill, wheezing and groaning, were being attended.
The patients in the waiting room -- some Medicaid recipients, some without any insurance -- did not require emergency care; when asked to describe their problems, they labeled them "non-urgent." But they had nowhere else to go, said Dr. Lewis Goldfrank, Bellevue's director of emergency services.
Although there has been little systematic study of the issue, experts say it is clear that over-reliance on emergency rooms is helping to drive up Medicaid costs in New York. Because Medicaid patients often receive inadequate primary care, they say, ailments that could easily have been prevented often become serious illnesses that require expensive hospitalization.
"People come to us with foot injuries because no one taught them to wash between their toes," said Dr. Goldfrank, whose emergency room handles 100,000 visits a year.
In an effort to change this, the state's Department of Social Services has been pushing a new approach toward Medicaid, known in bureaucratic lingo as "managed care." The concept is simple: to enroll Medicaid recipients with group practices, hospital clinics or private physicians who will, for a set fee, oversee their medical care. The goal is to establish long-term relations between doctors and Medicaid patients that will improve preventive care and avert unnecessary expenses later.
Although the department has had some success with managed-care programs, efforts to enroll large numbers of Medicaid recipients have been blocked by a powerful combination of political concerns and institutional inertia.
Insisting that Medicaid patients be able to choose their own health-care program, lawmakers from New York City have long resisted efforts to make managed care mandatory. To date, hospitals have been slow to establish neighborhood clinics, and the state has provided little start-up money.
This year, the state appears to be making some headway toward introducing managed care on a grand scale. A proposal by the Governor to phase in mandatory managed care has received a polite reception in the Legislature, and the state is offering $20 million in grants to hospitals to establish neighborhood clinics. But few experts expect to see any savings from managed care for many years.
"The immediate purpose is to improve access to the right kind of services, " Mr. Dowling said. "It's not to save money in the short run, and anyone who thinks that has the wrong idea."
 
The Prospects
Few Options to Save Money
 By most estimates, New York's current predicament -- reduced resources coupled with increasing needs -- will persist far beyond this year's budget struggle. So, too, will the struggle over how to curb Medicaid costs.
To cut costs significantly, there are few options: reduce eligibility, cut the services offered, limit access to these services or reduce the rates paid to hospitals and nursing homes. All of these options are likely to be pursued in some form in the coming years. But all of them also face substantial political opposition from advocates for the poor and health-care providers.
One of the more radical options, now being tried in Oregon, is to ration Medicaid care, with some procedures given high priority and others shunted to the bottom of the list. But given New York's long history of resistance toward such restrictions, such rationing seems unlikely here.
In the absence of more sweeping changes imposed from Washington, many experts predict that New York's Medicaid program will be the focus of years of wrangling -- and the cause of chronic spending problems.
"There are two choices," said Assemblyman James R. Tallon, a Binghamton Democrat and a nationally recognized Medicaid expert. "Either the country has to look itself in the mirror and say, 'Are we going to adopt a national health-care financing system at long last?' or else we are going to fight these endless guerrilla battles around the edges."
In the abstract, Mr. Tallon said, "everybody supports cutting Medicaid expenditures."
"But when we are finally faced with the ugly reality of how do you cut cost with the tools that are available," he said, "we still as a society don't want to put people out on the street without health care."

Costantino, the deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Social Services, said, "For a good part of our experience, Medicaid is a program for the middle class, not the poor." ; "Your best hope with Medicaid is that you can control the rate of the spending increase," said Michael J. Dowling, deputy secretary for human services. (Photographs by David Jennings for The New York Times) (pg. 25)

HEADLINE: JAPAN RETREATING ON PROMISED LOANS

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 13

 BODY:
Angry over agreements that allow Poland and Egypt to escape foreign debt obligations, Japanese officials say the Government will not provide loans it had promised to those nations and will refuse new loans to other countries that seek debt forgiveness.
The Japanese have been bitterly criticizing President Bush's plan to forgive billions of dollars of the official debt of Poland and Egypt. Officials in Japan's Finance Ministry and its Export-Import Bank, the key agency intended to handle Japan's loans to developing countries, say the Japanese will not fulfill Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's promises to lend Poland $500 million and to provide several loans to Egypt.
 
Tokyo Asserts Itself
 The rift between Japan and the United States is a sign of Japan's growing assertiveness on foreign-aid issues and in setting its own agenda for helping the developing world. The two countries are at odds over a fundamental point in the strategy for dealing with the debt crisis: how big a role politics should be allowed to play in making these economic judgments, and whose political standards should be applied. 
 When Mr. Kaifu pledged the aid to Poland during a visit to Eastern Europe last year, he surprised many Japanese aid specialists because the promise came before financial considerations had been carefully reviewed. With the reversal, it now appears that the formidable Finance Ministry has reasserted itself.
Japanese officials say they feel the Americans are using debt forgiveness to reward certain nations. They complain that this policy encourages financial irresponsibility and makes it difficult to say no to other countries with similar problems.
What some Japanese officials find particularly galling is that they are being criticized for holding to policies long espoused by the United States.
The United States Government has maintained that financial discipline and consistency are essential for fostering improvements in long-term management of the economies of indebted countries. That is one reason the United States had pushed for the restructuring of debts, but not abandonment of them.
Japan has emerged over the past several years as one of the world's largest donors of aid to developing countries, as well as a major government-to-government lender. Japan has budgeted foreign aid of $6.5 billion for the current fiscal year.
Most of the aid and loans are aimed at Asia, where Japanese corporations are centering their investments. But Japan is increasingly providing assistance to Latin America, too.
For its part, the United States has described the debt reduction measures as a selective humanitarian gesture to ease pressure on ailing economies and protect fragile democratic institutions.
 
Political or Economic Decision?
 David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, earlier described Poland and Egypt as "unique politically and economically."
In the Japanese view, Washington's selection of these two countries represents a political decision to reward Poland for its commitment to a rapid transition to capitalism and Egypt for its support in the war against Iraq.
The disagreement has stirred an unusual level of emotion on both sides.
An American official described the Japanese stance as "unconscionable" and "coldly financial," arguing that compassion was called for. A senior Finance Ministry official in Japan characterized America's call for debt forgiveness in conjunction with offering fresh loans as "irrational" and "contradictory."
The United States agreed to forgive 70 percent of the $3.8 billion it has lent Poland. It is seeking overall to eliminate half of Poland's $33 billion in debt to other governments.
 
Restructuring Comes at a Price
 Japan currently has 189 billion yen, or about $1.4 billion, in official loans to Poland. It reluctantly agreed to provide some relief under President Bush's initiative, not by forgiving the principal of loans, but by reducing interest payments and converting some interest payments into principal.
In addition, the United States has said it will forgive about $7 billion in loans to Egypt. Japan will also provide relief to Egypt in accord with the United States initiative, officials said. The Japanese Government has roughly $2 billion in loans outstanding to the Middle Eastern country. Again, the Export-Import Bank will hold off on new loans.
The officials said Japan will fulfill a promise made last fall to supply approximately $700 million in subsidized loans to Egypt. That is part of a total of $2 billion in aid Japan pledged to the front-line states that joined the coalition opposing Iraq. But other new loans will be halted.
 
Forgiveness and Contamination
 Japanese officials say that if the American measures are not contained, they could undermine the carefully crafted Brady plan for resolving the debt crisis. The plan was named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
While the Brady plan relies on some reduction in commercial bank debt in return for new government-to-government loans, the debtor countries must agree to impose market-oriented policies to improve the efficiency of their economies. Under this process, the prospect of repayment of the remaining commercial bank debt is enhanced because fresh collateral is put up.
The Export-Import Bank pledged $2.8 billion in new loans last year to Mexico, Venezuela and the Philippines after they restructured their borrowing under the Brady plan model.
But Japanese officials said they worry that forgiveness will "contaminate" other countries, encouraging them to seek outright reductions rather than struggle to manage their burden. Indeed, the Philippines is reported to have said it would like to erase part of its $28.9 billion in official debt.
 
Japan Clings to Standards
 "We don't want to see such easygoing attitudes among debtor countries," said Hiroyuki Hayakawa, who oversees lending to governments at the Bank of Tokyo, Japan's leading commercial bank in this field.
During a visit to Europe last year, Prime Minister Kaifu pledged $500 million in loans each to Poland and Hungary, to support their difficult transitions from centrally planned to market-based economies.
"Hungary has been making strenuous efforts to pay off its debts, and this should not be discouraged," said a Finance Ministry official. "How do you explain to Hungary what the U.S. did for Poland?"
Japanese officials say they hold to their policies against forgiving debt, in part, because of their own record.
"We are proud of the fact that we never failed to repay any of our debts that we took on for reconstruction after the war," said a Finance Ministry official. "It is good discipline."
"It's sort of the Eastern version of the Calvinist doctrine," an American official said, adding: "Their attitude is entrenched and rigid."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
BUSH STANDS FIRM ON MILITARY POLICY IN IRAQI CIVIL WAR

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 13

 BODY:
Strongly reaffirming United States policy, President Bush said today that Washington would not "interfere" in Iraq's civil war, but he warned Iraq not to try to impede the delivery of emergency aid to refugees fleeing to Turkey and Iran.
Mr. Bush, who has been criticized for declining to support the military uprisings by Kurdish and Muslim Shiite dissidents against the Government of President Saddam Hussein, said: "Internal conflicts have been raging in Iraq for many years, and we're helping out, and we're going to continue to help these refugees. 
 "But I do not want one single soldier or airman shoved into a civil war in Iraq that's been going on for ages," he said. "And I'm not going to have that."
As the President spoke, United States cargo planes and helicopters were stepping up the airlift of supplies to the hundreds of thousands of refugees along the Turkish border. Thousands of others continued to cross into Iran. [Page 10.]
 
Accuses Hussein of 'Savagery'
 An audience of 2,500 students and guests here at the Maxwell Air Force Base War College applauded the President's address several times.
"We will continue to help the Iraqi refugees," he said, "the hundreds and thousands of victims of this man's, Saddam Hussein's, brutality. I see food and shelter and the opportunity to return unharmed to their homes. We will not tolerate any interference in this massive international relief effort."
The President said, "Saddam's continued savagery has placed his regime outside the international order." But he continued: "We will not interfere in Iraq's civil war. The Iraqi people must decide their own political future."
The Administration has been widely criticized as sluggish in its response to the fate of the refugees, in terms of protecting the Kurds and Shiites massing on the borders of Iran and Turkey, and, its critics say, for not moving swiftly enough on humanitarian aid.
 
What Is New World Order?
 Some critics assert that Mr. Bush conducted the Persian Gulf war as a moral crusade, and that his postwar policies on Iraq and the refugees have weakened his position.
Mr. Bush seemed to strike back today, saying that "with Saddam in power, Iraq will remain a pariah nation, its people denied moral contacts with most of the outside world."
"We set our objectives," he said of the war. "These objectives, sanctioned by international law, have been achieved. I made very clear that when our objectives were obtained that our troops would be coming home. I want our troops out of Iraq and back home as soon as possible."
Although Mr. Bush had urged the Iraqi people to rise up and overthrow Mr. Hussein, today he was more restrained, noting that the Iraqis must decide their own future.
Mr. Bush's address was the first of four planned speeches meant to explain what he sees as the new world order. He made the stop here on his way to Pintlala, Ala., to take part in a bass fishing tournament at the home of his friend, Ray Scott, the founder of BassMaster Magazine.
In his speech, the President warned the Soviet Union that it would not share fully in "the new opportunities" of a refashioned world unless it shows progress in moving toward democracy.
 
New Tone Toward Moscow
 During the Persian Gulf crisis, Mr. Bush sought not to criticize Moscow too sharply -- even when Soviet tanks fired on Lithuanian pro-independence protesters in January, the week before the war began -- for fear that he would unravel the delicate international coalition assembled against Mr. Hussein.
But today, the President addressed the tumultuous tug-of-war in the Soviet Union between the hard-liners and those seeking liberalization.
"Let there be no misunderstanding," he said. "The path ahead for the Soviet Union will be difficult and, at times, extraordinarily painful. History weighs heavily on all the peoples of the U.S.S.R. -- liberation from 70 years of Communism, from a thousand years of autocracy.
"It's going to be slow," he said. "There will be setbacks. But this process of reform, this transformation from within must proceed. If external cooperation and our progress toward true international peace is to endure, it must succeed. Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and evolving world order."
 
New World Order Defined
 Mr. Bush defined the new world order, in light of the Persian Gulf war, as "a responsibility imposed by our successes."
Declaring that it was made possible by the collapse of Communism and the new spirit of cooperation with the Soviet Union, Mr. Bush said the tenets of the new world order are: "Peaceful settlements of disputes, solidarity against aggression, reduced and controlled arsenals, and just treatment of all peoples."
A summit meeting between Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, which was supposed to be held this spring in Moscow, was postponed because of the gulf war and because a treaty on conventional arms forces in Europe was not ready.
After President Bush called Mr. Gorbachev this week to suggest some compromises on arms destruction, it looked as if the impasse could be solved. The treaty, under negotiation in Vienna, would lead to the destruction of thousands of weapons for conventional warfare, helicopters, tanks and other combat vehicles.
Mr. Bush is to use the occasion of commencement addresses in May to discuss ways of applying the new world order to the Middle East, to United States national defense policy and to international economic policy.
The President has been assailed this week for using situational ethics with regard to the Middle East.
"Can it really be that the global order America went to war for is designed to protect only the kingdoms of emirs, regardless of the consequences to millions of people?" said a New Republic editorial this week titled "Desert Shame."
But Mr. Bush said today that the new world order was based on American ideals.
"Never before has the world looked more to the American example," he said, adding, "What makes us American is our allegiance to an idea that all people everywhere must be free."

Bush's Uneasy Welcome For Violeta Chamorro

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT VIOLETA BARRIOS de CHAMORRO of Nicaragua will be the toast of Washington when she arrives tomorrow. She will be guest of honor at a formal state dinner at the White House and accorded the rare opportunity of addressing a joint meeting of Congress. No Nicaraguan leader has received such honors since Anastasio Somoza Garcia -- the founder of the Somoza dynasty -- rode with Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a motorcade down Pennsylvania Avenue in 1939.
United States and Nicaraguan officials say Mrs. Chamorro's state visit is evidence of a new respectful relationship. But despite the accolades for Nicaragua's new democracy, and despite Washington's self-congratulations about having helped force the Sandinista Daniel Ortega Saavedra out of the presidency, there remains an uncomfortable reality. 
 Behind the facade of Mrs. Chamorro's elected civilian Government, the Sandinistas continue to wield a large share of power because they still control Nicaragua's army, security forces and most aggressive unions. And hundreds of contras, incensed by the assassination in February of one of their former leaders, Enrique Bermudez, are reported to be planning a new insurgency against Sandinista officials. All the while, the economy remains in shambles.
In a sort of mirror image of the ambiguity that has emerged in Nicaragua since Mrs. Chamorro defeated Mr. Ortega in the February 1990 election, Administration officials in Washington are privately expressing their own strained ambivalence about Mrs. Chamorro. On the one hand, they are charmed by her madonna-like nurturing style -- lending the image of a Latin American Corazon Aquino -- and they hope this will help her to heal Nicaragua's fractured society. Publicly, these officials insist that the United States no longer wants to mold Nicaragua's political future. But despite the public applause, when it comes to making policy, the Administration doesn't always treat her like an ally.
"There are remnants of the old policy" of intervention, noted Ernesto Palazio, Nicaragua's Ambassador to Washington. "It's a knee-jerk reaction." He added, however, that "this trip means that we are establishing the foundations of a stable, close and respectful relationship."
Washington strenuously protested Mrs. Chamorro's early decision to appease the left by retaining Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, Daniel Ortega's brother, as commander of the army. The Administration has not yet dispersed nearly half of the $300 million in aid it was scheduled to send to Nicaragua this fiscal year, pressing Managua to overhaul its banking system and reform its state-directed economy.
 
Human Rights Questions
 Most recently, the State Department took Nicaragua to task in a human rights report that lent credence to reports that Sandinista units have executed many contras and contra sympathizers, and that Sandinista agents continue to torture prisoners.
Tempers flared in Managua last month when the Administration privately urged the Soviet Union to cut off shipments of spare parts to the Sandinista-led army in protest against its continued smuggling of weapons to guerrilla groups operating in Honduras and El Salvador.
And in recent days, Nicaraguan officials have complained that the Administration is leaking reports to the press that there is circumstantial evidence linking the Sandinista high command, including General Ortega, to the slaying of Mr. Bermudez. "Why can't they share the information with us?" asked a Nicaraguan official.
"We see eye to eye on the big issues," said a State Department official. "But I don't want to downplay the problems we have. The arms transfers are very serious. The human rights situation in the countryside is very serious."
Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said there was a central paradox: "We want the stability of a democracy but the cooperation of a dictatorship."
Mrs. Chamorro's visit is likely to underline her Government's mixed record, and reopen the Central America debate in Washington, at least for a few days.
Republican conservatives led by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina say Mrs. Chamorro's record is so blotched that she does not deserve the honors she is to receive. Mr. Helms says it is unjust for Congress to invite Mrs. Chamorro to speak before a joint meeting when it is unwilling to do the same for the Dalai Lama, the anti-Communist leader of Tibetan resistance to Chinese rule, when he arrives in Washington later this month.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps affairs, said he hopes Mrs. Chamorro's visit will encourage the Administration and Congress to grant more assistance in the future. The Administration, he complained, takes the position that "This is our gal but the problem is she is not being a good gal."
"They give her all the trappings, all the dinners, the photo ops," Senator Dodd said. "But the one thing she would prefer is the money."

AIDS Protesters Test State Needle Laws

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
TWO trials that opened last Monday on the East and West Coasts could mark a turning point in the debate over how to prevent AIDS among drug users, their sex partners and their unborn babies. The issue at stake in New York City and Redwood City, Calif., is whether the threat of AIDS justifies giving away clean needles in violation of state laws.
Across the country, advocates for AIDS victims have openly defied authorities by giving out needles. At the same time, the campaign to legalize needle distribution has won victories in courts and legislatures as well as on the streets. 
 "There's a real civil disobedience movement that's having an effect on public policy," said Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais, a member of the Federal Commission on AIDS. Eleven states outlaw the sale or possession of hypodermic needles without a prescription: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Illinois and California. In the other 39 states, needles are considered illicit if found with contraband drugs.
Legal needles that retail for less than 20 cents each fetch up to $5 on the black market. Addicts often borrow used needles, which may be contaminated with the AIDS virus. Once infected by sharing needles, addicts can transmit the virus through sex and pregnancy.
In the cases that went to trial last week, defendants staged public needle giveaways and invited arrest. Other test cases are pending in Newark and in the Massachusetts towns of Lowell, Roxbury and Worcester. Jon C. Parker, who founded the National AIDS Brigade, which gives away needles and collects dirty ones, was acquitted in Boston last year after arguing that he was saving lives. Later he was arrested in Rhode Island and Delaware but charges were dropped. A public health graduate student at Yale and an ex-addict, he is one of eight defendants in the New York trial and was an organizer of the incident that led to the case in Redwood City.
There are signs that the campaign is having an effect. The Connecticut legislature authorized New Haven's health department to start providing needles last fall, with the endorsement of the mayor and police commissioner. Supporters of needle distribution programs include the mayors of Boston, Baltimore and San Francisco. Even states that already allow people to buy needles without a prescription are trying to make access easier. Hawaii's legislature approved needle distribution. Local projects have sprouted in Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo. Tacoma, Wash., offers swift needle delivery to addicts who call in.
The nation's biggest needle program, Prevention Point in San Francisco, distributes nearly 8,000 needles a week. Last year San Francisco residents adopted a referendum asking the state to legalize the program, which was started in 1988. The rate of infection with the AIDS virus among addicts there had doubled to nearly 13 percent from the year before. Since then, the level has remained stable. Samplings of East Coast addicts show infection rates of 50 percent or more.
Official needle distribution programs are growing in Europe. "Internationally, the U.S. is the exception," Dr. Des Jarlais said. Although the National Academy of Sciences recommended researching the effects of needle distribution, the Bush Administration has barred Federal funds to pay for needles or study programs sponsored outside the Government.
 
Treatment on Demand
 Opponents also include some prosecutors, religious leaders, politicians, minority leaders and drug treatment experts who contend that giving away needles encourages drug abuse. Mayor David N. Dinkins and Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., the New York City Health Commissioner, are opposed to the programs. After canceling a small needle-exchange program, Dr. Myers said he would prefer the city to work toward a policy of treatment on demand for any addict who wanted it.
Proponents of the programs argue that there is no evidence that needle restrictions reduce drug abuse. Addicts intent on shooting up will find needles, they say, resorting to used ones if necessary. Studies show that recipients of free needles are less likely to share them. Sometimes the giveaway programs serve as bridges to encourage addicts to seek treatment. Proving that the programs reduce AIDS cases is hampered by the years-long lag between infection and symptoms. But cases of hepatitis B dropped among needle recipients in San Francisco and Amsterdam. Baltimore researchers found that addicts with diabetes, who have legal access to needles for insulin, were infected with the AIDS virus at a rate less than half that for other drug users.
People on both sides of the debate agree that the ideal is to get addicts off drugs. But Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, a former New York City Health Commissioner, says that not all addicts are willing or able to quit. And those who seek treatment face monthslong waiting lists at underfunded clinics. He testified for the eight New York defendants last week, calling them courageous.
Strategists hope that winning more cases will enable needle distribution to flourish without fear of reprisal, and perhaps even to win government financing. But adverse court rulings could turn the test cases into setbacks rather than breakthroughs.
Giving needles to addicts "is not something we like to do, but if we don't, people are going to die for lack of a stupid needle," said Dr. Mathilde Krim, cofounder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Dr. Krim helped hand out needles in San Francisco last year during the international AIDS conference. "Laws should help people," she said, "not hurt them."

How a Tribe in Connecticut Is Taking On Atlantic City

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

DATELINE: LEDYARD, CONN.

 BODY:
EACH week, busloads of bingo players from New England and the New York metropolitan area arrive at the tiny Mashantucket Pequot reservation near the Rhode Island border for the high-stakes games that were legalized in 1986. By next fall, these gamblers and thousands more may find something else: a new casino, the first on the Eastern seaboard outside of Atlantic City.
"We expect to start construction probably in early May and be open by October," said Alfred J. Luciani, a casino consultant and chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Enterprise. The all but assured Pequot casino would arrive after a lengthy legal battle and despite continuing opposition to casinos in the state. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that casinos could attract organized crime, and has argued that since the state prohibits such gambling elsewhere it should be banned on the 1,700-acre reservation. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. is also opposed. 
 Other officials, however, note that the state is already deeply involved in legalized gambling and collected $265.7 million in revenue in the 1989-90 fiscal year on lottery games, jai alai, dog racing and off-track betting. They argue that Connecticut should license its own casinos since it lacks a broad-based tax on personal income and has a projected $2.6 billion budget shortfall for the next 15 months. Because of the Pequot's sovereignty, the tribe is not required to pay taxes or a share of its profits to the state, local or Federal government.
"Casino gambling is now a reality, and they would have the only casino between the North Pole and Atlantic City," said state Representative Ronald L. Smoko, a Democrat from Hamden. "Perhaps the proper remediation is to have casino gambling on a limited basis in limited locations."
Proponents of casino gambling in Connecticut cite numerous other states that have already approved casinos. In 1988 South Dakota legalized some casino games in Deadwood, and Colorado has authorized casino-style gambling to begin in three towns this fall. Iowa also started allowing gambling on Mississippi riverboats this month, and other states are expected to soon follow.
The Pequot, a tiny 200-member tribe, were the first Indian tribe east of the Mississippi to secure a gambling compact with a state under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which was approved in 1988 and gives federally recognized tribes the right to negotiate the operation of games of chance if that form of gambling is already permitted in the state.
Citing a Connecticut law that allows nonprofit organizations to hold "Las Vegas nights" to raise money by conducting standard games of chance like blackjack and roulette, the Pequot met the requirement to negotiate for a casino. But after negotiations between the state and the tribe failed to produce a compact, the Pequot requested and obtained a mediator. After a long and complicated process, a Federal District Court ruled in May 1990 that Connecticut was not negotiating in good faith, citing the length of time the process was taking. A Federal mediator then asked state officials and the tribe to submit separate plans for casino gambling. The mediator selected the state plan, which, paradoxically, was almost identical to the Pequot plan, but the state officials then refused to consent to it. After failing to persuade a Federal appeals court to grant a stay in the case, the state appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that they had not negotiated in bad faith, that the Federal law allowing casinos had been misinterpreted and that the issue should never have been mediated.
The Supreme Court is to decide on April 22 whether it will hear the case. Two weeks ago, Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr filed a friend-of-the-court brief siding with the Pequot. Last week the Department of the Interior announced it was going to implement the mediator's plan. "The Government would be very surprised if the Court decided to hear the case," said Michael D. Cox, the general counsel to the National Indian Gaming Commission, which was created under the 1988 Federal law to oversee gambling on reservations.
The Pequot casino in Ledyard, a small, rural town of 14,500 residents about 15 miles north of New London, would greatly enhance the economy in New London County, which has been hit hard by job losses at major defense-related companies like the Electric Boat submarine shipyard in Groton and United Nuclear Corporation in Montville. Mr. Luciani said it would create about 1,500 jobs and provide tribal members with funds for a museum, a research center and additional housing. It is unclear how much profit the casino will make for the Pequot, although Mr. Luciani has said that the operation will gross about $80 million annually.
The casino itself will be modest, about half the size of the smallest casino in Atlantic City, with a capacity of about 1,000 customers. Mr. Luciani, who as a member of the New Jersey Attorney General's office helped draft the state's Casino Control Act, said the structure would be understated, forgoing neon and blending into the wooded surroundings. "It's New England architecture and intended to be parklike in its decor," he said.
Mr. Luciani added that a casino in Ledyard is minutes away from the coastal towns of Mystic and Stonington, and it would be a serious competitor with Atlantic City because southeastern Connecticut is a far more attractive region. "The people in Atlantic City -- not because of the industry but because of Atlantic City -- have an inferior product," he said.

HEADLINE: Driving Banks to Desperate Risks

 BODY:
The House Banking Committee is reportedly on the verge of making a grievous decision to delay action on comprehensive bank reform until after Congress fixes the deposit insurance system. If that happens, banks will be forced to pay higher costs but will have no way to increase earnings. With hundreds of banks already reeling, that's an incendiary combination.
The decision to delay would be misguided for another reason: Congress can't intelligently decide how to reform deposit insurance without knowing how it wishes to reform the banking system. Disconnecting the two decisions risks a big, and lasting, mistake. 
 Many U.S. banks are in trouble; some of the largest banks are close to bankrupt. They are losing their best customers to other financial institutions and foreign banks; and they are earning less profit on customers that remain.
In part, their predicament is due to antiquated laws that forbid interstate banks and limit investments. Nine of Texas's 10 largest banks have collapsed; no such catastrophe would have occurred had they been able to branch out to other states or to invest less in real estate.
As banks begin to fail, they try to survive by gambling with insured deposits -- making risky loans to real estate developers or underdeveloped countries. Losses mount, and taxpayers foot the bill.
One remedy is to allow banks to diversify their investments so they can earn reasonable profit without unreasonable risk. The Treasury Department has made just such a proposal. It would permit banks to set up branches anywhere in the country and enter the insurance, securities and mutual fund industries. These changes would insulate banks from regional downturns and open up new sources of profit.
Another remedy is to tighten regulation. The Treasury plan would empower regulators to close down banks before they went bankrupt, threatening taxpayers. Critics charge, justifiably, that the Treasury plan doesn't go far enough: regulators must be required, not just enabled, to intervene once shareholder equity begins to fall.
Here's a place where Congress can make a pivotal improvement in the Treasury plan. Indeed, there is a compelling argument that limits on insured deposits can be completely removed if bank reform is passed -- a benefit that could not even be imagined were Congress to turn matters upside down and fiddle with deposit insurance first.
Any change in bank reform forces Congress to pick winners and losers. Permitting interstate banks threatens small banks; letting banks into related financial sectors threatens insurance and securities firms. The politically safe course is to duck, and pay attention only to the near-bankrupt Federal deposit insurance fund. But what's politically safe is economically destructive.
A healthy economy needs healthy banks. The American banking system, however, is on the ropes and cannot afford a Congress that dithers.

HEADLINE: Costly Foot-Dragging in Albany

 BODY:
Once again, New York's leaders have failed to deliver a state budget on time. They're already 14 days late, and every day costs New Yorkers money. How can legislators and Gov. Mario Cuomo justify wasting millions of dollars even as the state sinks deeper into its recession?
Delay is expensive because, while waiting for state aid, localities have to borrow at high interest costs. To meet its payroll, New York City will soon have to sell about $1 billion worth of notes to make up for missing state money. That will cost the strapped city up to $20 million in interest. 
 Albany's foot-dragging also makes it difficult for local governments to adopt their own budgets because they don't know how much state aid to expect.
What's delaying Albany's leaders, of course, is their dread of dealing with a budget gap of at least $6 billion -- 20 percent of a $30 billion budget. Mr. Cuomo, adamantly opposed to raising income taxes, proposes a 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase, painful spending cuts and an unwise welter of one-shot revenues. Assembly Speaker Mel Miller says no to the gas tax and yes to an income tax. The Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, is against an income tax hike and noncommittal on the gas tax; and now he's making the empty gesture of promising his own plan -- two weeks past the budget deadline.
What's everybody waiting for? There is no rescue in sight, no surprises, just more bad economic news to compound the state's troubles. It is increasingly difficult to understand why New York's leaders cannot face up to their jobs.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
The New Saturn: Lustre Under the Skin

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
It has taken a very long time, but Saturn is finally here. Saturn, the ultimate answer from General Motors to all those pesky gnats from Japan.
Yes, yes, you've heard all this before. There was the J-car of the early 80's. There were the likes of the J2000 from Pontiac, the Cavalier from Chevrolet. There was even the Cimarron, and Cadillac would probably be just as happy if I hadn't mentioned that one at all. 
They were among the cars that were going to save the General's stars and, moreover, be the salvation of Detroit. Uh huh.
But Saturn is a whole new family of cars, the first since G.M. added Chevrolet in 1918. In fact, Saturn is a wholly new corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary formed to create a wholly new way of building cars and doing business.
The idea was to get rid of the old labor-management hostilities, to involve all the workers, to build a new plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., and to change the way automobiles were conceived and constructed. The marketing, too, would be different, with every accent placed on customer satisfaction.
The new corporation was formed in 1985, but even then the idea had been three years in the making. And, when I got behind the wheel, it seemed the wait had been too long.
It was, I thought, sort of the Gone-With-the- Wind syndrome. All my life, I had heard about that movie. And when I finally did get to see it, the reality was exceeded by the expectation. Much like Saturn, I thought.
I have been driving Saturn's reality for the past week, a white SL2 touring sedan, the top of the line if you don't count the four-seat sports coupe, which is designated an SC. The sedan seats five, and my first notion was that it had accomplished what no American car had accomplished before: Saturn had successfully imitated what had been available from Japan all along.
A nice little Japanese car from Tennessee, I thought. It has a long beak that provides a family resemblance to the rest of G.M.'s small cars. It is tidy and without quirk on the road. It is quiet and roomy, given its small shell, and it is reasonably thrifty. But I had nits to pick with this gnat.
Forgive the cliche, but G.M. started with a clean sheet of paper. And how could you create a new car, particularly one with nine years of gestation, and not have an air bag? How can you have a car whose rear windows don't go all the way down?
Why are antilock brakes not a standard item? And how could you come up with a car whose glovebox lid has indents for cups and then have that lid open and stop at a 30-degree angle?
The lack of an air bag means that the car has to have mechanized seatbelts, those infuriating contraptions that startle and sometimes strangle the unwary. But the Saturn does provide a chime and warning lights to remind you to buckle the lap belt, an important addition.
So somebody was thinking for all those years. And the car does have a steel spaceframe with ding-proof plastic body panels attached, a la the late and, for my part, lamented Pontiac Fiero. Where metal is used, it is galvanized, a plus that staves off corrosion. And there is a stainless-steel exhaust system.
Things, I thought, were beginning to look better. And I realized that a lot of what is really good about the Saturn doesn't show. The glossy paint is designed to be crack-proof as it bends with the plastic doors, fenders and quarter-panels. And everything is meant for easy service, both by the car's owner and by the dealer.
All fluids -- oil, coolant, transmission, power steering, brakes and windshield washer -- can be checked by standing in one spot. Dipstick handles, located in a common area, are coded by color for easy identification.
Repair simplicity was worked out in conjunction with insurers, so that premiums on the car would be lower.
There is a plug-in port, so the car can be diagnosed with a handheld computer that analyzes all of the annoying stuff, including the intermittent problems that happen only when you are watching. Microprocessors are used throughout the car, and the technology is top notch, as is assembly.
The car's quality is said to be higher than that of any other G.M. product, and the company has reported that many Saturns are coming off the assembly line with zero defects. That compares with two to four defects for most other General Motors automobiles.
And the more I looked, the more I realized that the white sedan was indeed a pleasant addition to the driveway. Inside, it had all the amenities, including central locking and a power sunroof that opens as a vent or slides back on top of the roof, saving valuable headroom.
The radio has knobs instead of rocker switches, and that's all to the good, as are the comfortable front buckets and the rear bench seat that is split, 60-40, to form a pass-through to the trunk. In fact, the Saturn proves itself eminently easy to live with.
On the road, it feels more substantial than its surprisingly light 2,300 to 2,400 pounds would indicate, and the fuel economy is reasonable if not great.
With the standard five-speed transmission and the base engine, the mileage figures are 27, city, and 37, highway, and those numbers range downward to 23 and 32, when you order the "performance" engine and an automatic transmission.
Like the rest of the car, the all-new engines and transmissions are made in Tennessee. The aluminum powerplants are 1.9-liter fours, producing 85 horsepower in the base version and 123 in the performance configuration, which adds dual overhead camshafts and has four valves per cylinder.
The company likes to call the engine-transmission combination a "power module," and the modules are mounted transversely to drive the front wheels.
How well they drive them depends on the combination, and zero-to-60 acceleration ranges from a leisurely 13.7 seconds to a surprisingly quick 9.2.
Maybe the most surprising aspect of the Saturn, though, is its price. The coupe and sedans, in several levels of trim, start at a mere $7,995 and top out at $11,775. Optional equipment can add another $2,600 or so, but that still means a sticker that is competitively low.
Maybe this time. . . .

A TALE OF TWO CITIES

BYLINE: BY CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
APRIL HAS BECOME THE MONTH OF FURNITURE fairs on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, the International Market, the country's largest to-the-trade event, opens in High Point, N.C., on Thursday and runs through April 26. Thousands of buyers and merchandise managers come to see new designs they might buy for stores this fall.
For the first time this year, April is also the month Milan becomes a furniture mecca. The Salone del Mobile di Milano, indisputably the world's most influential furniture fair, which for the last 30 years has been held in September, has been moved to April. It opened Friday and runs to Wednesday. "There's no question Milan will be the most exciting; it always is," says Carl Levine, a Bloomingdale's senior vice president. "The Italian manufacturers consider design a priority, whereas Americans are looking for recession-busters -- designs they simply hope will sell." 
 As in the last few seasons, furniture at High Point will be dreary, as traditional designs continue to take the spotlight. Many have designer labels, a result of manufacturers' continuing to commission big names like Mark Hampton, Vicente Wolf, Mario Buatta and Adam Tihany to design lines.
By contrast, the Milan show is expected to make news. Indeed, architects and designers from around the world will be featuring innovative objects -- everything from the truly wacky to the sleek but livable. Although the Milan market has also been suffering from sagging sales for the last year, experts predict designs will not suffer; indeed, they will be especially unusual. "The furniture must be original and fresh to succeed," says Ivan Luini, a United States representative for many furniture companies, including Cappellini and Kartell. "When Milan gets conservative, it will signal the end of Italian design."

Secret Sharers: Solo Acts in a Confessional Age

BYLINE: By DAVID RICHARDS

 BODY:
I always assumed the one person play was the theater's way of dealing with the shrinking dollar. You really can't get more basic -- a performer, a platform, a text. Take away anything else and what do you have? A loon emoting in the street or a mime show.
Lately, though, I've been wondering if the form, which usually brings a historical figure back from the grave to chat with us -- presumably in his or her own words -- isn't curiously attuned to our times in a deeper way. We have never been so besotted with celebrities. We have even come to believe that celebrityhood carries with it one duty above all others: an obligation to spill the beans. 
 It's still too early to pin a label on the current season. But if you're looking for distinguishing characteristics -- beyond the hullabaloo caused by the coming to town of "Miss Saigon" -- there's no avoiding the rash of solo endeavors. Julie Harris, assuming the strange, silvery persona and exotic wardrobe of the Danish writer Isak Dinesen in "Lucifer's Child," is only the latest example. She has been preceded by reincarnations of Virginia Woolf ("A Room of One's Own"), Huey Long ("The Kingfish"), Lyndon Baines Johnson ("Lyndon") and Florence Aadland ("The Big Love"), among others.
Economics, of course, is not to be discounted in any of these cases. The new penury is upon us. The city is cutting back on services, department stores on their inventories, restaurants on the $50 entrees. It follows that the theater would scale back, too, although when a show like "The Big Love" ends up costing $800,000, "scaling back" is a relative term.
There is, however, another explanation for this vogue of one-person plays. We're very close to it when, for example, Miss Harris first mentions the lifelong syphilis, "the flowering of Nemesis . . . inside me," that ravaged Isak Dinesen's health. "There are two things a woman can do in such a situation," she explains forthrightly, "accept it or shoot the man." Then, fixing the audience at the Music Box Theater with a look that is both elegant and defiant and perhaps a little mischievous, too, she explains what she did instead. "I gave my soul to Lucifer. In return, he promised to transmute my sorrow into tales the whole world would read. So, you see, I am Lucifer's child."
The British actress Eileen Atkins, who is the sly, piercingly intelligent and altogether bracing Virginia Woolf in "A Room of One's Own" at the Lamb's Theater, is ostensibly talking about women and literature when she asserts that "it is fatal for anyone to be a man or a woman pure and simple. One must be woman-manly, or man-womanly." The act of fruitful artistic creation, she argues, depends on "some collaboration . . . in the mind between the woman and the man." For a second, her fierce intensity goes beyond the confines of literature and seems to dare us, presumably so sure of our definitions, to define gender. A revolutionary's zeal is clearly stirring in this concentrated creature.
In both instances, the characters are approaching confession, and confession, these days, has become something of a national obsession. Rare is the sin that cannot be absolved by being publicly aired. Keeping secrets, once a component of good manners, is suspect. And in the theater, the quickest way to get characters to reveal themselves is to put them in one-person plays.
What other choice do they have? They're there to reminisce, settle scores, set a record or two straight and generally sum themselves up. Occasionally, they will answer the telephone or call out to an invisible maid. But those are just diversionary maneuvers. We're the ones they're really addressing -- owning up to, you could say. Conventional plays expect us to be no more than onlookers. But the one-person play casts us as confidants.
There was some critical disagreement over the value of what Florence Aadland had to tell the world in the recently departed "Big Love." As the mother of Beverly Aadland, onetime 1950's starlet and underage mistress of Errol Flynn, she witnessed Hollywood lowlife from the sidelines and fooled herself into thinking she was at the center of big-time glamour. But Tracey Ullman's extraordinary performance gave no hint whatsoever that the woman was holding anything back. For better or worse, sympathy or ridicule, there she was -- a flashy, foolish nobody, pouring out her tinseled heart to us and, since her candor was stronger than her vanity, admitting to an artificial foot, as well.
Likewise, Miss Harris's magical presence is the glory and redemption of "Lucifer's Child," a more ambitious play, but not necessarily a more successful one. The script is by William Luce, who has already stitched the retiring existence of Emily Dickinson into the luminous "Belle of Amherst" for Miss Harris and fashioned the travails of Lillian Hellman into the feisty "Lillian" for Zoe Caldwell. This time, however, his work seems particularly piecemeal and unfocused. The setting is Denmark just before and just after a lecture trip that Dinesen, then in her mid-70's, made to America in 1959 -- hardly a pivotal event in her life. Why, it may well be asked, are we tuning in here?
The movie "Out of Africa" painted Dinesen as a romantic heroine struggling to make a go of a coffee plantation in Kenya and braving man, beast and elements. "Lucifer's Child" seems to view her as a cross between a crumbling grande dame of letters and a disease-ridden Auntie Mame who calls her fur piece "Beowulf" and gathers mushrooms by the light of an electric torch. It is only Miss Harris's confidential performance that makes a whole of this patchwork of memories, yearnings and regrets. Her voice has always sounded like heartbreak feels. And her powdery-white face remains triumphantly mutable. Depending on the light, you can see in it the child, the flirt, the crusader or the crone. That helps.
The one-person play, after all, has a lot of places to go and people to see, even if it's only the mind's eye that's doing the visiting. Or, more to the point, the re-visiting -- which brings us to a fundamental drawback of the form: it is backward-looking. The emotions being experienced are recollected emotions. The time for doing is long over. (The folksy demagogue John McConnell portrays in "The Kingfish" at the John Houseman Theater is already dead at the play's start and coming to us, apparently, from the other side.) What's left is the recounting, which is why the one-person play tends to be nostalgic in thrust. It prefers the question "Who was I?" to the more nettlesome "Who am I?"
A way exists out of this trap, although it is not open to everyone. Some one-person plays, instead of recreating a life, recreate a public moment in the life. That usually means repairing to the lecture hall or the legitimate theater itself, where the individual might once have appeared. Such was the tactic taken by Hal Holbrook in "Mark Twain Tonight," which is probably responsible, as much as anything, for the flowering of the one-person show in our times. Preceded by a puff of cigar smoke, Mr. Holbrook ambled on stage, as Twain himself had done at the end of his career, to tell a few tall tales, talk about piloting a steamboat down the Mississippi, and then read a selection from "Tom Sawyer" or "Huckleberry Finn."
The advantages of this approach are obvious. The stage is treated as a stage, not a confessional, and the audience can be addressed, with no violation of logic, as an audience. More importantly, the subject is still active and operating in the present tense. Packing and unpacking are all that Isak Dinesen can find to do in the here and now, before an old dress or a faded photograph activates her memories. Her dramatic motivation is the memorabilia all around her. But Mr. Holbrook's Twain had a lecture to give -- which is to say a purpose and a dramatic necessity.
So does Miss Atkins, as she makes her way through the audience and up onto the wood-paneled stage, removes her cloche hat and wraparound coat and prepares to share an opinion "upon one minor point" with the young ladies of Girton College. "A woman," she says, "must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction." The elaboration of that deceptively simple thesis leads her to consider the status of women throughout history, ponder the implications of men and wealth, and recount the tragic destiny of one Judith Shakespeare, imaginary sister of Will and every bit as inspired, who tried to follow in his footsteps and came to a sorry end.
The script has been adapted by Patrick Garland from Woolf's book, "A Room of One's Own," which is an expansion of two papers the writer herself delivered in Cambridge in 1928. Miss Atkins, crafty as the fox she resembles with her sharp eyes and long nose, makes an exhilarating adventure out of it -- leading us surely along the path of Woolf's thought, pausing here and there to let us drink in the magnificent vistas, before pushing onward, past boulder and precipice, to the dizzying summit. Knowing that the audience expects "a peroration," Miss Atkins obliges in the final dazzling moments by expanding a shrewd feminist manifesto into a thrilling call for freedom that includes everyone in the hall.
"A Room of One's Own" is the least anecdotal of one-person shows, resorting to autobiography only when it's necessary to reinforce an intellectual point. While sentiment is discouraged, wit and irony are plentifully indulged. ("There are people whose charity embraces even the prune," she notes at one point, with a faint curl of distaste that indicts the charity as much as the prune.) In the workings of her quick mind, however, we sense Woolf's essence as keenly as if she were reading excerpts from her diary.
 Today's performance artists are probably reluctant to acknowledge a debt to the one-person play. But really how different was, say, Wallace Shawn's extended mea culpa, "The Fever"? We never did learn the identity of the speaker, marooned in a revolution-torn country in the third world and feeling profoundly guilty about his privileged life. It is safe to assume, though, that a large part of the character, well born and cultivated, was Mr. Shawn himself. On the other hand, there was never any question that Spalding Gray was the subject of "Monster in a Box" -- Mr. Gray being the subject of all his monologues. In fact, there isn't anything he won't tell you about himself, which certainly makes him the right man at the right time in the right society.
Not too long ago, when someone said, "That's a personal matter," "personal" meant "none of your business." No more. Biographers don't consider their work well done unless they have painted "an intimate portrait." Supermarket tabloids thrive on blabbing -- and sometimes inventing -- the embarrassments of the rich and the notorious. But most of all, television, I think, has sanctioned this urge to pry. The mighty willingly submit to the indignities of the so-called in-depth interview, while common citizens think nothing of going on talk shows to divulge the troubles they are having with the law, their sexual partners or their kidneys. Even humiliating home videos are now the stuff of highly rated TV specials. What are we to conclude? We are peeping Toms without even leaving our living rooms.
The one-person play merely represents the high end of what has become a ravenous appetite for the low down.

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
American Ballet Theater Spreads Its New Wings

BYLINE: By Anna Kisselgoff

 BODY:
When Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith were appointed as directors of American Ballet Theater a little over a year ago, their mandate seemingly was to bring back the Ballet Theater everyone knew before Mikhail Baryshnikov's 10-year reign as artistic director. Now, with a nine-week season that opens a week from tomorrow at the Metropolitan Opera House, the new team could be charged, paradoxically, with offering only the familiar.
Mr. Baryshnikov has withdrawn the rights to his versions of the full-length classics, but much of his repertory from last season is back, as are ballets from the pre-Baryshnikov regime of Lucia Chase and Mr. Smith. While the schedule for this season includes two company premieres (Jiri Kylian's "Sinfonietta" and Vladimir Vasiliev's "Don Quixote"), plus restagings and guest stars like Sylvie Guillem and Carla Fracci, there are no world premieres, as there have been in previous years. 
 Does this season reflect a lack of an adventurousness or an obligation to work within the strictures of economic retrenchment? A strong advance sale for the Met season and certain performances that are already sold out (Ms. Guillem's "Bayadere" on May 18) indicate that Ms. Hermann knows Ballet Theater's audience. Critics might look for creativity; an opera-house audience might well prefer individual performers and a repertory with which it is comfortable.
What Ms. Hermann knows is that the survival of a major American institution like Ballet Theater should not be taken for granted. But in her view, budget restrictions can accommodate artistic policies, rather than the other way around.
"I'm not going to apologize for the fact that we're alive," Ms. Hermann said vehemently during a recent interview in her Ballet Theater office in Manhattan. Although Mr. Smith, a distinquished stage designer who has been closely involved in the season's new production of "Coppelia," contributes to overall planning, it is generally acknowledged that Ms. Hermann is the dominant member of the team.
In discussing the specifics of the forthcoming season, Ms. Hermann also defined long-range policies that she considers necessary to assure Ballet Theater's survival. One significant proposal is for an innovative touring subsidy from the troupe's board and the nurturing of support in communities across the country: Ballet Theater, she emphasized, is a national institution, worthy of recognition and underwriting in cities whose first loyalty is often to a local ballet company.
Ballet Theater, having settled a labor contract dispute last fall, has reduced its current budget to the unusually low figure of $16.5 million. Last year, Ms. Hermann had cut the $23 million Baryshnikov budget to $18 million. This season, she said, "Ballet Theater has put on a first-rate repertory and produced it in a way that shows off the dancers beautifully, a way that allows us to save the life of A.B.T."
Referring to financial problems encountered within the past year by numerous ballet troupes, including the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet, Ms. Hermann continued: "We have never operated without meeting the payroll, had dancers stay in people's houses, not paid taxes or defaulted on health insurance. I could have walked around with a tin cup too, but we didn't."
The regular layoff periods for the company have, however, grown longer, and the roster of dancers now numbers 85, compared with 102 three years ago. Ms. Hermann said this reduction was made through attrition. Martine van Hamel, a senior principal who started out on this year's national tour during the winter, left the company after she was offered a guest contract but did not get the roles she desired. Fernando Bujones, Cynthia Gregory, Ms. Fracci and Ms. Guillem are listed as guest artists and are paid per performance rather than on a weekly basis.
If the new season is the first planned by Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith, it does not yet reflect the long view of the company that Ms. Hermann has in mind.
One factor, she said, that "determined the repertoire of a season that was affordable" involved the "qualities of the dancers." "Coppelia," a box-office favorite, was revived with new scenery by Tony Straiges, because, Ms. Hermann said, "I had such casting in depth. In addition, the men were underutilized." Danilo Radojevic, Johan Renvall and Gil Boggs were "capable of doing more dancing than they were getting," she said of three bravura dancers who will be seen in "Coppelia."
Enrique Martinez, who staged the company's previous version of the comic ballet, was asked mainly to supervise the same choreography in an elaborate new setting. But Vladimir Vasiliev, the former Bolshoi star, has staged a "Don Quixote" that is markedly different from the streamlined entertainment that Mr. Baryshnikov's 1978 version offered.
Mr. Baryshnikov (who left the Ballet Theater in a dispute with Ms. Hermann in September 1989) has withdrawn the rights to all his stagings of the classics, although the costumes and scenery remain with Ballet Theater. As a result, Ms. Hermann invited Mr. Vasiliev, who had made Basilio (the ballet's hero) in "Don Quixote" one of his greatest roles with the Bolshoi. According to Ms. Hermann, "Vasiliev has doubled the amount of bravura dancing, and his rehearsals have added enormously to the projection you will see on on stage."
Ms. Hermann said that Mr. Kylian, in selecting dancers for the company premiere of his "Sinfonietta," had chosen some of the same dancers because of their energy level. This exuberant ballet, with its fanfares of trumpets by Janacek, was the hit of the Netherlands Dance Theater debut 10 years ago at the Met, where Ms. Hermann was director of presentations.
While the world outside ballet might wonder at the concern over arcane points that divide dancegoers or prompt criticism of company directors, these are the very details that help define a troupe's artistic policy.
A restaging this season that will be closely watched is George Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial." John Taras, long one of Balanchine's balletmasters at the New York City Ballet, staged it for Ballet Theater, where he was associate director until last year.
The revised version that Balanchine sanctioned at the City Ballet is very different in style. While there is much to be said for Ballet Theater's attempt to regain the textbook manner of dancing prevalent at the work's premiere in 1941, Barbara Horgan, head of the Balanchine trust, was among those worried that the staging looked old-fashioned.
"At Barbara Horgan's request," Ms. Hermann said, "we brought in Patricia Neary to restage the ballet."
The relationship between music and dancing is complex in a Balanchine ballet, and after a misunderstanding between the pianist and the conductor during a performance of "Ballet Imperial" on tour this winter, Ms. Hermann decided that "one of our major expenditures will have to be for music. Economics has dictated that we have cut rehearsal time with musicians. I have asked the board for extra full-orchestra rehearsals."
A repertory art like ballet, by definition, includes repeats from last season; Ms. Hermann notes that subscribers must get a chance to see what they missed, and it is economically unfeasible to "rehearse five full-length ballets and 16 short ones from scratch."
It is easy to criticize Ms. Hermann for playing it safe. A revival of Kenneth MacMillan's "Concerto" and still another staging of Act III of "Raymonda" (this time by Mr. Bujones) hardly qualify as exciting novelties this season.
Yet Ms. Hermann is one of the few company directors who recognize the excitement that a young dancer like Julio Bocca can generate. More important is the originality of Ms. Hermann's long-range thinking.
Above all, she makes a key point that destroys any illusions that Ballet Theater may have had about itself. Because it performs in theaters that are on an opera-house scale and because of the size and international stature of its wide repertory, she said, Ballet Theater is perceived as comparable to European companies like the Royal Ballet or the Paris Opera Ballet.
"But we are not that," Ms. Hermann said. "We are essentially a touring company, and we don't have the financial solidity that European companies have."
Moreover, she stressed, regional companies in the United States -- and the communities that support them -- tend to regard Ballet Theater as a competitive intruder. Ms. Hermann considers it imperative that the company and its board make clear that "we are essential to the American scene as opposed to a company making road visits to other cities."
New York City, she pointed out, welcomes both American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet. "It's that kind of perception on a national level that I hope we can promulgate in the next decade. I don't see Ballet Theater's growth if we constantly have to struggle to find venues where we are welcome."
One solution, Ms. Hermann suggested, is to establish closer relations with community leaders in these cities. But the major innovation she feels is necessary is a touring subsidy that would be added to the budget from the board or the communities visited. "We should not keep picking up bookings as we go," she said, adding, "The nomadic sense is very wearing. There is a difference between touring and being a nomad."
In addition, Ms. Hermann has plans for more touring in Europe and reaching younger audiences. A new "Nutcracker" would recruit children as performers and audience members in various cities. A new "Cinderella" is being discussed but, surprisingly, not to Prokofiev's ballet score. Instead, Ms. Hermann would like to use the music from Rossini's "Cenerentola." Above all, she envisages short programs for children with a revival of "Peter and the Wolf," a staple of the 1940's.
Never a professional dancer, her artistic choices tend, naturally, to be influenced by her experience as a dancegoer and the stars and choreographers she met while producing their companies at the Met. Ms. Fracci, in her view, remains unsurpassed as an actress-dancer. Here again, Ms. Hermann has a finger on the pulse of a public that was fiercely loyal to the Italian ballerina, who had appeared regularly with Ballet Theater before Mr. Baryshnikov took over.
The danger is that Ms. Hermann will turn to only the kind of ballet she knows. Although she has commissioned a new work from the modern-dance choreographer Ulysses Dove, she refuses to consider experimental choreographers unfamiliar with the ballet idiom. ("I can't imagine the New York Philharmonic commissioning a work from someone who never got beyond the key of C on the piano," she said.)
Plunging into the unpredictable during a recession is not Ms. Hermann's style. One could argue that a ballet company that follows public taste does just that -- it follows and does not lead. But a part of every dance-watcher over the age of 30 can also appreciate the value Ms. Hermann places on the glories of the past: "What did we go to see when we were young? Dance used to appeal to everybody."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
For Budget Lodging, Retreats or College Dorms

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
VACATIONERS with a constricted budget may want to consider not only economy motels but also alternative lodging such as religious retreats or college dormitories. Some of these may be Spartan, but for travelers who are game, necessity can be turned into an adventure.
The first set of choices consists of guesthouses, retreat houses and retreat centers maintained by religious organizations. A list of such places in Europe, Australia, Ghana, India, Israel and New Zealand has been compiled and was published in December by James J. and Victoria D. Hughes, a retired Army colonel and his wife. They started out pretty much the way the Zagats started out with their noted restaurant guides: Visiting places and sharing names and addresses with friends. This got out of hand, so in 1988 they began a formidable piece of research, writing to bishops with the goal of publishing a directory. 
 The result, "Travelers' Guide to Overnight or Short Stay at Religious Community Guest and Retreat Houses Around the World, European Edition," is a stapled paperback of 136 pages with 800 entries. It has no pictures, maps or prices, no explicit note of the denomination of the sponsoring group and no indication of the number of rooms available at each place, which may be as few as six. There is also no differentiation between retreat houses, where staff members lead the guests in periods of withdrawal, meditation or prayer, and guesthouses, which welcome travelers who have no religious purpose in mind.
Mr. Hughes said in an interview that the places listed for Rome, Paris, Venice, Florence and Israel were mostly guesthouses. In the next edition, he said, guesthouses would be given an asterisk or other marking.
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes have stayed in a few of these places in Rome, Assisi and London, but readers will quickly be aware that they are not perusing a Mobil guide with ratings and amenities; each large-type entry has two lines: city, name of religious house, phone number, address and postal code. Information on rates, sharing of bathrooms and what meals are served must be obtained from the place itself.
The authors warn that places fill up early and that reservations should be made promptly. They give only an idea of the cost: "In Rome in 1987, we paid $44 for bed and breakfast," they say in the introduction. As dated as this seems, it cannot be faulted too much because even annual bed-and-breakfast guides are vulnerable to rapidly shifting prices.
Whatever its deficits, the book is the first of its kind I have seen and, for people who want to stay overseas in a priory, abbey, foyer or similar place, this provides an invaluable start to the research. The book, costing $17.95 postage paid, is available from Hugen Press, Post Office Box 2286, Bloomfield, N.J. 07003.
A more detailed guide, to places in the United States, is "A Guide to Monastic Guest Houses" by J. Robert Beagle. This book, published in 1989 on the model of the dozens of bed-and-breakfast guides, covers 129 guesthouses, mostly Roman Catholic and Episcopal. Sketches, descriptions, prices and directions are included. Rates are given; sometimes the houses seek "free will donations" or gifts "as the spirit moves." Where a dollar amount is specified, it is low. The Immaculate Heart Hermitage in Big Sur, Calif., for example, asks $25 a person a day for room and meals. The nine rooms are singles with toilets and basins; showers are shared. St. Joseph's Episcopal Retreat House in Mount Sinai, N.Y., with 10 single rooms, one double and one quadruple room, all sharing baths, charges $30 to $40 a person a day.
The paperback guide, 132 pages, is issued by Morehouse, 78 Danbury Road, Wilton, Conn. 06897. It is available at bookstores for $11.95.
Religious Retreats
Travelers who are not looking just for a place to stay, but want to make a religious retreat in the United States or Canada, either privately or in a group, can get information on 600 sites from "Catholic America; Self-Renewal Centers and Retreats" by Patricia Christian-Meyer ($13.95, John Muir Publications, distributed W. W. Norton). The author includes several chapters on retreats and theology, but the bulk of the book is a state-by-state directory, with photographs and descriptions provided by the religious centers themselves. Families should know that under information on who may join a retreat, an entry frequently says "everyone except youths and families." This book is also at bookstores.
A list of Christian religious organizations in Israel that provide board and meals for under $30 a night a person is maintained by the Israel Government Tourist Office; it gives somewhat more information than the Hughes book. For example, in Jerusalem, St. Andrew's Hospice has 14 rooms and the Sisters of Zion Convent has 13. The free list is available from Israel tourist offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami, New York, Toronto and Atlanta.
Dormitories
Dormitories provide another cost-cutting expedient. The negative side is that staying in a college dorm usually means eating in a cafeteria and using a bathroom down the hall. But in contrast with the religious houses, dorms usually permit children. And some colleges have apartments for rent.
In Canada, a university association has organized to provide a free listing of the 50-odd colleges that have rooms to let either in vacation time or year round. Generally, the schools seek to attract conferences, but the leaflet "University Conference Facilities" is also aimed at family travelers. The chart shows such details as if a swimming pool is avilable, if parking is free and the number of rooms and apartments.
Prices are not given because of the variation in accommodations, but for each school, phone numbers are given for more information and fax numbers for reservations. The prices are modest. St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, for example, offers bed and breakfast -- all you can eat, they say -- from May to August. An adult in a single room would pay $24 a night, including taxes, in American dollars; a twin room would cost $37.50 a night and four people could rent an apartment for $77 a night. Linen and towels are included.
The Atlantic Provinces create a separate brochure, "Vacationing on a Budget," which gives prices and a few descriptive details on the 15 campuses in New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.
To receive this free brochure and the chart listing all Canadian campuses with space to rent, write to Jean Voisey, Canadian University and College Conference Officers Association, Room 311, Hatcher House, Memorial University, St. John's, Newfoundland A1C 5S7.
One way to find United States universities that rent dormitory rooms is to order a $13 directory called "U.S. and Worldwide Travel Accommodations Guide." This 76-page, large-format stapled paperback has been appearing for 10 years, so information is more complete than the Hugheses' book, but it is also a work in progress. John and Mary Jensen, former teachers, began it as a list for people on sabbatical, and have been expanding it since. In cases where they have arrangements with university groups overseas, notably with a technical college consortium in England, they simply pick up the charts that the groups use, complete with symbols, and the data may not match the format in the rest of the book.
A prime entry for the United States is the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., which provides quick access to Manhattan with dormitory rentals starting at $15 a person a night on the basis of two in a room.
The per person per night price given on the cover is $12 to $24 but with fluctuations in the value of the dollar the overseas prices may exceed this limit. One worthwhile caveat is for the Canadian entries, which are given in United States dollars but do not add in or mention a new 7 percent federal tax.
The book is available for $13 by mail from Campus Travel Service, Box 8355, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660; 714-720-3729. For first-class postage add $1.50.

HEADLINE: Way Cleared for Long-Delayed Housing

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
BY resolving several lingering disputes with community activists, some dating back more than a decade, the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins has cleared the way for the construction of nearly 4,000 new or renovated apartments and town houses in New York City.
Emerging from the details of those projects are the broad outlines of the Mayor's policies for housing production. The pivotal change is the expansion of low- and moderate-income housing sought by community and nonprofit groups and less reliance on the sale of city land for market-rate developments to finance the lower-cost projects. 
 At the same time, however, the recession and weak real estate market are taking their toll on programs, cutting the city's construction funds and stalling three other proposals for about 3,000 dwellings.
The city's budget for construction has dropped steadily from the peak of $738 million and 26,352 dwellings started in 1989, during Mayor Edward I. Koch's re-election campaign and when the economy was flush. For the year starting July 1, the city plans to spend $480 million for 14,635 units, and even that may be subject to cutbacks.
The new agreements will allow building or rehabilitating 1,711 dwellings in the South Bronx and west of Central Park and bordering the East Village in Manhattan. Officials hope to announce settlement soon on the fourth pending project, in Central Harlem, involving 2,200 new and rehabilitated apartments.
Taken together, the city's actions signal both the content and style of housing programs under the new administration, according to present and former officials and experts outside government.
The policy's cornerstone is the bolstering of low- and moderate-income housing to retain a neighborhood's mix of residents by income levels -- an economic version of "the gorgeous mosaic" the Mayor invokes to describe New York's ethnic and racial diversity.
Other essential features are the fostering of homeownership and tenant management, consulting with community groups, revising proposals to win local support and involving the groups in operating the housing.
"It's a change in policy and a change in attitude," said Felice L. Michetti, Mr. Dinkins's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, who was deputy commissioner under Mayor Koch.
The prior administration's approach promoted middle- and upper-income housing in neighborhoods where the booming private real estate market of the 1980's sustained gentrification. The city used some of the proceeds to help finance housing for lower-income residents.
Commissioner Michetti's efforts have drawn generally favorable reviews.
"If Koch's priority was based on the market, now the priority is to meet the needs of those who need housing the most," said Harold DeRienzo, chief executive of Consumer-Farmer Foundation, a nonprofit housing and community development agency.
"I think the city's is doing all it can to maintain a commitment to affordable housing," he said.
The last Housing Commissioner, Abraham Biderman, had kind words for Ms. Michetti and contended that the current policies were similar to his. He said his administration had worked on the projects now coming to fruition and had also emphasized housing for varied incomes.
Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger disputed Mr. Biderman's assessment.
UNDER Mayor Koch, she said, the controversial proposals "sat there and really did not move" and lower-income housing "was not the focus."
When Mr. Dinkins appointed Ms. Michetti a year ago, she decided at the outset to confront the backlog of projects bogged down by tenant and community opposition. Despite being an 18-year veteran of city government, she said she approached the disputes afresh, ready to discard or amend city positions. In dealing with neighborhood groups, she adopted Mr. Dinkins's techniques of conciliation and consensus.
"I said to the staff: 'There are several outstanding struggles here that I would like to approach with an open mind, not carrying any baggage or policies of the past,' " Ms. Michetti recalled. "I said: 'Let's begin a dialogue in good faith and see where it takes us. Start over and give it a chance.' "
That approach apparently paid off with agreement on new housing projects near St. Mary's Park in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, in Strycker's Bay on the Upper West Side, Cooper Square in lower Manhattan and Bradhurst Avenue in Central Harlem.
Ground was broken in February for 540 new homes on vacant lots for a Nehemiah project near St. Mary's Park. The sponsor is the South Bronx Churches, a coalition of 40 Protestant, Catholic and Muslim congregations modeled on the Nehemiah program in Brooklyn, which builds town houses that working-class people can afford to own. The Bronx group had fought bitterly with the Koch administration over another South Bronx site, where the city insisted on higher-density housing.
Two breakthroughs occurred in the agreement with the Dinkins administration. With half the development slated for triplexes, it is Nehemiah's first deviation from its theme of one-family homes, although each unit will be owned by its occupant.
And the project marks Nehemiah's first expansion outside of Brooklyn.
"Basically it was a compromise to address the issue of density raised by the city while preserving our principle of homeownership," said the Rev. Bertram G. Bennett Jr., a leader of the church group. I. D. Robbins, the developer and civic activist who conceived Nehemiah, often assails public officials and denounced Mr. Biderman sharply, said of Ms. Michetti that she was not hostile.
The negotiations also produced an increase in city aid. The estimated cost of the homes is $65,000 each. The city provides the land free, plus a subsidy reducing the homebuyer's purchase price to $50,000. The city will recoup its subsidies from future profits on resales.
TO get construction started, churches around the city are establishing a revolving loan fund of $4 million, which will be repaid as the housing units are sold. Trinity Church, on Broadway at Wall Street, and St. James' Episcopal Church, on Madison Avenue at 71st Street, have pledged $1 million each to the fund. The state will offer low-cost mortgages for working families with annual incomes ranging from $18,000 to $56,000.
In Strycker's Bay, agreement has been reached and an announcement is expected soon on the rehabilitation of 181 apartments in 15 walk-up buildings scattered from 87th to 95th Streets between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West.
Fourteen years ago the city took possession of the buildings, intending to demolish them for urban renewal. But residents objected to the plans and formed the United Tenants Association to press for preserving the structures.
From that movement, an organization is being created with tenant and neighborhood representation to own and manage the buildings.
A $9 million city grant will pay for the rehabilitation, which starts this spring. Once the renovations are done, the rents will rise, but the new rates will be capped at $50 a room a month, according to Joan Wallstein, an assistant housing commissioner. That will keep the apartments affordable for low-income residents, though not quite the bargain as the current rents -- some under $100 a month.
IN Cooper Square, after 31 years of a neighborhood battle against urban renewal plans that would have displaced 1,200 families, agreement was announced in December for several sites near the Bowery and Houston Street in Manhattan.
Plans call for building 560 new apartments for $16 million and renovating 430 in 37 buildings for $17 million. The renovated units will be for low- and moderate-income tenants. Of the new apartments, 200 will be rentals and 360 will be owner-occupied cooperatives or condominiums, with a fifth reserved for low-income residents and the rest for residents of middle and moderate income.
The Cooper Square Community Development Committee and Businessmen's Association helped negotiate the agreement, and local residents will help oversee the project and select tenants and owners. The project will include a community center.
In the Bradhurst Avenue project, the largest in the group -- exceeding the three others combined -- the city is negotiating with the Consortium for Central Harlem, representing churches and economic development organizations. Officials indicated that while details remain to be worked out, there appear to be no conceptual stumbling blocks.
The tentative plan is for 2,200 apartments at sites scattered from 139th to 155th Streets, between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Edgecombe and Bradhurst Avenues, in Manhattan. The project would include both renovations and new construction, with rentals as well as owner-occupied dwellings for a range of incomes.
Commissioner Michetti has her eyes on the next thorny project to resolve: "Another test will be Clinton. Many of these same issues are embedded in that site as well."
Clinton covers Manhattan's Theater District and neighborhoods to the west. For years, city officials and local groups have debated the fate of urban renewal sites there, especially regarding housing, business relocation and the theater and dance industries. Now the community board, its powers enhanced by the revised City Charter, is forging its own plan.
Funds are in place for Bronx Nehemiah, Strycker's Bay and Cooper Square, Ms. Michetti said, and she is trying to keep Bradhurst's budget intact.
Financing problems stalled the West Queens project in Long Island City sponsored by the Real Estate Board of New York. In its place, a new plan is being developed by the city with Queens Borough President Claire Shulman and the New York Partnership, Ms. Michetti said.
Policy changes and the economy felled two Manhattan proposals: the Milstein project near 10th Avenue and 44th Steet and the Seward Park project, also called Bridgepoint, near the Williamsburg Bridge.
The market no longer supports the rising values those proposals were based on, Ms. Michetti said. Further, they did not meet Mayor Dinkins's standards for incorporating the views of local groups and providing sufficient low- and moderate-income housing. The commissioner said she wants to work with local groups to devise new plans for the sites.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 28, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 14 about New York City's housing plans rendered information on rents at the Strycker's Bay project incompletely. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development had said that rents would be limited to $50 a room during renovations. But in two years, when a local nonprofit organization takes over, rents will rise to about $90. Further increases will come under rent-stabilization rules.

HEADLINE: The Unfinished Politician

BYLINE: By Robin Toner Robin Toner, national political correspondent of The New York Times, profiled Dianne Feinstein for this magazine last fall.

 BODY:
SENATOR BOB KERREY WAS DRIVING THROUGH THE flat fields of northern Nebraska, a somber landscape in midwinter: white sky, white fields, a few brown stands of trees. The land was quiet, frozen, and farmers had time for a town meeting with their Senator, time to gripe about the price of soybeans and the inequities of the new Federal farm program.
But it was the trouble in the Persian Gulf that was uppermost on their minds. It was a few days before Congress was to vote on the resolution authorizing President Bush to go to war with Iraq, and many Nebraskans were inclined to support him. But Senator Kerrey did not. 
 Everywhere he went, the 47-year-old Democrat talked about the cost of war. Everywhere he went, he talked about the reality of war, a very simple reality, he said, for all the wizardry of high technology. "In the end, you've got to take ground, and you've got to hold ground, and you've got to kill," he said. Saddam Hussein could be contained with something short of a full-scale offensive, Kerrey argued. The price of such an offensive, he said, was simply too high.
Kerrey's audiences listened respectfully, although many in this conservative state clearly disagreed. Still, this was not just another liberal Democrat cautioning against the use of force; this was one of their own, a Lincoln boy who went off to Vietnam 22 years ago and came home with a Medal of Honor and an artificial leg. In these meetings, Kerrey did not talk much about his own experiences. He did not have to. The memory of Vietnam was everywhere, an old ache aroused by the prospect of a new war.
Two months later, Bob Kerrey struggled with that memory once again -- this time pondering how it might have led him astray. The war in the Persian Gulf was over, a popular success, and Congressional Democrats, most of whom voted against the war authorization, were grimly hunkered down. But Kerrey was wrestling, aloud, on the Senate floor and in political speeches around the country, with what had happened: where he had gone wrong and where he had not. He continued to stand behind his vote against the war, but he talked about his "voyage" of recent months, about what he had learned of "the fallibility of my own nature."
"My own war experiences affected me throughout, and I say, as I have said to Nebraskans, not always in a constructive fashion," he said last month in a speech in Oklahoma City. "The political lies of Vietnam, and their tragic impact, have put me on constant alert for a battle cry that is tainted with insincerity or evasiveness."
It was a characteristic speech -- emotional, introspective, at times maddeningly inexact and naive, willing to concede error and far removed from the cool policy debate that is the norm in Washington. It was the speech of an unfinished politician, still in the middle of a personal odyssey that began in Vietnam, an odyssey of significance to a party and a generation.
Shaped by a devastating wound and a failed war, Bob Kerrey is a complicated, intense, often troubled politician who has become one of the most distinctive voices in the Democratic Party. He stands at the fault line of the 1960's: a decorated Vietnam veteran who later opposed the war but was wary of the antiwar movement because "it felt anti-veteran to me."
Emblematic of the conflicted political attitudes of the baby boomers, Kerrey was suspicious and sometimes contemptuous of politics for much of his life, then jumped in at the age of 39 to run for office for the first time. The job was governor and he won it. He still cultivates an outsider's air; some Democrats think of him as the "un-politician."
He lapses from time to time into moments of "cosmic Bob," putting aside the details of health care, education and foreign policy to talk of God, altruism and the need for spirituality in American politics. Some Democrats worry that they have produced another Jerry Brown, another mystic, when what they need are street-smart pols. The flattering way to describe him is inner-directed. But between the lines, one can almost hear the plaintive question from the political veterans, bred on straight-ahead, eyes-on-the-prize Humphreys and Mondales: What's wrong with this generation, anyhow?
Kerrey bears many telltale signs of a man with Presidential ambitions -- a national speaking schedule, a top aide out of the Gary Hart campaigns (Bill Shore) and a practiced line that disavows current interest in the White House while refusing to rule anything out. But when a reporter suggests he is playing out the string on this game and enjoying it, he turns petulant. "You're looking cynically at me," he snaps. "I'm not asking you to put me on any bloody short list, and it doesn't bother me if you take me off it."
Friends worry that he is being pushed too fast. Critics portray him as a lightweight with gushy press notices, a compelling life story and few real political accomplishments. Republicans dismiss him as the latest incarnation of the Democratic Party's ultraliberal, pacifist wing.
Clayton K. Yeutter, the new Republican Party chairman, scoffs at Kerrey's "negative and depressed viewpoints," while Roger Stone, a Republican strategist, says, "His war record provides some immunity, but he still fits into the Mondale/McGovern wing of the party when it comes to foreign policy."
As the spotlight settles on him, Kerrey whipsaws between angst and attitude. Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, sums up the tension this way: "The question on Kerrey is, there's a fine line between being unconventional and being unpresidential."

THE GENERATION that fought in World War II came home to a foreign policy consensus -- the virtues of containment, a muscular United States presence around the world to stem the onslaught of communism and prevent another world war. But those who fought in Vietnam, and those who fought against the war in Vietnam, and those in between never resolved what it meant for American foreign policy.
"The Vietnam War never ended," says Todd Gitlin, a sociologist at the University of California at Berkeley and former president of Students for a Democratic Society. "It simply stopped. And the country was left to thrash around without ever coming to a consensus on why we got involved in the war in the first place, and why we lost it, and with what consequences."
This unfinished business hung heavily over the gulf debates. A few days before the vote, Kerrey reflected, "I think it's going to be very difficult over the next 20 years or so to come to that conclusion: the conclusion of when do you die? When do you put it on the line? When do you use force?"
Many Democrats faulted George Bush for viewing the Persian Gulf crisis through the prism of World War II, the war of his youth, for drawing easy analogies to Hitler and Chamberlain in a kind of geopolitical transference. Kerrey, however, all but acknowledges that he is sometimes a prisoner of his own war.
"I believe that if we launch a military offensive, we will sustain thousands of casualties without military necessity, moral justification or public endorsement," he said in written testimony submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee last November. He worried that the war would "reopen social divisions we have only recently healed."
Throughout the late summer and fall, he attacked the Administration for not outlining a worthy rationale for the war and not confessing the policy errors that led to it. In January, he joined 44 other Senate Democrats in voting against the war resolution, urging that sanctions be given more time to work. The resolution passed by a vote of 52 to 47.
After the war, Kerrey took to the floor of the Senate for a characteristically candid post-mortem. "I have had the experience of having Government mislead me, of not leveling entirely," he said. "I have had the experience of just being in a war and then discovering you get halfway into it and Americans stop supporting it. It influenced my judgment on what we should do, perhaps too much."
Even before the war in the gulf, Kerrey admitted that his thinking on America's role in the world had begun to change. As a result of Vietnam, he said, he'd been skeptical about the doctrine of containment, until the emergence of Eastern Europe and the testimony of such dissidents as Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa about the importance of America's cold war stance. "My own experience had caused me to skeptically conclude something that was wrong," he said. "It was worth doing, and perhaps it was worth pressing it even further than we did."
In an interview after the cease-fire in the gulf, Kerrey said he would continue to stand behind what he called, with a slight smile, "the mother of all votes." He said he still believed that sanctions would have worked, but noted that, like other Democrats after the vote, he immediately rallied round the President and his policy. In a series of speeches after the war, he hailed the efforts of the troops and of General H. Norman Schwarzkopf and praised President Bush for articulating a moral crusade that roused the American people.
It is critical, Kerrey said, that this moral framework not be overlooked and that America keep pushing for the cause of individual freedom in Iraq and Kuwait. "If all we do after this war is over is take advantage of construction contracts, cheap oil and new buyers of military hardware," he said in a recent speech, "the sweet taste of victory could become as bitter as the defeat in Vietnam."
The suspicion of the Vietnam vet remains, along with an unflinching sense of the reality of war. "I remember sitting in that Philadelphia Naval Hospital," he says, "listening to the politicians saying, 'We know what war is all about,' and thinking, 'You bastards haven't got any idea.' "
KERREY ENLISTED IN October 1966. He was 23 years old, one of seven children of a building contractor and a teacher (both now deceased), and a recent graduate of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, with a degree in pharmacy. He was about to be drafted into the Army; instead, he joined the Navy and entered officer candidate school. When he earned his commission a year later, he volunteered for the Seals (the acronym stands for sea, air and land, meaning its members operate in all three) -- the Navy's commando team. "Mostly it was just duty," Kerrey says with a shrug. "I was an American. We had a war."
An old friend from the Seals, Gary Parrott, recalls: "We didn't go out there just to fight the enemy. We went out to capture important people and damage their war-making capability."
Lieutenant (j.g.) Kerrey was a Seal team leader. In January 1969 his seven-man team was sent to Vietnam. On the moonless night of March 14, Kerrey's unit set out to capture a group of Vietcong intelligence officers operating on a small island off the coast of Nha Trang. A defector had informed the Americans of the Vietcong's location, on a ledge beneath a 350-foot cliff. Kerrey and his team, intending to surprise them from above, had designed an operation to scale the cliff.
The Americans split into two teams, one to engage the Vietcong from the front while Kerrey and the other group came down from the top. They were near the end of their descent when the Vietcong began firing. A grenade exploded at Kerrey's feet. "All I knew was it was loud and it hurt like hell," he says.
His citation for the Congressional Medal of Honor declares: "Although bleeding profusely and suffering great pain, he displayed outstanding courage and presence of mind in immediately directing his element's fire into the heart of the enemy camp. Utilizing his radioman, Lieutenant Kerrey called in the second element's fire support, which caught the confused Vietcong in a devastating crossfire.
"After successfully suppressing the enemy's fire, and although immobilized by his multiple wounds, he continued to maintain calm, superlative control as he ordered his team to secure and defend an extraction site. Lieutenant Kerrey resolutely directed his men, despite his near-unconscious state, until he was eventually evacuated by helicopter. The havoc brought to the enemy by this very successful mission cannot be overestimated."
Kerrey had been in Vietnam for three months. He would spend the next nine months in a hospital, along with a lot of other young men trying to cope with lost limbs, burned bodies and pain. As Kerrey's roommate at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital, Jim Crotty, says, "It was, very simply, another war."
 KERREY ARRIVED IN Philadelphia shortly after his injury, and the doctors immediately scheduled surgery. When he woke up, he asked his mother how much of his leg was left. They had managed to save the knee.
The hospital specialized in amputees, and each morning, Crotty recalls, the orthopedic surgeons conducted "stump rounds," examining wounds and changing dressings. "You could tell how close they were to your room by the screams you heard," says Crotty. "And one thing I remember about Bob is, I never heard him utter a sound. He just had a real good capacity for pain."
Kerrey describes the hospital as a defining experience. "It's awfully difficult to be arrogant when they're sticking a bedpan under your butt. I learned what it's like to be dependent. Learned what it's like to suffer. Learned what it's like to feel compassion for someone who's suffering even more. Learned what it's like to feel alone and different."
In the hospital, he says, his doubts and anger about the war began to grow. "I was strongly of the opinion that Vietnamization would not work, that all we were doing was stalling for time and that we were going to negotiate away every damn thing we said we wouldn't negotiate away, that all we were trying to do was protect the politicians for a little while until they could get re-elected.
"And that's exactly what we did. And another 20,000 guys died."
He went home to Nebraska in December 1969 -- angry, bitter and still in a lot of physical pain. He worked with the liberal activist Allard Lowenstein in a voter registration drive and spoke out against the war, "but I didn't feel any strong kinship with the antiwar movement." Years later, he saw a taped interview he had done in 1973 with Jim Lehrer. "They asked me, are you bitter? And I said, 'NO!' And Jesus, you see the thing and you'd say, 'Here's a guy who's the definition of bitterness.' "
He went back to school, then into business with his brother-in-law, eventually building chains of restaurants and health clubs in Nebraska. He had several operations on his leg during the 1970's that enabled him to walk with only a slight limp and eventually even to run five miles a day. He married a woman from Nebraska, Beverly Defnall, and had a son and a daughter (Benjamin, now 16, and Lindsey, 14), but the marriage ended after four years. Kerrey had been only minimally involved in politics and had never run for office when he decided to seek the governorship in 1982. A combination of the ailing farm economy and his own fresh appeal helped him oust Republican Charles Thone.
"I believed I would be good at it and I would enjoy it, and finally I just said, 'I'm going to try,' " Kerrey says. "I'd had a lot of involvement with government, and I'd seen it do stupid things."
 IT WAS LATE, AND OMAHA was a good 40 miles away. Bob Kerrey had already done a half-dozen events that January day, the last being a long meeting in the small town of Tekamah, where he'd responded to anxious questions about the Persian Gulf. The small traveling party of aides and reporters was ready for Omaha and bed. Kerrey, however, had other ideas: Everybody was going to Ronnie's, a Tekamah bar. The patrons looked up approvingly as their Senator walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday night and ordered a beer. It is the kind of surprise Nebraskans have come to expect. It is part of the mystique.
Kerrey appears ideally suited for an era of personality politics. There is, of course, Bob Kerrey, war hero. There is also Bob Kerrey, regular guy, whooping it up with a couple of beefy ranchers about a mutual acquaintance, a trapper renowned for his drinking ability and earthy habits. There is Bob Kerrey, celebrity bachelor, who has an off-again, on-again relationship with the actress Debra Winger; they met in 1983 in Lincoln, where she was filming "Terms of Endearment" and he was in the Governor's mansion. Even Bob Dole, the unimpressable Senate minority leader, looked slightly dazzled when Kerrey showed up at the Capitol one weekend during the budget crisis with Winger in tow. People magazine could not have done a better job inventing Bob Kerrey.
David K. Karnes, the former Senator who was defeated by Kerrey in 1988, contends that all the glitter has an impact. "I was never able to transcend the charisma and get to the issues," he says. Karnes remembers one campaign event when "somebody came up and asked me about soybean marketing loans; then they turned to Bob and asked about Willie Nelson and Debra Winger."
Kent Grisham, the former communciations director of the Nebraska Republican Party, adds: "He has star quality. I don't think he has leadership qualities. I don't think he has statesmanlike qualities, but unfortunately star quality can get you elected."
"Charisma" is a word devalued by overuse, endlessly invoked by a generation of journalists and consultants seeking the Kennedy myth of their youth. But Kerrey does have the ability, in person and on screen, to connect.
The looks help. Kerrey has a boyish face saved from weatherman prettiness by his eyes, which are the eyes of a man who spent nine months in a hospital. He is much hotter emotionally than most of his fellow politicians, who have been taught to downsize their gestures and cool their tones for the television era, only to find a generation of voters turned off by standardized, sound-alike pols.
"I remember seeing the first cuts of the TV ads in his first campaign, and they leapt off the screen," says John J. Cavanaugh, a former Democratic Representative from Omaha. "I said, geez, can we tone this guy down?"
Kerrey always has an edge -- sometimes ironic detachment, sometimes a barely cloaked streak of up-yours:
Reporter: "You've been the subject of a lot of speculation about running for the Presidency. Do you want it and do you think you're ready for it?"
Kerrey: "I don't want it and I don't know if I'm ready for it. If I wanted it, I'd worry about being ready."
Reporter: "So you'd rule out a run in '92?"
Kerrey: "I don't absolutely rule out a run in '92, but something's going to have to happen to make me want to be President. And it hasn't happened yet."
Reporter: "Why wouldn't you want to be President?"
Kerrey: "Gee, I don't know. Let somebody else figure that out. That's what you guys do for a living. Analyze."
Reporter: "No, that's what therapists do for a living."
Kerrey: "That's right. [Laughing, lowering his voice] 'Maybe it's because he gets too angry.' "
Kerrey and his handlers have a sure sense of how to package his persona. His 1988 campaign commercials had the aura of Midwestern myth: Kerrey in fields, Kerrey on a farm with a huge extended family, Kerrey talking dead into the camera about losing his leg and witnessing the birth of his children -- all under the tag line, "Nebraska at Its Best."
The Republican Party's Grisham argues, with considerable frustration, that Kerrey "represents a much more liberal, left-of-center group of people than Nebraskans tend to be." But according to an Omaha World-Herald poll, Kerrey's approval rating in the state has generally stayed above 70 percent and Nebraskans dote on his national image. Almost everywhere he goes in the state, people ask if he will run for President.
Kerrey's detractors say his personal magnetism has masked an unimpressive record in both offices he's held. He was Governor during the height of the farm crisis, but a Governor can usually do little more on farm issues than rail at Federal policies. Kerrey takes credit for balancing a strained budget without a permanent tax increase. But even he acknowledges that he "made a lot of mistakes" in his handling of the state's banking crisis in the mid-80's.
Those mistakes came under renewed scrutiny last year when Kerrey launched an attack on the Bush Administration's own handling of the national savings-and-loan collapse. Republicans noted that Kerrey had kept close ties, including a business partnership, with one of the owners of a Nebraska bank that eventually folded while he was Governor. The Omaha World-Herald reported last year that investigations had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Kerrey, but the issue lingers.
His critics point to something else about Kerrey: an impatience, a restlessness. In 1985, just three years after becoming Governor, he announced that he would not run again, explaining he needed a break from politics, saying it was time to move on. He taught for a while and tended his restaurant business; then in 1988, after the death of incumbent Democratic Senator Edward Zorinsky and the short-term appointment of Karnes, he returned to run for the Senate. "He ran for Governor and inspired the troops to beat an incumbent," says Karnes. "Then three-quarters of the way through, he decided it wasn't what he really wanted to do. I guess the question comes down to, what is his motivation? What drives this guy?"
 KERREY ARRIVED IN Washington in 1989 amid great expectations; right from the start, the Democratic networks were humming about the talented newcomer who might be able to help juice the party, a party shut out of the White House for a decade, a party constantly searching for the angle, the philosophy, the personalities to bring it back. The Democratic Party makes its stars with dizzying speed, and often breaks them just as quickly.
Kerrey sought and won appointments to the Appropriations and Agriculture committees -- good assignments for a Midwestern freshman, though not the kind that win a Senator national visibility. Last year, Kerrey built a fairly liberal voting record, according to the annual ranking by the National Journal: more liberal than 66 percent of his colleagues on economic issues, than 74 percent on social issues and than 75 percent on foreign issues.
He made his mark during one of the most emotional debates of the 101st Congress, over a proposed Constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning. Eventually, most Senate Democrats voted against that amendment, but Kerrey opposed it at a time when few Democrats were willing to get out front and polls showed overwhelming support for the measure. The Democratic leadership was delighted to see the charge led by a winner of the Medal of Honor.
Kerrey was also a vocal critic of the Administration's Southeast Asia policy. He has argued that the United States should explore the possibility of improving relations with Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia.
Kerrey has tried to tackle health care as well, holding numerous informal hearings on the issue in his home state and producing a draft plan this winter intended to provide universal health care. But as some of the keepers of conventional wisdom in Washington have noticed, he often gives the impression of being in the middle of a vast tutorial on national policy.
"My sense of Kerrey is of a guy who hit .385 in triple-A ball, is proclaimed by all the scouts as the next phenom, comes up to the Major Leagues and so far hasn't really shown that he'll be a star in the World Series," says Norman Ornstein, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think tank.
Yet Kerrey, by virtue of his raw political talent and the wide-open Democratic field, regularly makes the short list of potential Presidential candidates kept by the press and the political professionals. This has caused some jitters among his friends. "I have told him, be careful," says J. James Exon, Nebraska's senior Democratic Senator and something of a mentor to Kerrey. "The press loves to build people up for these offices, and then once they build them up to a pinnacle, they love to tear them down."
Another senior Democrat, a declared fan of Kerrey's who insisted on not being identified, adds: "I'm sure he's getting a lot of pressure to do it, but I don't think he's getting that much pressure from his real friends. What little opportunity he's had to prepare to run for the Presidency would make him fall, and if you fall hard, it's hard to come back."
Already there are hints of downward reappraisal. "I'm a little worried that he could turn out to be a kind of recycled Jerry Brown," says one Democratic consultant who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Other Democrats privately worry about a gravitas problem. To which a somewhat exasperated Kerrey replies, "I'm not going to sit here and list the things that cause me to believe I've got gravitas."
Kerrey's strong position against the gulf war would almost certainly be used against him in any Presidential campaign. But only to a point, his allies suggest; his war record provides a certain protective cover.
Those close to Kerrey take him at his word on 1992: that he has no plans or even desire to seek the Presidency but reserves the right to change his mind. Yet there is something about Kerrey that seems incompatible with modern Presidential campaigning -- sitting in the front of an airplane day after day, watched by 50 reporters waiting for a gaffe; serving up a message of the day with relentless discipline. No more impromptu stops at Tekamah bars. No freedom to change his mind on major policy questions -- or think aloud, as Kerrey is wont to do -- without provoking a furor. Opening your personal life to unending scrutiny.
He is plainly uncomfortable with questions about Winger, whom he began seeing again last year after a long hiatus, during which she married the actor Timothy Hutton, had a son and was divorced. One day several months ago, Kerrey winced at the sight of a gossip item about his Paris rendezvous with the actress for the opening of her film "The Sheltering Sky."
"The generalization is that your personal life and your political life are always mixed up together," he said later. "And the danger is that you begin to act on the personal side as if you're still a politician. It's hard to shut it off. So you begin to think about your children and loved ones in political ways. I think that's a genuine danger."
At this point, the most intense Democratic fantasy about Kerrey probably revolves around the No. 2 slot. Party officials practically salivate at the idea of watching their Medal of Honor winner in a Vice Presidential debate against Dan Quayle, whose service in the National Guard during the Vietnam War proved so controversial in the 1988 campaign. It is an understandable fantasy for a party that has absorbed such a hammering on the issue of patriotism, that has repeatedly seen its candidates attacked as something less than red-blooded heroes.
"I think you could fund the Democratic National Committee for four years just by selling tickets to Democrats to see Kerrey on a stage with Quayle," says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker and longtime adviser to the Senator.
Kerrey, while claiming no interest in the Vice Presidency, still shows a keen sense of how to use his combat record against the Quayles of the world. When the Vice President was traveling the country pledging, "This will not be another Vietnam," Kerrey asked, "How does he know?" When Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, drew a scathing contrast between Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert One, Jimmy Carter's failed attempt in 1980 to rescue the hostages in Iran, Kerrey fired back, taking note of the fact that Gingrich had the benefit of student and family deferments during Vietnam.
"This avoider of miltiary service gained my permanent enmity," Kerrey said, "debasing the memory of those men who died in that noble, dangerous, heroic and -- yes, in the end -- unsuccessful try to liberate their fellow Americans."
 EACH TIME BOB KERREY runs for office, his old Seal buddies show up; they help him campaign and they help him celebrate. The night Kerrey was sworn in as Governor, Gary Parrott remembers, "he just opened the door to the mansion, let us in and locked it." The night he claimed victory in the Senate race, five of his fellow Seals, who had campaigned across the state for him, were there. On live television, at the end of his victory speech, Kerrey sang a song that he dedicated to them. It was the Australian lament from World War I, "And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda," about a young man who goes to war and comes home without his legs.
For Kerrey, the political pilgrim, the journey begins in Vietnam and always leads back there. It gives his politics an emotional charge, a passion rare in public life. But Kerrey is still learning how to use it, how to harness the energies and ideas that come from his own experiences into a vision of public policy.
Like any good pilgrim, he acknowledges doubts, wrong turns, missteps. It is a refreshing trait in the Senate. In a Presidential campaign, it would not be easily forgiven.
In the days after the cease-fire in the gulf, exuberant pundits all over the country pronounced the Vietnam syndrome dead. Bob Kerrey was reaching for some closure, too. In an interview, he talked about the astonishing effectiveness of the allied military campaign, of the nation's justifiable pride in its troops.
"We started this thing and we finished it," Kerrey said. "We have a powerful military leader in Schwarzkopf, who did exactly what he said he was going to do. We drove them out of Kuwait. We accomplished our objectives, and there's tremendous pride in that."
But Kerrey was raising questions, too. "The larger issue for me is, how are we going to use this power? Are we going to use it for good?"
He rambled on, thoughts and theories spinning round and round, searching, apparently, for his own "new world order."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Soviet Version, Perhaps, of a TV Soap

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
BEWARE of the play that relies on press releases, program notes and imposed staging to convince its audience that it carries an important message. Such a play is Alexander Gelman's "Man With Connections" now at Theater Three in Port Jefferson.
This contemporary Russian play is, we are told in the program, an allegory about keeping the Russian union together. To underline the issues, a large on-stage screen projects recent newspaper headlines like "Perestroika With Tears," "Sounds of Silence: Soviet Shows of Strength vs. Lithuania" and "Get Along or Kill Each Other -- There's No Other Choice." 
 If you were not told that "A Man With Connections" is a play with a message, you might have missed its significance. You might have thought this is a turgid drama about a petty bureaucrat who refuses to take responsibility for his own disastrous decisions.
"A Man With Connections" looks at the deteriorating relationship of Andrei and Natasha Gladkov, whose shaky marriage is on the verge of final collapse over the current family tragedy.
Their son has lost both his hands in a construction accident, and the bullying, authoritarian Andrei was the project foreman who sent his son's crew to work on an unsafe road in violation of safety regulations.
Natasha has just been told the ugly details of the accident by one of Andrei's employees, and she is torn between the wish to throw her husband out of their apartment and the desire to kill him.
If the earnest imposition of current events had been left off stage, "A Man With Connections" would be a ponderous Soviet drama with occasional flashes of intelligent insight into the Russian equivalent to America's skewed Wall Street tycoons.
The play offers glimpses of the way of economic life in Russia, where crippling shortages and inefficiency foster a bizarre method of doing business. Here it truly is not what you know, but who you know, that gets the job done.
Andrei's failures stem from his methods of handling shortages in both his marriage and his construction business. He cannot build in either sector, because he has not established a concrete foundation, literally and figuratively.
There is no trust or mutual support between husband and wife. Andrei's manner of dealing with family problems is crude and manipulative, as are his managerial methods in the office.
"It is a business venture we have," Andrei tells Natasha, "not a family."
And, indeed, life for Andrei and Natasha is a series of semisuccessful negotiations. Shortages of paper, cement, telephones, love and personal fulfillment are all one and the same to them. Andrei knows he is unhappy, but he has no idea what to do about it other than to make sure Natasha does not leave him.
Natasha seems to serve primarily as a sounding board for the incessantly chattering Andrei. Why she stays and what she wants out of her marriage and her life are confused and confusing. Hers is a relationship as hollow as the god of materialism she worships.
Bradlee E. Bing has directed the play to be a portentous political allegory, which only serves to highlight the script's paucity of ideas.
The set was also designed by Mr. Bing. It is a collection of black oblong boxes that the characters move around like chess pieces. Red fabric is stretched across the back wall, and in the center is the large screen showing news headlines.
The two actors, Amelia Chiaramonte as the distressed Natasha and Robert Marr as the beleaguered Andrei, speak in the staccato rhythms of announcers reading news bulletins.
Some of the leaden quality of "A Man With Connections" may be owing to Stephen Mulrine's translation. Some of the play's pretentiousness may come from the production's heavy-handed imposition of topical relevance.
But most of the problems in "A Man With Connections" grow out of the playwright's old-fashioned tale of petty bureaucrats trapped on a treadmill of corruption and self-aggrandizement.
The play is at Theater Three Second Stage through May 1.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
The Italian Style Is Now Family Style

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
FAMILY-STYLE dining is the latest trend in Italian restaurants. Serving family style is as old as grandma's kitchen, but transporting this overflowing abundance to restaurant meals is the hot new ticket.
A few restaurants predate this 1990's craze. They are found mainly in old Italian neighborhoods in the five boroughs and on Long Island at La Parma in Williston Park and La Parma II in Huntington. But since last winter, when Coco Pazzo opened on Manhattan's Upper East Side to rave reviews, family style has rocketed in popularity. 
 On Long Island, even the ubiquitous pasta cafes are being given a run for their money by the new family-style restaurants. One of the trendy newcomers is 2-month-old Piccola Bussola in Westbury.
Piccola Bussola has the same owners as La Bussola in Glen Cove, which received a rating of excellent in July of 1987. Diners expecting the serene surroundings and sedate service of La Bussola will be in for a surprise in Westbury, especially on a no-holds-barred Saturday night.
The scene is a frenetic, although congenial, one of laughing, noisy, large groups, including children, all casually attired and watching waiters hustle with huge platters of food. Our waiter, a transplant from Glen Cove, looked absolutely shellshocked.
Piccola Bussola follows the family-style formula of gargantuan menus on the walls rather than individual ones. Each dish on those menus is designed for two or more to share. Thus, prices that seem a tad high at first glance, $13.75 for chicken scarpariello or $7.50 for a combination salad, are really bargains.
That salad, which is enough for four to share, may take top honors as buy of the year. It is a tri-color beauty bolstered with onions, roasted peppers and, most of all, flavor. The Caesar at $9.50 is also recommended, but takes second prize.
Other great openers are the fried red peppers and onions loaded with garlic; the melt-in-the-mouth stuffed eggplant, which is light on crumbs and heavy on flavor, and the impeccably fresh seafood salad glistening with first-class olive oil and splendid seafood.
Baked clams are a mixed lot. The large ones on the platter are chewy, the tiny ones tender. Stuffed mushrooms are tasty with bacon and scant on filler.
Pastas like linguine marinara and zitti with broccoliat are platter-size Italian classics at $12 to $13. Although done well, they offer little excitement.
The entrees that set our table singing were the chicken scarpariello, moist, juicy and loaded with garlic, and the firm, tasty shrimp oreganata. Striped bass oreganata had the same flavor-packed tastes, but the fish was unevenly cooked. Family members grabbing the thick center pieces were happy. Those left with the overcooked edges were downcast.
Veal did not fare well. Veal chop Bussola, two large chops for $26.75, is covered with red peppers, mushrooms and onions. It had lots of spunk, but was overcooked. Veal piccata, four cutlets for $15.75, was tough.
It is a shame that most diners will be too full for dessert. Baked daily at La Bussola in Glen Cove, these sensational sweets are show stoppers. Lovers of La Bussola's luscious chocolate mousse cake topped with slabs of dark chocolate will find it here. Also top of the line are the creamy tiramisu and the moist cheese cake perfumed with orange peel.
Ordering wine at Piccola Bussola is an adventure. There is no printed list, and waiters know only two possibilities, red and white. Both are Villa Banfi table wines at $9.50 a bottle or $3 a glass.
But diners willing to search through the wine racks will discover that Piccola Bussola inherited an interesting wine cellar from the previous tenants.
Family-style restaurants offer recession-weary Long Islanders a reassuring abundance of food with small price tags in a warm homey atmosphere. And no one is stuck with the cooking or kitchen cleanup.

STEELTOWN, USSR
Soviet Society in the Gorbachev Era.
By Stephen Kotkin.
Illustrated. 269 pp. Berkeley:
University of California Press. $24.95. 
 The Russian city of Magnitogorsk symbolizes the rise and decline of Soviet Communism. It is the subject of "Steeltown, USSR," a firsthand account by a young Princeton historian who, Soviet authorities say, was the first American to visit the city in 45 years.
Magnitogorsk was founded in 1929 just behind the southern tip of the Urals, in the open steppe. By 1939 this "hero-city" of Stalinist industrialization was producing 10 percent of Soviet steel. During World War II it turned out half the steel used to make Soviet tanks.
Among quite a few Americans who helped to build Magnitogorsk was a young expatriate, John Scott, who worked there as a welder from 1933 to 1937 and described his experience in a 1943 book, "Beyond the Urals: An American Worker in Russia's City of Steel." Scott recounted the dark side of daily life -- incredibly primitive living and working conditions, the pall cast by Stalin's purges, the presence of forced laborers alongside enthusiastic volunteers. But he emphasized the belief of many of his co-workers that they were "laying the foundations for a new society farther along the road of human progress than anything in the West; a society which would guarantee its people not only personal freedom but absolute economic security."
Fifty years after Scott left, Stephen Kotkin arrived. He found "entrenched alcoholism, recurrent shortages of consumer goods, a severe housing crisis extending well into the future, a ubiquitous black market, a crumbling or nonexistent urban infrastructure, almost unfathomable pollution, and a health catastrophe impossible to exaggerate."
As for the famous steel plant, Mr. Kotkin describes it as "a wheezing dinosaur." By the late 1980's it was the largest steel complex in the world, producing almost as much steel per year (16 million tons) as all of Great Britain -- but at precisely the time when Britain and the other Western countries were turning away from steel to accommodate the imperatives of the global economy.
Yet the most depressing change Mr. Kotkin found was the loss of hope, a loss brought on by the long years of suffering and sacrifice, and, ironically, deepened in recent years by the impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.
Most of what we know about perestroika and glasnost derives from the experience of huge metropolises like Moscow and Leningrad. Moreover, the little we have heard from the provinces has been contradictory. Some travelers, Soviet as well as Western, portray the Russian hinterland as a stronghold of conservatism. Others report that because smaller cities have experienced less economic decline than has Moscow (in part because they were worse off to begin with), their residents remain more upbeat about reform than jaded Muscovites or Leningraders.
Mr. Kotkin spent four months in Magnitogorsk -- two in 1987, when city authorities still half suspected him of being a spy, and two more in 1989, when virtually all doors were open to him. He talked with steelworkers as well as intellectuals. He accompanied candidates to electoral meetings and wrote for the local paper, with whose staff he became particularly friendly. He prowled the halls of such formerly closed institutions as courts, hospitals and even the central police station.
What Mr. Kotkin learned is that Stalinism still has a social base in Magnitogorsk. It includes the ruling nomenklatura, along with much of the intelligentsia and working class. The establishment has managed to get its own kind chosen in more or less democratic elections. The rest of the population, says Mr. Kotkin, simply goes along.
The dislocations caused by perestroika have only worsened economic conditions in Magnitogorsk, an outcome that has reinforced residents' fear that they have more to lose than to gain from change. In bigger cities a plethora of new political parties and informal groups has arisen to challenge the Communists. In Magnitogorsk only two tiny "informals" have appeared -- one made up of extreme Russian nationalists, the other of orthodox Marxists.
The main force, virtually the only force, for reform in Magnitogorsk has been the local newspaper, The Magnitogorsk Worker. But rather than inspiring people, its brave muckraking has deepened their sense of being hemmed in by troubles they are powerless to affect.
"How much evil has accumulated!" said a middle-aged skilled worker to Mr. Kotkin. "It hurts to think about it. . . . At first there was some hope. We felt we could breathe at last. It was a release. Now I don't know. I'm tired, even though I'm not old. And anyway, how can you live only on faith? We're boxed in."
Part of the glue that holds the old system together is a kind of self-hate on the part of its victims. "They make a son of a bitch out of you," said the same worker. "No one makes a move until we see where the power lies. As soon as it is clear, we all quickly take that side."
This worker summarizes the meaning of Magnitogorsk as follows: "We worked, we toiled, we built. And now they can't figure out what the hell we built! No one knows what to call it: barracks socialism, Stalinism, totalitarianism. You could spend the rest of your life thinking about it, but you'll never come up with the right name. What we built -- it's unnameable."
Mr. Kotkin's message is sobering. Alas, the medium that conveys it is disappointing. In contrast to John Scott's book, which contained gripping narrative sections, Mr. Kotkin's chapters (on the economy, glasnost, elections, etc.) consist of repetitive bits and pieces that never develop any overall momentum. With a few exceptions, such as the just-quoted blue-collar worker, people appear and reappear without our getting a sense of them as individuals. Perhaps this is the result of Mr. Kotkin's training; he seems more comfortable analyzing social aggregates than sketching personal portraits. In any event, it detracts from the impact of what is otherwise a valuable book.

PRIVATE ACTS
By Linda Gray Sexton.
317 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company.
$19.95. 
 Sometimes the world turns too quickly -- or the cogs of publishing turn too slowly -- for contemporary writers. Novels that painstakingly re-create a specific moment in time appear, through no fault of their own, to be set in an alien world when they are finally published. Linda Gray Sexton's fourth novel, "Private Acts," an account of very wealthy people doing not-so-nice things in the New York City of 1986, arrives in 1991 like a relic from some lost, prewar, pre recession civilization.
Like most fiction set in New York, "Private Acts" concerns itself with a particular milieu; here it is "the upper echelons" of Wall Street investment banks. The novel is peopled exclusively by investment bankers, the people who sleep with investment bankers and, in one case, the children of investment bankers (one of the things we learn is that investment bankers have no time for children). These are men and women who consider Scarsdale a sixth borough of the city, who think Stuyvesant Town is the Lower East Side. Their meals in expensive restaurants are frequently interrupted by their beepers or their sex drive, forcing them to abscond with doggie bags filled with sea urchins and lobster. In short, they "can afford to look past the worst" in New York. And they do.
At the center of all these investment bankers is Maggie Whitten, who is not one. She had been the fiction editor of Esquire, but she left that job to move to Scarsdale with her husband, Sy (his bank is First Boston) and raise their children, Kate and Mikey. Maggie and Sy met at Harvard in the early 70's, where they double-dated with Maggie's roommate, Alexis, now of Hewett Lowell, and Sy's best friend, Nicolas, who owns a chain of clothing stores.
When the book begins, over a day of tennis in the Whittens' backyard, everyone is -- or appears to be -- happy: Maggie and Sy, Alexis and Nicolas, and Christa, a colleague of Sy's at First Boston, and Jon, a defense-industry analyst.
As the summer progresses, Sy, who is desperately attempting to become a partner, ignores Maggie and the children; Maggie becomes frustrated at home and longs to return to work; Alexis grows sick of Nicolas, who seems to have lost interest in (or claws for) "hanging on for her ride to the top"; and Jon loses interest in Christa and concentrates on -- and succeeds in -- seducing Alexis, who finds his "smell of . . . power" to be "an aphrodisiac."
Maggie begins her job search with a couple of disheartening interviews, only to abandon it in favor of an affair with Nicolas, who has begun hanging around the house in Sy's absence. They spend their afternoons on a mattress in the attic, and he gives her the orgasms Sy cannot. She becomes "his slave, his thing to do with as he wills, his child," and it's not long before Maggie is enjoying a little bondage and thinking of herself as a "sweetmeat on a pile of laundry." (She was, after all, fiction editor at Esquire, not Ms.)
Meanwhile, the plot spins as Alexis is indulging in insider trading, trying to make partner (a year early) while romancing Jon and coping with endometriosis. Nicolas urges Maggie to leave Sy. And Maggie is torn between her children, her husband, her best friend, her career and her newfound sexuality. No wonder she bolts out of the house into the snow, slamming the door behind her like Ibsen's Nora, to spend "some time to think, by myself, about what I want to do."
Ms. Sexton gets much right in "Private Acts." The suburban domestic scenes are particularly convincing. She is always generous with details, and sets up and plays out scenes with skill. If none of her characters are particularly sympathetic or compelling, there are moments when they all seem human and vulnerable. They are smug, but not hypocritical -- not one even pretends to have a social conscience. Unfortunately, however, there is not a trace of satire here -- all this lusting for power and money is portrayed with vapid sincerity. The (third-person) narrator is characterless, humorless (we are constantly told that people are laughing, lest we not discern the humor) and totally nonjudgmental. Greed, vice, even rape go not only unpunished but unacknowledged.
When the characters are re assembled on the tennis court a year later, it is revealed that Maggie is writing the book we have been reading. This goes a long way toward explaining the murky and incestuous point of view of "Private Acts": it finally becomes a book not only about, but for, investment bankers.

HEADLINE: Trade Restrictions Would Hurt All the Chinese

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis is right when he says that we must remember Wei Jingsheng and press for his release ("The Prisoner," column, March 25). Nor should we forget other political prisoners in Chinese prisons. But Mr. Lewis is wrong, I think, in presuming that removal of China's mostfavored-nation tariff status is a way to secure their freedom. If he does not envision such action as a way to secure their release, but as punishment of China's leaders, he is ignoring other components of Chinese society and of United States-China relations. 
 Mr. Lewis's resolve does not address the situation of the many Chinese intellectuals, educators, writers, artists, as well as people in commerce, who were not imprisoned and who desperately yearn to keep open ties with the West. We must consider whether rescinding most-favored-nation status would push China's leaders toward further cutting their ties with the West and what this would mean for the many in China who no longer support the Government.
After the 1989 massacre, for example, many educational organizations debated whether or not to cease exchanges with China. Some did, some did not. But now almost all these organizations have resumed educational exchanges for many reasons. The main one, I believe, is the sense that there is less hope for change in China if ties with Western democracies, as well as Western technologies and Western wealth, are cut.
Commerce too is a form of educational exchange and a vital component in increasing aspirations toward political, intellectual and economic freedom in China. We should not follow Deng Xiaoping and his comrades, who mistakenly believed they could separate the political and intellectual from the economic sphere. Contact with the West for the last decade has allowed Chinese intellectuals, academics and officials in the central and provincial governments to experience free exchange firsthand.
As long as there is continued intellectual discourse and economic intercourse between the West and China, there is greater hope for those Chinese who remain in China and who want their country to change in a liberal direction.
Since the 1989 massacre, there have been rumors and policy declarations by the Chinese of a desire to control the number and the background of Chinese allowed to study in the United States. One such policy is to give more middle-level government officials a year of study in America for being less "corruptible" and more likely to return. This strategy, however, has a very interesting dimension. Such officials, spending a year in the United States, return to China with strong, warm feelings about America and American systems, as well as enthusiastic ideas about freedom in all areas.
To cut off China's most-favored-nation status will not help Wei Jingsheng and others, but may hurt the delicate, carefully developed relationships between Chinese and Americans that have been growing since China opened its doors to the West and further remove all the Chinese from the possibility of basic human rights.

HEADLINE: Is Recovery in Sight? Don't Look at Payrolls

 BODY:
While many economists see a recovery budding in the next several months, company executives say they will wait until an expansion is in full bloom before they resume hiring.
Managers at dozens of American companies say they intend to meet increased demand with only slight increases in employment, if any. 
 At the Dana Corporation's plant in Fort Wayne, Ind., some of the assembly lines that make components for light trucks are likely to remain silent through most of the year. Since August, the company has laid off 5,000 workers, or 21 percent of its North American labor force.
 
Employment Historically Lags
 "I don't see people coming back for the next several months," said Howard Moore, Dana's vice president of corporate relations. The company's economists expect renewed demand in the fourth quarter, but Mr. Moore said that renewed hiring is only a possibility. "Some people may come back to work,"' he said. "But we expect the upturn will be slow."
Economists say that unemployment usually keeps rising even after the economy has begun expanding. Companies initially extend overtime and improve productivity to raise output.
This recovery in particular might be far kinder to employers than employees, reviving sales and profits but leaving many people jobless.
Many companies are nearly suffocating under huge debts; others are beset by efficient competitors, domestic and foreign. They have become as conservative in their employment as in their inventories, as if extending just-in-time practices to labor.
A few companies -- with hot products, healthy markets or failing competitors -- have continued hiring throughout the downturn. Several airlines, intent on grabbing market share, are expanding despite losses.
But like the wealthy who shun ostentation during tough times, even the more prosperous corporations practice austerity.
 
'The Only Lever'
 The Hewlett-Packard Company, despite recent increases in sales and earnings, has trimmed about 1,000 jobs in each of the last four quarters, leaving 91,000 employees worldwide. Blame competition for the cutbacks, said Tom Pierson, the company's manager of human resource planning.
"High-technology industry is moving to lower cost, higher volume manufacturing," he said. "It was going on to a great degree before the recession set in. Against lower profit margins, the only lever you have is cost."
Companies that hope to resume hiring want to see piles of new orders first. The Inland Steel Company, the nation's fourth-largest producer, has laid off about a tenth of its 11,000 employees. The company offers the idle little hope of returning until customers come back to the showrooms and stores. "We would need a significant increase in consumer durables -- appliances and automobiles in particular -- before we would make any increases," a spokesman said.
Cross & Trecker Inc., a maker of machine tools, cut more than 600 of about 3,600 employees last year even as the industry's orders from aerospace, auto and applicance companies strengthened. Richard Priebe, a spokesman, said the company would call workers back only when manufacturers become far more eager to upgrade their plants.
Several of the nation's largest companies say many of their payroll cuts are permanent. The General Motors Corporation plans to eliminate 15,000 of its 99,000 salaried positions in the next three years. More than 60,000 of the company's 254,000 hourly workers have been temporarily or indefinitely laid off. "We have not added new workers for a number of years, and I don't see us adding any soon," said John Maciarz, a company spokesman.
The International Business Machines Corporation -- 33,000 jobs lighter since 1986 -- plans to trim another 14,000, leaving fewer than 360,000 employees by the end of the year.
Steve Eams, I.B.M.'s spokesman on personnel matters, brags of a 45 percent increase in annual revenue per employee since 1986. He says that cutbacks in the support staff -- secretarial, bookkeeping, "or corporate spokesmen like me" -- will continue.
Few retailers see much need to rebuild their staffs. The industry's borrowing binge compounded the injuries of recession. The Southland Corporation cut its payroll by about 2,500 employees last year, to 45,665. The company, which operates the 7-Eleven stores, has ceded control to a Japanese retailer, Ito-Yokado, in a bankruptcy reorganization.
 
Growth at BankAmerica
 Southland has no immediate plans for further cuts, but its hand is clearly on the cleaver. "In retailing and convenience retailing specifically, business conditions are very, very soft," said Cecilia Stubbs Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman. "Our forecast indicates that softness will continue throughout this year and into the next."
Sears, Roebuck & Company, suffering from the loss of customers to discount chains and the slack economy, went from 500,000 to 460,000 employees last year, with plans to eliminate another 33,000 jobs this year.
Healthier companies say they can stay that way only by staying slim. After dropping 30,000 employees during the 1980's, the BankAmerica Corporation, one of the nation's more successful big banks, grew from 53,000 to 57,000 employees last year.
Most of the growth has come through acquisitions; some because experienced auditors, lawyers and real estate experts looking for jobs were simply too talented to resist. "We take advantage in some cases of the downsizing in other companies," said Robert N. Back, executive vice president, corporate human resources.
Many companies are finding that Government programs -- once a favorite economic remedy -- provide no refuge from recession. In California, aerospace and military employment is off sharply, reflecting both the recession and tighter Pentagon spending despite the gulf war.
The Hughes Aircraft Company, a G.M. subsidiary near Los Angeles, has withstood the recession well enough to keep its employment at 68,000 for the last year. But the company expects to lay off at least 1,200 workers this year, possibly as many as 3,000.
"The single biggest issue is the downturn in defense," said Ted G. Westerman, the vice president of human resources and administration. The Navy cut off Hughes's contract last year for Phoenix missiles, and the Pentagon decided to stop making F-14 fighters, which carry Hughes radar systems. Other projects have been slowed, Mr. Westerman said.
 
Some Airlines Counter Trend
 Many companies that continue to hire hope to profit from others' misfortunes, gaining market share and seasoned employees. The liquidation of Eastern Airlines and the woes of several other carriers have allowed the strongest ones to expand their fleets and buy extra routes and slots. Despite their losses, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines continue to grow.
American has grown from about 78,000 to 85,000 employees in the last year, despite a record $215 million loss in the fourth quarter. Teri Teat, the vice president for personnel resources, expects 90,000 employees by year-end, with experienced pilots and computer programmers readily available. As other airlines cut back, she said, "Their former employees come and knock on our door."
Home Depot Inc., a rapidly growing chain of discount hardware stores that added 3,500 employees, for a total of 22,000, last year, claims that a recession works to its advantage. "We're finding that people would rather do a small plumbing project themselves and save the $75 or $100 it would have cost them to call a plumber," said Barney Fogel, a company spokesman.
Housing sales slow? No problem for Home Depot, said Bernard Marcus, the company's chairman and chief executive. "This is the time people decide to add another room or make an improvement," he said.
The company has no trouble hiring sales help with lists of qualifications as long as the stores' aisles. Mr. Marcus speaks of hiring electricians with decades of experience. "We're looking for someone who's tired of the cyclical nature of new-home starts," he said, "and wants a stable, secure job."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Will a Political Promise Bring Political Demise?

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Like many politicians, Senator Kent Conrad made bold campaign promises when he first ran for the Senate in 1986. Like many politicians, he made promises that have not come true.
But unlike most, the North Dakota Democrat made one promise that he most certainly regrets: that he would not seek re-election if the Federal deficit was not brought under control. 
 What's worse, he left himself no wiggle room. If the Federal deficit and the trade deficit did not drop by 80 percent, he vowed at the time, he would not run again. "I'm either going to get results or get out," Mr. Conrad, who was then State Tax Commissioner, declared. "I believe it is time for politicians to stop posturing and promising, and start guaranteeing performance and results," he said at another stop.
On stump after stump he repeated the promises like mantras, seeking to make the economy the leading issue of his campaign against Senator Mark Andrews, the incumbent Republican.
While Mr. Conrad has more than a year to make good on his pledge, even the most optimistic economists would not dare predict a fiscal turnaround of such miraculous proportions. Since he first ran, not only has the budget deficit not declined, it has risen, to nearly $300 billion from an estimated $221 billion . The trade deficit did drop, but not by 80 percent, to $100 billion in 1990 from $148 billion in 1985.
The 43-year-old Mr. Conrad has not announced whether he will run next year, though his backers say he is inclined to do so, and a Republican has yet to emerge to challenge him.
But already, Mr. Conrad is feeling the heat back home. Questioned Monday by honor students at Grand Forks Central High School, the Senator conceded he is all the wiser after learning the political realities of serving in Congress.
"I made a statement on something I could not, in and of myself, deliver," he said, referring to his promise. "That is, I could not make it happen alone. No one person can make it happen alone."
For now, that is all Mr. Conrad has to say on the subject, about which he is clearly touchy. Wayne Barnett, a spokesman, said the Senator was too busy to talk about broken campaign promises. And no one from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is responsible for electing Democrats to the Senate, had anything to say either.
Mr. Conrad has taken a stab at damage control: To prove that he is doing something about the nation's economic woes, he has assigned a senior aide to be a "fat finder," someone who will identify ways to eliminate waste in Federal spending.
But Mr. Conrad's predicament does elicit smirks from other politicans. Reminded of the Senator's pledge, people at the Republican National Committee could barely contain themselves.
"I'm sure that he must have qualified that in some way," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip. Told that there were no qualifications, he shook his head and said that broken campaign promises was "the kind of thing that haunts us all."
Brian Lunde, a Democratic consultant and a North Dakota native who has been a friend of Mr. Conrad for years, said he was hopeful that the state's voters would be forgiving if the Senator was open about his mistake.
"The flip side is, if he doesn't handle it right, there could be problems," Mr. Lunde said. "His re-election could become a referendum on his promise."
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat, joked that he learned after three terms in the Senate never to make pledges he could not keep.
"The lesson is that the first time you run, you know you have no conscience," said Mr. Chiles, who was back in the Capitol last week for a visit. "And I think you ought to be free to make statements that you can't fulfill."
Surveying his former colleagues as he sipped an iced tea in the senators' dining room, he remarked, "The nice thing about this place is usually you're not handicapped by those promises, you're not bound by them." But he said that he has found things different as a chief executive.
"I've learned," Mr. Chiles said, "to keep my mouth shut."

HEADLINE: Unions Threaten Strike At Freight Rail Lines

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
Leaders of eight railroad unions with more than 150,000 members who have worked without a contract for three years have threatened to cripple the nation's freight lines with a strike on Wednesday.
But the Bush Administration is trying to head off a strike, which it says would severely jolt an already weak economy. 
 Railroad executives want Congress to halt a walkout within hours, which unions said would begin against one or more rail lines at 12:01 A.M. on Wednesday. The Administration is also urging swift action by Congress to settle the dispute.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said lawmakers should order the railroads and the unions to adopt staffing, wage and benefit terms recommended in January by a Presidential panel. Leaders of three other rail unions with about 70,000 members agreed to similar terms in the last few days.
"Any interruption of the nation's rail service would be a disaster for the country," Mr. Skinner said Friday in Los Angeles. "It would affect every American in one way or another."
More than one-third of all goods shipped each month in the United States. or 115 million tons, travel by rail. Many industries, including automobile makers, which rely on timely supplies of parts and materials at assembly plants, could be forced to curtail production in days if rail shipments are cut off.
The Administration estimated that a two-week rail strike would cause 500,000 layoffs in industries relying on rail service. The Ford Motor Company said it would have to close some assembly plants and begin laying off workers within two days of a rail strike. The Chrysler Corporation said widespread plant closings and layoffs would occur three days after a strike began.
Some railroad executives said they expected the unions to initially limit their walkout to a single railroad that is financially weak and thus might seem more likely to accept union contract demands. But a strike against one rail line would soon affect freight shipments across the nation, said Gerald Grinstein, chief executive of Burlington Northern, the largest of the nation's approximately 15 major carriers. "We probably will have to treat a strike against one as a strike against all." he said.
Union leaders want Congress to stay out of the dispute, figuring that an extended strike would inflict heavy losses on the railroads and force them to reduce their demands. The two sides are divided over wages and benefits, but the biggest feud is over the railroads' insistance on cutting jobs and easing work rules.
"The railroads are going to be disappointed if they think Congress will panic" and force a quick settlement, said Fred T. Hardin, president of the United Transportation Union. The largest of the 11 railroad unions with 100,000 members, the transportation union has the majority the workers whose union leaders have not agreed to terms Presidential panel's recommendations.
To inhibit public pressure for a quick settlement, the unions have promised to continue working at rail lines serving commuters and other passengers. Although Conrail is involved in the contract dispute, Amtrak and commuter lines in the New York area and in other parts of the Northeast are expected to run on normal schedules.
A shutdown of the nation's freight lines would force 100,000 of the nation's commuters into other modes of travel, 75,000 of them in the Chicago area, where 45 percent of all commuter travel is by rail, the region's Metra commuter rail system says.
Commuters there are bracing for calamity. Half of Metra's commuter routes pass over freight lines owned by Burlington Northern, Chicago and Northwestern, Southshore and Norfolk Southern. Those companies have said the Metra segments cannot be operated safely if their freight operations are struck.
Chicago hotels could become crowded if a strike lasts through the week. Many commuters said they would book rooms in the city rather than struggle with crowded highways, bus and subway lines.
Amtrak officials said routes that carry half of its 60,000 daily passengers could be disrupted by a strike against the freight lines. But Amtrak owns and operates lines between Washington and Boston, and those routes, which carry 30,000 riders a day, should not be disrupted, said Renee Banks, a spokeswoman in Washington.
As the deadline neared, the National Mediation Board convened a final round of contract talks this weekend in Washington that included the 11 unions and representatives of the industry's bargaining organization, the National Railway Labor Conference. Leaders of three unions were engaged in talks around the clock, but the other five unions were not talking with the company representatives.

HEADLINE: Showdown for Dinkins: A 'Nip and Tuck' Fiscal Drive

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
New York City's slowly unfolding fiscal drama has become a taut and immediate crisis.
In less than three months, Mayor David N. Dinkins must come up with up to $300 million in revenue and savings for the cur rent fiscal year or risk severe damage to the city's reputation and to its ability to borrow money or even the loss of control over its finances to a state oversight body, the Financial Control Board. 
 "It is nip and tuck," said Alan J. Proctor, executive director of the control board. "The crunch is now. Fundamentally, if the city is going to take any actions, it has to do it now. As time goes by, your options diminish."
For months, Dinkins administration officials have talked about slashing the city payroll, laying off workers, winning concessions from municipal unions and convincing Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to help in refinancing bonds to provide quick cash.
 
More Talk Than Action
 But that talk was mostly about its problems in the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1, when the city faces a $3 billion gap in its $29 billion budget. And little of the talk has been transferred into action, fiscal analysts say.
Thousands of layoffs were announced and then averted; negotiations with the unions stalled, and with budget-cutting efforts lagging, the Mayor asked the City Council for a one-month delay in the submitting of his budget, due on Apil 26. The Council offered Mr. Dinkins a 10-day extension.
Now, with the city battered by a worsening economy and plummeting sales-tax revenues, including a $55 million shortfall in sales-tax revenues that turned up last week, a chronic problem has turned into an immediate crisis. In a matter of days, Mayor Dinkins must find solutions to elusive problems, bring together divergent interest groups, make some excruciatingly difficult choices, or face the consequences.
"I wouldn't call it nip and tuck," said Philip R. Michael, the city's Budget Director. "But I would say that there is a real sense of urgency to it. Because of the timing I would say that it is getting somewhat hairy."
The Mayor plans to meet with labor leaders in the next few days to ask them for immediate concessions, including unpaid vacations and the deferral of some wage increases, to help the city cut costs immediately.
And mayoral aides say they have begun urgently pressing Governor Cuomo for a firm commitment to provide some of the $300 million the city needs to close its gap this year. But over the weekend the Governor reiterated his longstanding position that he would help only after the unions make concessions.
Speaking to reporters in Albany last night, the Governor said a delay in the adoption of the state budget, which was due on April 1, made it less and less likely for the state to be able to help the city, making a takeover by the Financial Control Board more likely.
"Our capacity to help the city is reduced every day by this delay," he said. "Every day New York City gets closer to control, and that is something we very much want to avoid."
With so little time remaining in the fiscal year, huge budget-cutting efforts may produce only puny savings. For example, eliminating a $60,000-a-year job on June 1, a month before the end of the fiscal year, would save only $5,000.
"We are entering a very difficult period, to say the least, because it is so late in the year," First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said yesterday. "It should be obvious we are trying to move on all fronts."
All but a few favored agencies like the Police Department have stopped hiring, said budget officials, who are also trying to halt or delay most purchasing and contracting. The officials, who recently attacked a City Council budget proposal, even asked the Council's staff for ideas on how to generate cash quickly, Council aides said.
As Mayor Dinkins struggles to find a quick solution to his immediate financial problems, he is also under pressure to build a consensus behind a broader plan to solve permanently the city's fiscal difficulties, even if the economy continues to worsen.
"I don't think there is a plan in place for '91 and '92," said City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. "There is not a lot of time. Labor and business and elected officials have to find a common ground and move quickly."
Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the teamsters' union, said the unions would not agree to any concessions until there was a comprehensive solution. "Nobody has yet done a plan that brings us from the wasteland to the promised land," he said yesterday.
In both the fiscal crisis of the 1970's and the current one the city was forced to cut spending drastically in an economic recession. But in the earlier crisis the city was shut out of the bond market and could not e find cash to pay its bills. Today, the city, while struggling to cut its budget, is still able to borrow money and meet its obligations.
 
Delay in Aid Payments
 Though the city technically has until the end of June to come up with the $300 million, the pressure to do so immediately is intense. Since Governor Cuomo and state legislative leaders have been unable to agree on a state budget, state aid payments to the city have been delayed, forcing the city to sell about $1 billion in short-term notes to pay its bills in the next few weeks.
The city is scheduled to put out an official offering statement for the notes within the next week or so, detailing, among other things, the city's financial condition, including an outline of its plan to close the $300 million gap.
Even if the city failed to come up with any plan, it would have little problem selling the notes since they are backed with specific state aid payments, not general city revenues, officials said. But the city could face higher interest costs now and greater uncertainty next month, when it is scheduled to sell long-term bonds.
If the city is unable to sell notes or bonds, or if it ends its fiscal year with a deficit of more than $100 million, the state's Financial Control Board, established during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, could assume sweeping powers to approve city spending and contracts.
Mr. Proctor said that even if the deficit appeared to exceed $100 million, the board could not step in until the fiscal year ended on June 30. That is four months before the exact deficit will be known since he city's official accounting report is prepared in October.
While city officials would view a takeover by the control board as a humiliation, bond analysts say the presence of the control board in the governing structure has reassured bond buyers and helped stabilize the market for city bonds.
The $100 million deficit specified in the law is not a cash deficit in the city's bank accounts but is a deficit under the tougher accounting standards the city has been held to since the mid-1970's.
Under these generally accepted accounting principles, which severely limit the city's flexibility at times of crisis, the city counts all bills toward its deficit when they are incurred, not when they are paid.
Mr. Michael said that the city's newly disclosed problems did not appear to jeopardize the city's ability to meet it payrolls.
Warnings about the city's mounting fiscal problems date to the 1989 mayoral campaign and before. In the last year, the Dinkins administration has been repeatedly forced to trim spending and press for tax increases.
In January the administration presented a plan that closed a $500 million gap in the current budget and brought it back into balance.
Since then, projections of increased spending, higher debt service and tax shortfalls have created a new gap of about $450 million, according to preliminary figures compiled Friday. This is being offset by $110 million out of a $150 million reserve fund, and $60 million in surplus funds from the Board of Education, leaving the city with a gap of nearly $300 million, city officials said.
This new problem this year could complicate the city's efforts to close next year's gap. To the extent that the city postpones spending, rather than cutting it, and uses one-time revenues that it had planned to use next year, the problems could be worse.
Mr. Michael said the administration has not been given enough credit for cutting spending. He said that even though the city was able to avoid most of its layoffs, it has begun slowly to reduce its payroll through attrition. He attributed the latest problems to an unfortunate but unforeseen turn in the economy.
But Mr. Proctor and other administration critics say that in recent months the administration did not move ahead fast enough to slash spending, especially since the city committed itself to tens of millions of dollars in new purchases and contracts in March.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier who is chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was set up in the 1970's to sell bonds for the city, said he too was disappointed with the progress of the city. He noted that as the city moved closer to a deadline, the "problems were getting bigger instead of getting smaller."
"There is a real question about whether enough has been done to face up to the reality of the moment, which at the moment is very grim," Mr. Rohatyn said.

HEADLINE: Base Closings Pit Some Republicans Against Bush

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Senator Arlen Specter talked to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney about military base closings on Friday and again on Saturday. And he has an appointment with President Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, to talk about it some more this week.
Mr. Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is working to keep the Philadelphia Naval Station and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard open, is one of a number of Republican lawmakers normally loyal to President Bush who feel they must now fight the Administration. 
 "It looks like the Department of Defense is declaring war on Pennsylvania," Mr. Specter said at a news conference on Friday after learning that his state stands to lose nearly 13,000 military and civilian jobs at the two Philadelphia sites and two other installations.
On Friday, Secretary Cheney formally announced his recommendations on 71 military installations, including plans to close 32 major and 12 minor installations and scale back 28 others by 1997.
 
Republicans Up in Arms
 Unlike last year's base-closing plan, which was rejected out of hand largely because of stiff Democratic opposition, Mr. Cheney's new proposal has stirred up Republicans and Democrats alike.
Senator Specter is not alone among concerned Republicans. Senator Richard G. Lugar traveled home to Indiana to visit Grissom Air Force Base, which is scheduled to close with the loss of 3,200 military and civilian workers. He has sent a letter to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which will review the Pentagon plan, asking it to check for possible errors in the evaluation.
And Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, cited the American success in the Persian Gulf war and has vowed to fight "to maintain Florida's fair share of defense jobs." Florida will lose the Naval Training Center in Orlando, costing the state 17,000 military and civilian jobs.
Such strong opposition to the proposal from Republicans, combined with the scorn of Democrats like Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and John B. Breaux of Louisiana has put Mr. Cheney's plan in a vulnerable position as it goes to the commission for consideration Monday.
The Pentagon proposal has also set the stage for a conflict of politics and principle as lawmakers wrestle with the consequences of their votes that will reduce the Pentagon budget to its lowest share of Federal spending since 1939, down from 27 percent of the Federal budget during the Reagan Administration to 18 percent by 1995.
 
Grim Outlook for Philadelphia
 For Philadelphia, a Pentagon estimate offers even more grim figures than those found in the number of jobs directly affected. When indirect employment associated with the shipyard is factored in, more than 47,000 jobs would be affected by the Philadelphia shutdown, resulting in a 2.1 percent increase in unemployment in the metropolitan area.
"I don't think these installations should be kept open as a matter of local economy," Mr. Specter said in an interview. "The central issue is national defense. I don't think there's any way you can close it and maintain readiness."
Last year Secretary Cheney was criticized for submitting a proposal in which more than 90 percent of the bases targeted for closing would have been in Democratic Congressional districts. The House Armed Services Committee determined that this year 60 percent of the large bases recommended for closing are in Democratic districts and 37 percent were in Republican districts. Democrats hold 267 of the 435 seats in the House. or 61 percent.
Mr. Cheney, appearing today on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," predicted Congress would not reject his plan. "I think the process that we set up last fall when we agreed to a commission, a bipartisan commission, which has now been appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, removes any taint of partisanship," he said. "Nobody can accuse us of having made decisions based on political circumstances."
 
A Safe Seat Now at Risk
 It is an interesting problem for Mr. Cheney, a former Republican member of the House of Representatives who has enjoyed uncommonly good relations with his former colleagues until now. But as the Presidential and Congressional election cycles begin, the base-closing problem is as troublesome for Republicans who had hoped to gain from having supported the use of force in the gulf as for Democrats who opposed using the armed forces.
Partisanship has already intruded. The situation is Pennsylvania is more complicated than most because of the death of Senator John Heinz in an plane crash on April 4 left the state's Republicans looking for a way to hold on to what had been considered a safe seat.
"The message was delivered to the White House that it would be very hard for a Republican candidate to campaign in this state when the largest city just had the President and the Secretary of Defense close down one of its biggest employers," said an aide to one member of the Pennsylvania delegation who would speak only if not identified.
Several of the members of Congress who represent affected districts and states rushed home to blunt the bad news on Friday when the Pentagon released its list. Many more hunkered down in Washington, drafting letters of appeal to the commission.
"We knew we were going to be on the list," said an aide to Representative James H. Saxton, a New Jersey Republican whose district includes Fort Dix. Mr. Cheney has recommended closing Fort Dix except for some National Guard operations. "We never imagined the cut would be that deep," Mr. Saxton said.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said politics should not play a role in the commission's decision. But he pointed out that he was a member of the Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee.

HEADLINE: Chicago's Cultural Life Bucks Downward Trend

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 14

 BODY:
This burly city of big shoulders and grand ambitions is experiencing what few other American cities could imagine in these days of recession and belt-tightening. Its cultural institutions are expanding in size and audience at a time when those in some other cities are trying to stay in business.
In what many consider a coming of age of the arts in Chicago, the burst of activity was set off tonight at the Steppenwolf Theater, whose Broadway production of "The Grapes of Wrath" won the 1990 Tony Award for best play. The company, whose gritty, rough-hewn interpretations have come to characterize a Chicago style of theater, has become a hatchery for talents like John Malkovich and Glenne Headly. It firmly planted itself in Chicago tonight when it opened its new 500-seat theater with the American premiere of Ronald Harwood's "Another Time," with Albert Finney. 
 Just south of the Loop, the city is nearing completion of a new central library, the Harold Washington Library, a neo-classical palace of brick and granite and gargoyles, designed by Thomas Beeby, that with its 760,000 square feet will be the largest public library in the world.
The Museum of Contemporary Art, whose cramped quarters have caused it to exclude major works from touring exhibitions or to forego some exhibitions altogether, is to announce late next month the winner of a worldwide search for an architect to design its new museum overlooking Lake Michigan.
 
'A Center That's Throbbing'
 "Very few cities in the world have had this kind of regeneration in the arts without preparing for the Olympics or a World's Fair," said Anthony Jones, the president of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, which recently bought a new building in the Loop to accommodate a rapidly growing enrollment. "It shows an astonishing amount of confidence in this city. It's still a nuclear city; it's still got a core, a center that's throbbing all the time."
Aside from the major new buildings emerging on the Chicago landscape, cultural institutions from the Lyric Opera to the city's regional theaters are experiencing record growth, according a study released last month by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, whose yearly $5 million contribution to the arts is confined almost exclusively to Chicago.
"The strength of the organizations is they deliver the goods," said Nicholas Rabkin, the senior program officer for the MacArthur Foundation. "There has been growth in the size of the audience, growth in the number of cultural organizations and financial growth in organizations at all levels and sizes and disciplines, which is not to say, however, that arts organizations here are financially secure or can be free spenders."
The expansion, many in the arts here say, is long overdue in a city of this size and importance and reflects a cultural maturing in Chicago.
 
Prosperity Flanked by Recession
 While there is no single reason for the explosion of activity and certainly no single financial source, the city's cultural institutions have had several things going for them.
For one, Chicago has not been devastated by the severe recession on the East and West Coasts and has not been forced to make the painful cuts that many other cities have. For another, Chicago's large number of established and widely known institutions have been able to attract a steady stream of donations from companies and individual patrons to finance growth borne of their enormous popularity.
The Museum of Contemporary Art, for example, raised $37 million from its trustees alone for a new 125,000-square-foot home before even naming an architect.
The museum typifies the growing pains of many of Chicago's cultural institutions. While its attendance has increased 42 percent over the last two years, to 144,138 from 102,149, it operates out of a 33,000-square-foot building that is so crowded the museum has never been able to show its permanent collection adequately. And, as often happens, during a recent touring exhibition of Japanese sculpture, the museum had to eliminate some large wooden and stone pieces that could not get through its doors.
All of this is expected to change in 1995 when the museum's new building is to be completed on a two-acre lot, now occupied by the Illinois National Guard, that was essentially given to the museum by former Gov. James Thompson.
 
A Suitable House for Art
 Museum officials have been traveling from Osaka to Stuttgart looking at the work of the architects competing to build the new museum. The list of finalists is an unusually strong one with several international firms represented, but no local ones. Among the finalists are Morphosis, a Los Angeles firm, Tadao Ando and Fumihiko Maki, both of Japan, and Emilio Ambasz of New York.
"We don't want anything that intimidates, is trendy or dates easily," said Maureen King, a spokeswoman for the Museum of Contemporary Art. "We want something timeless without being classical, a container that is a work of art itself."
Part of the reason that Chicago's cultural organizations have fared so well, many say, is that they have not tried to be New York or Los Angeles and have accurately read their audiences.
"Chicago is a major metropolis but it is far enough from the spotlight that we can just address the work," said Randall Arney, the artistic director at Steppenwolf. "Actors and artists are away from the glare of the media spotlight that can kill a company in the beginning. You can make your mistakes in the dark."
 
The Growth of Steppenwolf
 It was in this environment that Steppenwolf grew from a tiny company operating out of a suburban church basement to a North Side establishment working out of a converted dairy to its present home, a raw, industrial theater of cinder block and exposed pipes that is all gray, black and white and as unpretentious as the city that spawned the company.
During its 15 years, the company and many of its members inspired a new generation of theaters in Chicago and successfully transplanted so much of its work to New York that many in Chicago feared they would lose the company. Now, with a new theater, there appears less cause for Chicagoans to worry, and the company can do what it has always wanted.
It can produce a wider selection of works and can present plays with more than one set and do all of this with the latest technology. Now it can do "Death of a Salesman," for instance, without putting Willy Loman in a ranch-style house instead of a two-story Brooklyn frame.
"Half the theater literature was unavailable to us," said Bruce Sagan, the president of the troupe. "Now we have put a Broadway stage in a 500-seat theater."
The real development in Chicago theater has occurred in only the last two decades. In the 1970's, it was basically limited to the downtown touring houses dominated by shows that had originated elsewhere, mainly meaning in New York. Now there are about 130 theaters in Chicago, from the Auditorium Theater where "Les Miserables" is playing to the dozens of small, experimental theaters that stand next to trendy cafes and lofts on the city's North Side.
"To say that Chicago theater is rough and tumble is a bit of a cliche, but there is some truth to it," said Robert Falls, the artistic director of the 683-seat Goodman Theater, which last fall presented an acclaimed production of "The Iceman Cometh," with Brian Dennehy, and is currently looking for a larger space. "There is a lack of pretentiousness to the work. It's not a theater of fancy sets, lights and costumes. There is very little avant-garde theater there. It is more direct, straight. It is emotionally accessible, openly physical and not particularly cerebral."
 
Theater as Direct as the City
 Despite the strength of the larger, established institutions, there have been casualties in the Chicago art world. City Musick, a chamber orchestra specializing in 18th-century music, and MoMing, a contemporary dance company, folded last year after financial and leadership crises. And while attendance and earnings are up for those that remain, the arts in general are facing a possible 10 percent cut in state financing in the coming year, said Alene Valkanas, the executive director of the Illinois Arts Alliance.
"People are doing well but doing well with great difficulty," said Ms. Valkanas. "What we have is an arts and cultural scene that shows signs of enormous vitality and diversity and at same time real jeopardy and threat."
Not at Orchestra Hall, though. There, the Symphony is celebrating its 100th season with the highest rate of ticket sales in its history, 102 percent, owing to the tickets turned in and then resold by the orchestra.
Asked about the orchestra's wish list, Henry Fogel, the orchestra's executive director, said, "There is nothing that we need that we don't have."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Ammirati Is Finding Its Grip On Club Med Is Loosening

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
AMMIRATI & PURIS may soon lose the Club Med resorts business, a small but important account that helped establish its reputation as a New York agency that specialized in stylish, often glamorous, advertising.
Michael Cubin, the president of Club Med's North American operations, said Friday that the company would begin talking to agencies about new approaches for the account, which has billings of $5 million to $10 million. 
 Industry executives said the loss of Club Med would be significant because the resort company, along with BMW and United Parcel Service, has been viewed as integral to Ammirati. These high-profile accounts have undoubtedly been instrumental in helping Ammirati attract many clients, executives said.
The loss would not be a big financial blow for Ammirati. The agency has billings of about $230 million.
Mr. Cubin said Club Med had not been unhappy with Ammirati. "I can't say enough good things about them," he said. The problem, Mr. Cubin said, is Club Med wanted to see new work and Ammirati insisted on sticking with the current campaign that emphasizes the variety of activities the resorts offer.
As a result, Martin Puris, the president and chief executive of Ammirati, said the agency would not actively participate in the review. In a statement, Mr. Puris said, "We are proud of our work for Club Med." Instead of creating a speculative campaign, he said the agency would let its work stand as a "benchmark against which other agencies' work is evaluated."
Club Med and Ammirati did not see eye-to-eye before. In 1985 the two disagreed on what direction the advertising should take, and Club Med abandoned Ammirati for the Ayer agency. Unable to get what it wanted elsewhere, Club Med returned to Ammirati two years later.
This time around, Mr. Cubin said the agency and Club Med had agreed on the basic marketing strategy. Club Med has been trying to move away from its earlier image as a resort chain that catered to the swinging singles crowd.
New advertising from Ammirati during the last several years has portrayed Club Med as something more than just a romantic supermarket. The ads show the resorts as places where people can pursue a far wider variety of interests. One commercial tells travelers they can come to Club Med for the sports, for the fine food, or just to lie in the sun in a hammock.
But some agency excutives said Club Med's management in the United States has been under pressure from its French parent, Club Mediterranee, to begin a more aggressive campaign aimed at quickly pumping up sales. Hurt by both the recession and the Persian Gulf crisis, Club Med's business has been in a slump.

HEADLINE: New Drug Chief Turns To Softer Side of Issue

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
When Bob Martinez, the new chief of national drug policy, was Governor of Florida, he developed a reputation as a leader whose solution to the drug problem was to build more prisons and execute the worst offenders.
But in two weeks as Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, he has been talking mainly about the softer aspects of the problem -- treatment of addicts and the prevention of drug abuse through education. 
 In an interview this week in his office near the White House, Mr. Martinez said he had "a tremendous amount of interest in education and prevention" and wanted to "open up a very good dialogue with the treatment providers so that we can work together."
President Bush, at the drug chief's swearing-in ceremony on March 28, said that Mr. Martinez "understands that we cannot defeat drugs through law enforcement alone" and that "any long-term solution also depends on successful education and treatment."
 
Emphasis Still on Winning
 But Mr. Martinez said that in his meetings with Mr. Bush about the drug post there had been no discussion about changing emphasis in the national policy or presenting a different image. "It wasn't a question of priorities," he said. "It was of winning."
The director said he was not recommending an increase in Federal spending for treatment and education, adding that he did not wish to "in any way minimize" the importance of law enforcement.
"It's pretty hard to get the message to a youngster in a school house, despite whatever prevention and education programs exist," Mr. Martinez said, "if when the school bell rings he sees a pusher standing on the corner, which clearly indicates that society must not think it's all that bad."
The most persistent criticism of the Bush Administration's drug policy from experts in the field and some members of Congress has been its emphasis on law enforcement. Mr. Martinez's predecessor, William J. Bennett, disparaged drug treatment programs as "touchy-feely" exercises.
The National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors estimates there are 6 million to 10 million serious drug abusers and says only 15 percent to 20 percent are receiving treatment.
Mr. Martinez said he fully supports the $11.6 billion anti-drug budget for the coming fiscal year, now before Congress. It was prepared by Mr. Bennett and continues an Administration pattern of allocating about 70 percent for police and military operations and the rest for treatment and education.
The proposed budget represents an increase of 11 percent over the previous year and includes a request for $100 million to expand treatment centers. But the expansion requires matching money from the states, many of which are in financial crisis.
In the interview, Mr. Martinez said he had always been concerned about treatment and drug education and professed dismay that only his tough tactics had left an impression. "I visited more cocaine babies as Governor than I can count on all my toes and fingers," he said.
 
Close Ties to Bush Family
 Mr. Martinez, a 56-year-old Republican, was defeated last fall in a bid for a second term as Governor. Both Mr. Bush and his wife campaigned for him and one of the Bushes' sons, Jeb, held the largely symoblic post of campaign chairman after serving as Mr. Martinez's Secretary of Commmerce.
In his confirmation hearings, senators questioned Mr. Martinez's qualifications and Senator Eward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the nominee's drug strategy in Florida was "characterized by the same imbalance that mars the national drug plan."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said in an interview this week: "It doesn't matter who he was or what he didn't do as Governor. We have to look forward to what he wants to do and what he can do."
Mr. Bennett quit the drug post to become head of the Republican National Committee. But he then decided not to take the party job because it would have meant giving up income from speeches and writing.
Mr. Bennett, a former Secretary of Education, drew attention to drug issues with a flamboyant and combative style.
Friends of Mr. Martinez, a tall, lean jogger and one-time semipro baseball player, say he prefers to work quietly and is unlikely to get into public disputes.
Describing himself as "an implementer," a person who "likes to operate, to execute and to monitor what is to be done," Mr. Martinez said he hopes to bring order to a field in which there is little reliable data and only broad accountability, aiming to get more out of existing money.
Mr. Martinez said he plans to press Congress for enactment of pending legislation requiring every state to develop a comprehensive drug treatment program and to explore the possibility of sending drug addicts who are poor to private drug treatment centers, which often have vacancies, at a preferential rate to be paid by government.
Hours after being sworn in, Mr. Martinez flew to Salt Lake City to address a conference of state drug treatment officials. William Butynski, the executive director of the group, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, said Mr. Martinez's appearance diminished concern "that he might be oriented only to enforcement."
Last weekend Mr. Martinez told a group of national fraternity and sorority officials he thought mandatory drug testing of college students, as suggested by Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, a Democrat, was unnecessary.
"He clearly declined an opportunity to try to trump a Democratic political leader, to be tougher," said Eric E. Sterling, the coordinator of the National Drug Strategy Network, which regards treatment and education as the most important elements of the anti-drug effort. "This was an improvement over Bennett."

HEADLINE: Careers;
M.B.A. Study Is Urged for Some Jobless

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE Simon Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Rochester has some advice for young middle managers who have lost their jobs, and for a few seniors graduating without job commitments: Think about getting a master's degree in business administration. And they can start a program at some schools in January if they are too late for the September term.
Along with at least two other graduate business schools among the top 20, Rochester accepts students into its M.B.A. program in January as well as in September. The business schools at New York University and Columbia University also allow students to enter at midyear. 
 This means that displaced middle managers or some college graduates who find themselves jobless this spring could take the required Graduate Management Admissions Test as late as October and still be accepted for the January term.
Without some pertinent work experience, however, graduating seniors may find the application process frustrating. Leading business schools like Harvard and Stanford have long refused to accept graduates right out of college unless they had work experience. This policy, widely adopted during the last decade by admissions directors at other leading schools, has meant that students in M.B.A. programs tend to be older than the typical recent graduate.
"We don't admit many right from undergraduate school," said Debra Felix, director of admissions at Columbia's business school.
Recent graduates are admitted if they can show good summer or other work experience and campus leadership qualities. This might include a successful entrepreneurial venture started on campus, for example.
Partly because of the recession, business schools are finding plenty of good applicants.
"We have been seeing an older crowd in January than in September," Ms. Felix said. "They tend to be more experienced." Last fall she began to notice "applicants who had lost jobs and said to themselves 'now is a good time to go back for an M.B.A.' "
She said applicants might have a better chance of getting into a good graduate business school in the January term, because competition is less stiff. At Columbia this year, 131 students entered in January; 493 entered last September.
The Stern School of Business at New York University also tends to accept applicants with experience. "We look for three and a half years of work experience," said Janet R. Marks, associate dean for M.B.A. education. "It would be possible but unusual for a few seniors to gain admission."
Dr. Marks encouraged unemployed middle managers to consider the option of N.Y.U.'s Accelerated M.B.A. Program, which begins in January and can be completed at the same time as the September program. "It is a great opportunity for people who have lost jobs or want a career change," she sad. "I think it is a good way to wait out the recession and use time productively." The Graduate Management Admissions Test can be taken as late as Oct. 15.
In January 1991 the Stern School had 63 full-time and 238 part-time students.
Foreign students are also being drawn to midyear entry programs in American business schools. At Columbia there has been a slight increase, to 24 percent from 22 percent, in foreign students who entered in January.
Most foreign students at Rochester receive government, corporate or other financial support, and a shorter time on campus in this country saves sponsors money, not just in tuition but in living expenses and time away from jobs as well.
"The idea of completing an M.B.A. program in 18 months instead of 22 attracts students from abroad," said Priscilla E. Gumina, assistant dean for M.B.A. programs at the Simon school in Rochester.
In a typical two-year M.B.A. program, students spend the summer between the first and second year as interns working for corporations or government. That means the January entrants can catch up with their counterparts who begin in the fall by opting to study through the summer. Midyear students take the same required courses as those entering in the fall.
At Rochester, 50 students entered in January, compared with 35 last year and 20 in 1989, the first year it permitted midyear entry. New York University and Columbia have had January entry programs for years.

Bois Cascade Reports Loss

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho, April 15 (AP)

 BODY:
The Boise Cascade Corporation said today that rising expenses and weak demand for its paper and wood products caused a $16.85 million loss in the first quarter of 1991.
The loss was in contrast to a profit of $33.57 million, or 79 cents a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Sales amounted to $992.73 million, compared with $1.066 billion a year earlier. 
 The quarterly loss was the first in more than six years and officials said financial problems could persist if market conditions did not improve.
The company cited the weak economy, excess production capacity that created the poor market for paper, deterioration of the wood products market reflecting rising log and wood chip prices, and higher interest rates and depreciation expenses because of a $2 billion plant modernization campaign.
The company laid off workers this year in a cost-cutting campaign and has consolidated two paper divisions, reduced administrative budgets and cut expected capital expenditures from $824 million last year to $300 million in 1991.
The stock rose 37.5 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange today, to $25.625.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Amid Worries About Interest Rates in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other leading currencies yesterday amid concerns about United States interest rates.
Gold prices edged higher, with the April contract gaining 30 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $361.60 an ounce. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $360.30, up 80 cents. 
 The dollar fell after the Federal Reserve took steps to drain cash from the banking system, leaving less money available for banks and pushing the cost of borrowing higher. The markets interpreted the move as a signal that the Fed was not altering its monetary policy or pushing interest rates lower.
Ordinarily, the prospect of stable or higher rates is a signal for traders to buy the dollar, since it, like other currencies, is supported by higher yields.
"It's somewhat surprising that the dollar didn't react more," said Mike Faust, a currency market analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
 
Fed Action Still Expected
 Some traders still expect the Fed to take some action relatively soon to relax its monetary policy and allow interest rates to fall.
That theory was bolstered by sales figures released by the big American auto makers showing that demand for new cars and trucks remained weak in the first 10 days of April. The numbers were seen as proof of continuing economic weakness that could force the Fed to push rates lower to stimulate business.
Comments by a German official, indicating that rates in that country will remain firm, helped the mark at the dollar's expense, Mr. Faust said.
The official, Hans Tietmeyer, a member of the policy-making directorate of Germany's central bank, said a stable mark would be achieved by "continued relatively high interest rates."
The dollar fell more than a pfennig against the mark. In New York, it slumped to 1.6710 marks, from 1.6880 late Friday, and in earlier European trading, the dollar closed at 1.6755 marks, down from 1.6855.
The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen, closing at 134.25 yen in New York, down from 136.40 late Friday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar fell to a close of 135.22 yen, from 135.85 on Friday, and it was quoted later in London at 134.48.
The British pound rose against the dollar. In New York, the pound advanced to $1.7910 from $1.7725 late Friday. Earlier, in London, the pound rose to $1.7920, from $1.7775.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Friday rates, included: 1.4185 Swiss francs, down from 1.4320; 5.6385 French francs, down from 5.7020; 1,237.25 Italian lire, down from 1,252.25, and 1.14815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15085.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $360.50 an ounce, from $361.25 late Friday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $361.20, unchanged from late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.19 an ounce, to close at $361.99.
Silver picked up four-tenths of a cent to close at $3.981 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. In London, silver fell to a late bid price of $3.98 an ounce, down from $4 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 12.38, to 2,933.17, on a Volatile Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks turned volatile yesterday as traders tried to figure out whether the Federal Reserve would bring interest rates down to revive the economy. Weakness in I.B.M. stock was a strong factor in keeping the market from moving higher.
Many concluded that the Fed would do nothing for now because it might feel the economy would improve on its own. And long-term bond prices moved up a bit, carrying stock prices slightly higher. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which jumped 18 points early in the day and then quickly sank 30, closed at 2,933.17, ahead 12.38.
 
Other Indexes Inch Up
 Other market indexes continued to inch ahead to new highs:
*The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose to 381.19, up 0.79.
*The New York Stock Exchange composite rose to 208.59, up 0.51.
*The American Stock Exchange market-value index rose to 366.87, up 0.24.
The Nasdaq composite fell less than a point, but strength in the Amex and in the Nasdaq, despite the drop, showed that investors were still pouring money into small stocks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slid to 161.8 million shares, from a solid 198.6 million on Friday.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trading, said that heavy computerized selling early in the day lopped 15 points off the Dow.
Explaining the Fed's current stance, H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company in New York, said: "The Fed is reluctant to see short-term rates come down at present, partly because it sees growth in the money supply and doesn't want to see it grow too rapidly. Fed economists appear to believe the economy is bottoming and will soon moveupward."
Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, said he was "not sure the Fed is a strong factor right now."
He argued that "strong program trading on a light-volume day" was a leading factor yesterday and that the big question on interest rates was not whether but when the Fed would bring them down.
Mr. Heinemann argued that the nation faced "four to six months more of recession"; that in that context rates would "continue to come down substantially, if not today," and that the money supply would continue to grow.
On the strength of increasing signs that inflation is now weak, traders bid up stock prices early in the day in expectation that the Fed would trim rates. But at 10:35 A.M., or an hour before the Fed typically moves in, it drained money from the banking system in what traders took to be a clear signal that the Fed would not ease. The Dow dropped instantly, trading erratically for the rest of the day.
Six minutes after the Fed's action, a seven-minute flurry of program selling toppled the Dow 11 points.
 
Advice to Salespeople
 In a conference call with Kidder, Peabody salespeople yesterday, Mr. Jarrett said: "This is a stock-pickers' environment, but crosscurrents in the marketplace are very mixed. Some of the averages reached new, all-time highs while others, like the Dow industrials and the transportation index, are lagging."
I.B.M., the second-most-active Big Board stock, on volume of three million shares, fell 1 5/8, to 106 7/8, after Daniel Mandresh, a computer analyst at Merrill Lynch, cut his earnings estimate.

HEADLINE: Brady Calls for Lower Rates To Stimulate World Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 15

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the top economic priority for the industrialized world should be to lower interest rates.
He stressed that lower rates were vital to stimulate economic growth and generate the extraordinary amount of capital needed in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, the war-ravaged Middle East and Latin America. 
 As he met with finance ministers of the six other leading industrialized nations -- Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan -- and attended the opening ceremony for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr. Brady expressed concern about sluggish economic growth in the developed world.
 
Lag in Europe and Japan
 While there were signs that the United States was emerging from its recession, he said, Western Europe had been slowing and Japan, though still buoyant, appeared to have lost some of its vigor.
Some of his remarks appeared to be aimed at Germany, where concerns about the inflationary pressures of unification have led the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to keep interest rates high, forcing other countries to also keep rates up.
Mr. Brady said too much emphasis was being put on lowering inflation and not enough on cutting interest rates and stimulating economic growth to generate the tremendous amount of capital needed throughout the world. There are fears in European financial markets that the Bundesbank may soon raise interest rates.
 
Obsession With Inflation
 A senior Treasury official who gave a background briefing to reporters today said Mr. Brady had told his counterparts on Sunday night that he believed some were overly obsessed with lowering inflation.
The Treasury official said everyone at the meeting agreed on problems of a potential worldwide capital shortage. While there was no conclusion reached at the session on how to deal with it, the official said, the finance ministers agreed to focus on it at their formal meeting in Washington later this month.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which formally opened its doors today, is a multilateral financial institution founded to help rebuild Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and to promote market economies and democracy in the region. Jacques Attali, the bank's president, has estimated that Eastern Europe will require as much as $3 trillion in investment over the next 20 years.
Thirty-nine countries and two European Community organizations have pledged to provide the bank with a total of about $12.3 billion in capital. The United States has agreed to provide $1.2 billion, making it the single biggest donor.

HEADLINE: EUROPEAN NATIONS TO LIFT SANCTIONS ON SOUTH AFRICA

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 15

 BODY:
Ignoring appeals from the African National Congress, the 12-nation European Community agreed today to lift its remaining economic sanctions against South Africa in response to the Pretoria Government's continuing moves to dismantle apartheid.
Meeting in Luxembourg, community foreign ministers said the move would result in ending a five-year-old ban on imports of gold coins, iron and steel from South Africa. Last December, the ministers revoked a prohibition against new investments in South Africa. 
 Although the nations of the community are still bound by the United Nations embargo on arms sales to South Africa, today's action marks a new step toward South Africa's reincorporation into the world economy. In 1985, the year before European sanctions were adopted, South Africa exported some $700 million worth of gold coins, iron and steel to community countries.
 
U.S. Conditions on Sanctions
 In Washington, a State Department official said the South African Government must still fulfill two conditions -- freeing all political prisoners and repealing laws that classify people by race -- before American sanctions can be lifted under the measure by which Congress applied them.
Washington's sanctions are wider than the European Community's. In addition to prohibiting import of South African gold coins, iron, steel and agricultural products, they ban the export to South Africa of crude oil, petroleum products, munitions and computers and computer services to security services. And the United States continues to ban new investment in South Africa.
The European Community's decision today was signaled last February when community officials told Pretoria that remaining sanctions would be lifted as soon as South Africa proposed legislation to repeal important apartheid laws. The South African Parliament is expected to approve this legislation in July.
 
Opposition to Move
 Last week, however, the Secretary General of the African National Congress, Alfred Nzo, urged the European Community to maintain its sanctions, arguing that the apartheid system was still in place. Many members of the European Parliament also spoke out against today's community move.
But the community foreign ministers were reportedly unanimous today in supporting the lifting of sanctions and in denying the European Parliament an opportunity to debate the issue. Community officials said the ministers argued that they had exclusive authority to decide about the sanctions.
A European Community official in Washington said it was likely it would take several months to re-establish trade lines cut off since the mid-1980s.
The official said there would be a good market for South African gold, in Europe and business could easily reach the pre-sanctions levels, but for iron and steel the outlook was less promising.
There have been major changes in the structure of the European industry, the official noted, with less need today for types of steel supplied by South Africa.
"They must have lost their traditional trade lines, and I can't imagine there would be an immediate pickup," she said.
At the meeting today in Luxembourg, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the community, foreign ministers also agreed to press for a war crimes trial for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, accusing him of aggression against Kuwait, using chemical weapons against civilians and condoning genocide against the Kurds.
European officials said that, after Germany's Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, made the proposal, it was agreed that Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Jacques Poos, would raise the issue with the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, when they meet Tuesday.
The officials said Mr. Genscher had not clarified in what court and under what international conventions that Mr. Hussein should be tried, but they recalled that, in the months leading up to the gulf war, the community repeatedly warned the Iraqi leader that he would be charged with war crimes.
Eager to play a diplomatic role in the wake of the gulf war, community foreign ministers are also to meet the Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Luxembourg Wednesday to coordinate their policies towards the Middle East in general and the Kurdish refugee crisis in particular.
Much of today's meeting in Luxembourg, though, was given over to discussion of the community's broader moves towards closer integration, above all plans to draw up common foreign and security policies that would enable it to play a more active role in future crises than it did in the gulf war.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
De Klerk Welcomes Move
 JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- President F. W. de Klerk tonight welcomed the European Community's decision to lift economic sanctions against South Africa, calling the latest move "positive and most encouraging."
In a statement, Mr. de Klerk thanked the European governments for standing by commitments to lift the sanctions.
"It is another important step for South Africa and all its people towards improved economic conditions and normal international relations," Mr. de Klerk said.
Mr. de Klerk said he would refer to the issue in greater detail when he visits Western Europe later this month.
The African National Congress, which has repeatedly opposed any lifting of sanctions without its approval, expressed concern that the decision could make the white minority Government more intransigent.
Saki Macozoma, a spokesman for the congress, said that Mr. de Klerk "knows what is needed in this country and does not need rewards to do it."
Mr. Macozoma said Alfred Nzo, the congress's secretary general, and Thabo Mbeki, its international affairs secretary, had gone to Brussels last week in an effort to dissuade the European Community from its decision.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Response to Move
 WASHINGTON, April 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- A State Department official said today that South Africa, to win an end to American sanctions, still needs to comply with two conditions of the original five set by Congress in imposing the curbs.
Pretoria has complied with three of five conditions set by Congress: repealing state-of-emergency regulations, legalizing once-banned opposition political parties and entering negotiations with representative political groups.
The law imposing the sanctions also mandates that all political prisoners -- there are between 300 and 1,200 -- must be released. In talks with the African National Congress last fall, the Government promised all would be freed by April 30.
Under the law, President Bush may consider modifying the sanctions once the political prisoners have been released. He has committed himself to consulting with Congress before he does that, the State Department official said.
Congress also demanded that Pretoria repeal the Groups Areas Act and the Population Registration Act, laws that classify people by race and limiting blacks' access to land ownership. The Government has introduced legislation to repeal these laws during the current parliamentary session.

HEADLINE: Baker Is Returning to Middle East To Push Arab-Israeli Peace Talks

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will head back to the Middle East on Tuesday for the second time in two weeks, seeking to overcome remaining obstacles to an Arab-Israeli peace conference, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Baker completed his last trip through the region on Friday, having found broad support for some kind of peace conference that would include Israeli, Arab and Palestinian representatives, but still unable to reach a final agreement on the framework and agenda for such a meeting. 
 Administration officials say the main reason Mr. Baker is returning to the region so soon is because he believes that he is making some headway and is convinced that unless he makes a major effort to reach a final agreement right now all of the parties will drift away or fall prey to domestic infighting.
Mr. Baker will first travel to Luxembourg, where he will consult with European Community officials about Kurdish refugees fleeing the Iraqi Army into Turkey and Iran. The officials will try to come up with a consistent position on how the United Nations and International Red Cross can extend humanitarian aid inside Iraq and to better coordinate and finance relief efforts for refugee camps. Mr. Baker is also likely to discuss with them a European Community decision made Monday to seek to bring President Saddam Hussein to trial as a war criminal.
 
Visit to Jordan Is Likely
 From Luxembourg, he is scheduled to fly to Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and almost certainly Jordan. The stop in Jordan, which is expected by American officials, would be particularly noteworthy since it would represent at least a partial reconciliation between the two countries. The Administration resented King Hussein's public support for Iraq during the Persian Gulf war, and threatened to cut economic aid.
Administration officials noted that no country wanted to be held responsible for a breakdown of any peace initiative but that each had differing perspectives of how the meeting should procede and what its goals should be.
Israel continues to refuse to consider a trade of land for peace. Meanwhile, a number of Arab countries say they will attend only as long as its goals are based on United Nations Resolutions 242 and 338, which call on Israel to return Jordanian and Syrian lands it has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Among other issues that remain unsettled are what if any connection Palestinian representatives would have to the Palestine Liberation Organization, where the conference would take place and whether the Soviet Union would attend. Mr. Baker would like the Soviet Union to be a co-host of the conference to build confidence among the Arab countries and shield them from criticism from radicals who would say they are betraying their ideals by directly negotiating with Israel.
"The Arab countries have been timid about sudden initiatives and the longer something draws out, the more hardened their positions become," said a State Department official monitoring the peace process.
 
'Much Work to Be Done'
 Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the decision to send Mr. Baker back to the Middle East was made over the weekend during consultations between President Bush and the Secretary of State.
"The President and the Secretary are convinced that all parties are taking a serious approach to peace in the Middle East," she said, but, in a seeming attempt to keep expectations low, she quickly added, "While we believe all parties are serious, there is much work to be done, many questions to be answered and still a long way to go."
Mr. Baker's return trip was welcomed by Foreign Minister David Levy of Israel, who said: "This is a good sign. It shows his labor is bearing fruit."
There was no immediate official high-level Arab response to the announcement.

 BODY:
A New York State judge ruled yesterday that a state program to provide prenatal care for the working poor was unconstitutional because it did not include abortion services.
The judge, Justice Carmen Ciparick of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, ruled that the exclusion violated state constitutional guarantees of due process, privacy and equal protection. 
 "While the Legislature can express preference for childbirth over abortion and allocate resources accordingly," Justice Ciparick said, "it cannot transgress constitutional principles to achieve this result."
Donna Lieberman, a lawyer for the New York State Civil Liberties Union, said the ruling was the "first time time a New York court explicitly recognized that the State Constitution, independent of Federal guarantees, protected the right of a woman to an abortion." That is significant because, should the United States Supreme Court reverse its stance upholding abortion rights, the question is likely to be decided on a state-by-state basis.
 
No Decision on Appeal
 Terrance McGrath, a spokeman for the State Commissioner of Social Services, Cesar Perales, said the ruling had not been reviewed and no decision had been made on whether to appeal.
The ruling dealt with a state law that took effect in January 1990, which extended an array of prenatal medical services to poor women whose income is above the Federal poverty line. The program excluded abortions, although they are available to women below the poverty line under Medicaid.
The state program was adopted after years of wrenching debate in the Legislature. Lawmakers in the Democratic-led Assembly wanted it to cover abortions as well as prenatal care, but the Republican Senate wanted abortions excluded. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo sided with the Senate, offering a bill excluding abortion financing, which was eventually adopted.
In a broad constitutional attack on the law, the Civil Liberties Union argued that the state "cannot wield its economic power to dictate the choice it prefers, in this instance, childbirth." The group estimated that at least 30,000 women who might have chosen to have abortions last year were denied them because of the exclusion.
Commissioner Perales and David Axelrod, the State Health Commissioner, had contended that the exclusion "did not deprive this group of women of their right to obtain an abortion simply because the state is not supplying the funds," and Justice Ciparick agreed.
But, she said, "The Prenatal Care Assistance Program impermissibly pressures eligible indigent women toward childbirth, abridging a constitutionally protected right."
She cited the case of one patient, a 19-year-old pregnant woman with sickle-cell anemia who was poor but did not qualify for Medicaid. Judge Ciparick said the woman was advised to have an abortion because her health was so poor. The judge said that the prospects for a healthy baby were not good, and that though the woman could choose state-financed prenatal care, she was denied a state-financed abortion.
Poor women in New York City can receive abortions financed by the city through the Health and Hospitals Corporation.

Earnings Up At Eli Lilly and Upjohn

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Eli Lilly & Company and the Upjohn Company each reported double-digit earnings increases for the first quarter, confirming the ability of drug makers to do well despite problems in the economy.
Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said net income rose 14 percent from the same period last year. Upjohn, based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said earnings had increased 16.6 percent. But analysts said both drug companies had important products that faced marketing problems.
 
 
Eli Lilly
 Lilly said net income in the quarter was $388.6 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with $340.8 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago. Quarterly sales rose 15.7 percent to $1.44 billion, from $1.24 billion a year ago. 
 Richard D. Wood, Lilly's chairman, said sales growth in each of the company's operations had generated a record first quarter. But analysts expressed reservations.
 Barbara Ryan at Prudential Securities said sales of Prozac, Lilly's strong-selling antidepressant drug, seemed flat. "The Prozac numbers have to start to move up," she said, to match the product's strong growth in the second half of 1990, when Prozac sales were $450 million.
 Mary Ellen McCarthy, a drug analyst with Shearson Lehman, said Prozac sales had been hurt by lawsuits charging that the drug has dangerous side effects. Lilly denies the charges, and many psychiatrists say Prozac's benefits far outweigh any possible problems.
 A Lilly spokesman said the company does not disclose sales of individual products. But the company said worldwide pharmaceutical sales were up in the quarter and listed among the "important contributors" Prozac, the ulcer drug Axid; the antibiotic Ceclor and the generically engineered insulin Humulin. Lilly said sales of medical devices and animal health produces also increased.
Eli Lilly stock rose $1.375 a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $81.625.
 
 
Upjohn
 Upjohn said quarterly earnings were $133.3 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with $114.3 million, or 61 cents, a year ago. Sales rose 10.5 percent to $799.4 million, from $723.4 million a year earlier.
Upjohn said it was helped by a decline in its estimated annual tax rate to 27 percent, compared with 32.5 percent in 1990, because the company increased the portion of earnings from its factories that qualify for tax breaks in Puerto Rico. Upjohn said pretax earnings from continuing operations rose 5 percent, pulled down by new requirements to provide rebates on drugs to state Medicaid programs for the poor.
Ronald Nordmann at Paine Webber Securities said price rises generated nearly half of Upjohn's sales increase in the quarter. He said the company had raised prices by at least 9 percent on three major products -- Xanax , its tranquilizer, Halcion sleeping pills and Ansaid, for arthritis.
Ms. Ryan said Halcion and Xanax sales were depressed in New York State, which required pharmacies to file triplicate records on sales of the Upjohn products, curtailing their availability for illegal sales that drug enforcement officials had been reporting. She said similar national restrictions on Xanax and Halcion have been proposed in Congress.
Upjohn's stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday on the Big Board, to $46.375 a share.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Fed Move Dims Hope Of Easing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Credit market traders and analysts said the Federal Reserve Board sent a clear signal yesterday that it had no current intention of lowering short-term interest rates.
Many analysts had expected that the good inflation news reported last week, with the Consumer Price Index falling one-tenth of 1 percent in March and the Producer Price Index dropping three-tenths, would lead the Fed to cut the discount rate and lower the overnight Federal funds rate. 
 "I was somewhat surprised," said Darwin L. Beck, a vice president and economist at the First Boston Corporation. "All of the signs last Friday pointed to an ease. But the signal only said we haven't eased now. It says nothing about what the future might hold. I think an ease could be triggered at almost any time."
 
Draining Reserves
 The Fed pointedly entered the open market for Treasury securities an hour earlier than normal yesterday and drained reserves from the banking system, a signal that points toward tighter, rather than easier, credit.
At the time of the Fed move, the funds rate was trading around 5 1/2 percent, a level where it hovered for much of last week. Subsequently, the funds rate moved back above the 6 percent level that has been widely regarded as the Fed's target since early March.
"The Fed decided to put an end to the mystery," one Government bond trader said. "But all it means is that they have decided not to cut rates now. But the economic data are very bullish, and inflation is under control."
 
Fed Move Dominates Activity
 The Fed's move dominated trading activity yesterday, and led to a selloff of short-term securities. Longer-term note and bond issues posted modest gains.
"At this point the Fed is more concerned with getting long rates down than short rates," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "I think bond yields will have to go down to or below 8 percent, and give every indication that they will stay there, before the Fed will move."
A decline in long-term bond yields would tend to push down mortgage interest rates, which, in turn, would provide more stimulus to the housing sector. In February, housing, which has been depressed, showed signs of improvement. March data on housing activity is expected to be released today.
Auto sales, however, which have also been depressed, are not experiencing any sort of postwar recovery.
In a report that went virtually unnoticed in the credit markets yesterday, the nation's auto manufacturers said the annualized selling rate was a mere 5.6 million vehicles in the first 10 days of April, down from the 6.4 million recorded for the last 10 days of March. Most Wall Street analysts had been expecting sales would come in at a rate of 6.2 million.
"The Fed can't be very happy with the auto sales numbers," Mr. Beck said. "They show that a revival in consumer confidence doesn't necessarily translate into sales of goods."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the impact of the Fed's signal was most noticeably felt in rates on outstanding Treasury bills.
In the bill market, three-month bill rates rose by 9 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 5.58 percent. And six-month bill rates rose by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.66 percent.
The reaction among bond traders was slightly more positive.
In late trading, the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 97 6/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.12 percent, down from 8.14 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price of 98 5/8, up 1/32, to yield 7.95 percent. And the 7 1/8 percent two-year notes were unchanged, at a late offered price of 100 1/2, to yield 6.84 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, new three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.57 percent, down from an average rate of 5.60 percent at last week's sale. It is the lowest rate on a new three-month bill since the auction on Nov. 30, 1987, when three-month bills sold at an average rate of 5.49 percent.
Bids on new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.67 percent, off from an average rate of 5.68 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a six-month bill since the auction of July 13, 1987.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, activity yesterday was highlighted by offerings from two Canadian provinces, which collectively offered $800 million worth of securities to investors.
The Province of Quebec priced a $500 million offering of 12-year, 8.80 percent debentures through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The securities were priced at $99.689, to yield 8.842 percent, 90 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which mature April 15, 2003, are noncallable for life. They are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The Province of Nova Scotia offered $300 million of 30-year debentures through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 9 1/8 percent securities, which mature May 1, 2021, were priced at $98.818, to yield 9.242 percent, 1.125 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point in fairly active trading.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds said that prices of most widely quoted municipal issues rose by about 1/8 of a point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Beef Prices at Record Highs As Cattle Shortage Continues

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
With barbecue season around the corner, a near 30-year low in the nation's cattle herd has resulted in the highest prices ever for steak, hamburger and other cuts of beef.
The Government expects the herd to be larger by the end of the summer, but there is a puzzling discrepancy between the growing number of cattle in feedlots and the number actually slaughtered. 
 And until more cattle are slaughtered, beef prices, ranging from hamburger meat to choice steaks, are likely to stay high. Ground beef is selling nationally at an average of $1.64 a pound, according to the National Cattlemen's Association, up 6 percent from $1.55 in March 1990. T-bone steak is selling for $5.40 a pound, a 5 percent increase from $5.16 a year ago.
 
Thousands Sold Their Herds
 The beef shortage is the aftermath of economic problems that beset farmers in the mid-1980's. Thousands of financially strapped ranchers sold their cattle herds to pay off bank loans. A severe drought followed, making it too expensive for many remaining farmers to buy feed to expand their herds.
As a result, the number of cattle in the United States -- on both pastures and feedlots -- has been hovering at slightly below 100 million head for the past several years, compared with more than 110 million in 1980 and 132 million in 1976.
Faced with the high meat prices, many grocers say they are promoting chicken breasts, which average $2.04 a pound, or less than half the price of a T-bone steak, and that more and more shoppers are choosing chicken.
"I used to spoil myself, but I gave it up since it got so high," said Katie Tschimperle of Minneapolis, in regard to the price of beef. Within the last six months, because of high prices, she has switched from T-bone steak and porterhouse to chicken and pork.
One New York City restaurateur said she was trying to de-emphasize her beef offerings. "People are ordering less steak; it's very expensive," said Ruth Jeffries, owner of Mrs. J's Sacred Cow Steak House in Manhattan, who prefers that the restaurant now be known simply as Mrs. J's. "I am trying to get away from the word 'steak,' " she added.
Grocers have been trying to hold down the price of beef to avoid driving away customers. "Retailers have eaten some of the price increases," one supplier said. Prices have gotten so high that many retailers have simply stopped advertising beef.
But Dennis Smith, the chief meat buyer for Super Valu Stores Inc., a large food distributor and retailer based in Minneapolis, said grocers would be unwilling to continue to accept smaller profits at their meat counters if the price of cattle on the cash market continued to rise.
Such a move would drive consumers into the waiting arms of the chicken producers.
 
Government's Count Questioned
 For nearly a year, Agriculture Department surveys have shown that an increasing number of cattle are fattening up in feedlots, the last stop before slaughter. But despite a 10 percent increase in the number of cattle in feedlots from a year earlier, the size of the slaughter has not grown. That has caused a dispute about the accuracy of the Goverment's monthly feedlot cattle count and a great deal of uncertainty over how much longer prices will stay high.
"They are out there," insists Robert Cole, head the Agriculture Department unit responsible for counting the inventory. He said time would eventually prove the Government's counts correct.
Mr. Cole says the cattle were bound to appear at slaughterhouses in several months. He believes the nub of the problem is not that the Government's cattle count is wrong but that cattle are arriving at feedlots sooner and are weighing less. That means they remain on feedlots longer to gain the required weight for butchering.
 
No Surge of Cattle Yet
 But Mr. Cole acknowledges that the number of cattle being slaughtered this month is still less than he expected. "We have not seen that large surge yet," he said.
Faced with what several analysts are calling "the phantom herd" problem, the nation's biggest slaughterhouses, which have cut back production and hours for their employees because cattle are scarce, say they are planning output on a week-to-week basis.
"Nobody knows what is going to happen," said Gene Meakins, a spokesman for Monfort Inc., which is based in Greeley, Colo., and is the meat-packing subsidiary of Conagra Inc. of Omaha. "We can't get all the cattle we need," Mr. Meakins said. "People in the company say they cannot remember when it has been this difficult to get cattle."
 
Mystery of 'Missing Cattle'
 The "missing cattle" mystery stems from the fact that for nearly a year the Government has reported that the cattle herd is gradually building back from the ravages of the drought three years ago, and that more and more cattle are awaiting slaughter.
The recovery is gradual since it takes nearly two years to breed and fatten a calf and move it through the chutes to slaughterhouses. As the steers get closer to the kill, the Government's counts are important to the meat processers, who use them to set production and shipping schedules for fresh beef.
But the latest projections for the slaughter have been off by up to 240,000 cattle, or 5 percent, of the five million cattle the Government projects for slaughter each quarter.
Cattle ranchers complain that the Government count is off because it relies on outdated methods. "Counting cattle is one of those things that most people in Washington don't think is very significant," said Richard Farr, of Farr Feeders, a feedlot with 30,000 head of cattle in Greeley, Colo.
 
Double Counting Possible
 For one thing, Mr. Farr said, the Government is factoring in cattle from producers that have been out of business for years. Other ranchers and livestock analysts say some cattle are being counted twice. Double counting occurs, they say, when cattle occasionally are moved from feedlot to pasture and back to a feedlot.
Mr. Cole, the Agriculture Department official, said the Government numbers and methods were accurate. He said the survey took steps to avoid double counts by subtracting cattle if taken from a feedlot.
He acknowledged, however, that it was possible that the Government might occasionally include in its estimates cattle produced from farmers who have left the business.
"We try everything to avoid it, but it is possible," he said.
When agents are unable to find ranchers counted in the past, they are allowed to assign a herd size to the rancher based on the size of other herds in the region, Mr. Cole said. He said that estimate amounted to a fraction of the total count.
 
Method of Cattle Counting
 Each month, the agency counts cattle in the seven top cattle-producing states, primarily by asking major feedlots to report the size of their herds. They also telephone major cattle ranches and ask them to count their cattle.
The Government then develops a "statistical indication" of the number of cattle in seven states that the slaughterhouses may expect in a matter of months. Each quarter, the survey, formally known as the Cattle on Feed Inventory, is expanded to include cattle in the 13 biggest cattle-producing states.
Outside the Government, there is confusion about whether the herd is growing. With high prices for cattle, some ranchers are cashing in much of their herds, including cattle that would have been used for breeding. And some farmers and others who raise cattle on the side are getting out of the business, at least temporarily, because they do not want to buy cattle at these prices and be holding them when prices fall.
 
'Critical Time for the Industry'
 "There is a mixed set of projections right now" as to the size of the herd and the direction of prices, said Michael Boehlje, an agricultural economist at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, adding, "It is a critical time for the industry."
The Government and some ranchers predict that a rise in the size of the nation's cattle herd will force prices down slightly sometime this summer. Ronald Gustafson, an Agriculture Department economist, said that although the worst was over, cattle supplies would remain tight for the rest of the year, and that the expansion of the herd would not have much impact on meat prices until the middle of next year.
"The outlook is for continued record high prices at the meat counters through out the spring," said Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers in Chicago.
 
Growing Popularity of Chicken
 Last year, for the first time, Americans consumed more poultry than beef, an Agriculture Department survey found. Although health and nutrition issues have played an important role in the growing popularity of chicken, economists say the cheaper price of chicken is the primary factor.
"Forget about nutrition; it is just plain old economics," said William Roenigk, vice president of the National Broiler Council in Washington.
Mr. Boehlje, the agriculture economist, said poultry would continue to gain market share at the expense of beef as meat prices rise. "The higher beef prices move, the more people are going to switch," he said. "We have seen substantial switching in the past and I think that is going to continue."
And Mr. Smith of Super Valu predicted, "This summer, you will see a little more chicken on the grill and fewer steaks."

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Big Jump In Profits At Chase

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation yesterday announced a first-quarter profit of $117 million, a sharp improvement from a year earlier. The news was a sign that conditions for the banking industry are improving, even though problems with bad loans remain severe.
First Fidelity Bancorporation, the largest banking company in New Jersey, also announced an increase in profits. 
 Like many other banking companies, Chase and First Fidelity benefited from a wider spread between the interest rates they paid for deposits and the rates they collected on loans; a cutback in low-profit corporate lending and an expansion of higher-profit consumer lending, and reductions in payroll and other expenses.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
 
Chase Manhattan
 At Chase, the nation's third-largest banking company after Citicorp and BankAmerica, first-quarter profits were more than double the $44 million earned a year earlier, and earnings per share improved to 73 cents, from 20 cents.
After losses totaling $999 million in 1989 and 1990, analysts have been predicting a return to profitability at Chase. Yesterday's announcement was better than expected and helped raise the company's stock price $1.375, to $19 a share, its highest level of the year. As recently as October 1989, Chase's stock had traded at $44.875. That was before the company began announcing a rapid increase in losses on bad loans, and declining activity in corporate lending, an area of traditional strength for the company.
"They are still not operating at a level of profitability the company needs over the long term, but the improvement gives hope that management is executing the turnaround plan," said Norman Jaffe, a banking analsyt at Fox-Pitt Kelton, a securities firm.
The most glaring sign of trouble at Chase was an increase in domestic loans labeled as non-accrual because they are either badly delinquent or in such trouble that management does not expect repayment in full. Non-accrual loans backed by commercial real estate projects increased $294 million, or 16.5 percent, to $2.074 billion, and now account for 23.6 percent of all such loans. Other kinds of domestic loans in enough trouble to be lableled non-accrual rose $38 million, to $761 million.
Despite the increase in non-accrual loans, Chase did not increase the size of its reserve for loan losses. After adding $240 million to the reserve and loan charge-offs of $270 million net of recoveries, the reserve declined slightly to $2.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, Chase set aside $200 million for its reserve and charged off $286 million net of recoveries.
There are no firm rules for how much a bank should set aside in reservs for bad loans, and it is up to each bank to estimate how much of a loss it expects on its loans.
Chase continued to reduce the size of the company and its payroll during the first quarter, though at a much slower pace than during the last half of 1990.
 
 
First Fidelity
 Profits at First Fidelity more than doubled, to $56.1 million, from $21.1 million a year earlier. First Fidelity's earnings improved to 87 cents a share in the first quarter, from 30 cents a year earlier.
A $37.2 million decline in non-interest expenses, to $211.6 million, helped compensate for an increase in troubled loans. The company set aside $85 million in its reserve for additional losses, up from $63 million in the fourth quarter. Badly delinquent and other troubled loans rose $50 million, to $786.7 million, or 4.5 percent of all loans, up from 3.907 percent at year-end.
On the New York Stock Exchange, First Fidelity's stock rose 62.5, cents to $25.375.

HEADLINE: Film Workers Reject Settlement, Prolonging New York Shutdown

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Members of a film-crafts union local rejected a tentative contract yesterday with leading Hollywood producers, prolonging a bitter and costly stalemate that has virtually shut down major-studio film making in New York City since November.
The surprising rejection came at a critical time of the year for New York's $2.5 billion movie-making industry when commitments are made to bring big budget productions to the city for summer filming. The lack of a settlement would mean that only low-budget, independent films would be shot -- a small fraction of the city's film-making business. 
 "I'm sick about this, I had hoped it wouldn't happen," said Jaynne C. Keyes, director of the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcast. "It's very bad news for the city. If the producers don't come back to the bargaining table, we've lost our summer, and that's most of our business."
In mail ballots counted yesterday, the rank and file of Local 52 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators voted 606 to 393 not to accept the settlement, which was reached on March 18.
Although many of the union members have been out of work for as long as five months, they were opposed to provisions that would have offered the film producers reductions in required overtime and weekend payments. In return, the workers would have received greater health and pension benefits.
"I guess the producers were asking too much," said Walter Stocklin, president of Local 52, "We do want to reach an agreement with the producers. We have some ideas -- it doesn't mean we're dead in the water."
The major producers involved in the negotiations are five Hollywood studios: Columbia Pictures, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, MGM-United Artists and Orion Pictures, participating as a distributor.
"We're extremely disappointed with the vote," said Joel Grossman, vice president for labor relations at Columbia Pictures, who was the producers' chief negotiator with the union local. "Theoretically, talks could resume right away, but the question is whether there is any reason to resume."
"Speaking for Columbia Pictures," he added, "we will not bring productions into New York until there is a signed agreement with Local 52."
Before the tentative settlement was reached in March, the 19-week stalemate had called a halt to major-studio movie making in New York City, a vital part of the city's economy that is estimated to generate $500 million to $2.5 billion a year in fees to the city, as well as many ancillary jobs. Mayor David N. Dinkins had pressed for a settlement along with the city's film office.
The 2,000-member Local 52 provides much of the behind-the-scenes people for movies in New York, including sound people, electricians, shop craftsmen, prop people, camera grips and set dressers. Only about 1,000 members of the union, whose jurisdiction is New York City and Long Island, voted.
Many of Local 52's members, as well as the members of other New York film unions, have been out of work since November. Although they are accustomed to interrupted employment, most of them do not hold other jobs and will have to leave the city to seek film work in other cities.
The tentative agreement had been reached in Sherman Oaks, Calif., by the producers and the bargaining committees of Local 52 and another film union, Local 644 of the International Photographers of the Motion Picture and Television Industries. Local 644's members are now voting on the tentative settlement by mail, with their ballots to be counted on May 3. Ratification is expected.
Local 644, which represents cinematographers and camera crews, has 1,500 members. It has jurisdiction over the entire East Coast.
Efforts to reach Louis D'Agostino, business manager of Local 644, for comment were unsuccessful last night.
Mr. Stocklin, the Local 52 president, said he "did not anticipate" any action by the international union that might force acceptance of the settlement.
After Local 52's contract expired on Oct. 31 -- a month after Local 644's contract -- the producers promised to steer films away from New York City until an agreement was reached, amounting to a boycott of New York movie making other than independent productions, which have continued.
In 1989, 110 films were shot partially or totally in New York City, the film office reported. In 1990, 139 films were shot in New York City. Since January, 35 feature-film permits have been granted by the film office, compared with 34 by this time last year. Ms. Keyes said all of the new films were nonstudio productions, with budgets of $1 million or less.
Before the tenative agreement, which Mayor Dinkins had hailed as "a clear sign that a resolution to this conflict is near," city officials were deeply worried about the effects of a continued boycott on the city's economy.

HEADLINE: Chemical Leak in Korea Brings Forth a New Era

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUMI, South Korea

 BODY:
When South Korea decided that the country's only chance at economic pre-eminence lay in supercharged industrialization, it started here, in a scrubby valley formed by the Naktong River.
As a result, the region, the home district of President Roh Tae Woo, could now be mistaken for anywhere in the Silicon Valley of California. But a recent chemical spill that some critics link to South Korea's "industrialize at all cost" policies is causing the area and the nation much anguish. 
 Until a few weeks ago, the country's industrial leaders liked to escort visitors through the endless line of low white buildings to show off Korea's prowess in building televisions and VCR's, telephones and refrigerators, and more recently, computers and advanced memory chips.
 
Many Violently Ill
 That was before one morning last month, when South Koreans turned on their taps and were overcome by a tremendous stench. It came from a caustic, highly toxic form of phenol, a chemical used in processing circuit boards, that had leaked overnight from a storage tank at an electronics plant in Kumi. It had coursed its way through the reservoir system of Taegu, South Korea's third-largest city, which is about 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
The water flowed to 1.7 million people, and hundreds, perhaps thousands, became violently ill. The incident has turned into South Korea's most politically charged industrial pollution case, one that could galvanize the country much the way the more severe mercury poisoning cases in Minamata, Japan, became a symbol of industrialization gone awry a generation ago.
And true to their passionate style, demonstrators took to the streets in Taegu, demanding punishment for the offending company, the Doosan Group, and beginning a boycott of Coca-Cola and Kentucky Fried Chicken, among other products that Doosan holds the franchises for in Korea.
After hurried Cabinet meetings in Seoul, Mr. Roh announced a rapid rethinking of South Korea's industrialization policies. The plant was closed and the managers overseeing it were quickly imprisoned. To drive home the point that a new era of environmentalism had suddenly begun, prosecutors also locked up many of the region's environmental inspectors, suggesting they were negligent or were paid to look the other way. Six have been indicted on charges of industrial pollution and negligence, among other offenses, and all remain in jail.
"For years, Koreans accepted this kind of thing as the price of development," said Yoon Myung Hyun, the administrator of the area's environmental agency. "For Korean businesses, protecting the environment is just another way to cut into profits. Now, maybe, those days are over."
Whether Mr. Yoon is right, or whether he is simply optimistic, is still a matter of significant debate.
For years, South Korea has been notoriously lax about what is dumped into the air and water, and while few officials will acknowledge it openly, the absence of expensive environmental regulations has made investing in industry here attractive.
Kumi, just west of Taegu, is jammed not only with Korean companies but also with Japanese and American joint ventures. The plant in the current pollution case, the Doosan Electro-Materials Company, is 40 percent owned by a unit of Allied-Signal Inc. of Morristown, N.J.
 
No Denial by Doosan
 Doosan has not denied that it was the source of the phenol leak. But it says that under Korean tradition, it cannot really defend itself while it is the focus of public controversy. Instead, company officials say, they must sit back and absorb the criticism, and make explanations later.
"If we explain everything, it will only inflame people," said a senior Doosan official, giving a recent visitor a tour of the plant while it was closed. But the official, the head of another part of the Doosan Group, said many of the charges were false, including contentions that Doosan was slow to alert officials or people who rely on the water supply.
Last week, the large Doosan plant, which has been shut since the accident occurred on March 14, was reopened to reduced production. Doosan makes 80 percent of the printed circuit boards produced in Korea. The boards house the internal controls for everything from television sets to microwave ovens.
Mr. Roh's Cabinet is also considering a plan to create special regions near tap-water sources where no new factories could be built.
But such policies may be too late. The Korea Times, an English-language daily, has reported that 343 factories along the 326-mile Naktong River, the nation's longest, have been found to have illegally discharged atoxic waste last year.
The leak that prompted the newest protests started when an underground pipe leading from an outdoor tank to the Doosan factory burst. The pipe leaked at least 30 tons of pure concentrated phenol into the river. Prosecutors charge that the company waited hours to report the accident, making it impossible for the authorities to shut off water supplies in time.
But the amount of phenol was so large, it may have saved many residents from further illness or even death. The reaction of the chemical with the water created an overpowering stench that made the water virtually undrinkable, residents say.
"It smelled so awful that you vomited when you go near it," said T. H. Jo, an area environmental official.
The intense reaction against Doosan seems to underscore the growing conflict here between industrial companies unaccustomed to being questioned and a public that got its first taste of real political power only four years ago.
Soon after the elections that brought Mr. Roh to power, the country was shaken by strikes in some industries. The bitterness of those wage disputes have added to public suspicions about the "chaebol," Korea's giant industrial groups. Chemical-laden rivers and air fouled with exhaust make for a potent target. A plan to build a titanium operation in Korea has encountered strong opposition from environmentalists.
"I think it has to do with a sudden sense of affluence in Korea," said Mr. Yoon, the environmental agency administrator. "People are tired of bad working conditions and bad living conditions."
But some industrial officials remain philosophical. "You can't hide this kind of thing," the Doosan Group official said. "We have no choice but to accept our guilt and try to build up again."

HEADLINE: EUROPE'S ECONOMY IS FOUND TO STALL

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 15

 BODY:
A year ago, as the United States was sliding toward recession, many European officials boasted that the European Community, spurred by German unification, would take over as the locomotive of the world economy.
Instead, Western Europe's economy has stalled, with the Persian Gulf crisis pushing much of the Continent, already weakened by Germany's high interest rate, to the brink of recession. 
 Worried by the crisis in the gulf, consumers shunned department stores and auto showrooms. As consumer confidence declined and oil prices jumped, businesses had second thoughts about investment. Some industries began idling workers late last year.
 
Peak in Interest Rates Seen
 Now, the allied victory in the gulf has made European officials optimistic that a recession will be avoided and economic growth will pick up soon. Many economists predict that Europe's high interest rates have peaked and that American imports of European goods should grow when the recession in the United States ends.
But few economists foresee a robust European rebound. The "Europhoria" that swept the Continent in the late 1980's, when the prospects of a barrier-free market in 1992 touched off a boom in investment, has given way to a cautious period of "Eurorealism." Executives wonder when consumers are going to rush back to buy cars and computers.
"The situation is very uncertain at the moment," said Ian Harwood, chief economist for Warburg Securities, a London investment bank. "Once the gulf war was over, business confidence was supposed to pick up, but we haven't seen a sharp lift in spirits."
Europe's slump is one factor helping to hold back the United States economy. European shoppers are buying less and that is not only hurting American exports but also profits at some of America's largest corporations with major European operations, like the International Business Machines Corporation. In addition, Europe's high interest rates have nudged up interest rates in the United States, reinforcing America's recession.
Despite today's bumps and uncertainties, many economists say Western Europe might still enjoy a dynamic decade. "Over all, Europe's prospects for the 1990's are very good indeed," said Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London. "That's not to say that Europe is going to grow faster than Japan, but it's likely to grow faster than the U.S."
And even Japan's economic growth is slowing as it concentrates on public works and as its banks recover from plunging stock and real estate prices.
The European Community's plan to drop tariffs and trade restrictions to form a single market of 340 million people by late 1992 is on schedule, but other ambitious measures have stumbled.
Plans to form a European central bank and adopt a single European currency by the mid-1990's are snarled in debate. Eastern Europe, expected to be a hungry new market for Western Europe, is finding its journey toward Western-style capitalism and prosperity far longer than anticipated. German reunification is proving difficult and expensive as eastern German industry verges on collapse.
Under last year's rosy outlook, a newly united Germany was likely to buy so many imports that the 11 other European Community nations would prosper. Bonn's deficit spending for eastern Germany and the East's appetite for Western goods did in fact help western Germany's economy grow by 4.5 percent last year, the fastest since the mid-1970's.
But Germany is not exporting its prosperity. "Germany is still the engine of Europe, but it's not as strong an engine as it had been," said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
Many economists say the German locomotive has lost its horsepower for a single reason: the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank. The nation's central bankers, fearing that Bonn's $85.5 billion in emergency spending to help eastern Germany would overheat the economy and stoke inflation, have repeatedly jacked up interest rates. These increases are expected to slow western Germany's growth to 3 percent this year.
Most of the European Community's other central banks have followed the Bundesbank's increases to keep their currencies from falling against the German mark. Most community currencies are linked through the 10-nation European Monetary System, in which the Bundesbank reigns supreme because it sits atop Europe's most powerful economy and most respected currency.
The Bundesbank last raised rates in late January, bringing its discount rate to 6.5 percent and its short-term Lombard rate to 9 percent. These increases have pushed up rates worldwide, slowed Europe's growth, and irked French and British officials, who feel their own economies are underheated.
"By keeping rates high, the Bundesbank is having a negative impact that outweighs the import boom into Germany," said Christopher Mills, an economist with DRI Europe, a London-based economic consulting firm. "This year German unification is proving a negative rather than positive factor for Europe's economy."
High interest rates have undercut growth in another way: At least until six weeks ago, they caused Europe's currencies to soar against the dollar, hurting exports of BMW cars and Belgian chocolates.
The strength of Europe's currencies also ate into corporate profits, by making the prices of European goods less competitive. Last week, Renault, the state-owned auto maker, announced that its 1990 profits plunged 87 percent, to $212 million, from $1.63 billion. Two of Germany's chemical giants, BASF and Bayer, reported that pretax 1990 profits dropped by 37 percent and 18 percent, respectively.
The sick man of Western Europe, economists agree, is Britain, which is bogged down in recession. The Thatcher boom in the late 1980's, together with financial deregulation and rapid monetary growth, produced 10 percent inflation. After the Bank of England raised interest rates to subdue inflation, the nation plunged into a deep recession last spring, a slump expected to last at least several more months.
France and Italy were beginning to slow down even before Iraq invaded Kuwait last August because of the slumps in Britain and the United States as well as high interest rates. "But what happened in the gulf really reinforced the downturn," said Albert Merlin, chief economist for Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, the French glass and packaging giant.
The gulf crisis helped reduce France's growth to 2.6 percent last year from a robust 3.9 percent in 1989, the nation's strongest growth in a decade. Italy's growth shrank to 1.9 percent in 1990 from 3.6 percent in 1989.
 
A Change in Psychology
 During the fourth quarter, industrial production fell in France and Italy, but most economists expect both nations to escape recession. "People's psychology has changed somewhat," Mr. Merlin said. "That change is not very strong, but we should see it show up in industrial production in a few months."
Many economists forecast that Europe's slowdown will bottom out in the first quarter. "I think we have passed through the worst part," said Philippe d'Arvisenet, an economist with Banque Nationale de Paris. "In France, the first quarter may be flat, then we expect a rebound."
DRI Europe forecasts that France's economy will grow by 1.9 percent this year, and Italy's by 1.6 percent while it expects British output to fall by 1 percent.
These weak figures are not expected to dent the community's stubbornly high 9 percent jobless rate. "Unemployment remains high across Europe," said Mr. Mills of DRI Europe. But because governments remain preoccupied with taming inflation, he said, fighting it seems to be a fairly low priority.
 
Optimism on Interest Rates
 Corporate planners are optimistic that Europe's interest rates have peaked. Some economists say the Bundesbank will not raise rates further because that would only aggravate eastern Germany's troubles and infuriate the rest of Europe. The Bundesbank may feel less need to raise rates now that Bonn is raising taxes to reduce the huge deficit caused by outlays for eastern Germany.
One reason why France and some other nations are eager to form a single communitywide central bank is to reduce the Bundesbank's conservative dominance over Europe. Because this new central bank would include French and Italian governors, it should be more responsive than the Bundesbank to French and Italian economic needs.
But the Bundesbank's president, Karl-Otto Pohl, wants to crawl, rather than run, toward a single central bank. He fears it would be less independent than the Bundesbank and would accommodate those who crave growth more than stable prices.

HEADLINE: Net Rises 5.2% at G.E.; Financial Services Gain

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Buoyed by productivity improvements and strong gains in its financial services sector, the General Electric Company said yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 5.2 percent.
Profits totaled $999 million, or $1.15 a share. In last year's first quarter, G.E. earned $950 million, or $1.06 a share. Its revenues were up 5.6 percent, to $13.3 billion, from $12.6 billion a year earlier. 
 The company does not break out specific quarterly figures for its divisions on a quarterly basis. But it acknowledged that operating profit and revenues at its National Broadcasting Company subsidiary were sharply lower than year-earlier levels primarily because of reduced advertising revenues, lower ratings and higher news costs resulting from coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis. All of the television networks were hurt by competition from the Cable News Network in covering the war.
 
Bought Shares Back
 The company, based in Fairfield, Conn., said growth in earnings per share outpaced growth in net earnings because of G.E.'s five-year $10 billion stock repurchase program. During the quarter, the company bought back four million shares.
John F. Welsh Jr., the chairman and chief executive, said the company did not see any evidence that the surge in consumer confidence after the war was being followed by any meaningful pickup in economic activity. But he added that the company's diversified global busineses should provide relatively strong earnings.
Despite Mr. Welsh's caution about the future, G.E.'s stock rose 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at $73.75 a share.
What particularly pleased some analysts was G.E.'s statement that first-quarter earnings in its financial services unit rose by 15 percent.
 
Kidder Termed Improved
 G.E. said Kidder, Peabody & Company, its Wall Street subsidiary, recorded what it called much-improved results, reflecting higher trading profits. The company also said that there was strong portfolio growth at GE Capital and that it had a gain on the merger of its auto-auction business with another company. The gain, however, was more than offset by lower operating results in highly leveraged transactions and commercial real estate businesses.
Russell Leavitt, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst, said the results were better than expected. He said the financial services results were welcomed since many other finance companies have had substantial writeoffs and earnings problems.
The company said its primary strength came from increased revenues and productivity improvements in its long-cycle businesses: aircraft engines, power systems and medical systems, as well as financial services.
"G.E.'s operating margin of 12.1 percent, a record for the first quarter and an improvement over 1990's 11.8 percent, was particularly encouraging," Mr. Welsh said.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges All Sides to Act to Avoid a Rail Strike

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
President Bush said today that "it would be prudent that all efforts and actions be taken" to avoid a nationwide rail strike, saying it would seriously disrupt a fragile economy.
Speaking to the Association of General Contractors, Mr. Bush stopped short of asking Congress to head off a strike against most of the 15 major freight railroads. He added that the Administration was "willing to work with the parties to help in any way possible." 
 Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner had said that if no progress had been made when the weekend was over the Administration would consider asking Congress to pass legislation to avert the strike before it occurs, as it did in 1970.
Under the Railway Labor Act of 1926, the Federal Government has wide powers to deal with labor relations at railroads and airlines. The act keeps labor contracts in force during negotiations, essentially postponing their expiration indefinitely and provides for the appointment of a Presidential emergency board to recommend a settlement. In similar railroad negotiations in the past, after an automatic 90-day cooling-off period, Congress has used a commission's recommendations to legislate a settlement.
Congressional committees have been keeping track of the negotiations, but they have not introduced any legislation, hoping that the railroads and unions will reach a settlement.
The Administration is prepared to force the issue through Congressional action if the unions do not make a deal to stop a nationwide strike, scheduled to begin at 12:01 A.M. Wednesday, when the cooling-off period between freight railroads and 11 unions expires.
Leaders of unions for about two-thirds of the country's 235,000 freight line workers have threatened to leave their jobs then if a deal is not struck on the thorny issues of wages and health benefits. Leaders of 3 of the 11 unions have agreed to terms similiar to those recommended by the Presidential board, but members have not voted on the agreements.
Contract talks continued into the night and were to resume Tuesday. The largest union, the United Transportation Union, did not take part in negotiations today, but said it would join the talks on Tuesday.
The railroads say the wage recommendations of the commission go too far, and they are pressing to cut workers and change work rules. The unions' strongest objections have been to the reductions and plans to change work rules.
Mr. Skinner met this morning with a large group of union leaders as they were coming out of intense weekend bargaining sessions with the National Mediation Board, which oversees contract disputes covered by the Railway Labor Act. The negotiations on a new contract have been going on for three years.
Transportation officials said that while the Administration was not keen to interfere in a labor-management dispute, Mr. Skinner was persuaded that the strike would prolong the economic slump. More than a third of all goods shipped each month in the United States go by rail, and many industries, among them automobile makers, rely on timely delivery of parts and materials at assembly plants. They could be forced to curtail production within days of a strike.
"That strike that looms for right after midnight tomorrow could seriously disrupt the economy just as the economy, in our view, is trying to turn around and get out of this recession," Mr. Bush, who was accompanied by Mr. Skinner, told the general contractors.
